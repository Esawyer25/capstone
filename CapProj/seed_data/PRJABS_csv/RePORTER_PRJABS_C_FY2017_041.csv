"9308036","TRAINING UNIT  Our success in unraveling the biology of rare diseases and in developing effective therapies for conditions such as ALS and related disorders depends critically on our engendering and nurturing a cadre of new clinician scientists in whom the spark of rare disease research has been ignited, and who will carry the torch of rare disease clinical research into the future. This will be accomplished by identifying and recruiting talented and highly motivated young people who wish to pursue a career in clinical research focused on ALS and related disorders. Trainees will be provided with an education in clinical research methodology, the science of rare disease research, grant writing and issues specifically relevant to ALS and related disorders. The consortium will foster trainee career development through mentorship and immersion in a clinical and scientific environment that is colaborative, supportive and rich in opportunity."
"9308729","This figure represents our methodology. The concentric circles represent four levels of influence upon the health of an individual: the innate (e.g. heredity), the behavior of the individual and his or her family, the influence of the community, and that of the global environment. To intervene positively on the individual's health, initiatives (e.g. policies) must be addressed all levels. If that happens, the interventions produce outcomes, which in turn become inputs for the intervention process in a cycle of improvement. The cycle must continue, like a chain reaction, in order for health equity to be fostered.  With the creation of our TCC, we will utilize our collaborators from Region III hospitals, CHCs, public and private schools of higher education, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), private physicians, faith-based organizations, advocacy groups, health disparity experts, and health policy experts to improve the quality of life and assure that the best quality of care is available to the residents of Region III.  Our Main Goal is to assure that the uninsured and underinsured receive quality health care. We have seven focus areas that we will strive to improve:  ? Access to Care  ? Health Literacy  ? Prevention and Control of Chronic Disease  ? Access to Healthier Foods  ? Healthy Physical and Recreational Activity  ? Self-Management of Chronic Conditions  ? Health Care Providers' Skills in Treating and Preventing Chronic Diseases"

"9304057","Project 1 Abstract: The project seeks a robust and scalable procedure for preparation of clinically-translatable long-acting reservoir-targeted nanoformulations of antiretroviral therapy (nanoART) with optimal size range, surface coating and colloidal stability. We will, first, develop prodrugs (from what is presently hydrophilic to hydrophobic ART) with a range of viral action sites then optimize the formulation functional parameters (manufacturing methods, drug loading, particle size and colloidal stability) to facilitate drug uptake by monocyte-macrophages for sustained therapeutic drug concentrations in cells over an extended time period. The development of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors to facilitate elimination of restricted viral infection would provide a stage for viral education strategies to be initiated. Second, we will develop versatile synthetic procedures for conjugation of targeting ligands to coating polymers to facilitate decorations of nanoART to cellular HIV reservoirs. Third, we will determine whether the modifications developed in aims 1 and 2 will translate into improve pharmacokinetic profiles. We posit that harnessing of monocyte-macrophages as cell carriers and depots will enhance antiretroviral delivery across tissue barriers and into sites of viral growth. The drug's synergistic long-acting antiretroviral efficacy will be determined in cell culture assays and validated in animals (in collaboration with Projects 2, H. Gendelman and 3, M. Boska; Core C, L. Poluektova and H. Fox)."
"9297396","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BDNF and other neurotrophins (NTs) have widespread and powerful roles in mammalian nervous system, and are thought to be involved in a number of psychiatric and neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, drug addiction, schizophrenia, and depression. However, how NTs function at the cellular and synaptic levels is not well understood. In particular, it is not clear whether they are released from or act on the pre- or postsynaptic neuron. Aplysia sensory-motor neuron synapses in isolated cell culture are an ideal system for addressing those types of questions. An Aplysia BDNF-like NT and its Trk-like receptor have recently been identified and shown to be important for the induction of long-term facilitation (LTF) and growth of presynaptic varicosities. I now propose to use the Aplysia culture system to examine the pre- and postsynaptic roles of ApNT in two learning-related forms of synaptic plasticity, LTF and intermediate-term facilitation (ITF) by the neuromodulator 5HT.  NTs do not act in isolation, but are often part of signaling cascades. For example, synaptic growth during development involves a cascade of pre- and postsynaptic changes and back-and-forth signaling by a variety of molecules including NTs and the transmitter itself. Disorders of this synaptic growth cascade are thought to contribute to a number of neurodevelopmental diseases including schizophrenia and Rett syndrome, which also involve NTs. We will investigate the general hypothesis that long-term plasticity involves a similar growth cascade, and specifically examine the role of ApNT and its relationship with spontaneous transmitter release as key players in such a cascade. Recent studies in Aplysia suggest that spontaneous release recruits postsynaptic mechanisms of ITF, and then retrograde signaling contributes to recruiting presynaptic mechanisms of LTF. Preliminary results suggest that ApNT plays an important role and could act as such a retrograde signal, although it might also function as an autocrine or anterograde signal. In addition, spontaneous release may enhance ApNT and ApNT may also enhance spontaneous release, perhaps creating positive feedback loops that would make the cascade more dynamic.  To further explore the possible roles of ApNT and spontaneous release in a trans-synaptic signaling cascade leading to long-term synaptic plasticity and growth, we will (1) examine pre- and postsynaptic sources and targets of ApNT during LTF and ITF, (2) examine the roles of ApNT and spontaneous release in the assembly of pre- and postsynaptic components during LTF and ITF, and (3) examine possible interactions between ApNT and spontaneous release during LTF and ITF. These studies may also suggest how dysfunctions of this cascade could contribute to psychiatric and neurological disorders."
"9357634","Project Summary Accumulating evidence suggests that the crosstalk between histone modification (HM) and DNA methylation (DM) may play important roles for establishing and maintaining the epigenomic landscape during development and disease. Conventionally, HM-DM crosstalk has been studied by examining HM and DM separately, using molecular assays such as ChIP-seq and whole- genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). These assays (in their conventional forms) require a large amount of sample input and are not practical with scarce primary samples from small lab animals and patients. This problem is particularly serious when multiple epigenomic marks are studied. In this project, we will develop novel microfluidic technology that permits low-input (1000 to single cells) sequential ChIP-MethylC treatment and examination of genome-wide HM- DM crosstalk using the same cell population. We will demonstrate the principle using H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and primary tissues (i.e. neuronal nuclei) isolated from frontal cortex of mouse brains. Our technology will pave the way for integrative analysis of multiple epigenomic marks based on scarce cell samples."
"9304236","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK) proposes a competing continuation of the Program for Excellence and Equity in Research (PEER), an Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity (IMSD) program. Peer offers students from underrepresented minority (UR) groups a unique program of professional development in their first two years as graduate students.

"9312904","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Chronic itch is a presenting sign in numerous diseases associated with the skin, immune and nervous systems. Chronic itch is largely resistant to conventional antihistamines, and few effective therapies are available. In order to develop novel therapeutics against chronic itch, there is a pressing need for identification of itc-specific signaling mechanisms involved. Activation of kappa opioid receptor (KOR) can inhibit chronic itch. However, KOR activation is associated with several side effects that might have hindered its use as therapeutics. We recently found that gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is an important receptor for the development of chronic itch, and KOR activation attenuates itch by inhibiting GRPR function. Aim 1 is to determine whether KOR inhibits itch by a blockade of GRPR function. Aim 2 is to examine the role of PKC in KOR activation-mediated inhibition. Aim 3 is to determine whether KOR activation inhibits itch via KOR-GRPR heteromerization. The proposed studies are highly translational because it will provide mechanistic insights into KOR-mediated inhibition of chronic itch and will significantly expand the pool of the targets that may be explored for future KOR-GRPR-based anti-pruritus drug discovery program."
"9315083","Project summary Individuals aged 65 years or older account for 80-90% of deaths from influenza A virus each year. In our preliminary data, we show that infection with the influenza virus is associated with a marked decline in the function of the proteostatic networks in the lung epithelium and that aged mice suffer increased mortality following infection with the influenza A virus. The overarching goal of this project is to systematically test the hypothesis that lung epithelial mitochondrial metabolic changes, proteostasis, aging and the susceptibility to influenza A infection are causally linked. Mitochondrial metabolism has been noted to decrease during the natural aging process. Our preliminary data shows young mice harboring decrease in mitochondrial respiratory capacity are less susceptible to and recover faster from influenza A virus-induced lung injury. Based on these data, we suggest that the reduced mitochondrial capacity during aging is an adaptive response to a decline in the function of the proteostasis network in the aging lung. We hypothesize that this decline in mitochondrial capacity triggers the mitochondrial unfolded response and increase in mitochondrial ROS production to diminish influenza A virus induced lung injury. A consequence of influenza A virus is hypoxemia, an important cause of morbidity and mortality in mice and humans. We have previously shown that mitochondrial ROS trigger hypoxic adaptation through the activation of HIFs. In our preliminary data using C. elegans, we found that mitochondrial ROS to activate mtUPR even in the absence of HIFs, suggesting a new and exciting molecular pathway for hypoxic adaptation. These led us to propose the following three aims: (1) To determine whether diminishing mitochondrial DNA encoded proteins (respiratory capacity) in the lung epithelium promotes proteostasis to attenuate lung injury during aging; (2) To determine whether low levels of mitochondrial dependent ROS promotes proteostasis to attenuate lung injury during aging; (3) To determine the molecular pathways by which hypoxia induces the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in C. elegans and mice."
"9323228","ABSTRACT  The goal of the Integrative Redox Biology Core is to provide investigators with a coordinated and comprehensive evaluation of the molecules, pathways, and systems that contribute to oxidative metabolism and oxidative stress using analyses of frozen samples from a wide variety of model species (e.g. invertebrates, rodents, exceptionally long-lived species, and humans). These analyses include state-of-the-art measures of redox and energy balance as well as oxidative damage and mitochondrial function. The Core will offer accurate and sensitive analyses of altered redox status and ATP levels as well as mitochondrial function and oxidative damage through a coordinated evaluation of a number of molecules, pathways, and systems. Redox status and oxidant homeostasis have a major impact on physiologic processes underlying aging and contribute to a number of age-related diseases, including diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Thus, these assays will be valuable for a wide range of investigators studying aging and age-related disease. The Specific Aims of the Integrative Redox Biology Core are:  Aim 1. To perform accurate and comprehensive analyses of redox and energetic status. The core will provide analyses of the following redox couples: GSH/GSSG, NADPH/NADP+, NADH/NAD+, thioredoxin (-SH/S-S), peroxiredoxin (-SH/S-S), CoASH/Acetyl-CoA, as well as  the energy charge (ATP, ADP, & AMP).  Aim 2. To determine consequences of changes in oxidative stress by measuring oxidative modifications and damage to cellular components as well as the expression profiles of  antioxidant proteins. Oxidative damage to cell components will be analyzed using assays we have developed; oxidative damage to lipid, protein, and DNA will be measured by F2-  isoprostanes, protein carbonyls, and 8-oxo-dG, respectively.  Aim 3. To provide additional assays of mitochondrial function using permeabilized tissue, isolated mitochondria, and cell culture models. The Core will provide services to measure  mitochondrial function e.g, ETC activities, oxidant generation, ATP production, and respiration  in fresh tissue or isolated mitochondria.  A significant strength of the Core is that, because we are analyzing levels of highly specific biological compounds, our assays can be used with tissues or cells from any living organism. In addition, the analyses we provide are especially appropriate for a Core because they require costly equipment and significant technologic expertise that can limit these types of analyses as routine measures in individual laboratories. Overall, the key advantage of this core is that we can provide a comprehensive, accurate, and sensitive set of redox and oxidative stress related measurements in a wide variety of organisms with frozen tissue that can be shipped from any laboratory in the United States."

"9291461","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (DM) in older persons is increasing rapidly. DM increases the risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which is a transition state between normal cognition and dementia that is often characterized by memory and executive function deficits. These deficits reduce adherence to DM medications, which worsens glycemic control and increases the risk for adverse DM-related health outcomes. Improving medication adherence may prevent these outcomes and reduce health care costs. This is important to all older persons with DM but particularly to older African Americans (AAs). They have twice the rate of DM, worse cognitive function, lower medication adherence, and worse glycemic control than whites. One million older AAs now have DM and their number will double by 2030. Because 30% also have MCI, low medication adherence is an important problem for them. This necessitates culturally relevant interventions that compensate for their cognitive deficits and improves their medication adherence and glycemic control. We propose a randomized controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy of a collaborative Primary Care-Occupational Therapy (PC-OT) intervention to lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in older AAs with DM, MCI, HbA1c e 7.5%, and d 80% adherence to an oral hypoglycemic medication. PC-OT consists of: 1) primary care physician (PCP) - occupational therapist (OT) collaboration; 2) DM education tailored to cognitive impairment; 3) in-home OT cognitive-functional assessment; and 4) OT-delivered Behavior Activation to increase adherence to medications and other diabetes self-management (DSM) practices (e.g., diet). We will recruit 100 participants from primary care clinics and randomize them to PC-OT or Enhanced Usual Care (EUC). EUC is usual medical care plus low intensity DM education delivered by community health workers. Participants in both PC- OT and EUC will have 6 initial in-home treatment sessions over 3 months, and then 3 booster sessions during this 12 month study. The primary outcome is a reduction in HbA1c of 0.5%, which reduces the risk of adverse medical events. The primary efficacy analysis compares the proportion of participants in PC-OT and EUC who achieve this outcome at month 6 (short term effect) and at month 12 (maintenance effect). We will measure medication adherence using an electronic Medication Event Monitoring System, prescription refills, and self- reports. A secondary aim determines if improving medication adherence mediates PC-OT's impact on HbA1c levels. We will also evaluate PC-OT's effect on other DSM practices; ER visits and hospitalizations; cognition; function; mood; and quality of life; and PC-OT's costs and net financial benefits. This is the first study to determine if PCPs, collaborating with OTs (who are experts in developing strategies to compensate for cognitive/physical deficits), can improve medication adherence and glycemic control, and prevent cognitive and functional decline in older persons with DM and MCI. If PC-OT is effective in a high risk population of older AAs, its benefits may extend to all older persons with DM and have enormous public health significance."
"9327055","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly one in three adults in rural communities has prediabetes, a condition that increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke but can be managed by use of metformin, lifestyle interventions, and control of major cardiovascular (CV) risk factors However, current prediabetes care is characterized by: (a) delayed recognition of prediabetes; (b) patient unawareness of effective treatment options for prediabetes; (c) poor control of concomitant major CV risk factors; (d) very low rates of metformin initiation; and (e) low rates of follow up to assess ongoing effectiveness of prediabetes management.1-3 Increased use of electronic health records (EHR) in rural communities now provides a new opportunity to improve awareness and management of prediabetes and to reduce these patients' significant CV risk burden. In this project, we implement and evaluate an EHR-linked, Web-based clinical decision support (CDS) system that identifies patients with prediabetes and provides patients and their primary care providers personalized, evidence-based CDS and follow up to reduce risk of heart attacks or stroke. To accomplish this objective, we randomly allocate 30 primary care clinics with their 450 primary care providers and estimated 17,000 prediabetes patients to one of two intervention arms: Usual Care; or else the prediabetes CDS to optimize management and follow up of prediabetes patients with uncontrolled CV risk factors. Random-effects models assess intervention impact on: (a) American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) pooled CV risk; (b) major CV risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, HbA1c, smoking, and BMI); (c) use of evidence-based drugs, including metformin, and lifestyle interventions to manage prediabetes; and (d) patient and provider satisfaction with the intervention strategy. We also conduct a state-of-the-art cost and a cost- effectiveness analysis of the interventions relative to usual care. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, supplemented by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), is used to assess implementation processes and outcomes in a rural/urban health system. The results of the project will provide a template for implementation of personalized CDS tools in rural and urban health settings, resulting in more efficient and effective rural healthcare that can be broadly applied across many clinical domains, incorporates patient treatment preferences, and has the potential to substantially and sustainably improve the quality of CV care and clinical outcomes of millions of Americans with prediabetes residing in medically underserved areas."
"9292273","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because electronic cigarettes deliver nicotine without burning tobacco, they may offer a valuable alternative for smokers who cannot break their nicotine addiction. However, little is known about electronic cigarette emissions or the health problems they produce. Our long-term objectives are to understand how electronic cigarettes affect human health and to contribute to the scientific foundation that will be used to establish rational policies for regulating the manufacture, advertisement, and sale of electronic cigarettes. Our Preliminary Data demonstrate high concentrations of metals and metal nanoparticles in aerosol from a leading brand of electronic cigarette. The goal of the proposed research is to identify and quantify the metal content of electronic cigarette aerosols from a broad spectrum of products and designs, to examine the cytoxicity and genotoxicity of aerosols with metal content, and to examine biomarkers of metal exposure and effect in human electronic cigarette users. In our first Specific Aim, we will identify and quantify metals in electronic cigarettes from various brands and styles and determine how metal concentrations correlate with electronic cigarette design. Metal quantification will be done using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Characterization of particle structure and size will be done using scanning and transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to identify elements. Metal concentrations in aerosol will be examined as a function of puffing topology. In the second Specific Aim, we will determine if aerosols with metals produce cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in human cells using the MTT and comet assays, in combination with a novel liver cell metabolizing assay. Human embryonic stem cells will be used to model an early stage of prenatal development and three dimensional human bronchial/epithelial tissue exposed at an air-liquid interface will be used to model human lung exposure. In Aims 1 and 2, metals in electronic cigarettes will be compared to metals in three popular brands of combustible cigarettes. In Aim #3, we will use metal biomarkers to quantify metal exposure and effect in humans who use electronic cigarettes, determine if metal uptake by cells includes nanoparticles, and determine whether metals migrate to the bloodstream and are excreted in the urine. Our project will generate new data on: (1) the metal content of electronic cigarette aerosols across a broad spectrum of evolving products, (2) the cyto/genotoxicity of the metals in electronic cigarette aerosols, (3) the sensitivity of embryonic and differentiated adult lung cells to electronic cigarette aerosol metals, and (4) the absorption, excretion, and the biological effects of metals in human electronic cigarette users. These data, the first of their kind, will contribute to a foundation of science upon which the FDA can develop regulatory policies to protect consumers' health and minimize future public health problems."
"9281775","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the absence of FMRP, a negative regulator of mRNA translation. In this proposed Fragile X Center, Gary Bassell, Erick Klann, and Joel Richter demonstrate that depletion or inhibition of molecules that alter the translational landscape reverse excessive protein synthesis and FXS pathophysiological phenotypes in mice. These molecules include PI3 kinase, which when pharmacologically inactivated restores dysregulated protein synthesis and dendritic spine morphology that characterize FXS (Bassell Project), p70S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which when genetically ablated corrects molecular, synaptic and behavioral phenotypes displayed by FXS mice (Klann Project); and the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB), whose deficiency rescues inappropriate protein synthesis, synapse dysregulation, and behavioral abnormalities that are prominent features of FXS. These discoveries provide an unprecedented opportunity to alter the translational landscape and ameliorate symptoms of FXS. The  Principal Investigators, together with an RNA Sequencing/Bioinformatics Core, will use innovative molecular biology to identify mRNAs whose translation is rescued when PI3K, S6K, and CPEB are ablated or inhibited, which will define the underlying molecular basis of FXS and indicate novel therapies to treat the disease. The investigators will work with an Electrophysiology/Animal Behavior Core to assess how rescued protein synthesis regulates synapse efficacy and higher cognitive function. The investigators work with both research cores to explore molecular mechanisms of rescued translation and apply the methods and knowledge gained from mouse models of FXS to assess molecular causation of FXS in human cells. The investigators will work with an Administrative Core to ensure scientific excellence in the Fragile X Center."
"9321982","Abstract ? Project 2 ? Biomarker Project The MIDUS Biomarker Project has led to widespread engagement from the scientific community: 122 publications have been generated, 47% of which appeared in 2014/15. The goal of this project is to build on this momentum by collecting longitudinal data (9-10 years later) on the baseline biomarker sample, 90% of whom recently returned for the MIDUS 3 survey assessments. We will repeat the comprehensive battery of initial biomarkers (neuroendocrine, inflammatory, glucose metabolism, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal) plus add new measures in 5 targeted areas (ankle-brachial index, HDL function, body impedance, gait analysis, expanded cytokine panel). This revision details numerous specific hypotheses to be tested with the new biomarker data, most of which build systematically on key findings generated from the baseline data. Our design allows for the investigation of multiple pathways through which 3 waves of sociodemographic data and 3 waves of psychosocial data can be combined to predict cross-time change in biological risk profiles. Negative pathways combine cumulative vulnerability factors (e.g., persistently low SES + chronically high or incrementing depressive profiles) to predict worsening biological risk across time. Positive pathways combine cumulative advantage factors (e.g., majority status + persistently high social relational ties) to predict maintenance or improvement in biological regulation across time. Most novel are resilient pathways that combine vulnerability and protective factors (e.g., persistently low SES + persistently high well-being) to predict healthy cross-time biology and maintenance of functional capacities. The MIDUS Biomarker Project enjoys three key features that distinguish it from other U.S. studies. First, it provides longitudinal biological data that span change over 10 years in a population-representative sample, which included adults aged 25 to 74 at baseline. Second, the biomarkers collected in the project are far richer than any other U.S. population-based sample. Third, the extensive survey data of MIDUS ? now encompassing over 20 years of prospective information on socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of participants' lives -- provide unique opportunities for testing how these factors combine to account for who has maintained healthy biological regulation and functional health across time, while others have shifted toward clinically significant biological risk, or moved from pre-disease to disease states. The Biomarker Project has a history of over 15 years of successful collaboration among team leaders -- Carol Ryff (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Teresa Seeman (University of California-Los Angeles), and Maxine Weinstein (Georgetown University). The protocols at each site are well established, and the respective site teams have strong track records of successful recruitment and testing."

"9369673","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):    The Structural Biology Shared Resource provides state-of-the-art infrastructure and expertise needed for high quality protein production and high resolution structure determination by NMR and X-ray crystallography. These capabilities are complemented by significant strengths in cryo-electron microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, a wide range of vibrational spectroscopies, computational biology and unique macromolecular foot printing approaches at the College and AECC. Through the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium (NYSGRC), AECC investigators have access to -25-30 shifts (8 hour blocks) on the X29 insertion device at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory, as well as outstanding access to the LRL-CAT beamline (administered by Eli Lilly & Co.) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), which provides FEDEX crystallographic service at one of the premiere beamlines in the world. Moreover, through membership in the New York Structural Biology Center, AECC investigators have access to the X4A bending magnet beamline at NSLS. These arrangements ensure that access to data collection resources is never rate limiting. There is also in-house Rigaku rotating anode/image plate data collection capabilities essential for characterization and screening of samples prior to synchrotron analysis. NMR capabilities at Einstein consists of one 300 MHz and two 600 MHz NMR spectrometers, with a cryoprobe on one of the 600s. AECC investigators also have full access to the NYSBC making available two 900 MHz and three 800 MHz instruments, all with cryoprobes, and one 750 MHz solid state NMR spectrometer.

"9313311","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Heart failure (HF) is poorly treated by current therapies. More knowledge of the deleterious mechanisms that produce this disease is necessary in order to develop novel specific therapies. The focus of this research is on testing therapeutic approaches targeting maladaptive mechanisms that will improve impaired contractility and deficient energy production in HF. Our long-term goal is to identify new highly specific therapeutic targets to treat HF. Our immediate goals are to determine if reducing excessive protein OGlcNAcylation to normal can improve cardiac function in HF. Our preliminary results show that in HF nuclear, cytosolic, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondrial (Mito) cardiac proteins are excessively OGlcNAcylated. Furthermore, reducing O-GlcNAcylation by transgene expression in mice with HF resulted in improved cardiac function. The hypothesis is that HF-induced abnormalities in cardiac myoc)1:es (CM) can be reverted by expression of specific transgenes that correct the maladaptive excessive protein OGlcNAcylation and/or its deletrious effects on key myocardial proteins. Using viral vector gene transfer in a mouse model of HF, or transgenic mice with HF the following specific goals should be achieved: i) Identify and determine the time course and mechanisms contributing to excessive 0-GlcNAcylation of proteins in the intact CM and in specific organelles of the CM during the evolution of PO-induced HF. 2) Determine if attenuation or reversal of excessive CM protein 0-GlcNAcylation improves function in the failing heart. 3) Establish that excessive 0-GlcNAcylation of specific proteins diminishes Mito function and propagates HF. In Aim I the mechanisms contributing to excessive protein 0-GlcNAcylation in HF are explored and key cardiac proteins that undergo excessive 0-GlcNAcylation are identified. Aim I is related to Aim II, in that in Aim II we determine if reversal of excessive nuclear, cytosolic and SR protein 0-GlcNAcylation in CM of HF improves CM and heart function. Aim III establishes that excessive 0-GlcNAcylation of specific proteins diminishes Mito function."
"9315918","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competing continuation application requests funding for an institutional postdoctoral Training Program (TP) in Mental Health Services and Systems Research co-sponsored by the two leading public and private universities in the southeastern United States-the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University-that are located within ten miles of each other in the Triangle area of North Carolina. Training occurs at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research (Sheps Center) at UNC and the Mental Health Services Effectiveness Research Program and Center for Developmental Epidemiology in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Duke University Medical Center (Duke). The TP goals are to expand the pool of independent investigators capable of undertaking policy-relevant mental health services and systems research in three areas: mental health laws and state policies, mental health and criminal justice, and child and adolescent mental health services.  This TP for social/behavioral scientists and clinicians has two components: (1) core activities and (2) individualized study. The core component involves alternating bi-weekly research seminars and journal club meetings, a semester-long research proposal writing seminar, departmental seminars and grand rounds at the collaborating institutions, and other research seminars/workshops at UNC or Duke. The individualized study component is tailored to the special interests and needs of each fellow. It is based on an apprentice-type model whereby each fellow is linked to one or more mentor(s) who works with the fellow to develop research skills and opportunities. The TP remains committed to interdisciplinary training, a public sector orientation, and a special focus on persons with severe and persistent mental illness.  The success of this interdisciplinary training can be measured by the accomplishments of the 48 fellows who have participated to date. Most now hold academic or other research positions, have numerous publications, and funded research projects. Innovative emphases have been continually added to the TP since its inception to assure that graduates are capable of pursuing the latest developments in services and systems research. During the next five years, we will introduce and enhance fellows' research in comparative- effectiveness and patient-centered care, integration of mental health and health care, and legal aspects of population mental health. Given the sustained excellence of this training program, funds are requested to continue NRSA-support for four postdoctoral fellows each year during the next five-years."
"9300989","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies in this R01 grant renewal will address the overall hypothesis that redundant bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligand, receptor, and intracellular SMAD signaling pathways regulate uterine growth, differentiation, and vasculogenesis during implantation and early pregnancy and abnormalities in these uterine pathways lead to maternal diseases, including preeclampsia. The transforming growth factor ß (TGFß) superfamily, the largest family of secreted proteins in mammals, includes the BMPs, activins, myostatin, and growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11). These ligands signal through a heteromeric complex of type 1 and type 2 serine-threonine kinase receptors. Ligand-induced dimerization of these receptors leads to phosphorylation of receptor-regulated SMAD proteins, which translocate to the nucleus and form a complex with SMAD4 to regulate gene expression. These signaling pathways have been implicated in many pathophysiologic processes including diseases of pregnancy. For example, at the end of the first trimester, serum activin A concentrations are elevated in women who will eventually develop preeclampsia, and polymorphisms in TGFß family signaling receptor genes are associated with preeclampsia. With the support of this grant that started in 1994, we have generated and analyzed mice with mutations in ligands (activin subunits), a ligand binding protein (follistatin), an intracellular receptor-binding protein (FKBP12), several SMADs, and multiple TGFß family receptors. The phenotypes of our genetic models range from neonatal lethality to infertility to cancer. These models have been indispensable for deciphering TGFß superfamily signaling pathways in the gonads and uterus and modeling clinical reproductive diseases including infertility, premature ovarian failure, and ovarian and testicular cancer. These HD32067-supported studies have resulted in 16 papers published during the current 4-year grant period and 101 publications overall including high impact papers in Developmental Cell, Nature, Nature Genetics, Nature Medicine, PLoS Genetics, Science, and The Journal of Clinical Investigation. The overall goals of this R01 renewal will be to follow-up these studies by mechanistically analyzing the unique and redundant roles of BMP ligands, type 1 and type 2 receptors, and downstream SMAD signaling components that are active in the uterus during pregnancy and identifying new small molecules that regulate the functions of BMPs, activins, myostatin, and GDF11 in uterine, ovarian, bone, and muscle physiology. The Specific Aims of these proposed studies are: 1) Mechanistically and genetically define the BMP signaling components required for implantation, 2) Characterize BMP signaling pathways in post-implantation uterine biology and diseases of pregnancy, and 3) Create small-molecule BMP receptor type 2-specific regulators. These proposed studies will allow us to genetically place TGFß superfamily ligands, receptors, and downstream SMADs into biological pathways in the female reproductive tract and to identify and synthesize compounds for future treatments of human reproductive and non-reproductive diseases."
"9395706","Abstract KRAS mutations drive resistance to diverse targeted therapies, most notably to EGFR inhibitors in the setting of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Curiously however, through a series of genetic screens involving constitutive activators of oncogenic signaling pathways, we found that ectopic expression of mutant HRAS, another RAS gene not typically associated with resistance, drove substantially stronger therapeutic resistance than mutant KRAS. Although HRAS and KRAS share ~85% amino acid sequence identity, the nucleotide sequence between the two varies enormously, with HRAS being enriched in common codons that yield high protein expression, while KRAS is enriched in rare codons that yield poor expression. This suggested that rare codons may limit the ability of KRAS to impart resistance in the clinic. Consistent with this notion, we find that primary resistance to the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab in CRC is dependent not only upon KRAS mutational status, but also upon the ability of cancer cells to overcome the translational barrier imposed by codon bias. Similarly, we show that more potent KRASQ61 mutations drive acquired resistance even in the setting of low protein expression, perhaps explaining the paradoxical enrichment of these mutations observed in patients with cetuximab-refractory CRC. Finally, we demonstrate that cancer cells globally upregulate translation in the setting of KRASG12-driven acquired cetuximab resistance, resulting in hypersensitivity to diverse small molecule inhibitors of translation. These findings demonstrate that codon bias plays a critical regulatory role in KRAS-driven therapeutic resistance and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting protein translation to overcome resistance."
"9411473","    Project Summary     Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) carries the greatest burden of HIV globally, and has in recent years experienced substantial declines in HIV incidence, morbidity and death. These achievements result from concerted and sustained national efforts to provide effective combination antiretroviral treatment (ART) to increasing proportions of all persons living with HIV (PLWH), guided by the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines for treatment and prevention of HIV infection. Current WHO guidelines recommend universal testing and treatment (UTT) both to prevent further HIV transmission and to improve the individual health of PLWH, and have recently been implemented in some form by most SSA countries. As UTT is implemented across Africa, it is critical to develop a research approach, methods and implementation agenda for the sub-Saharan African region, to provide timely assessment of progress and challenges to inform course corrections. The International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) network (www.iedea.org) is an international research consortium established in 2005 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in seven regions throughout the world (in Africa, North and South America, and Asia), which collaborate to collect and define key variables, and implement methodology to effectively analyze data as a cost-effective means of generating large data sets to address the high priority HIV/AIDS research questions that are unanswerable by a single cohort. IeDEA has contributed substantially to the understanding of HIV treatment outcomes in Africa. The four IeDEA regions in sub-Saharan Africa (Central, East, West and Southern) have enrolled >1,000,000 patients receiving HIV care in 140 sites in 23 countries, and propose here to convene an ?All-Africa IeDEA? meeting in November 2017, in Kigali Rwanda (Central Africa IeDEA) to develop, disseminate and plan implementation of a research agenda that can provide countries and global planners with data, analysis and new methodologic approaches to best guide HIV treatment activities and contribute to ending the epidemic.  "
"9306093","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The critical need remains to improve our ability to prevent breast cancer. An area of research that holds great promise for reducing breast cancer risk concerns improving our knowledge of the impact of environmental factors, especially when these factors appear to act when the breast is particularly susceptible to changes that ultimately lead to cancer. The proposed Coordinating Center for the Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program (BCERP) consortium will support research that follows national recommendations to prioritize prevention, use transdisciplinary research approaches, and intensify the study of chemical and physical factors that potentially influence the risk of developing breast cancer. Our overarching goal is to support integrated scientific research to enhance our understanding of environmental and genetic factors underlying breast cancer risk throughout the lifespan, with particular focus on windows of susceptibility. Specific Aims are: 1- to provide leadership in team science by identifying opportunities to facilitate cross- project transdisciplinary interaction, standardize and integrate research efforts, and maximize use of resources; 2- to provide exceptional coordination for the consortium including defining a shared vision and mission, identifying shared resources, developing standard policies, managing Opportunity Funds to distribute to Consortium members, assisting NIH staff, and supporting a Steering Committee, Working Groups, and an annual scientific meeting; 3- to leverage sharing of data and other resources among BCERP members; 4- to support cross-project communication as well as dissemination of findings to diverse partners and audiences including the broader breast cancer and environmental science research communities, and to support the training and mentoring of the next generation of breast cancer researchers; and 5- to facilitate internal and external evaluation to maximize the Coordinating Center's and Consortium's performance, transdisciplinary nature, productivity and effectiveness. Our mission is to provide intellectual leadership and logistical support for the BCERP consortium by identifying and facilitating opportunities for cross-BCERP collaboration, and disseminating research findings through partnerships with stakeholders. Our multidisciplinary team includes experts in breast cancer epidemiology, basic science, environmental health, toxicology, program evaluation, biostatistics, outreach/community engagement, and research administration, as well as mentoring and training. The University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center provides the ideal environment for supporting the Coordinating Center due to its multiple resources and strong established relationships with local, regional, and national research and advocacy organizations. The BCERP Coordinating Center will use multiple innovative approaches to leverage Consortium members' common passion for elucidating the role of environmental factors that act during windows of susceptibility to increase risk of breast cancer, provide opportunities for collaboration, and enable BCERP to bring about substantive reductions in the burden of this common disease."
"9308627","Our goal is to identify susceptibility genes for dyslexia, defined as unexpectedly low accuracy and/or rate of reading or spelling of neurobiological origin. This complex disorder affects 5-12% of school-aged children and, despite costly and intense remediation, aspects persist into adulthood with long-term educational, economic, and social repercussions. There is consensus from twin and family studies that genetic factors play a role in dyslexia and strong evidence from linkage analyses that there are discoverable risk alleles/genes. The genetic paradigm provides a powerful approach for discovery and delineation of underlying biochemical and neurodevelopmental pathways. This is particularly important given the absence of alternative non-human model systems for studying this specifically human form of communication. Multiple genes and loci have been associated with dyslexia but, as expected for a common complex disorder, none accounts for a majority of cases and causative DNA variants have not been confirmed. We will leverage the large, well-characterized set of families and linkage data we have amassed, coupled with large samples from a new multinational consortium, to identify genes and non-coding regulatory elements (gene-units) associated with component phenotypes of dyslexia. This goal will be accomplished with three specific aims: 1. Comprehensively evaluate and identify variants in gene-units of strong already-proposed dyslexia candidate loci; 2. Discover, refine and prioritize candidate gene-units for dyslexia component phenotypes in the most promising regions of interest identified in our cohort of families by prior genome scans; and 3. Validate the most promising gene-units in additional subject samples.  Our proposed project has multiple major novel components. First, we will test a particular model of the genetic architecture of dyslexia by comprehensively analyzing DNA sequence data in focused regions of interest (ROIs) in family-based samples. This will include evaluation of genomic sequence data from molecular inversion probe (MIP) capture of gene-units in large datasets. We will use analysis tools developed in our group to select the minimal number of informative family members to sequence, and combine family-based and population-based imputation to augment the sequence data by populating variants into the rest of the pedigree. This strategy will reduce the multiple test problem and increase power. Second, these analyses will incorporate ENCODE-annotated regulatory elements that may harbor variants that affect gene expression or function in more subtle ways than protein coding variants. The focus on transcribed DNA and Mendelian traits that is typical in human genetic analysis of coding-exon data may miss important variants that affect quantitative, rather than qualitative, variation. Third, we will employ bioinformatics approaches to prioritize genes and regulatory regions that explain the observed phenotypic variation in ROIs. These approaches include gene burden and family-based association methods that simultaneously accommodate rare and common variants as contributors to the component phenotypes. Our multigenerational subject sample and a large subject sample from the consortium provide excellent resources for discovery and validation of relevant variants and genes."
"9385136","Project Summary Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells affecting more than 20,000 patients each year, with a median survival of approximately 6 years. Despite recent advancements in therapy, the disease remains fatal in the majority of patients. Genetic aberrations including translocations, mutations in crucial cellular pathways, and copy number alterations, have been identified as molecular hallmarks of MM. However, the causal drivers of MM pathogenesis are still unclear, and treatment is given empirically based on recurrence risk rather than genetic events. High-throughput DNA sequencing of MM patients has revealed wide and remarkable heterogeneity of the mutational spectrum across the cohort of patients and complex sub-clonal structure. Clonal heterogeneity, evolution and competition suggest that the employment of a personalized therapeutic approach is likely to improve the outcomes for myeloma. In the past recent years, integrative network-based methods have proven to be extremely effective in modeling complex biological systems and uncovering novel patterns of genomic perturbation associated to disease initiation and progression. However, to date, there have been no network-based models in hematological malignancies developed using large-scale next generation sequencing data. In on going research, we have developed an integrative network biology approach to infer an improved molecular model of newly diagnosed MM. Our preliminary results show that our methodology is able to successfully recover previous knowledge and identify novel biological features of MM at both general and patient-specific level. This makes our approach naturally suitable for personalized medicine applications. Moreover, case studies of patients treated at Mount Sinai based on deep sequencing analysis show that a data-driven personalized therapy approach could be an effective way of treating patients resistant to the standard of care. To take our methodology to the next level, we propose to develop a complete ?bench- to-bedside? intelligent learning precision medicine platform for personalized cancer therapy, specifically designed for MM based on large datasets and a novel comprehensive integrative network approach. We will generate network models of myeloma patients in order to infer key driver genetic alterations, derive prognostic signatures and stage-specific features, perform disease subtype classification and inform therapy prioritization. The tool will match individual patients profiles with network-inferred disease classes, in order to select the most appropriate treatments, and will perform combination therapy prediction using tumor clonality assessment. Physician's opinion and therapy outcome will be used as feedback to refine the predictions through reinforcement learning techniques. It is important to note that, although the system will be built based on MM models, it will be practically applicable to other types of cancer, providing a general framework for personalized network-based therapy in oncology."
"9319752","Abstract Hox genes are critical for maintaining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although ectopic expression of the HoxB4 gene in bone marrow or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) leads to a dramatic expansion and long-term engraftment potential of HSCs, HoxB4 deficient mice exhibit only a mild reduction in progenitors and stem cells in fetal liver and bone marrow. In contrast, mice deficient in both HoxB3 and HoxB4 genes display severe hematopoietic defects with a marked decrease in HSC population indicating that other anterior HoxB genes may cooperate with HoxB4 to specify hematopoietic cell fate. It is important to understand underlying mechanisms by which the anterior HoxB genes are coordinately activated to confer HSC fate. The expression of Hox genes is regulated epigenetically by polycomb (PcG) and trithorax (TrxG) group regulators. We showed that recruitment of SETD1A to the HoxB4 locus governs its transcription activation and promotes HSC fate. Furthermore, we have identified and cloned a HoxB locus associated long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA), HoxBlinc, which is expressed during early hematopoietic differentiation consistent with H3K4me3 patterns and anterior HoxB gene activation. Furthermore, HoxBlinc associates with the Setd1a HMT complex and controls the specification and differentiation of Flk1+ hemangioblasts. Thus, the data suggest that HoxBlinc RNA may play an important role in early hematopoiesis, at least in part by recruiting Setd1a HMT complexes onto the Hox genes thereby modulating Hox locus chromatin structure and organization. However, it remains unknown how HoxBlinc reprograms chromatin state to regulate anterior HoxB genes and hematopoietic specific transcription program and whether HoxBlinc plays a role in targeting histone modifying enzymes to these genes to initiate hematopoietic differentiation. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that selective recruitment of the Setd1a HMT complex to the HoxB locus and coordination of anterior HoxB expression are mediated by HoxBlinc to specify the hematopoietic cell fate. In this proposal, we will examine the role of HoxBlinc in reprograming chromatin state and modulating anterior HoxB gene transcription. We will investigate underlying epigenetic mechanism by which HoxBlinc regulates early hematopoietic lineage commitment and differentiation. By finishing the proposed research, we expect a better understanding of molecular mechanism by which lincRNA and epigenetic regulators control early events of hematopoiesis."
"9316414","DATA AND STATISTICAL CORE?PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goals of The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center (JAX NSC) Data and Statistical Core are to 1) make the JAX NSC a model for data dissemination and analysis practices and 2) work with other Nathan Shock Centers to provide support for statistical design and analysis of model organism aging studies. In pursuit of these goals, the Core will develop statistical methods and apply specialized software tools to analyze JAX NSC data. We will provide data resources and study design and analysis support for the aging community. The Data and Statistical Core has provided analysis support for strain surveys and mapping crosses and has developed methods and software required for the analysis of our Diversity Outbred (DO) studies, including methods to analyze genotyping array data and methods for mapping genetic loci. In the renewal period, the Core will carry out genetic mapping analyses of the extensive phenotype data collected in the JAX NSC DO studies. We will analyze RNA-Seq and DNA methylation profiling data from JAX NSC tissue samples that have been distributed to collaborators within and outside the Center. These data represent a bridge that will enable us to identify the molecular mechanisms linking causal genetic variation to lifespan and age-related diseases. Going forward, the Data and Statistical Core will place greater emphasis on providing services to a broader cross-section of the aging research community. The Core will maintain strong ties with the Mouse Phenome Database, which serves as our primary outlet for data release. In addition, we will develop and deploy new web interfaces that provide searchable access to our large-scale ??omics? data, to ensure that all of our JAX NSC data is freely and easily accessible to the community through multiple outlets. Our Specific Aims are to:  Aim 1. Provide data analysis support for ongoing studies conducted within the JAX NSC including  the development of new analysis methods and software necessary to support these projects. Aim 2. Disseminate JAX NSC data in conjunction with the Mouse Phenome Database and through the development of web services and interfaces to provide access to large-scale data resources. Aim 3. Provide experiment design and analysis support to the aging research community."
"9321100","PROJECT SUMMARY - CLINICAL CORE The Clinical Core will establish and maintain a cohort of extensively characterized individuals who have volunteered to participate in research projects addressing brain aging and dementia. In addition to serving the national NIA mandates related to Alzheimer?s disease, Clinical Core resources will be distributed and adjusted to support intramural research programs investigating the heterogeneity of cognitive aging and dementia, as reflected in the themes of unusually successful brain aging (SuperAging) and non-amnestic dementias (e.g., primary progressive aphasia). The emphasis on Alzheimer?s disease will shift to earlier and pre-symptomatic stages with a view toward prevention trials. The SuperAging projects will explore factors that promote resilience to aging-related involutional changes and resistance to the emergence of Alzheimer pathology. The primary progressive aphasia program will help to clarify the biological diversity of Alzheimer?s disease and the principles of selective vulnerability in focal brain neurodegeneration. In the next five years, the Clinical Core will support the following goals:  1. Maintain a diverse cohort of 500 research participants that will include cognitively healthy persons with or  without subjective complaints of memory impairment and individuals with different forms of amnestic and non-  amnestic deficits. These subjects will be characterized by the Uniform Data Set (UDS), followed annually, and  committed to research participation, tissue donation and contribution to national collaborations through NACC,  ADCS, ADGC, NCRAD, and ADNI.  2. Emphasize the recruitment of study participants for areas of research where the Northwestern ADC enjoys  a national leadership role, such as SuperAging, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and other dementias  caused by frontotemporal diseases.  3. Promote the ?therapeutic encounter? theme of the ADC through the support of innovative non-  pharmacologic interventions that target unique person-specific symptom profiles.  4. Sustain a training approach that capitalizes on the multidisciplinary ?centerness? of the Northwestern ADC  and that serves the mission of the Research Education Component through the cultivation of an environment  where trainees from different disciplines (basic and cognitive science, neurology, neuropsychology,  psychiatry, social work, and neuroimaging) train together in contiguous space.      "
"9333975","Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of CGG-trinucleotide repeats in the 5? untranslated region (UTR) of the gene fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1). An atypical mode of protein translational initiation, known as repeat-associated, non- ATG (RAN) translation, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS and other nucleotide-expansion disorders by triggering synthesis of aberrant homopolymeric proteins that accumulate in neuronal inclusions and elicit toxicity in disease models. To understand how RAN translation works and how it might be suppressed, I performed a candidate-based screen for modulators of RAN translation in a Drosophila melanogaster model of FXTAS. This screen identified the RNA helicase belle (DDX3, in humans) as critical for RAN translation in both flies and human cell-based assays. This proposal will determine how DDX3 facilitates RAN translation and whether genetic inhibition of belle/DDX3 alleviates RAN translation-dependent toxicity in Drosophila and mammalian neurons. This work should provide mechanistic insights into how RAN translation occurs while providing a roadmap for rational therapeutic development in FXTAS and other repeat expansion disorders."
"9389607","Project Summary  The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is estimated to cause disease in more than 1,000,000 people worldwide every year, resulting in greater than 600,000 deaths. However, not all Cryptococcus isolates cause lethal infections; some are relatively benign while others are hypervir- ulent. Differences in pathogenicity are often correlated with variation in speci?c morphological and physiological features such as the ability to grow at high temperatures, the size of the pro- tective polysaccharide capsule surrounding the yeast cell, or resistance to antifungal drugs. In order to develop better ways to prevent and treat cryptococcal disease we need to understand the underlying genetic differences that lead to changes in virulence and virulence-related traits. We also need to understand the frequency and distribution of these genetic differences in different parts of the world.  To tackle these problems, the proposed research will use a combination of experimental and statistical approaches to dissect the causal genetic basis of variation in virulence and virulence- related traits. In Aim 1 we will employ a statistical technique called Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping, that exploits genotypic and phenotypic differences among offspring derived from genetic crosses to identify regions of the genome (loci) and DNA changes (alleles) that con- tribute to differences in virulence traits. We will validate the contributions of the loci identi?ed in this manner using gene replacements and related techniques. In Aim 2 we will subject ge- netically diverse populations of Cryptococcus to selection in animal hosts. Following selection, pooled whole genome sequencing will be used to identify loci and alleles that are favored during infection. This technique provides an unbiased approach for discovering loci that contribute to virulence, and will both complement and extend the results of Aim 1. In Aim 3 we will frame our ?ndings in the context of natural populations of Cryptococcus by studying the frequency and geo- graphic distributions of virulence alleles identi?ed in Aims 1 and 2. This aim will employ a large, global sample of Cryptococcus strains isolated from both clinical settings and the natural environ- ment. This information will be used to carry out Genome-Wide Association (GWAS) mapping of virulence traits and to identify regions of the world where there are higher frequencies of virulent genotypes or where there is potential for increased virulence through recombination."
"9302605","Alcohol use disorders exact a substantial toll on America's public health especially with respect to brain  structure and its functions. The goal of this expanded research plan is to identify mechanisms of alcoholism-  induced brain injury using advanced magnetic resonance brain imaging (MRI) that could guide rehabilitation  strategies and ultimately inform pharmacological treatment development. Alcoholism's dynamic cycle of  remission and relapse can result in compromised functioning, selectively destructive to problem solving,  working memory, visuospatial abilities, and gait and balance. Converging evidence strongly implicates  disruption of frontocerebellar circuitry as a principal contributor to the characteristic pattern of alcoholism-  related impairment. Findings generated from the current research revealed this circuitry comprises multiple  dissociable loops, each subserving different cognitive or motor functions. We also established which loops  are affected and which are spared in alcoholism and have discovered instatement of novel functional  connections associated with good performance and longer sobriety in recovering alcoholics. In addition to  these task-activated findings, our resting-state (rs) fMRI studies identified intrinsic functional connectivity  networks that are affected and others that are spared in alcoholics. Our pursuit now will be to test whether  network recruitment can be redirected from disrupted nodes and networks to alternative functional circuitry  for overcoming selective dysfunction. Proposed are 3 specific aims with testable hypotheses:  Specific Aim 1: To elucidate the status with short-term abstinence and change with sustained abstinence or  relapse of resting-state intrinsic and task-activated functional cerebellar networks;  Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of sustained sobriety or relapse on alcoholism-induced degradation  ofthe neuroanatomy and cerebral blood perfusion on task-activated and intrinsic connectivity networks  involving frontocerebellar circuitry;  Specific Aim 3: To examine the motor and cognitive ramifications of sobriety-related or reIapse-related  changes measured in intrinsic network connectivity identified with rsfMRI."
"9308033","The motivation and rationale for project 1 derives from the increasing recognition that ALS and related disorders represent syndromes with shared pathophysiological mechanisms, but a multitude of different (often genetic) causes. This realization is prompting an increasing interest in the ideas that one treatment may not be appropriate for all patients with each clinical syndrome, but rather that different therapeutic approaches might be needed depending on the underlying etiology of disease. It is against this background that defining the temporal course of disease and delineating the variability in rates of disease progression in genetically homogeneous patient populations has emerged as an essential stes in preparing for the future of clinical trials in ALS and related disorders. The principal goal of Project-1 of this RDCRC is to define the natural history (i.e. the temporal rate of disease progression) of disease in patients with ALS and related disorders who harbor different underlying genetic mutations; A secondary goal is to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of disease progression within these individual disease categories, with a focus on ALS."
"9312901","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thermosensitivity and thermotolerance are fundamental processes that affect virtually all aspects of human physiology. Human sensation of cold - ranging from refreshingly cool to unpleasant and frigid - relies on the ability of primar sensory afferents to transduce these stimuli into electrical signaling, thereby triggering adaptive biological response. Dysregulation of thermosensation underlie cold allodynia - a common hallmark of chemotherapy-, nerve injury- and post-stroke-induced neuropathic pain, in which even mild cooling can be perceived as excruciatingly painful. Despite significant medical relevance, the molecular aspects of cold sensation under normal, adaptive and pathological conditions, and the sequence of events that underlies this process still remain enigmatic and controversial. Animals that tune temperature sensitivity to the extreme provide ideal model to delineate cellular and molecular aspects of thermotolerance and temperature perception in general. We are using mammalian hibernation as a naturally-reversible model to understand these processes. Unlike the standard laboratory rodents, hibernating animals do not perceive cold temperature as uncomfortable until -2°C. This remarkable ability contributes to their unusual resistance to cold during hibernation, when the animals drop their core body temperature to 2-4°C. In this proposal, we are aiming to examine contribution of TRPM8 and Nav1.8 ion channels into cold adaptations in hibernating squirrels at the level of somatosensory system using multi-disciplinary approach, including physiology, imaging, behavioral paradigms, cell biology, differential transcriptomics, genomics and bioinformatics."
"9353756","We seek to understand how the process of protein aggregation leads to the dysfunction and, ultimately, the death of post-mitotic tissue in the transthyretin (TTR) amyloid diseases. This understanding would enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies, the establishment of early diagnostic tactics, and the identification of biomarkers that quantify response to therapy. The TTR protein is secreted from the liver, it circulates in the blood, and its aggregation results in a primary neuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy, depending on the sequence(s) that misassembles. In Aim 1, we aspire to understand the structure-proteotoxicity relationship(s) driving the pathology of the TTR amyloidoses. We will isolate non-native TTR structures from patient plasma and subject them to structural characterization using atomic force microscopy and negative stain electron microscopy (EM). Non-native TTR structures that decrease upon tafamidis treatment (a disease-modifying kinetic stabilizer drug that stops TTR aggregation) and exhibit relevant cellular proteotoxicity will be further structurally characterized by cryo EM and by solid-state NMR. Cytotoxicity will be assessed in relevant primary cells and C. elegans, aiming to delineate the structures that are proteotoxic and preliminary mechanistic insights, while also assessing whether there are neurotoxic vs. cardiotoxic TTR structures. Moreover, we are developing novel peptide-based probes to quantify non-native TTR structures in blood to facilitate diagnosis and response to therapy across the >100 TTR sequences linked to pathology. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that secretory pathway proteostasis network capacity in hepatocytes influences the folded structure, kinetic stability, and amyloidogenicity of secreted TTR. NMR evidence indicates the novel finding that an altered structural ensemble with enhanced TTR kinetic stability is afforded by folding TTR in a transcriptionally reprogrammed cellular proteostasis network. This aggregation resistance is due, in part, to the Hsp70 pathway, according to in vitro reconstitution experiments. We will continue to study the mechanism by which this and other proteostasis network pathways alter the structure, increase the kinetic stability, and reduce the aggregation propensity of secreted TTR in vivo. We will test the notion that wild type TTR produced by 10% of older males adopts a kinetically less stable, alternative tetramer structure that is more aggregation prone and thus leads to wild type TTR cardiomyopathy. We have developed a method to efficiently isolate TTR from healthy elderly vs. TTR amyloidosis patients to facilitate comparisons. That chaperone assisted folding can alter the folded structure of the client protein is a novel finding."
"9300880","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glycans on cell surface and secreted molecules play crucial roles in diverse biological processes. Functional studies have been hampered by the complexity of the glycan repertoire and by technical limitations in our ability to analyze expression of different glycan forms. In particular, one highly dynamic aspect of the vertebrate glycome has remained largely intractable to full analysis: the diverse array of terminal sialic acids (Sias), and their linkages to underlying glycans (sialoglycans, which constitute the sialoglycome). Current glycomic methods destroy and/or miss certain aspects of the sialoglycome, and the compromise is to release Sias and separately study their diversity. However, this approach also destroys important information, requires instrumentation and expertise only available to a few, fails to elucidate the intact sialoglycome in a native state, an prevents localization of the different components of the sialoglycome within or on cells or tissues. Thus, non-experts tend to avoid studying the biological questions arising. We will develop a systematic approach for in situ identification, tracking, manipulation, and analysis of sialoglycans and their functions. We will collect, curate and optimize a well-defined set of recombinant soluble stable tagged sialoglycan recognizing probes (SGRPs), which can eventually be used as practical tools by non-experts. SGRPs to be explored include a subset of bacterial SRR adhesins, bacterial B5 toxins, viral hemagglutinins, viral hemagglutinin-esterases, phage proteins, and invertebrate and plant lectins, as well as certain Siglecs and monoclonal antibodies--all with requirements for specific Sia modifications and/or linkages in their binding epitope. We will not pursue directed mutagenesis of SGRP binding sites in the first round of studies, as biological evolution via natural selection (e.g., at the hostpathogen interface) has already honed specificities of natural SGRPs. Additional chicken monoclonal antibodies with specificity for certain sialoglycans would be explored. Each stable probe would be studied for specificity on a sialoglycan array displaying major aspects of natural diversity. In parallel we would expand the diversity of sialoglycans on the array. The best subset of probes would be tested using mice with genetically induced sialoglycan changes, in flow cytometry, Western blots, ELISAs on serum, and immunohistochemical analyses of tissues. Optimization of conditions and controls will be explored, including mutant inactive probes and/or pretreatment with specific sialidases, esterases or mild periodate oxidation of the Sia side chain. The goal is to define a set of SGRPs that can be made available to any biosciences investigator, who can profile the diversity of intact sialoglycome in biological samples. The final outcome (which would be cross-validated and further optimized) is a simple and reliable toolkit to track the sialoglycome in biological samples. This work will simultaneously acquire basic knowledge valuable to investigators who generate probes, as well as to those who study the biological systems they originate from."
"9280925","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many hematological diseases result from aberrant chromatin and gene regulation of the maintenance, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). As the major H3K4 methylation enzymes in mammals, the Set1/Mll complexes occupy a crucial position in developmental biology, and are considered potential drug targets for epigenetic therapeutics due to the intimate connection of H3K4 methylation with gene expression as well as the extensive association of several subunits in these complexes with diseases, including multiple blood cancers. However, it remains unclear how the H3K4 methylation activity of the Set1/Mll complexes regulates normal and abnormal hematopoiesis. We have previously established that Dpy30, a shared subunit of the Set1/Mll complexes, facilitates chromosomal H3K4 methylation, and is crucial for efficient differentiation of embryonic stem cells by facilitating the induction of many bivalently marked developmental genes. In this proposal, we will study the functional role of Dpy30 and its associated H3K4 methylation in HSPC fate determination using a Dpy30 conditional knockout (KO) mouse model that we recently generated. We have shown that the cellular H3K4 methylation level is markedly reduced in the Dpy30 KO mice. These mice develop severe pancytopenia and have profound defects in multilineage hematopoietic reconstitution, yet strongly accumulate phenotypic early HSPCs at the expense of more downstream hematopoietic cells, suggesting a block in hematopoietic differentiation. Further analyses in a competitive transplantation system also reveal profound defects in HSPC fate determination and in expression of key regulatory genes. These results allowed us to formulate our central hypothesis in this proposal -- Dpy30 is critical for HSPC cell fate determination through facilitating H3K4 methylation of key hematopoietic genes. We thus propose two specific aims to test this hypothesis: (1): To define the role of Dpy30 in HSC maintenance and HSPC differentiation. (2): To dissect the molecular mechanisms by which Dpy30 regulates HSPC function. By revealing a previous unrecognized role of the H3K4 methylation activity of the Set1/Mll complexes in regulating HSPC fate determination, this project will have important implications for developing therapeutic strategies against certain HSPC-based hematological diseases."
"9317287","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Corrosive couple conflict (CCC) and coercive parent-child conflict constitute a ubiquitous, potent, and destructive (but modifiable) interpersonal poison to a wide range of adult and children's health outcomes. Such patterns are also linked with poor parent-child relationships and with more harsh punishment, which is associated with disturbed responses to environmental stresses (e.g., disruption in sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical responses), a wide variety of adverse health outcomes in childhood, including dental caries, obesity, and diabetes related metabolic markers. This phase of NIH's Science of Behavior Change program emphasizes an experimental medicine approach to behavior change necessitating identification of central interpersonal/social targets for maximal impact on far-reaching panoply of health outcomes. This project will focus on factors associated diabetes and oral health (though the processes affect many other disease outcomes). Both are associated with pain, distress, expense, loss of productivity, and even mortality. They share overlapping medical regimens, are driven by overlapping proximal health behaviors, and affect a wide developmental span, from early childhood to late adulthood. As requested by the RFA, we will isolate three proximal health behaviors: (a) medical regimen adherence; (b) eating and drinking high sugar/calorie items; and (c) self-care behaviors. CCC/coercive parent-child conflicts are marked by an interrelated set of affective, behavioral, and physiological signatures. In the UH2 phase, we will identify/develop/validate assays. We will also identify/develop, and test interventions to reduce CCC/coercion targets. In the UH3 phase, we expect to conduct at least 2 studies to test whether reduction in targets results in improvement in adherence and other health behaviors of interest. One study will focus on parents and children, the other on adults in intimate relationships. Health behaviors related to diabetes and oral health problems will serve as dependent variables as will self-care behaviors in both diabetes and oral health. To place these health behaviors in the context of disease conditions and medical regimen adherence, we expect to focus one study on a sample of children with early childhood caries and the other study on an adult sample with diabetes."
"9309101","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper development of neuronal morphology and neural circuits, as well as neuronal maintenance, requires tightly controlled subcellular localization of proteins such as axon guidance cue receptors. Proteins are targeted to specific cell locations by elaborate membrane trafficking and axonal transport systems. Neurons are particularly dependent on high fidelity protein trafficking because of their highly polarized and complex structure. Defects in trafficking and transport underlie multiple human developmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Charcot-Marie-Tooth, and Niemann Pick disease. Despite their importance, the mechanisms regulating trafficking processes in neurons are poorly understood, in part due to a paucity of in vivo models in which the machinery and mechanisms of axon transport can be studied. A major challenge to the field and the long term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms controlling axonal transport and protein localization as neurons develop in their natural environment, where they must integrate multiple extracellular cues. We established a model in which we can image dynamics of neuronal cargo transport, protein localization, and microtubule behavior in the intact zebrafish embryo. Vertebrate sensory neurons extend distinct central and peripheral axons to form the sensory circuit. We found that these axons show distinct responses to axon guidance cues. Moreover, we discovered roles for endosomal trafficking and the kinesin adaptor Calsyntenin-1 (Clstn-1) in differential guidance of sensory axons. In Aim 1 we propose to determine how calsyntenins regulate endosome transport routes to different axon compartments. In Aim 2 we will investigate mechanisms regulating specific localization of receptors for Neurotrophin-3 and Semaphorin3d. We will test the hypothesis that Calsyntenins and another class of kinesin adaptors, the Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) function to target receptors to specific axon compartments. In Aim 3 we will determine how Clstn-1 and CRMPs organize microtubule polarity and dynamics, processes essential for accurate trafficking and axon growth. Our unique model allows us to connect the molecular events of axonal transport, guidance receptor localization and microtubule organization to specific axon guidance decisions at the time and place they naturally occur. Elucidation of the molecular signals regulating sensory axon growth, guidance, and protein trafficking is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disorders, neuropathic pain disorders and the conditions under which regeneration after axon injury can occur. Our experiments will uncover such mechanisms and thus may help to identify molecular targets for disease treatment."

Core C will provide participants' data to three projects to facilitate much- needed research on physical and cultural contributors to pelvic floor support and pelvic floor symptoms."
"9279228","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children of mothers with pain have a greater risk for pain compared to children of healthy mothers, but little work has identified mechanisms through which this risk is conferred. While the presence of chronic pain certainly presents parenting challenges, our understanding of how exposure to specific parent behaviors impacts children is limited. Identifying mechanisms through which exposure to maternal chronic pain confers risk for pain and poor health outcomes to children would enable early screening and development of preventive interventions to modify risk. The long-term goal of this research program is to identify mechanisms through which chronic pain in parents negatively impacts children and adolescents. Identification of these mechanisms will inform the development of preventative interventions for youth at increased risk for chronic pain. The incidence of childhood chronic pain increases in early puberty, which makes the transition from childhood to early adolescence a critical period for studying risk for chronic pain and related problems. The proposed study will utilize a developmental model of the impact of maternal chronic pain. Both direct and transactional mechanisms of risk transmission will be tested over the course of a three year period during the transition from childhood to early adolescence. The central hypothesis is that maternal chronic pain influences risk for child pain and negative health outcomes through several direct and transactional pathways. Maternal responses to child pain and distress, as well as physical activity parenting and overall family stress will be examined as potential mechanisms. Longitudinal models of risk transmission will be tested in a sample of mothers with chronic pain and their 8-12 year old children (n= 400 mother-child dyads). These mother-child dyads will be assessed annually over a three year period, and will report on mother pain and disability, cognitive-affective factors, physical activity parenting, and family stress. These factrs will be examined as predictors of child pain, somatic symptoms, internalizing problems, healthcare utilization, school absences, and functional limitations. Daily associations between maternal functional limitations and child risks for chronic pain will also be examined. Determining mechanisms and moderators of risk during this developmental transition will provide critical information for the design of interventions aimed at reducing pain and other negative health outcomes in at-risk youth."
"9294004","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Support is requested for continuation of the Training Program in Cancer Biology and Therapeutics (CBT) at the University of California, Irvine. Despite decades of research, cancer is the #1 killer of adults under 85. Thus, there remains a substantial need for new therapies, diagnostics and preventions that will not be met by business as usual approaches. The goal of this program is to meet this need by providing UCI graduate students and postdocs with comprehensive, highly interdisciplinary training that includes cancer biology, the most current research methods, and a focus on translational science such as the development of novel cancer therapeutics and diagnostics. The foundation we provide together with professional development activities offered will produce a cohort of well-trained experts armed to successfully attack the cancer problem from vantage points in both academia and industry. The Program benefits from outstanding institutional support from the UCI Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center), the UCI Cancer Research Institute, Graduate Division, and other campus offices. The Program provides research opportunities across the cancer continuum from etiology to therapeutics, encompassing faculty from the School of Biological Sciences, basic and clinical departments in the School of Medicine, and the department of Chemistry. There are twenty-eight training faculty, each with a cancer-focused research program and established record of training. We request support for four postdoctoral and four predoctoral trainees; one additional predoctoral position will be supported by our Graduate Division. Over the last two years, we have carried out a rigorous self-evaluation with input from trainees, faculty, and external advisors. This process has led us to implement a revised program that meets the specific needs of current UCI trainees. The Program is led by a new Director and co-Director, both mid-career faculty with outstanding records of research productivity and training. A continuing element of the Program will be a rigorous and well-defined set of courses (Cancer Biology parts A and B, Clinical Cancer for Basic Scientists, Cancer Biology Journal Club), that build knowledge about basic and clinical/translational cancer research. Other strong components that will continue are the biennial CBT program retreat and the annual symposium in basic cancer biology. A fundamental change will be greater flexibility for trainees to choose courses and activities based on their Individual Development Plan (IDP) that they will update annually. Other new elements will be a Research-in- Progress series, a quarterly seminar series featuring eminent cancer researchers from academia and industry, and enhanced opportunities for exposure to clinical cancer care and research. The Program will implement substantial improvements to recruiting approaches for both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, including innovative methods to recruit underrepresented minorities. Lastly, CBT trainees will benefit from an exciting new emphasis on professional development, supported in part by a new NIH-BEST award to UC Irvine."
"9276679","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The training platform in this proposal focuses on intracellular signaling in B lymphocytes as a new approach to correcting fundamental defects in immune tolerance and to monitoring therapeutic interventions to reprogram islet-destructive immunity. While much work has gone into understanding the intercellular processes that drive T1D, the intracellular cascades that control the destructive responses to islet antigens are undefined. The production of autoantibodies is the earliest available biomarker of autoimmunity, but the mechanisms that permit this breach in immune tolerance remain unknown. While targeting of the whole B lymphocyte pool with rituximab delayed the progression of new-onset T1D, the effect was transient, which may relate to failure to reprogram islet-reactive cells long-term. Like T cells, B cells progress through multiple developmental stages during which they are programmed by antigen contact to be tolerant to self-antigens. This program fails in T1D, which I have hypothesized is due to improper coupling between antigen contact and effector responses during B cell development. In my preliminary studies, I have utilized new approaches in cutting-edge, phosphoflow cytometry to uncover defects in c-Abl signaling in the Transitional 1 (T1) B lymphocyte subset of NOD mice, the benchmark preclinical model of T1D. While the function of c-Abl in oncogenesis has been extensively dissected, its role in the programming of immune tolerance in B cells is largely unknown. In this proposal I will dissect the c-Abl dependent signaling pathways that govern B lymphocyte tolerance mechanisms. I hypothesize that c-Abl modulates the balance between homeostatic expansion and negative selection in the transitional B lymphocyte compartment and that defects in this pathway underlie B lymphocyte selection defects found in autoimmune disease. I will dissect c-Abl mediated pathways that control B lymphocyte homeostasis and selection by applying transgenic, antigen-specific systems and therapeutic targeting of c-Abl pathways for disease modulation (Aim 1). I will extend this analysis of immune signaling to understand how immune function is reprogrammed during disease-modifying therapy using informatics approaches combined with high dimensional mass cytometry (Aim 2). Through this fellowship application, I will develop 1) a detailed understanding of new intracellular pathways of B cell regulation during tolerance induction and 2) my potential as a basic and translational scientist focused on T1D. These training goals will be facilitated by the research plan, by the exceptional team of mentors with expertise in the proposed study design, by completion of the Howard Hughes Certificate Program in Molecular Medicine, and by the resources, facilities, and training plan available through Vanderbilt University."
"9373398","PROJECT SUMMARY Platelet studies have had a profound impact on our understanding of adhesion receptor function as exemplified by the adhesion and signaling roles of integrin ?IIb?3 in hemostasis and thrombosis. Less is known about whether and how ?IIb?3 signaling regulates platelets in their roles as sentinels and effectors of immunity and inflammation. In this regard, we have discovered that ?IIb?3 interacts through its ?IIb cytoplasmic tail with SHARPIN, an obligate component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). This complex is the only known enzyme responsible for M1 linear ubiquitination of key proteins involved in immune and inflammatory signaling through the NF-?B pathway in leukocytes. Platelets express many proteins of the canonical NF-?B pathway. Therefore, we will now employ complementary approaches, including studies of peripheral blood platelets, megakaryocytes and platelets derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, and gene-targeted mice to test the following central hypothesis: Through dynamic and mutually exclusive interactions with ?IIb?3 and LUBAC, SHARPIN regulates platelet function in inflammation and immunity as well as in hemostasis and thrombosis. Aim 1 will employ biochemical and advanced imaging techniques to test whether physical and functional linkages exist between ?IIb?3, LUBAC and the NF-?B pathway in human and mouse platelets. Attention will be focused on whether SHARPIN functions to maintain ?IIb?3 in a low-affinity state in resting platelets, but dissociates from ?IIb and assembles the LUBAC complex to facilitate ?IIb?3 and NF-?B activation in response to platelet agonists generated during hemostasis and inflammation. Aim 2 will introduce genetic modifications into human megakaryocytes and platelets derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to model the effects of SHARPIN knockdown or knockout on ?IIb?3 and LUBAC functions in the appropriate primary cells. Using this system, optogenetic techniques new to the platelet field will be used to determine the functional consequences of conditional SHARPIN interactions with ?IIb?3 or with its two LUBAC protein partners. Aim 3 will address whether SHARPIN is required for ?IIb?3 and platelet functions in response to inflammatory stimuli and vascular injury in vivo. To accomplish this, platelet-specific SHARPIN knockout mice will be generated using the Pf4-Cre system and studied in several mouse models of platelet-dependent inflammation, hemostasis and thrombosis. Altogether, these studies will provide new insights into the role of SHARPIN in platelet pathobiology, with mechanistic and potential therapeutic implications beyond hemostasis and for platelets in inflammation and immunity."
"9211407","SUMMARY  The loss of tissue homeostasis and regenerative capacity with age underlies some of the most challenging health issues in the elderly. A major contributor to age-related decline in the structure and function of many tissues is the loss of stem cell function that occurs during the aging process. To be able slow, arrest, or even reverse those age-related declines in stem cell function holds would represent a major therapeutic advance in the growing field of regenerative medicine.  The primary focus of this Program is to understand the molecular basis of age-related changes in stem cell function with the underlying premise that such an understanding is likely to reveal ways to target those changes in order to enhance aged stem cell function. Based largely on the work from the laboratories of this Program, there is increasing evidence of profound epigenetic changes that occur in stem cells as they age and that underlie many functional changes. A central conceptual theme that is woven throughout the proposal is the notion that these changes are not only mediators of cellular function but are amenable to being restored to a more youthful state through the process we call ?epigenetic rejuvenation?. In addition, we explore how the epigenetic changes confer upon stem cells the characteristics that may be responsible for selection of subsets of cells across the lifespan by an ever changing adaptive landscape and result in a population of distinct stem cells in the aged milieu.  To examine those concepts experimentally, this Program includes three Projects that focus on somatic stem cells from three different tissues that differ in terms of their homeostatic turnover and regenerative capacity ? blood (high turnover, highly regenerative), muscle (low turnover, highly regenerative), and brain (low homeostatic, minimally regenerative). The Projects are integrated in their shared approaches to understanding the epigenetics of stem cell aging using cutting-edge technologies, including single cell transcriptome and epigenome analysis, modified CRISPR/cas9 technology for locus-specific epigenetic modifications, and in vivo lineage studies to explore the dynamics of stem cell populations during aging. These Projects are supported by three essential Cores ? an Administrative Core to facilitate the interactions among the laboratories, a ?Rejuvenation Strategies? Core for our shared animal studies to explore epigenetic rejuvenation, and a Bioinformatics Core to serve as the essential hub for storing, processing, visualizing, analyzing, and sharing data from the three Projects. Overall, the investigators who are Project Leaders and Core Directors are internationally recognized experts in these areas and bring to the Program the full breadth of expertise, creativity, and records of accomplishment to assure an integrated, innovative, and highly successful Program to explore the molecular mechanisms of stem cell aging."
"9341949","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory nerves narrow airways in response to inhaled substances. Patients with asthma exhibit enhanced sensitivity and reactivity to inhaled stimuli, leading to life-threatening bronchoconstriction and symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest tightness. The mechanisms of airway nerve hyperreactivity are unclear and represent a potential therapeutic target. Eosinophils accumulate within the airways of asthmatic patients and interact with nerves. Eosinophils also increase cultured sensory nerve growth. The goal of this project is to determine if eosinophils cause airway hyperreactivity by regulating sensory nerve morphology, as well as neurotransmitter and receptor expression. This project proposes to use whole-mount immunostaining, tissue optical clearing, laser-scanning confocal microscopy, and digitized nerve modeling to characterize how eosinophils regulate nerve morphology and neurotransmitter content in murine models of asthma. Measurements of lung resistance in mice treated with selective pharmacologic antagonists will determine how eosinophil-mediated sensory neuroplasticity promotes airway hyperreactivity. This project also proposes to co- culture primary human sensory neurons with eosinophils to determine if eosinophils increase expression of select neurotransmitters and receptors. Taken together, achieving the goals of this proposal will increase understanding of how eosinophils promote airway nerve dysfunction in asthmatic patients."
"9314641","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial evidence suggests that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in neurodegeneration associated with HD. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which mutant huntingtin (htt) causes mitochondrial dysfunction remain largely unknown. We recently demonstrated a regulatory role of Ape1, the major mammalian apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease that participates in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, on mitochondrial function. Thus, our main objective is to determine the mechanisms of Ape1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of mutant htt. This proposal will test the hypothesis that mutant htt, in combination with age-related effects, mediates mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration by targeting Ape1, which in turn results in deficient repair of mtDNA. We propose to test our hypothesis using a combination of in vivo and in vitro models of HD and directly test our hypothesis by determining if: 1) age-related changes in Ape1 synaptic nerve terminals contribute to mtDNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in HD and 2) what mechanism(s) might trigger Ape1-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of the htt mutation. This study is likely to provide insight into a possible regulatory mechanism of Ape1 in mutant htt-induced mt dysfunction and neurodegeneration."
"9312767","ABSTRACT Despite major breakthroughs over the past few years in our basic understanding of the cellular and molecular changes that lead to cancer, many key steps in carcinogenesis, and changes in early cancers that promote invasion and metastasis, still remain poorly defined. Rigorous training of future young investigators in cancer biology will be essential in our quest for a deeper understanding of carcinogenesis, and for the development of better methods of early cancer detection, improved diagnosis, and effective new cancer treatments. The Training Program in Cancer Biology (TPCB) is a multidisciplinary program across all cancer subtypes that capitalizes on the unique strengths and training opportunities at CU Anschutz including world renown research in functional genomics, experimental therapeutics, steroid receptor signaling, stem cells and organ specific cancers (in particular lung, breast, prostate and blood). Our goal is to provide interdisciplinary training at the cutting edge of cancer research to best prepare our trainees to compete in a biomedical research environment increasingly focused on translational applications of basic research. Our training plan consists of laboratory training, didactic activities, attendance at scientific conferences, professional development and career mentoring, development of communication skills, and exposure to the clinical perspective. The Co-PIs of this training program have leadership roles within the institution that integrate the University of Colorado Cancer Center and the Graduate School into this training program. Dr. Cramer is co-director of the Hormone-Related Malignancies group within the Cancer Center and works with other Cancer Center leadership to establish goals and directions of the cancer center. Dr. Reyland is director of the Cancer Biology pre-doctoral training program, providing a strong link to the Graduate School. Additional integration comes from other training faculty who are all members of the Cancer Center (many with leadership roles), and several also have leadership roles in the Graduate School. Resources from the Cancer Center, the Graduate School, and individual departments are committed to support the training program. The infrastructure of the Cancer Center is particularly important as it provides core resources available to training faculty that are therefore available to the trainees. The proposed program will include pre-doctoral training through the graduate training program in Cancer Biology, which is housed in the Graduate School, and post-doctoral training for PhDs. The total of 31 training faculty were selected based on their scientific expertise and track record of mentorship. Based on the NCIs postdoctoral/predoctoral training ratio of 3:1, this application proposes to appoint 3 new postdocs and 1 new predoctoral student in year 1, and 6 post-docs and 2 pre-doctoral students per award year for years 2-5. We will select trainees from external and internal pools based on their research and academic records and commitment to cancer research.

"9247885","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (ATAAD) are interrelated cardiovascular diseases that carry high mortality.] Current approaches to pharmacologic prevention of ATAAD are ineffective, particularly in patients with sporadic disease. Although there is a critical need to develop new treatment strategies, a major barrier to this goal is a poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms that trigger and then promote aortic degeneration in sporadic ATAAD. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the under- standing of the pathobiology of aortic wall degeneration in hope of developing new pharmacological strategies to prevent ATAAD formation and progression. The overall objective of this application is to systematically define the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade, a multiprotein platform involved in amplifying intracellular stress responses, in promoting aortic destruction and the extent to which this cascade represents a therapeutic target against ATAAD. The central hypotheses are: (1) the NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 cascade promotes aortic degeneration by promoting smooth muscle cell contractile dysfunction and aortic destruction, and (2) treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of this cascade will prevent ATAAD. These central hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims, each of which focuses on specific hypotheses based on our preliminary data. [In the first aim, we will seek to prove our hypothesis that the NLRP3- ASC-caspase-1 inflammasome cascade promotes ascending aortic wall inflammatory cell infiltration, matrix destruction, contractile dysfunction, and biomechanical failure through a series of experiments with a mouse model of sporadic ATAAD. In the second aim, we will seek to prove the hypothesis that the inflammasome cascade directly cleaves and degrades myosin heavy chain and tropomyosin, and thus promotes SMC contractile dysfunction. We will also determine whether intracellular stress activates the inflammasome cascade and confirm the association of intracellular stress and the inflammasome in human ATAAD tissue. In the third aim, we will test the hypothesis that NLRP3 inhibitors (glyburide, parthenolide and MCC950) will prevent ascending aortic destruction and disease progression in our mouse model of sporadic ATAAD.] The proposed research is significant because it will determine how the inflammasome cascade is activated, how this cascade promotes ATAAD development, and the extent to which an inflammasome inhibitor can prevent ATAAD. This research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo, namely the current pharmacologic approaches to preventing aortic disease progression. The development of a new, effective pharmacological prevention strategy would have an important positive effect on disease prognosis by delaying or obviating invasive procedures in patients presenting with early-stage ascending aortic disease, suppressing disease progression in patients who are poor candidates for surgical treatment, and improving the durability of surgical aortic repairs."
"9516332","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5 year training project that will allow me to achieve my goal of becoming an independent investigator in diabetes research. The training and career development plan includes a research project with potential implications for public health, training in laboratory techniques, and didactic scientific and career development seminars and courses. Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, a leader in the field of insulin signaling and diabetes, will serve as my mentor. He has trained over 150 postdoctoral fellows, many of whom are now department heads. In addition, an advisory committee will provide me with scientific and career advice. The research will take place at the Joslin Diabetes Center; a Harvard affiliated institution, providing me access to all of the resources the Harvard Community has to offer. There is an increased risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease in patients with diabetes. The mechanism connecting these diseases is unclear. Recent data in mice demonstrate a decrease in the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the brains of diabetic mice. This is particularly significant given that the greatest risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease s a variant in a cholesterol transporter (ApoE). My preliminary data demonstrate that decreasing cholesterol synthesis by knocking out one copy of the sterol sensing protein SCAP in the brain produces mice with an impaired rate of cerebral cholesterol synthesis, impairment in synaptic transmission, and cognitive impairment. The overall goal of the project is to understand how insulin regulates SREBP-2, a more specific regulator of cholesterol synthesis than SCAP. In Aim 1 I will define the molecular pathway used by insulin to stimulate insulin signaling in the brain. Aim 2 will determine the biochemical consequences of deleting SREBP-2 from neurons and glia in mice. Aim 3 will delineate the changes in brain function produced by knocking SREBP-2 out from neurons or glia. In addition, these knockout mice will be made diabetic or crossed with a model of Alzheimer's disease to determine how a background of reduced cholesterol exacerbates these diseases."
"9387209","ABSTRACT Ebola virus (EBOV) is classified as a filamentous, enveloped, non-segmented negative-sense RNA carrying Category A Priority Pathogen by the NIH and CDC. Infections with EBOV cause severe hemorrhagic fever and high mortality in humans and non-human primates (NHPs). During the Ebola outbreak of late 2014 in West Africa, the lack of laboratory tests for early Ebola-virus-disease (EVD) detection (preferably before the onset of symptoms) and lack of effective treatments limited the containment and management of the eventual epidemic. To address this critical need for early EVD diagnosis, we have recently customized a platform we developed to enhance biomarker detection to allow sensitive and specific EBOV biomarker quantification in serum samples. Our method uses antibody-modified porous silicon nanodisks (pSiNDs) and high-throughput, high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) ? together referred to as pSiND-MS ? to greatly enhance the specificity and sensitivity of target peptide detection from complex protein samples. In our customized EVD assay, these pSiNDs are functionalized with custom antibodies to specific peptides of the EBOV matrix protein VP40 in order to efficiently capture these peptides from non-enzymatically-digested serum samples of EBOV-infected hosts. Notably, the starting non-enzymatic digestion step of this assay is used to both inactivate live EBOV particles and to site- specifically digest all serum proteins for subsequent pSiND-MS analysis. We have observed that VP40 peptides are increased in the plasma of infected animals even before EBOV RNA is detectable with currently available diagnostic assays. We have identified EBOV- and EBOV-species-specific VP40 peptides, and hypothesize that multiplex detection of our two selected VP40 peptides will robustly indicate EVD, EBOV species and EBOV load in potentially-infected individuals. We will thus apply pSiND-MS to quantify low-abundance VP40 peptides for early diagnosis of EBOV using a rapid, single-test assay, where we propose to: 1) optimize the pSiND-MS platform for detection of these biomarkers and 2) apply pSiND-MS to longitudinally quantify VP40 levels in sera from EBOV-infected non-human primates at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, to produce an informative preclinical EBOV-detection profile. Major advantages of our approach include the simplicity and safety of sample preparation; the use of matrix- assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS equipment found in most hospitals and laboratories (and future use of simplified, miniaturized MS systems); the potential to read the assay on MS/MS instruments for marker sequence confirmation; the specificity and sensitivity of biomarker detection; the use of rapidly-customizable, modular multiplex assay; and rapid diagnosis (2hrs from sample). These characteristics are ideal for a point-of-need application. Successful completion of this proposal will provide a novel technology that can overcome significant hurdles of current diagnostic methodologies for Ebola and other infectious agents, potentially transforming the protocols for care, treatment, and containment of future epidemics."
"9396467","Project Summary Age-related cognitive impairment in racial and ethnic minorities is one of the most important public health issues in the US. The number of adults aged sixty-five and older is expected to double in the next four decades, and the proportion of Hispanic/Latino or non-Hispanic black older adults is also expected to increase rapidly. Hispanics/Latinos and non-Hispanic blacks have a greater risk of cognitive impairment compared to non-Hispanic whites, which could be due to a greater burden of vascular risk factors in these groups. Vascular risk factors may influence macro- and microstructural WM integrity, which may in turn damage gray matter (GM) integrity and lead to cognitive impairment. Though global metrics of WM integrity, such as white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), have been associated with cognition extensively, growing evidence suggests that WMHV does not reflect the full extent of WM disease. Recent studies propose that a penumbra of WM damage exists outside of WMH and is better reflected by metrics of microstructural WM integrity. Despite these findings, the relationships between macro- and microstructural WM integrity, GM integrity, and cognition are not well understood in Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic black populations with a greater vascular risk factor burden and increased risk for cerebrovascular and cognitive disease as compared to Caucasians. In this proposed study, I will investigate the associations between macro- and microstructural WM integrity, GM integrity, and cognition in the mostly Hispanic/Latino, clinically stroke-free Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS). The central hypotheses are that MRI-derived, region-specific metrics of macro- and microstructural WM integrity predict cognitive performance, and region-specific metrics of GM integrity partially mediate this association. I also hypothesize that metrics of microstructural WM integrity will associate with cognition independently from and more robustly than metrics of macrostructural WM integrity. Results from this proposed study will provide evidence for potential targets for intervention in these at-risk populations. These study aims support key goals of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Strategic Plan, including: a) investment across the full spectrum of basic, translational, and clinical research; b) promotion of clinical research; and c) establishment of a data-driven process to identify unmet scientific opportunities and public health need within and across neurological disease. The proposed research also addresses the NIH BRAIN Initiative by exploring brain networks through MRI metrics of WM integrity."
"9309092","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adult CNS can adapt to and compensate for deficits in neurologic function after CNS injury or neurodegenerative disease, an effect that contributes to typically less severe clinical symptoms than the magnitude of neuronal damage. Microglia, CNS resident immune cells, play fundamental roles in brain health and disease and are essential neuron partners, but little is understood about how their activities contribute to endogenous mechanisms of CNS repair and adaptation to a chronic neuroinflammatory insult. Here we focus on the mechanisms that control microglial transition from the pro-inflammatory to the anti- inflammatory/neurosupportive phenotype over the course of a chronic disease that affects millions of Americans. We will use exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a hallmark of sleep apnea that causes significant cognitive and learning impairments in humans and animal models, and that is experienced in more than half of patients with other neurological diseases and injuries. We have identified two primary phases of CIH neuropathology, an acute pro-inflammatory phase that coincides with hippocampal neuron loss and impaired hippocampal plasticity (long-term potentiation; LTP), and a late phase in which microglia produce neurotrophic factors and neurocognitive behaviors partially recover. Our data suggest that the signaling activities of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an innate immune receptor that is most often associated with pro- inflammatory microglial responses, may contribute to the beneficial effects of microglia late in CIH pathology. We find TLR4-dependent upregulation of an anti-inflammatory microRNA during CIH that functions to suppress the pro-inflammatory activities of the canonical MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling pathway. TLR4 signaling also promotes BDNF production which is required for hippocampal LTP and neuron survival, and we find that microglial BDNF expression temporally mirrors early hippocampal LTP loss and later recovery of learning during CIH. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that early pro-inflammatory TLR4 signaling is later repressed by TLR4-dependent miRNAs that ultimately promote microglial transition to the neurotrophic phenotype, helping to limit neuronal damage and support recovery of hippocampal neuroplasticity during continued CIH pathology. Four specific aims will be pursued using the shared power of genetic/biochemical studies in transgenic mice, multi-color flow cytometry, and hippocampal slice electrophysiology. The aims will test the role of TLR4 and its signaling pathways in orchestrating the beneficial effects of microglia, as well as the requirement for microglial BDNF in limiting neuronal loss and recovering hippocampal plasticity in the late phase of CIH. Results from these studies will identify mechanisms by which microglia adapt to enduring neuroinflammatory disease to limit injury and help promote recovery of neuronal function. Mechanisms identified here may be harnessed for therapeutic benefit to enhance ongoing, endogenous neural repair mechanisms for many disorders in which intermittent hypoxia and/or microglia play a role."
"9395743","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI-D) is one of the most serious complications for hospitalized patients. Renal recovery after AKI-D ? defined as return of sufficient native kidney function to come off dialysis ? is a critically important clinical and patient-oriented outcome. However, we currently have limited ability to predict recovery in an individual AKI-D patient, and there are no interventions proven to improve the likelihood of recovery. Our overall goal is to improve outcomes in patients with AKI-D. We propose to develop and validate a clinical prediction model for recovery after AKI-D using an established database from a large integrated health-care delivery system. Guided by our prediction model, we will also conduct a small, single-center pilot randomized controlled trial among AKI-D patients with a reasonable chance of recovery to test the feasibility and safety of a conservative dialysis strategy, in which dialysis is not continued unless specific metabolic or clinical indications for dialysis are present. We hypothesize that, compared to the conventional practice of thrice-weekly dialysis, a conservative dialysis strategy will reduce the number of acute hemodialysis sessions needed and improve the likelihood of renal recovery. This pilot study will play several key roles in the design of a larger future trial by identifying potential barriers to recruitment and affording the opportunity to optimize intervention delivery. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. To derive a clinical prediction model to predict the chances of renal recovery after AKI-D by 90 days after initiation of renal replacement therapy. Aim 2. Among AKI-D patients classified as having >30% chance of recovery, to determine the feasibility/safety of and adherence to a strategy of conservative dialysis strategy in a single-center pilot randomized clinical trial (n=20)."
"9346604","Summary We believe that our project is responsive to the HLS16-02 Small Business Topic of Special Interest for NHLBI Fiscal Year 2016. Here, we will develop commercialization-ready advanced functional imager to assess red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. We successfully finished Phase I by developing the device?s prototype and testing its functionality in the proof-of-principle experiments in scattering phantom and two dorsal window mice models. In Phase II of the project the device will be verified with established functional microscopy in the dorsal window animal model, next the RBC transfusion microcirculation endpoint markers will be correlated with established organ wellness markers in the cranial window mouse model and finally the design and software of the clinically-ready imager will be finalized in a small study of volunteers. The key features of the imager are the ability to quantify local microcirculation parameters including tissue oxygen supply and consumption with a handheld probe for easy tissue access. Our market research and analysis indicates a strong demand for such instrument to help physicians effectively perform RBC transfusion, which is the most common inpatient hospital procedure. We estimate that our device can save annually up to $300 million in health care costs in the US.  Currently there are no defined markers of the RBC transfusion efficiency evaluation, except the hemoglobin and hematocrit level, which do not address function. Conventional optimization of macrocirculatory (arterial blood pressure, cardiac output etc.) and tissue perfusion (acidosis, lactate, venous O2 saturation (SvO2), organ function etc.) parameters do not demonstrate beneficial results. We hypothesize that the microcirculation, including capillary density, blood oxygenation, flow and oxygen extraction in arterioles and venules with diameters of 20-100 µm, can provide crucial endpoints for optimization of the RBC transfusion. To reduce the risk of infection or injury in vulnerable patients and to minimize number of blood draws, a non-invasive microcirculation assessment, if validated, would be highly preferred over invasive or minimally invasive methods. We believe our approach provides the needed performance to solve a critical problem and a clear path to successful commercialization.  This project will have strong social impact by providing crucial clinical information to improve patient outcomes. Quantitative imaging of local tissue oxygen delivery and consumption will not only improve outcomes with RBC transfusion but has great potential to decrease morbidity and mortality in many devastating diseases with vascular etiology including a variety of malignant, inflammatory, ischemic, infectious and immune disorders."
"9301653","Abstract Disorders of social behavior and communication are increasingly prevalent and pose a substantial burden to society. These disorders often show sex differences in prevalence, expression and severity. One explanation for these differences reflects dysfunction in the sexually different social brain. A particularly relevant neuropeptide system in this respect is the vasopressin (AVP) innervation of the brain, which shows marked sex differences across many species, including humans, and which has been implicated in both aggressive and affiliation behavior. AVP fibers are prominent in most areas of the social brain and many of these originate from cells within the posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). However, so far no studies have directly targeted these cells to test their role in social behavior. Here we do so using viral vector technology to test the overarching hypothesis that these BNST AVP cells promote male-typical affiliation and that they do so by receiving direct social sensory and arousal/reward-related modulatory input. We will test this hypothesis across two specific aims using a multi-disciplinary approach: (i) does removal of BNST AVP cells eliminate prosocial communication in male, but not female, mice? (ii) does viral-vector tracing of monosynaptic connections to BNST-AVP cells reveal sensory and modulatory inputs? The answer to these novel research questions will uncover a fundamental mechanism by which the brain regulates sexually-differentiated social communication, and will contribute to identifying causes of, and treatments for, disorders of social communication."
"9356488","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT By discovering the strategies that animals normally use to renew and regenerate their tissues, we can lay a foundation for regenerative approaches in humans. One of the principal long-term goals of my laboratory is to understand mammalian renewal and regeneration by integrating developmental and evolutionary perspectives. To do this, we are using the dentition as a model and are taking advantage of a remarkable property that is found in diverse mammalian species, which is the ability to grow teeth continuously based on the presence of adult stem cells. Despite initial progress, many gaps and challenges in our knowledge remain. We are still in the early stages of understanding how dental stem cells in the incisor epithelium behave, and we know very little about the mesenchymal stem cells. We also have a great deal to learn about how dental stem cells evolved and how they arise in the embryo during development. The overall scope of the research program proposed here will be to contend with these fundamental questions: How do adult stem cells enable the organ to renew? How do the stem cells in teeth respond to environmental influences such as hibernation and force? How did stem cells emerge during evolution of the mammalian dentition? How do progenitor cells in the embryo provide the starting materials for tooth development? Can we target tooth progenitors to cure disease? The impact of our work will be to provide a solid basic science foundation for future regenerative approaches by obtaining deep insight into a system of natural mammalian dental renewal."
"9314587","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Teens' increased freedom to explore different environments potentially increases exposure to contextual risks such as social disorganization. Socially disorganized areas, in which residents have difficulty maintaining social and physical order, are related to increased teen ATOD use/delinquency. Alcohol outlets, indicators of disorganization, influence teen alcohol use through increased access and perceptions of alcohol use as normative. In addition, contextual resources such as collective efficacy, a resource based on social ties among neighbors and their willingness to intervene for the good of the neighborhood may protect against teen risk behavior. Prior studies have not considered context dynamically, instead focusing on a static area, typically administrative units (e.g., census tracts around the teen's home as the area of environmental influence. However, these units may not capture contextual risks/resources where teens spend time, potentially missing a key influence on ATOD use/delinquency. By instead measuring all the places teens spend time, termed here dynamic context, we will address this gap in past research. The aims of the study are to: 1) Test whether teens' dynamic context includes different geographical areas and reflects greater levels of social disorganization and lower levels of collective efficacy than their residential context; 2) Test whether teens' dynamic contexts broaden and shift to areas of greater social disorganization and fewer contextual resources as they progress into older adolescence; and 3) Test whether: a) increases in exposure to social disorganization and decreases in exposure to collective efficacy in the dynamic context contribute independently to increases in ATOD/delinquency throughout adolescence; and b) these changes in exposure in the dynamic context are more predictive of teen risk behaviors than social disorganization/collective efficacy in the residential space, controlling for covariates. 325 14-16 year olds will be tracked for one month over 3 annual waves. GPS-enabled smartphones will be used to measure teen travel patterns to delineate teens' dynamic contexts, and allow measures of disorganization and collective efficacy to be appended to location points, thus quantifying exposure to contextual influences. Using the phones will also allow ecological momentary assessment (EMA) through text-prompted web surveys to assess ATOD use/delinquency to determine how these behaviors assessed in real-time are linked to exposure to disorganization and collective efficacy. The study will build on an ongoing funded grant that provides an existing sampling frame and archival contextual data. The proposed study expands traditional views of contextual influences by using a novel GPS- EMA integrated approach to examine the importance of considering exposures where teens spend time, as these may be more relevant for risk behaviors. This must be understood in order to inform prevention efforts/policy. This study could guide future prevention efforts that use the phones to deliver prevention messages proximal to risk behaviors by identifying precursors of risk behavior through teens' travel patterns."
"9223984","PROJECT SUMMARY This application to NHLBI Clinical Trial Pilot Studies describes a pilot clinical study to evaluate the combination of rosuvastatin with enoxaparin in order to prevent venous thrombosis following ovarian cancer surgery. Venous thromboembolism is a leading cause of preventable post-surgical mortality. Ovarian cancer patients are at a particularly high risk for thrombosis following surgery with rates that exceed 10% despite receiving recommended thromboprophylaxis. Rosuvastatin has been shown to prevent venous thrombosis but has not been prospectively evaluated in cancer patients. Elevated numbers of circulating procoagulant microparticles are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis in cancer patients and there is evidence that statins effectively decrease the generation of these procoagulant microparticles. We propose a pilot trial in women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer where women will be randomized to receive enoxaparin alone or enoxaparin in combination with rosuvastatin for 60 days. The specific aims of this pilot study are focused on establishing reliable point estimates for the cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolism at day 60 following ovarian cancer surgery, evaluating trial feasibility, and optimizing recruitment across multiple sites. The correlative aims of the proposal focus on innovative approaches towards investigating the mechanistic, prognostic, and diagnostic significance of microparticles in ovarian cancer. Collectively, these data will enable the conduct of the first phase III clinical trial to evaluate the antithrombotic efficacy of a statin in a high risk cancer population."
"9302805","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The germ line is the tissue that generates gametes. It is of tremendous practical and scholarly significance. It may be the ultimate source of stem cells for tissue replacement, and it impacts issues of fertility and reproduction. Therefore, germline biology is crucial for medicine, agriculture, and society. Recent major advances derive from both plant and animal studies including vertebrates and invertebrates. It is therefore critical that researchers from diverse arenas be brought together to share their discoveries.  This proposal seeks support for the ninth, tenth and eleventh of a biennial series of meetings held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that is the premiere meeting for this field. The 2014 Germ Cells meeting will be held from October 7-11 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. We expect to ~250-300 participants from around the world. There are no competing similar forums for all aspects of germ cell research.  Broad topics for platform presentations include Germline Evolution, Sex Determination, Germline Stem Cells, Meiosis, Epigenetics, Environment and Hormones, and Post-Transcriptional Control. Each session will be co-chaired by two experts in the field who are also invited speakers. Most speakers will be selected from submitted abstracts, including many young scientists. Ample opportunity for informal interactions will also be ensured."

"9352847","ABSTRACT Our laboratory recently discovered that postnatal human epidermal keratinocytes (KC) could be reprogrammed into a neural crest (NC) fate without genetic introduction of transcription factors or reprogramming to the pluripotent state. The KC-derived NC (KC-NC) could be coaxed to differentiate into all functional NC derivatives including peripheral neurons, melanocytes, Schwann cells and mesenchymal stem cell derivatives (osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells). Upon transplantation into chicken embryos, KC-NC migrated along stereotypical pathways and gave rise to multiple NC derivatives. Here we propose to extend our findings to adult epidermal keratinocytes, provide mechanistic understanding of the NC reprograming process, and demonstrate the use of KC-NC derived Schwann cells for treatment of demyelinating disease. In aim 1, we will determine whether human adult epidermal keratinocytes can be reprogrammed into neural crest stem cells under defined conditions. Aim 2 will study the mechanism of KC reprogramming into NC fate. In aim 3, we will develop a highly efficient strategy to differentiate KC-NC into Schwann cells. The KC-NC Schwann cells will be employed for the treatment of demyelinating disease using a mouse model of congenital hypomyelinating disease that has become the gold standard for the assessment of myelinating cell preparations. This work represents a paradigm shift in stem cell biology as it demonstrates the plasticity of human epidermal cells to be reprogrammed into cells of common developmental origin ? both originate from the ectoderm - without genetic modification and under defined culture conditions. Finally, our work has the potential to provide a novel source of abundant, readily accessible, autologous stem cells for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, for which cell sourcing remains a severe impediment hampering cell therapy approaches.  "
"9370942","This proposal describes a 5-year training program designed to enable the applicant to develop an independent research career in the field of lymphoma biology and experimental therapeutics. The applicant is a pediatric oncologist at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) who is committed to an academic career studying disease mechanisms in lymphoma and exploiting these mechanisms to develop novel therapies. Her current research focuses on targeting the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in B-cell lymphoma. The candidate?s immediate career goals are to gain further training in experimental design and develop expertise in epigenomics. Her long-term career goals are to establish independent laboratory space, lead a team of researchers, and make scientific contributions that allow her develop into a national/international leader in the field. To enable these goals this proposal outlines the following career development objectives: 1) formal training in experimental design, drug development, and statistical genomics; 2) coursework in epigenetic dysregulation, 3) regular meetings with an advisory committee composed of distinguished clinicians, scientists, and institutional leaders; 4) formal and informal professional development in leadership, management skills, public speaking and grantsmanship. The applicant?s mentors, Dr. Ethel Cesarman and Dr. Ari Melnick, are both tenured professors at WCMC and are international leaders in the study of viral-related lymphomas and epigenetic mechanisms in lymphoma respectively. Dr. Cesarman and Dr. Melnick have an extensive track record of collaboration including multiple joint grant awards and joint mentorship of trainees. The research proposal focuses on the rational translation of EZH2 targeted therapy in germinal center (GC) B-cell lymphomas. GC B-cell lymphomas are aggressive tumors that occur in pediatrics and adults. Relapsed/refractory disease represents an unmet need with most treatments failing to induce durable remissions. GC B-cell lymphomas are dependent on EZH2 which is a lineage factor for germinal center B-cells. EZH2 may play a unique role in EBV+ lymphoma where it contributes to restricted EBV viral latency that allows immune evasion. Small molecule inhibitors of EZH2 are currently in clinical development, including GSK126, which is being studied in a phase I trial that the applicant is conducting in collaboration with GSK. The unique mechanism and time course of epigenetic therapy requires careful consideration for effective clinical deployment. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a rational approach for the clinical use of EZH2i in lymphoma. The specific aims are 1) Define the epigenetic and transcriptional background of lymphomas that respond to EZH2 inhibition (EZH2i); 2) Determine the kinetics of response to EZH2i and the point of maximum vulnerability to combination therapy; 3) Determine the impact of EZH2i on the vulnerability of EBV + lymphomas to immune mediated therapy. Overall this proposal will accomplish the rational evolution and deployment of a new class of therapeutic agents in lymphoma. This work will be the basis of future clinical trials, which the applicant will be positioned to lead."

"9367698","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT People tend to falsely assume that the more unintelligible a child?s speech is, the more cognitively impaired that child is. However, intelligibility is not strongly correlated with intellect. In fact, many children with profound speech impairments have cognitive abilities that far exceed their speech abilities. Unfortunately, this false assumption leads to a series of negative social, educational, health, quality of life, and eventual employment outcomes ? outcomes that are all too common for the 1 in 100-125 people in the U.S. with such severe speech disabilities that they require augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). If children could use AAC to ?speak? in sentences, this would transform expectations and outcomes. Two gaps in knowledge prevent preliterate children from producing sentences via AAC: (1) data-based interventions have focused almost exclusively on basic social and vocabulary skills - not sentence-building skills; and (2) the AAC apps on iPads and other mobile technologies are too complex. Preliterate children spend precious cognitive resources searching for picture symbols instead of building sentences. The result is that they ?speak? using single words in most cases, despite an underlying ability to produce full sentences. Therefore, a critical need exists to develop data-driven interventions that support AAC sentence-building while minimizing the learning demands of current technologies. Failure to conduct this research will result in preschoolers with severe speech impairments continuing to experience a lifetime of underachievement and poor quality of life. The long-term goal for this line of research is to identify AAC interventions that enable children to become fully competent communicators as early in life as possible, thereby gaining access to a wealth of opportunities. The focus of the current proposal is to compare the effectiveness of the AAC Generative Language Intervention approach to an AAC Standard of Care condition on preschool sentence productions. All children will use existing AAC iPad applications. The central hypothesis is that preschoolers receiving AAC Generative Language Intervention will create longer, more grammatically complete sentences compared with the Standard of Care condition. Specific Aim 1 compares these interventions for preschoolers with severe speech impairments and typical receptive language, and Specific Aim 2 does the same for children with Down syndrome. Specific Aim 3 tests for possible moderation of the intervention effect by age, dynamic assessment scores, sentence type, receptive language abilities, prior AAC use, sex, mental age, and disability. Aims 1 and 2 will be accomplished using randomized controlled trials. Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to examine interactions for Aim 3. The achievement of the aims will have a broad impact on early sentence development and long-term quality of life for children who use AAC. This work will chart a new horizon of AAC research to create data-based interventions that capitalize on the availability of current technologies, simplify existing AAC apps, and promote early sentence productions, with the goal of mirroring the language skills and quality of life outcomes of peers."
"9296101","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A recent appellate court ruling has vacated the FDA's Final Rule that implemented the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FTA) requirement of graphic warning labels (GWLs) on cigarette packs. According to the FTA, the GWLs are to include one of nine mandatory textual warnings and a picture illustrating the negative health effects of smoking. The court decided that the GWLs selected by the FDA infringed on the tobacco company plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. The court opined that FDA's evidence of effectiveness of GWLs in general and GWLs producing strong emotional arousal in particular was insufficient to justify the infringement. Specifically, the court noted te lack of data supporting the effectiveness of GWLs in reducing actual smoking. The ruling highlights the limitations of existing data on GWLs that have been obtained predominantly through large-scale surveys using self-report outcome measures. In addition, the ruling has touched on a more basic controversy on the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of strongly salient format and content in persuasive health communications. This project will take a unique trans- disciplinary approach to address this issue from both a clinical and neurophysiological perspective. We shall  use biochemical (urine cotinine levels) and neuroimaging (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, fMRI)  assays, as well as traditional measures of persuasion, to compare the brain and bio-behavioral (urine cotinine)  impact of GWLs that were rated high or low on the emotional response (ER) scale, used by the FDA to select  GWLs for its Final Rule. We shall study 150 non-treatment seeking smokers' brain response to GWLs and  monitor their urine cotinine levels, before and after a 4-week long exposure to real-life cigarette packs carrying  High or Low ER GWLs. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that smokers exposed to high ER  GWLs will exhibit larger reductions in UC than those exposed to low ER GWLs. Based on our preliminary data  and prior literature pointing to the mPFC and the amygdala as key opponent brain regions mediating the brain  response to audio-visual anti-smoking ads, we hypothesize that acute exposure to high ER GWLs will be  associated with higher amygdala and mPFC response than low ER GWLs. In addition, we predict that the amygdala response to GWLs will decline after 4-week long naturalistic exposure to GWLs, while mPFC response will increase, with both effects more prominent in the High ER group. Secondary hypotheses will  evaluate the predictive value of acute mPFC response on urine cotinine levels change, as well changes in  cigarette craving, daily intake, and brain fMRI response to visual cigarette cues prior to and after the 4-week  exposure period. By applying measures of brain (fMRI), behavior (cotinine levels), persuasion and motivation (attitudes and intentions towards smoking quitting) to a cohort of smokers exposed to different affective levels of GWLs in a real-life setting, the project will provide integrated results that would complement existing population-level data and inform science-driven regulation of cigarette packaging that balances constitutional law and public health interest."
"9249450","Project Summary Project 3 investigates the central theme of this program project grant (PPG), sympathetic nervous system (SNS) control of bone metabolism, by using a novel mouse model in Aim 1 to define the contribution of increased ?-adrenergic receptor (?-AR) signaling to bone loss following estrogen (E) deficiency. Using microneurography, we found (see Project 1) that postmenopausal women have markedly increased sympathetic outflow as compared to premenopausal women. Moreover, in Project 3, we demonstrate that E treatment in vitro or E replacement in postmenopausal women markedly reduces ?2-AR expression in osteoblastic cells, suggesting that E may modulate ?-AR signaling in bone. Combined with previous studies indicating that, in mice, ?2-ARs are the principal mediators of SNS effects on bone, these findings lead to our hypothesis in Aim 1 that E deficiency results in enhanced SNS signaling in bone and that ?2-AR deletion in osteoblast lineage cells in adult mice at the time of ovariectomy (ovx) will prevent, or at least attenuate, ovx- induced bone loss. In Aims 2 and 3, Project 3 will better define E effects on bone metabolism beyond the interactions with SNS signaling being studied in Aim 1. For this, we will build on discoveries made previously in this PPG and will use novel mouse models that we have developed and validated. Thus, while skeleton is one of the main targets of E action, there are major gaps in our fundamental knowledge regarding E action on bone. First, all murine models of estrogen receptor (ER) action in mice have utilized deletions from conception onward, making it impossible to distinguish the effects of E on skeletal development from those on regulation of the adult skeleton or on age-related bone loss. We have developed and extensively validated a Cre- inducible system for deletion of ERs in the adult mouse. Our preliminary data using this system demonstrates that loss of ER? in adult mice has no effect on bone mass, whereas the uterus appears similar to an ovx d mouse. This suggests that in the complete absence of ER?, ER? may be compensating for the loss of ER? in bone. We will test this hypothesis in Aim 2, where we will determine if, in the absence of ER?, ER? compensates for loss of ER? in bone in adult mice. A second, major unresolved question is which cell type is most crucial for triggering bone loss when E is withdrawn in the adult mouse (or human)? This is a very different question from that addressed by current mouse knock out (KO) models which utilize osteoblast-, osteoclast-, or osteocyte-specific ER? deletion from conception onwards. Thus, while ER? deletion during skeletal development in each of these cell types affects bone mass and structure, none of these models address the issue of which cell type is most important for triggering bone loss following E deficiency in the adult animal. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that this crucial cell is the osteocyte, and that deletion of both ER? and ER? in the osteocyte will be necessary to trigger bone loss in the adult mouse and to mimic the effects of ovx."
"9241971","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cyanobacteria are among the most ancient organisms on Earth and have evolved chemical weapons for defensive purposes, which we are exploiting for anticancer drug discovery. Our past research has exemplified that marine cyanobacteria contain compounds with exceptionally potent activity and/or possess unusual or first-in-class inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action. However, cyanobacteria are also notorious for producing toxins detrimental to human health and other general cytotoxins. Our proposal addresses main issues in natural products drug discovery, including appropriate sample selection and prioritization for those compounds with promising therapeutic potential and cancer selectivity through innovative dereplication strategies and unique complementary in vitro cellular and in vivo organismal assay sets directed towards key cancer-related pathways. Targeted pathways are related to growth factor receptor activity and angiogenesis, resistance and metastasis, all of which are major areas of concern in cancer research. We have developed new chemical, biochemical and genetic tools to specifically probe novel mechanisms of action that we recently discovered and to identify modulators of these pathways. First, we will carry out field collections of marine cyanobacteria and will subject their extracts to taxonomy- and LC-MS/MS based dereplication strategies in combination with cytotoxicity assays. Prioritized cyanobacteria will be cultured and fraction libraries generated. Second, we will implement a rational screening strategy for selective cytotoxins by assessing differential cytotoxicity of fraction libraries using various suitable human cell-based models. Specifically, we will screen for agents with selective activity against colon cancer cells over the corresponding normal cells, in a mechanistically-unbiased approach. More targeted, we will screen for antiangiogenic agents that exert their activity through a mechanism we recently validated, involving simultaneous downregulation of receptors and growth factors. Through the use of our newly created unique isogenic screening system we then aim to discover novel dual inhibitors of the transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2, which have promise for combination therapy with anti-angiogenic agents. Prioritized fractions will be subjected to bioassay-guided isolation and structures will be determined. Third, we have discovered and characterized a novel mechanism to prevent metastasis and developed suitable zebrafish in vivo models to screen for anti-invasive agents that modulate tumor suppressor E-cadherin expression and localization to the cell membrane when applied as single agents or in combination with a synergizing cyanobacterial compound we already discovered. Anti-invasive properties of compounds will be assessed in a new zebrafish tumor model at the single-cell level by monitoring cell dissemination, invasion and metastasis. Fourth, we will mechanistically characterize the identified selective agents to pinpoint the molecular changes induced in the cancer cell and to determine potential direct targets."
"9309099","?    DESCRIPTION:   The sizes of tissues and organs are specified with great precision, a fact we notice in the symmetry of bilateral structures (such as limbs), and the degree to which genetically identical individuals resemble each other. Not only do tissues and organs reach specific sizes, they do so in the face of cell killing or alterations to cell cycle kinetics, which suggests a feedback control mechanism. Work from our group on continually- renewing tissues has identified a general integral negative feedback strategy, whereby negative regulation of stem or progenitor cell renewal automatically achieves robust set-point control. Such feedback may be conveyed by diffusible growth factors-as we and others showed in the olfactory epithelium (OE), retina, and muscle-but a variety of molecules and mechanisms could act similarly. Regardless of mechanism, however, the ability of local feedback to control proliferation is subject to distance limitations: molecular and mechanical signals decay over characteristic length scales. The fact that such scales are often very short-on the order of 100 µm or less-raises questions about how local feedback could possibly control the sizes of tissues and organs that are three or four orders of magnitude larger.  Here we address this issue through a combination of mathematical modeling and animal experimentation. Preliminary modeling has identified several strategies that could, in principle, enable large sizes to be controlled through short-range feedback. These strategies exploit the fact that controlling developmental tissue and organ growth is not a steady-state problem, but one of controlling a self-terminating trajectory. By considering a variety of possible cell lineage relationships and types of feedback interactions-all of which are motivated by observations in actual developing systems-we will use modeling and simulation to systematically discover the design principles out of which strategies for feedback control of large tissues and organs may be constructed. Subsequently, we will computationally test the hypothesis that the best way to distinguish experimentally among different potential growth-control strategies is by transiently ablating defined proportions of cells at specific lineage stages, and observing the consequences for final tissue size. Finally, we will perform just such transient cell ablations to investigate the development of three neural structures-the olfactory epithelium, the neural retina, and the cerebral neocortex-in mice, with the goal of identifying the strategies these tissues use for size control in different dimensions. This work will provide both basic insights into fundamental processes of development, and specific insights into size control in the nervous system. The results will be of direct relevance o the etiology of microcephaly and other birth defects, as well as to clinical phenomena of stunting, catch-up growth, and growth-asymmetry."
"9341529","PROJECT SUMMARY  Hearing loss, innate and acquired, occurs in over 37.5 million Americans and globally in over 360 million people. To compensate, many with hearing impairment rely on the combination of audio information and visual cues from the face, cheeks, nose and eyes to facilitate speech understanding. In healthcare settings, this important visual communication is severely hindered by the ubiquitously used surgical facemask, which covers the nose, mouth, cheeks and chin. This leads to a breakdown in communication that can increase the risk for miscommunication and medical errors.  A transparent surgical mask has the potential to improve speech understanding in patients with hearing loss and improve patient-caregiver communication for all individuals. Unfortunately, previous attempts have failed due to limitations in materials and design. The patented design of the FaceView MaskTM provides this transparency by utilizing a clear, anti-fog central panel. The mask also contains a silane-based antimicrobial on the outer fabric, allowing it to offer similar benefits as currently used surgical masks in addition to providing visual access to the face. A preliminary study has demonstrated that an early stage prototype of the FaceView MaskTM increased speech understanding in participants with differing degrees of hearing loss in the presence and absence of multi-talker babble.  The overall goal of this STTR Phase I project is to evaluate the potential of the FaceView MaskTM to improve speech understanding in subjects with hearing loss. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. In Aim 1, FaceView MaskTM prototypes will undergo biocompatibility testing in accordance with ISO 10993 (Part 1) guidelines including cytotoxicity, sensitization, and irritation testing. In Aim 2, Dr. Atcherson (Associate Professor in the Department of Audiology, University of Arkansas at Little Rock) will conduct human subjects research to assess the impact that the FaceView MaskTM has on speech understanding in normal hearing subjects and subjects with hearing impairment. In Aim 3, nurses and dental staff will assess comfort during daily use and healthcare personnel preference for the FaceView MaskTM in comparison to conventional paper masks. The conclusion of this Phase I work will allow for large, multi-site clinical trials in Phase II and further FDA-mandated characterization.  The FaceView MaskTM, an innovative transparent facemask, has the potential to enhance patient-caregiver communication and decrease dangerous medical errors, improving safety and the healthcare experience for millions of patients worldwide, especially for those who suffer hearing impairment."
"9323837","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The synapse is the principle active signaling component of the brain's neuronal circuitry. Synapses are highly complex, plastic, strongly modulated and deeply diverse entities, and their molecular complexity and diversity are fundamental to all synaptic circuit development and function. Moreover, many or most neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders are rooted in abnormalities of the brain's vast and highly heterogeneous synapse populations. Unfortunately, such disorders are poorly understood and difficult to diagnose, prevent, and treat because we lack adequate tools to measure the brain's vast and highly diverse synapse populations, and because most of the limited tools in use today can be applied only to experimental animals such as mice. An interdisciplinary consortium comprising neurobiologists, biophysicists, clinicians, mathematicians and computer scientists here proposes development of a very ambitious synaptomic analysis pipeline that will transform the science of synaptic network function and disorders in both experimental animal and human brains. This novel high-throughput pipeline, based on powerful new array tomography methods, will enable measurement, analysis, and modeling of heterogeneous synapse and neuromodulatory fiber populations with unprecedented precision. The synaptomic pipeline will be demonstrated initially by developing synaptomes to model the heterogeneous synapse populations of mouse and human frontal and temporal lobes. Pipeline resources and data will then be shared via an Open Synaptome Project that will facilitate the development of synaptomes describing synapse populations of additional brain regions and species. These efforts are expected to provide a new foundation for understanding the basic mechanisms of mammalian brain function, and to offer new quantitative perspectives on both similarities and differences between mouse and human brain that will be critical to leveraging animal research opportunities for the improvement of human mental health. Because abnormalities of synapses and their neuromodulation are prime suspects in numerous human mental health disorders, the development and sharing of synaptomic pipeline resources and data proposed here are likely to catalyze rapid progress in clinical neuroscience."
"9391732","This application is a part of the competitive renewal for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) in response to RFA-AA-17-012.  Pathological outcomes of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) stemming from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are devastating and highly variable, especially in regards to cognitive and learning deficits apparent in later life. Early intervention for such deficits is imperative for optimal outcomes; however, the pattern and magnitude of these deficits are not predictive even when accounting for the level of alcohol exposure, which by itself is difficult to accurately assess. Therefore, early, and precise biomarkers for predicting the risk of cognitive and behavior problems are crucial for establishing an effective treatment. This project aims at establishing a novel approach to identifying such biomarkers for predicting the risk of children afflicted with FASD. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that single-cell level epigenetic changes detectable in blood cell samples serve as biomarkers in predicting risks of cognitive and learning deficits before their symptomatic manifestations. By employing cutting-edge cellular droplet technology, we will test this hypothesis using the mouse model of PAE (Aim 1), and examine whether these biomarkers are applicable for human patients with a history of PAE (Aim 2). The Hashimoto-Torii lab will perform the single-cell droplet digital PCR- based biomarker analyses (drop-PCR) with both human and mouse blood samples. The Torii lab will collect the mouse blood samples, perform comprehensive mouse behavior analyses, and statistically evaluate potential correlations between the animal behaviors and drop-PCR results. The Chambers lab will collect the human blood samples, perform neurocognitive tests, and statistically evaluation of potential correlations between these test scores and the drop-PCR results.  This project will allow for critical assessment in linking biomarkers with comprehensive evaluations of neurocognitive deficits, brain structural abnormalities and facial dysmorphology. In addition, these studies maximize the potential our collaborations with other CIFASD research including the neurobehavioral (Chambers), genetic (Foroud) and dysmorphology core (Jones) projects. Cross-sectional approaches using controlled animal studies (Eberhart and Parnell) will provide essential mechanistic insights. Our identified biomarkers and those obtained through studies using cytokine (Chambers) and miRNA (Weinberg) panels generated for the same PAE patients will provide a rare opportunity to test this combined biomarker strategy for accurate prediction of PAE outcomes. By capitalizing on CIFASD infrastructure, this project will develop innovative single-cell biomarkers that impact FASD research and translational science at large."
"9297792","Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, can be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, an FDA panel has recently identified two remaining concerns about CTC: patient adherence, and the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. Our clinical multi-center trial showed that laxative-free preparation by oral ingestion of a contrast agent (iodine) to indicate fecal materials for electronic cleansing (EC), followed by computer-aided detection (CADe), makes CTC easy to tolerate for patients while enabling the detection of ?10 mm lesions at sensitivity comparable to that of optical colonoscopy. However, small polyps and flat lesions were a significant source of false negatives, because EC produced image artifacts that imitated such lesions. Because laxative-free CTC addresses the concern of patient adherence, the only remaining concern about CTC is the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. The goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-material deep-learning scheme, hereafter denoted as Deep- ECAD, that integrates EC and CADe for the detection of small polyps and flat lesions in laxative-free spectral CTC (spCTC), where spectral imaging and deep learning will be used to overcome the above limitations of conventional CTC. Our specific aims are to (1) establish a laxative-free ultra-low-dose spCTC image database, (2) develop a multi-material deep-learning method for EC, (3) develop deep radiomic detection of small polyps and flat lesions, and (4) evaluate the clinical benefit of Deep-ECAD with laxative-free cases. Successful development of the proposed Deep-ECAD scheme will substantially improve human readers? performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients. Such a scheme will make laxative-free spCTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, in particular, Medicare population, leading to an increased screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer."
"9425411","ABSTRACT The Mount Sinai Injury Control and Research Center (MS-ICRC) will continue, in the proposed funding period, to focus on ameliorating the secondary and tertiary conditions that occur after traumatic brain injury (TBI), to address two goals: (1) improving quality of life after TBI and (2) extending the life span of people injured after age 40. We have added an additional emphasis: reducing violence and criminal behavior in youth who are at high risk. The proposed Research Program of the MS-ICRC includes: (1) An investigation of the impact of a behavioral intervention on violence and recidivism amongst youth (with TBI and without) who are on parole. This study ?translates? an intervention we developed for an adult TBI population for use with adolescents at-risk for violence, and it comprises the first study of an intervention for young offenders with TBI. (2) A pilot prospective cohort study of individuals who sustained a TBI after age 40, to document health issues and other factors that may contribute to the accelerated aging and pre-mature death that has been documented in TBI survivors. (3) An analysis of a database developed by the Texas juvenile justice system to explore the relationship between TBI (and other health factors) and youth criminality, with a particular focus on violent offenses. This policy research follows extensive outreach by the MS-ICRC to the juvenile justice system in Texas that resulted in their decision to screen their population for TBI (using the MS-ICRC?s Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire [BISQ]). (4) The establishment of a longitudinal database of all college athletes at St. John?s University in New York City, to document at time of college admission lifetime history of concussion and to then prospectively document concussions sustained during college both on and off the field. Student-athletes will be followed to define the long-term consequences of concussions. This project will be fully manualized for replication in other institutions, to move toward the establishment of a national registry of college sports concussions. (5) A program of exploratory projects, to encourage other researchers to expand their work to address the MS- ICRC?s long-term goals. Together, Projects 1 and 3 have strong policy implications for developing system-wide interventions to identify children with TBI at the earliest point possible and for providing subsequent accommodations, i.e., systemic interventions to reduce violence and criminality in young offenders, or school- based interventions to prevent children with TBI from taking the path that often leads from untreated long-term challenges consequent to injury to criminal behavior, homelessness and other forms of social failure. The proposed Outreach Program addresses MS-ICRC goals by building on the output of our current activities (2007-2012) and by weaving the results of proposed activities into outreach, as new ?products? are developed and new implications for action emerge. Specifically, three interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy adapted to treat depression post TBI, and the Executive Plus and STEP treatment programs for post-TBI executive dysfunction) have been developed, evaluated and manualized. Planned outreach will focus on broad dissemination and support for adoption of these valuable additions to the TBI treatment arsenal. A second current focus is on screening for ?hidden? TBI, through further validation of the BISQ and its adaptation for web-based administration. Outreach in the next five years will stress wider dissemination of the BISQ to screen additional populations, with the goal of effecting changes in policy in schools and in other settings where screening is needed to identify individuals with brain-injury related challenges, so that accommodations can be provided to prevent failure associated with unrecognized injury. Another emphasis is being placed on working with marketing experts to better tailor MS-ICRC outreach to meet the needs of our several constituencies. A new element of MS-ICRC outreach will be a Policy Think Tank, to review evidence based on MS-ICRC research and from the established knowledge base, and then to detail means and strategies to achieve policy change; the first area will be establishing systematic screening for ?hidden? TBI. The Training and Education Program will continue to focus on supplying the field with qualified professional injury prevention practitioners and researchers, in the spirit of the training program established in 2007. Formal training will include a 2-year post-doctoral fellowship program and a 1-year pre-doctoral externship. In addition, we will educate service providers through webinars and workshops, symposia and lectures at professional conferences and institutions; we also provide numerous resources for professionals downloadable (gratis) on our website. Recommendations for curricula changes to be incorporated into programs for medical and other professional training will also be developed."
"9382968","Osteoarthritis is a debilitating condition associated with cartilage and joint dysfunction caused by trauma or aging that severely affects patients' quality of life resulting in a yearly burden of approximately 15 billion dollars on US healthcare. Cartilage regeneration is inherently inefficient and remains an unmet medical need that increases the propensity for development of arthritic conditions. Cell-based therapeutic approaches for repairing focal cartilage defects have utilized autologous adult chondrocytes or adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) but with limited success due to generation of inferior fibrocartilage and paucity of cells. An abundant autologous source like human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) is therefore attractive for engineering cartilage. Additionally, generation of developmentally `younger' chondrocytes from human iPSC akin to the neonatal or juvenile chondrocytes are expected to possess a higher regeneration potential than adult chondrocytes. The aim of this research proposal is therefore to generate iPSC and MSC from the same healthy or OA donor and comparing their potential for cartilage regeneration in vitro and in an osteochondral defect in a rat model. Towards this end, a major advance will be the generation of footprint-free human iPSC i.e. without the use of viral vectors that permanently integrate into the genome. Use of synthetic mRNA will allow generation of safe and clinically relevant hiPSC. Additionally, we have recently developed an efficient methodology to direct human iPSC (hiPSC) differentiation towards chondrocytes (or chondroprogenitor cells) using transient exposure to a series of growth factors. We will define molecular and functional characteristics of hiPSC- and hMSC-derived chondrocytes to relate with their functional capabilities. Secondly, we will optimize a biomimetic hydrogel scaffold for the maturation and implantation of human iPSC- and hMSC-derived chondrocytes. Thirdly, the potential of the human iPSC- and hMSC-derived chondrocytes to repair a focal cartilage defect will be tested in a rat model of surgically induced osteochondral defect along with long-term safety studies in mice. Collectively, these studies will help evaluate and provide a mechanistic understanding of whether a hiPSC-based cellular therapy will be superior to hMSC-based therapy and successful completion can provide the impetus to further develop a clinically applicable iPSC- based therapy for focal cartilage injury.  "
"9291482","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are at the foundation of spermatogenesis and may have application for treating some cases of male infertility. High dose chemotherapy treatments for cancer and other non-malignant conditions can cause azoospermia, which may be due to a depletion of the SSC pool. If that is the case and the testicular environment (SSC niche) is functionally intact, then SSC transplantation may constitute a cell based therapy for restoring fertility in male cancer survivors. Theoretically, SSCs can be isolated via biopsy and cryopreserved prior to cancer treatment and then reintroduced into the testis after cure to regenerate spermatogenesis. The proof in principle for this approach is already established in several animal models, including recent progress from our lab in primates. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that SSC transplantation might be translated to the human fertility clinic. This option may be particularly appropriate for prepubert boys who are not yet producing sperm and have no options to preserve their future fertility. With this in mind, several academic centers around the world, including our Fertility Preservation Program in Pittsburgh, are cryopreserving testicular tissues for boys in anticipation that SSCs can be used in the future to restore fertility. Pre-clinical studies are critically needed to demonstrate the feasibility of SSC transplantation in a model that is relevant to human anatomy and physiology as well as the target prepubertal patient population. In this application, we will treat prepubertal rhesus macaques with a clinically relevant high-dose alkylating chemotherapy regimen (BuCy2) that is expected to cause azoospermia. The SSC pool in nonhuman primate and human testes is comprised of Adark and Apale spermatogonia, but the relative regenerative potential of these morphologically distinct spermatogonial subtypes are not known. In Aim 1 we will evaluate and compare the stem cell properties of Adark and Apale spermatogonia, which will impact strategies to manipulate these cells for therapeutic purposes. Aims 2 will examine the effects of BuCy2 on the stem cell pool and somatic/endocrine environment (stem cell niche) of prepubertal testes. Aim 3 will model the clinical scenario of the prepubertal patient that is at high risk for azoospermia due to BuCy2 conditioning prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In that model, we will perform autologous SSC transplantation from frozen/thawed testicular cells. Fundamental knowledge generated in aims 1 and 2 could lead to novel SSC enrichment and niche therapy strategies that will be applied in Aim 3 to enhance spermatogenesis from endogenous or transplanted SSCs."
"9336827","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the proposed study is to conduct the first adequately powered prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) to determine whether combined auricular acupuncture and iRest(R) Yoga Nidra will lead to improved health-related functioning, reduced sleep disturbance and perceived stress in Gulf War-deployed Veterans with Gulf War Veterans' illnesses (GWVIs) compared to Gulf War Health Education. Using a multi-method approach, our interdisciplinary team of clinicians and researchers will test the primary hypothesis that, in Gulf War-deployed Veterans who reported at least 2 of 3 symptom types (fatigue, pain and mood/cognitive) for more than 6 months and at the time of screening, the complementary and alternative CAM treatment (combined auricular acupuncture and iRest(R) Yoga Nidra) will lead to greater improvements in physical health functioning, reductions in pain, fatigue, cognitive deficits and sleep disturbance than Gulf War Health Education. This study will also enhance our understanding of the real-world effects of CAM for these Veterans through the collection and analysis of in-depth interviews from Veterans. If successful, the results of this study would provide a scientific basis to expand the complementary treatments available to the significant number of Gulf War-deployed Veterans who suffer from GWVIs and for whom current medical treatments alone are not adequate. While the present study is targeted at the Gulf War cohort, results could also have significant impact on treatment for Veterans from all other eras as well."
"9276666","Summary Obesity perturbs metabolic homeostasis and has adverse effects on health. Obese patients have compromised immune function, increased risk for a hematological malignancy, and increased risk for non-relapse mortality following either autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Abnormalities in hematopoiesis occur in obese individuals and may underlie their compromised immune and hematopoietic functions. We propose to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie deregulated hematopoiesis in obese patients. The overall hypothesis to be investigated is that obesity perturbs metabolic homeostasis in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in compromised HSC function and hematopoiesis. Supporting this hypothesis is our recent finding that a nutrient sensor, whose activity is inversely regulated by nutritional input, regulates mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis to promote stress resistance in HSCs and promotes their self-renewal and hematopoiesis under stress. We plan to greatly expand this initial finding to systemically investigate how obesity affects HSC function and hematopoiesis.  "
"9420358","Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are serious and debilitating mental illnesses that incur substantial suffering for patients and major challenges to our health care system. The clinical high-risk (CHR) prodromal phase is the period prior to the onset of psychosis when clinical symptoms gradually emerge and function declines. The presence of a CHR syndrome in young adults is associated with heightened risk (~30%) for the later development of psychosis. The North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and other CHR studies have made substantial progress towards predicting psychosis, and in showing an accelerated reduction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) gray matter (GM) density in CHR converters from pre- to post-psychosis onset, but the mechanisms driving conversion remain elusive, partly because no studies include repeated measures prior to the onset of psychosis. In NAPLS2, we found that disrupted resting-state (rs) thalamocortical functional connectivity prior to psychosis predicts conversion and correlates with rate of GM decline, but we do not know if rs-dysconnectivity is progressive during the prodrome. Furthermore, in NAPLS2, plasma markers of pro-inflammatory cytokines at baseline predicted the rate of GM loss in converters; these same markers also correlated with rs-dysconnectivity. We do not yet know whether these inflammatory markers drive the changes in brain structure/function or are consequences of these changes. Similarly, higher levels of cortisol, and lower mismatch negativity predicted psychosis and the rate of PFC GM decline and were correlated with each other and with measures of rs-connectivity and cytokines. This proposal is a competitive renewal for a nine-site, longitudinal study aimed at identifying the brain processes underlying the progression of the clinical syndromes that characterize the psychosis prodrome. The goals are: 1) to determine the pre-onset trajectories of GM decline and disrupted resting-state brain connectivity in CHR individuals who develop psychosis using MRI, and 2) to identify inflammatory and plasticity mechanisms associated with transition to psychosis. Over a two-year period, the study will repeatedly measure these indicators, and at the same time examine changes in physiological indices of brain function, social and cognitive functioning, and symptom progression. The multi-site collaboration will follow large CHR (n= 378) and demographically matched comparison (n= 162) samples that will undergo comprehensive assessments of biological and behavioral changes. This approach will answer important questions about the origins of the brain changes that give rise to psychosis and will provide insights into likely approaches to halting or mitigating the pathological process and advance our understanding of risk prediction, both critical steps in prevention."
"9405815","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     In recent war-related conflicts, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a signature injury affecting a large percentage of the Veteran population. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, also referred to as concussion) accounts for approximately 70-80% of all TBI among returning Veterans as well as the civilian population. Although most overt symptoms of mTBI resolve spontaneously within days or weeks of the injury, in 10-20% of mTBI victims some functional deficits persist, with recent estimates suggesting that as many as 44-50% of mTBI patients experience three or more symptoms at one-year post-injury. Repetitive mTBI is of particular interest because military personnel often have several mTBI exposures over the course of their lives and possibly within single deployments. Recurrent brain injuries, even when mild, may interfere with neuropsychological recovery. Repeated concussion has also been associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive impairments of memory and cognition, as well as depression, anxiety, and motor abnormalities.  Among the proposed environmental risk factors of neurodegenerative disease, TBI, including mild TBI, is probably one of the most consistent candidates for initiating the molecular cascades and provoking neurodegeneration leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Consequently TBI has been shown to accelerate pathology and behavioral deficits in genetic models of AD or to enhance vulnerability to Parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxins. Recent evidence also identified TBI as an environmental risk factor of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), an early onset dementia associated in its behavioral variant with behavioral abnormalities, loss of sociability, or impulsive and irrational behavior.  Our preliminary studies show that mild repetitive impacts to the head of mice using a controlled impactor (closed head injury) result in gliosis, white matter changes, and cognitive deficits 3 months after injury. Separately, we showed that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), a key growth factor in the hematopoietic system, has prominent neuroprotective effects in acute brain injury when administered systemically after injury. These effects are mediated via CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) expressed at least in part by injured neurons. A newly discovered second ligand for this receptor, IL-34, seems to be equally or more potent than CSF1 in our model. Most importantly, for this proposal, preliminary studies show a remarkable recovery of memory impairment and reduced gliosis with a single bolus treatment of CSF1 after injury in our model of mTBI.  Based on these preliminary data we hypothesize that mild traumatic insults to the central nervous system lead to long-term neurobehavioral deficits in mice which model in part the deficits observed in human mTBI patients, and that systemic treatment with CSF1 and IL-34 will attenuate brain injury and related behavioral deficits even if given days or weeks after injury. In this application we propose to refine our model of mTBI and assess long-term pathological and cognitive changes in wildtype mice. We will expose mice to multiple repetitive cortical impacts that are days or weeks apart and study the longterm consequences of these injuries. Most importantly, we will treat such impaired mice with neuroregenerative protein therapies days, weeks or months after the initial traumatic impact occurred. After completion of the proposed studies we expect to have preclinical proof for efficacy of CSF1 and/or IL-34 in reducing pathology and alleviating symptoms in mouse models of mTBI. Since CSF1 is used clinically in humans our findings may find rapid translation to the clinic."
"9352238","The goal of this project is to understand how a mammalian organism initiates its multicellular development by completing its very first asymmetric cell divisions (ACD) - during meiotic maturation and fertilization of the oocyte. Meiotic ACD not only is critically important for successful fertilization and full developmental potential of the zygote, but also offers unique and fascinating insights into the mechanism of self-organization, a most fundamental property of biological systems. Recent studies from our lab and others using mouse oocytes as the model system have begun to unravel dynamic and bi-directional interplays between the chromosomes and the actin cytoskeleton in setting up oocyte cell polarity for ACD and potentially also for future embryonic development. In the proposed research, we plan to build on these exciting recent findings to answer three mechanistic questions: 1) how actin dynamics drive oocyte symmetry breaking (Aim1); 2) how the nuclear genome directly signals morphological reorganization on the cellular level (Aim2); and 3) how an unusual mechanism of dynamic force production patterns a large cell (the oocyte) and potentially impacts organelle segregation and early embryonic development (Aim3). To answer these questions, we will employ a highly innovative approach that entails a full integration of molecular genetic methods with cutting-edge imaging technologies, biophysical tools and mathematical analysis. Because clinical evidence suggests that defects in the polarized organization of mature oocytes are associated with aging-related infertility, our study not only has the potential for novel intellectual contribution to the understanding of self-organization in cellular systems but may also provide the basis for future development of new methods that help improve human fertility and prevent birth defects."
"9309990","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission of an Extramural/Intramural Alcohol Research Collaboration (U01) Application entitled Oxidized Metabolites of Linoleic Acid in Alcohol-induced Liver Injury. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains a major cause of chronic illness and death. Despite extensive investigation into ALD pathogenesis, the specific mechanisms responsible for development and progression are incompletely understood. Increased oxidative stress is a core abnormality responsible for liver injury in ALD. Based on our extensive preliminary findings we propose the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that oxidized linoleic acid (LA) metabolites (OXLAMs) generated via the 12/15-LO mediated pathway play a critical role in the development and progression of alcohol-mediated hepatic and intestinal injury. We have established a collaborative team with extensive expertise and unique resources that will allow us to accomplish our goals by using in vivo experimental animal models of ALD, in vitro cell culture models, and collaborating with the unique human populations of an ongoing NIAAA Clinical Center randomized trial on dietary linoleic acid (LA) reduction and an NIAAA sponsored U01 clinical trial on alcoholic hepatitis (AH). State-of-the-art technologies including Lipidomics (LC/ESI/MS/MS), Seahorse (to investigate mitochondria dysfunction), Cellomics (the high-throughput technique for cell image-acquisition and analysis) will be utilized in this proposal. FIRST, we will test the hypothesis that OXLAMs are specific mediators of liver damage and intestinal barrier disruption in ALD. We will establish the role of dietary LA and OXLAMs in the induction of hepatic steatosis/injury and intestinal hyper-permeability in murine models of ALD. SECOND, we will evaluate in in vitro systems potential mechanisms by which OXLAMs enhance ethanol-mediated liver damage and disruption of intestinal barrier integrity. We will determine the effect of OXLAMs and their interactions with alcohol on mitochondrial function in hepatocytes and integrity of tight junctions in intestinal epithelium. THIRD, we will evaluate the ability of controlled dietary lowering of LA in humans to reduce circulating OXLAMs, endotoxin/gut permeability, and liver steatosis/injury (NIAAA intramural RCT). We will test the hypothesis that, compared to a control diet containing 8 % of energy as LA, lowering LA to 1% of energy for 12 weeks will result in significant reductions in: liver steatosis assessed by 3T-MRI; OXLAM and LA content of plasma, circulating endotoxin, and serum CK-18 (total and fragmented) levels (two robust markers of hepatocyte injury). FINALLY, we will establish levels of OXLAMs in human Alcoholic Hepatitis and their relation to disease severity and mortality (NIAAA U01 program). This study will help to elucidate a novel biochemical pathway involved in the pathogenesis of ALD. The findings could provide novel targets for biomarkers and drug development, and could identify a potential nutritional strategy for ameliorating liver disease."

"9313132","Project Summary: The objectives of this pre-doctoral fellowship are twofold: first, to enhance the students training into an independent researcher in the field of neural development; and second, to investigate post-transcriptional regulation in radial glial cells during cortical development. Towards the first objective, we have designed a training plan to provide scientific and professional training for the applicant to achieve her goal of becoming a research scientist. This plan will be implemented under the guidance of sponsors with expertise in mouse cortical development and RNA biology. Towards the second objective, we will explore the role of asymmetric RNA localization in radial glial cells during cortical development. Precise regulation of radial glial cells is critical for generating a properly sized and organized brain, whereas dysregulation leads to malformations of the cerebral cortex, like microcephaly, and intellectual disabilities. Understanding the basic biology of radial glial cells will help advance our understanding of processes that go awry in neurodevelopmental disorders. The applicant will investigate regulation of radial glial cell function through the unique lens of RNA localization and local translation. This proposal will focus specifically on the mRNA of a critical mammalian brain size regulator ? Cyclin D2. Cyclin D2 is proposed to function in the nucleus to drive cell cycle progression. Surprisingly, its mRNA is localized to a distal subcellular compartment of radial glial cells (the basal endfoot) located hundreds of microns away from the nucleus. It remains unclear whether asymmetric localization of Cyclin D2 is critical for its function in radial glial cells. The primary goals of this proposal are to characterize the translational regulation and behavior of CyclinD2 protein in radial glial endfeet. To achieve these goals, the applicant will employ a combination of embryological manipulations, molecular RNA techniques, live confocal microscopy, and proteomics. Aim1 will elucidate extracellular signaling factors that influence translation in radial glial endfeet. Aim2 will characterize the behavior, including transport dynamics and protein interactions, of CyclinD2 in endfeet. These studies are important for advancing our limited knowledge of how the endfoot compartment influences radial glial functions during development. Further, we anticipate this work will uncover novel mechanisms of regulating radial glial cells through mRNA localization. Finally, this work will inform us of the role of CyclinD2 protein in endfeet, which may help to explain its influence over brain size."
"9122399","DESCRIPTION    Abstract:    Eighty to ninety percent of what most young children learn about the world comes through vision. The same cannot be said when we seek to learn about the inner workings of our own body, because light beyond skin deep becomes diffused due to multiple scattering. Instead, researchers have resorted to alternative means-such as X-ray, magnetic resonance, and ultrasound-to probe deep into the body. Until now, most advances in optical imaging have been geared towards high-resolution functional and molecular imaging at depths less than 1 mm in scattering tissue. The pursuit of deep-tissue optical imaging with high spatial resolution has been stymied by the inherent optical diffusion-the grand challenge since the inception of biomedical optics. We must meet this challenge to reach the full potential of light because it is such a powerful tool from both the physical and biological perspectives. Physically, the tiny fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum that light covers is the only part that probes molecular structures directly; biologically, the ability of molecules to sense, react to, and emit light is encoded on the most fundamental (i.e., genetic) level! In addition, light as nonionizing radiation is as safe to biological organisms as air and water. Therefore, light is the most natural choice fo visualizing biological structures and events, interrogating and controlling biological processes, as well as diagnosing and treating diseases, if only we could overcome the optical diffusion-a seemingly unbreakable barrier. While multiple scattering of light is treated as a problem in conventional wisdom, I believe that it should be part of the solution. Our recent work on time-reversed ultrasonically encoded (TRUE) optical focusing (Nature Photonics 2011) is a first breakthrough in this direction. TRUE focusing can noninvasively deliver light to a dynamically defined focus deep in a scattering medium. This invention opens the door to an even greater paradigm-shifti"
"9309052","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Molecular Biophysics Training Grant has nucleated the biophysics community on the UCSD campus for over 20 years. Our primary goal is to provide a rigorous, dynamic, and strongly interdisciplinary training program for graduate students from the Physical Sciences Departments of Chemistry/Biochemistry and Physics and the Health Sciences Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (SSPPS) and Pharmacology. Broad research opportunities are provided by 36 training faculty from the Physical Sciences Departments of Chemistry & Biochemistry (23 faculty) and Physics (3 faculty) and from the BMS graduate program SSPPS and Department of Pharmacology (7 faculty), and other Health Sciences departments (3 faculty). Since the last renewal, the number of training has increased from 30 to 36 and includes nine new assistant professors who strengthen our existing expertise and also bring new disciplines central to our training mission such as cryo electron microscopy and cellular imaging. The MBTG also provides an immediate academic home for these new faculty that extends beyond the boundaries of their home department/school. Trainees are typically supported for two years, beginning in their second year after completing rotations in at least three laboratories. The training program consists of 1) Laboratory rotations, 2) Graduate courses, 3) Teaching experience, 4) Monthly Tuesday evening student seminars, 5) Invited seminar speakers, 6) Yearly MBTG retreat, 7) MBTG journal club, 8) Individual Development Plan (IDP), 9) Individual mentoring and career guidance and 10) Hands-on instrument training.

"9338275","Project Summary The evaluation of candidate therapeutic agents for the treatment of bone marrow failure in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) is constrained by several challenges including the disease heterogeneity and the limited number of primary human hematopoietic cells available to study. In vitro assays of human hematopoiesis do not provide information about the correction of long- term multilineage hematopoiesis, a critical endpoint that determines the efficacy of therapy for bone marrow failure in FA and related disorders. The predictive value of preclinical studies can be significantly enhanced by the use of robust in vivo modelling. We have developed a novel, double-chimeric xenograft model that allows us for the first time to rigorously test candidate therapeutic agents for their potential to correct steady-state human FA deficient hematopoiesis. The goal of this Xenograft Core is to fully evaluate the acute and chronic effects of the administration of lead therapeutic compounds identified in Projects 1 & 2 of this proposal."
"9304781","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stem cells are necessary to maintain homeostasis within adult tissues. These cells receive signals from their surrounding microenvironment or niche in order to function properly. Precise regulation of stem cells and their niches is vital to prevent depletion or overgrowth of the stem cell pool. Although many mammalian niches have been characterized, the Drosophila testis provides a unique and more accessible system to study the regulation of a stem cell niche in vivo. This well-defined niche consists of a cluster of non-dividing (or quiescent) somatic hub cells that signal to the attached germline and somatic stem cells. Damaging the niche or overexpressing genes that promote cell division in hub cells induces hub cell divisions, but also leads to the conversion of hub cells to somatic stem cells. This change in cell fate is accompanied by the formation of new niches, characterized by the presence of ectopic hubs each supporting active stem cells. The generation of excess niches in an adult tissue causes widespread tissue disruption over time, and is likely to underlie tumorigenesis quite generally. However, little is known about how this phenomenon is regulated, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is a long-standing goal of regenerative medicine. The goal of this proposal is to uncover the molecular mechanisms and cellular behaviors that are activated or deactivated upon tissue damage and regulate the ability of niche cells to lose quiescence and adopt a stem cell fate. Recently the highly conserved cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor retinoblastoma homolog RBF was identified as a critical regulator of hub cell quiescence. Loss of RBF in the hub is sufficient to cause hub cell proliferation, conversion of hub cells into somatic stem cells, and ectopic niche formation. To understand what signaling pathways regulate RBF and its cell cycle interacting partners, a loss and gain-of-function screen of signaling components in the hub will be performed to further elucidate the mechanism. Live imaging of testes under loss of quiescence conditions has already revealed that converting hub cells migrate farther distances than their wild-type counterparts, and will allow cell fate changes to be tracked in real time. This technique will be further utilized to understand how ectopic niches form and how they acquire new stem cells. The proposed experiments will provide a model for understanding the regulation of niche cell quiescence and identity, which could be pertinent in other stem cell niches to prevent over-proliferation and metastases."
"9385702","ABSTRACT  Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. Both increased sugar intake and frequency of exposure alter the oral microbial community, triggering a disease process that leads to caries. Additional factors associated with caries in children include genetic risk, household SES, maternal caregiving behavior and stress, access to care. Progress has been made in understanding many of these factors. However, much remains to be done in order to further characterize individual risk factors, but just as importantly, to determine how interactions between them lead to oral health disparities.  The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia. The guiding philosophy of our project (the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia; COHRA) has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. COHRA's long- term goal remains to determine the sources of oral health disparity in a high risk, Northern Appalachian population so that effective preventive interventions can be designed and targeted.  During the previous project period that began Sept 1, 2009, we recruited a cohort of approximately 1000 northern Appalachian women during pregnancy (COHRA2), following them and their children through their children's second birthday. This prospective study of mother-child pairs complements the original cohort of approximately 840 northern Appalachian families (COHRA1) by gathering multifaceted, longitudinal data on the earliest antecedents of caries formation. As detailed in the progress report, the specific aims of the previous project period (using both COHRA1 and COHRA2 cohorts) were all accomplished (recruitment targets, genetic analyses of the COHRA1 cohort, psychosocial investigations, microbial assessments). We propose to follow the current COHRA2 cohort as it grows from ages 2 to 6, and to use the resulting longitudinal demographic, medical, diet, and psychosocial data to test hypotheses about the causal relationships between risk factors contributing to the unusually high rates of caries formation in this population. We will integrate the additional data to be collected with existing and new genetic and microbial data to identify ?cariogenic profiles,? in which the interactions between mother and child genetics, oral ecology, diet, and other environmental/psychosocial behaviors in infancy and early childhood are combined to predict unusually high risks for onset of caries before age 6."
"9316404","SUMMARY ? PATHOLOGY CORE The pathological assessment of old animals is important to determine whether the changes observed as animals age are associated with or independent of underlying pathological conditions. It is, therefore, essential to obtain accurate and thorough pathological assessments of aging animals. The Pathology Core will play a key role in the San Antonio Nathan Shock Aging Center because pathology increases exponentially with advancing age and is largely responsible for age-related morbidity and mortality. Knowledge of the pathological lesions associated with interventions used to study aging is essential to interpreting the impact of these interventions on the aging process(es). This knowledge will also provide insight into the underlying mechanism(s) behind the interventions' effects. The Pathology Core will build on the extensive experience of researchers at San Antonio and the expertise of the Core Leaders in pathological analyses of experimental animal models. Thus, the Specific Aims of the Pathology Core are:  1. To conduct comprehensive end-of-life and cross-sectional pathological analyses of established and new  rodent models as well as other species used in aging research that die spontaneously or are sacrificed at  specific age points in colonies maintained by the Aging Animal Models and Longevity Assessment Core.  2. To conduct immunohistochemical, molecular, and quantitative morphometric analyses of the  tissues/organs of rodent models and other species by performing a) morphometric and  immunohistochemical analyses on several lesions and age-related histological changes and b) in situ  hybridization to further analyze the histological changes at the molecular level.  3. To continue to a) accrue a comprehensive database of histopathological data and images as a resource  for analyses by investigators, b) provide basic pathological information for new investigations, and c)  create a tissue archive by collecting and storing tissue samples (paraffin and frozen blocks) as a resource  for analyses of samples as requested and for new morphological research.  4. To provide histopathology services for investigators by preparing paraffin and frozen blocks, making  unstained slides, and performing various staining (including special staining). New services include (a)  making tissue array slides for histological/morphological experiments, and (b) performing laser capture  microdissection for further molecular analyses.  5. To assist faculty and students interested in the basic biology of animal models with the pathological  analyses needed for grant applications and manuscript preparation."
"9319121","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive debilitating autoimmune disease of the CNS affecting ~400,000 patients in the US. Acute flares of MS are treated with corticosteroids, but corticosteroids are not disease-modifying. Although several biologics and drugs are approved in the US for chronic disease-modifying treatment of MS, none completely inhibits disease progression, and all have significant toxicities or safety issues. Thus, MS remains a serious debilitating disease with significant unmet medical need for safer and more effective treatments, especially for treatments with mechanisms of action other than, or in addition to immunomodulatory mechanisms; such as mechanisms directly effecting neuroprotection, and/or promoting myelin protection or repair. Io Therapeutics is developing IRX4204 to treat MS because it has substantial preclinical data indicating it has potential to be effective in the treatment of MS patients by multiple mechanisms of action, including immunomodulation, neuroprotection, and myelin protective/reparative effects. IRX4204 is a synthetic orally available compound, which is a potent and highly selective agonist for the RXR nuclear receptors. The compound is distinctive from the only currently approved RXR agonist (bexarotene), in that it is approximately 100-fold more potent as an RXR agonist than bexarotene, with RXR activation occurring at sub-nanomolar (nM) concentrations, and maximal RXR activation occurring at approximately 1 nM for all three RXR isoforms. IRX4204 at pharmacologic concentrations is devoid of activity at RAR, PPAR, FXR, and LXR nuclear receptors, which are activated by bexarotene. IRX4204 transactivates RXR/Nurr1 and RXR/Nur77 heterodimers at sub-nM concentrations. These RXR heterodimers are implicated in its activities on immune system and CNS. We have already tested IRX4204 in humans with cancer or Parkinson?s disease under two US INDs, and it has been shown to be well tolerated and safe for administration to humans with chronic neurodegenerative disease. The unique pharmacologic activities of IRX4204, combined with its human clinical data demonstrating safety following chronic administration, and oral pharmacokinetics consistent with once daily oral dosing, has substantially diminished the risk of IRX4204 as an advanced clinical stage therapeutic candidate for MS. This application is seeking funds to advance the development of IRX4204 into Phase 2 randomized, blinded, and controlled efficacy trials in MS patients. Prior to conducting chronic clinical trials in MS patients, the company must perform six month GLP toxicology studies in rats and dogs. These are required to meet ICH and FDA guidelines for administration of an experimental compound to humans for six months or longer. Per company discussions with the FDA, chronic toxicology studies of six months duration in rats and dogs are the only unmet requirements for advancing IRX4204 into the chronic controlled phase 2 clinical trials to provide preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy in MS patients, and patients with other types of neurodegenerative diseases."
"9305101","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for human organs far outstrips the supply. One potential transformative solution is to humanize the immune repertoire of pig organs in order to limit patient rejection of xenotransplanted organs. Whole genes and pathways can in principle be put into pig cells using a large artificial chromosome, which the Boeke lab refers to as synthetic Pig Artificial Chromosomes (sPACs). Current versions of these mammalian artificial chromosomes have limitations. The lab will address these issues by completely redesigning the sPACs from the `bottom up' in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These yeast-based sPACs could be readily reprogrammed with patient data and quickly uploaded into pig cells. In order to achieve this `plug and play' capability, the primary goal of this postdoctoral proposal is to humanize the chromatin of S. cerevisiae, thus ensuring the generation of mammalian-like chromosome structure. The proposal will focus on three specific aims: 1) humanize the histones of yeast; 2) build in H3K27 methylation; and 3) build in H3K9 methylation. In addition, the proposal will permit the study of the de novo establishment of mammalian chromatin in a cell. This will lead to fundamental insight into methylation establishment, maintenance, and mechanisms of perturbation, information relevant to human gene expression. This proposal will achieve two innovative and complementary goals by building human chromatin into yeast: study the mechanisms of chromatin establishment in a cellular 'blank slate', and generate a cell capable of making pig artificial chromosomes designed to facilitate organ xenotransplantation. The long-term goal is to provide an unlimited method of generating humanized pig organs for organ transplantation, thus advancing the treatment of human disease."
"9283376","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which comprises 85% of pancreatic cancers, is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a 5-year survival of 6%. PDAC tumors are often desmoplastic, with marked inflammatory infiltrates and dysregulated immune responses. Interferons (IFNs), key mediators of the innate immune response, act by binding to specific cell-surface receptors, activating the JAK-STAT1 pathway, and inducing the expression of numerous genes involved in the response to infection, most notably from viruses. While IFNs are most well-known for this anti-viral role, recently, an interferon-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS) consisting of genes induced by unphosphorylated STAT1 (U-STAT1) was found to confer resistance to genotoxic stress in cancer. Our laboratory recently established a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC in which oncogenic Kras is combined with deleted Rb1 in the pancreas due to Cre-mediated recombination (KRC mice). By array analysis of cancer cells derived from this GEMM, we determined that they exhibit a strong IRDS. To extrapolate this finding to human PDAC tumors, I clustered RNA- Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and found that 41.3% of PDAC patients also possess this IRDS signature. Therefore, the STAT1-IRDS pathway could be important in PDAC pathobiology. Accordingly, I plan to test the central hypothesis that the STAT1-IRDS pathway contributes in a crucial manner to chemo- and radio-resistance in PDAC patients with an IRDS signature, and that the pathway could serve as a beneficial therapeutic target in these patients. To test this hypothesis pre-clinically, I propose a combined mechanistic and informatics based approach which involves the following specific aims. 1) Using gene expression, classify GEMMs or human pancreatic cancer cell lines as being IRDS (+) or (-) and determine whether IRDS status correlates with the presence of U-STAT1 in tumors as revealed by immunohistochemical staining. 2) Determine if knockout of the STAT1 gene in murine and human pancreatic cancer cell lines is beneficial or harmful both in cells and orthotopic models and whether it depends on IRDS status. 3) Identify chemo- and radio-resistant genes downstream of STAT1. Collectively, this research will determine if the STAT1-IRDS pathway is a novel therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer patients with an IRDS signature at the pre-clinical level and will serve as a proof of concept for future clinical development."
"9409350","Summary: Single-cell sequencing (SCS) is a disruptive new technology that offers an unprecedented ability to interrogate the genomics (DNA, RNA) of single cells to understand the complex biologies of normal and diseased tissues. SCS is not only important for basic research, but also represents a next generation of diagnostic approaches?particularly for cancer. While multiple SCS platforms have been marketed or are under development, all of these rely on high-quality preparations of single, viable cells in a fluid suspension to enter their respective workflows. This is not a trivial undertaking, as enzymatically digested normal or diseased tissues contain dead or dying cells and cell aggregates that may confound SCS. Current cell preparation methods for SCS, such as fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) or dead-cell removal kits, are suboptimal in that they 1) often require a significant investment of time, money and/or training; 2) require multiple protocols; and/or 3) result in a poor yield of viable cells, which is particularly problematic for scarce clinical specimens. The SynderBio R&D team has developed a proprietary approach for separating cell types based on their differential responses to brief pulses of fluid shear stress (FSS). Our preliminary data supports our hypothesis that we can use this technology to rapidly (<15 min) eliminate dead/dying cells and dissociate cell aggregates from cell suspensions. Our Specific Aims and Milestones for this Phase I SBIR feasibility project are as follows: Specific Aim 1: Calibrate the performance characteristics of SynderBio's FSS technology for SCS. Milestone: Achieve ?95% viable, single-cell preparation with ?80% yield. Specific Aim 2: Compare SynderBio's FSS technology to existing cell-preparation methods. Milestones: Achieve significantly better performance characteristics (<30min, ?95% viable single cells, ?80% yield) with purity comparable to that of FACS or dead-cell removal kits from competitors. Phase II Aims will then be to 1) transform SynderBio's current pre-prototype device into a commercial-ready product; 2) distribute a limited number of these devices to thought leaders and potential strategic partners in the field; and 3) expand the side-by-side comparison with competing technologies to other relevant applications in the field. Phase II work will be focused on successful prototyping and in-depth testing designed to obtain the data required by potential Phase III industry collaborators/investors to engage in the next steps required for Phase III commercialization. The commercial opportunity for SynderBio's product is significant. The global cell-isolation/separation market alone is expected to reach $7.89B in 2021 at a CAGR of 17.2%. SynderBio's technology is also applicable to cell preparation for other purposes, such as FACS. Thus, we expect the successful development of SynderBio's technology to have a major positive impact on human health and to address significant commercial opportunities related to the use of SCS for understanding and differentiating normal and diseased tissue biology."
"9298611","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clear cell renal carcinoma (CRCC) is the most common and aggressive form of kidney cancer, and is inherently resistant to therapy. CRCC is typically initiated by inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, resulting in the constitutive activation of the hypoxia inducible factors, HIF-1 and HIF-2. CRCC lesions show evidence of a shift from high HIF-1? expression in early lesions, to high HIF-2? expression in advanced disease. The mechanism for this 'HIF switch' is unknown. However, high HIF-2? is associated with increased dysplasia and advanced disease, whereas HIF-1? is frequently lost in advanced CRCC. Hence the targeting of the HIF switch that leads to HIF-2 specific activation may be of therapeutic benefit. We have identified the hypoxia associated factor (HAF), as a mediator of the switch from HIF-1? to HIF-2? by selectively degrading HIF-1?, and promoting HIF-2? transactivation. We show that HAF promotes HIF-2 specific activation in CRCC cells, and that high HAF expression predicts for significantly decreased progression-free survival in patients with metastatic CRCC. Hence, our hypothesis is that CRCC is initiated by pVHL loss-of-function, resulting in the 'HIF switch' from HIF-1 to HIF-2 specific transcription mediated by HAF, which drives CRCC progression. Hence, the targeting of the HAF/HIF-2 axis may be of therapeutic benefit for the treatment of CRCC. The overall goal of our studies is to identify the mechanisms driving the HIF switch, which may lead to new strategies for more effectively treating CRCC, and to determine whether specific inhibition of HIF-2 will yield increased therapeutic benefit. Hence, our first aim is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating the switch to HIF-2, which include HAF SUMOylation and hydroxylation of unique poly-proline motifs within HIF-2?. Our second aim is to investigate the contribution of the HAF/HIF-2 axis in promoting CRCC progression and resistance to therapy using in vitro and in vivo models, and clinical CRCC samples. Here, we will address the impact of HAF on the anti-tumor response of CRCC cells in vitro and in vivo, and on tumor growth/metastasis in orthotopic mouse models. We will also investigate the relationship between HAF and HIF levels to tumor stage and patient survival, in samples from patients with VHL disease, and within a multistage CRCC tumor microarray. Our third aim is to develop peptide-mimetic inhibitors of HAF/HIF-2? binding as a novel way to specifically inhibit HIF-2. Our lead 7 residue peptide specifically inhibits HIF-2 activity in CRCC cells. This peptide will form the basis for a small molecule peptide-mimetic, which we will use as a pharmacological probe to investigate the potential anti-tumor activity of HIF-2 inhibition."
"9323528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last twenty years, sleep medicine has emerged as a field with highly prevalent disorders that have significant influence on individual as well as public health. Despite the impact of sleep on overall health and well-being, primary care physicians often do not address sleep complaints. Some of the barriers identified by primary care providers include insufficient education exposure across all levels of training including undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education. Currently, the average student in a U.S. medical school only receives 2 hours of sleep medicine education over the course of 4 years. Postgraduate medical experiences can be limited to due lack of support and resources for facilitating medical education. Continuing medical education is sleep medicine is often in the form of conferences which require time away from the office or medical journal articles and webinars which typically lack relevant clinically based teaching pearls. The plan is to develop a sleep medicine curriculum that is fully web-based and transportable to healthcare professionals who do not have access to hands-on clinical experiences. This curriculum would consist of live and enduring on demand as well as self-directed clinical cases that are smartphone application based with a website option. Topics would include basic sleep biology, sleep deprivation, sleep-disordered breathing, overview of neurologic sleep disorders and insomnia. The program will be rolled out in three phases. Initially, the curriculum would be provided to fina year medical students in taking a one-week elective in Sleep Medicine (Phase 1). Subsequently, the curriculum would be provided to first year internal medicine residents and family medicine residents at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania(Phase 2).. Lastly, the curriculum would be provided to community-based internal medicine and family medicine practitioners (Phase 3). Assessments of learning include change in attitudes and knowledge of sleep health and sleep disorders using pre- and post-testing (in all learners) and changes in behaviors (in residents and community-based primary care clinicians) as measured by screening, testing and referral patterns. Additionally, assessment of competency in learners using direct observation of clinical simulated encounters using video-chat technology will be developed and evaluated. The development of this innovative, educational, and completely web-based tool will transfer information about sleep health and sleep disorders to learners across the continuum of medical education (i.e. undergraduate medical education, graduate medical education, and community-based practicing physicians)."

"9310055","PROJECT SUMMARY: Motor neurons are the only neuronal cell type with cell bodies located within the central nervous system (CNS) and axons that project out into the periphery. Once outside of the CNS, motor axons bundle, but do not intermingle, with sensory axons as they co-extend towards peripheral targets. To establish this distinct projection pattern, motor neurons rely on combinations of molecular signaling pathways that direct them during different stages of their development. The mechanisms that constrain motor neuron cell bodies within the spinal cord while allowing motor axons to exit into the periphery are still not completely understood. I have found that a cell adhesion molecule, Transient Axonal Glycoprotein type-1 (TAG-1), is a fundamental, multifunctional regulator of motor neuron development and circuit formation. Multiple neural cell types transiently express TAG-1 during development, and while TAG-1 is expressed on motor neuron cell bodies and axons during early stages of differentiation and axon outgrowth, the function of TAG-1 in motor neurons is not known. An examination of TAG- 1 knockout mice revealed three major defects in motor neurons: (1) motor axon bundles (ventral roots) are expanded, (2) motor neuron cell bodies aberrantly leave the spinal cord, and (3) motor axons have severe guidance defects and invade dorsal root ganglia. Utilizing a combination of novel mouse genetics, whole embryo imaging, and in vitro assays, I will investigate the molecular mechanisms of TAG-1 function in motor circuit formation. I will also determine whether TAG-1 is required cell autonomously to regulate motor neuron migration, axonal growth and guidance. This proposal will elucidate the function of TAG-1 in motor neurons and uncover the fundamental mechanisms that regulate early motor neuron development. Overall, understanding the mechanisms that regulate neural circuit formation can inform future therapeutic interventions for re- establishing proper neural circuits after physical injury, neurodegeneration, or developmental mis-wiring."
"9326334","Project Summary Sleep disordered breathing occurs more commonly in the pregnant population; however, there has been no research to date that has assessed specific predictors of pregnancy-onset development of this disorder. It is possible that, with the exposure to pregnancy physiology, women with a specific phenotype are more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea. The aim of this project is to 1) assess anthropometric and body composition variables in women with and without obstructive sleep apnea in early pregnancy; 2) examine physiologic and biological measures longitudinally and relate changes to the development of new-onset obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy; and 3) evaluate the role of rostral fluid shifts around sleep in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea. The study will enroll pregnant women with obesity. Participants will have measurements of body composition, relevant anthropometric measures, biological markers ?such as female hormones, adipokines and inflammatory markers-, pulmonary function tests and upper airway patency measurements, followed by in-home sleep apnea testing. Women with obstructive sleep apnea will be compared to those without. Women without sleep apnea will then be followed longitudinally for the development of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy by repeat home sleep apnea testing. Early pregnancy measures and changes in these measures during gestation will be assessed as predictors of new onset obstructive sleep apnea and related to apnea hypopnea indices and other polysomnographic measures of obstructive sleep apnea obtained on repeat in-home sleep studies. This aim will facilitate the identification of specific pregnancy dynamic changes that predispose some women at risk, but not others, to develop obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy. To further understand the role of fluid shifts during sleep, a subgroup of women will be invited to have an in-laboratory polysomnography test where measurement of leg and neck circumference will be obtained in addition to an assessment of fluid shifts from the lower extremities. The knowledge gained from this study will help us identify factors that would place a woman at risk for developing de novo obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy paving the way for targeted screening strategies. Such research will also facilitate the identification of women at risk for these complications to be pursued in interventional trials."
"9441596","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glucose is a ubiquitous cellular fuel source in virtually all organisms. In addition to its energetic role in the human body, glucose also serves as a critical metabolic intermediate in which activated glucose molecules are transported to the ER and Golgi and used for glycosylating proteins, lipids and polysaccharides as part of the biosynthetic-secretory pathway. The path of entry to the body is common for glucose and the other dietary monosaccharides, which are absorbed by enterocytes of the small intestine and distributed throughout the body in the bloodstream. The plasma glucose concentration is tightly maintained by hormonal control and conserved reabsorption mechanisms in the kidneys. Secondary active transporters facilitate these absorption/reabsorption processes as well as the exclusive delivery of activated glucose molecules to the ER and Golgi. Alterations in their inherent functions result in numerous human diseases and disorders, such as type II diabetes; thus, an intricate understanding of their structure and dynamics is a critical objective for biomedical research.  During the original grant cycle, we solved the first crystal structure for an member of the sodium glucose transporter family, the Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/galactose symporter (vSGLT). On the subsequent renewal, we solved additional structures of the inward-open conformation of vSGLT, which in conjunction with biochemical and molecular dynamics simulations reveals the mechanism allowing substrate release. These two distinct conformations obtained during the course of this grant have fundamentally advanced our understanding of membrane transport to an atomic level and are the foundation for this competitive renewal. In addition, we aim to resolve mammalian transporters (in particular Homo sapiens) of SGLT (SLC5 family) as well as a distinct, and as of yet structurally unresolved class of nucleotide sugar transporters, the SLC35 family. The aims of this renewal are: Aim 1 captures a complete transport cycle for vSGLT using double electron-electron resonance and wide-angle x-ray scattering. Aims 2 and 3 structurally resolve two classes of human transporters with pharmaceutical relevance, the Solute Sodium Symporter family (SLC5) and the Nucleotide Sugar Transporters family (SLC35). Elucidating the structural basis for these transport families will increase our understanding of the related diseases and aid in drug development."
"9303414","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endocytic recycling is critical for many physiologic events, including nutrient uptake, cell signaling, polarity, and cell adhesion and migration. In recent years, we have advanced a fundamental understanding of endocytic recycling by identifying the first coat complex to act in this process. This complex is composed of clathrin coupled to a novel adaptor, known as ACAP1 (Arfgap with Coil-coil, Ankyrin repeat and PH domain 1). We have also identified ARF6 (ADP-Ribosylation Factor 6) to regulate this coat complex, with Grp1 (General receptor for 3-phosphoinositides 1) acting as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). More recently, our studies on these factors have uncovered significant new insights, which we propose to pursue in further detail. First, we have recently pursued a cutting-edge approach that combines single-particle cryo-electron microscopy with protein crystallography. This approach has shed unexpected new insight into how ACAP1 bends membrane. Thus, we propose to apply this combined approach to study how ARF6 bends membrane, and also examine how ARF6 cooperates with ACAP1 to impart membrane curvature. Second, we have also uncovered that Akt promotes endocytic recycling through a non-kinase function. Thus, we will examine three possibilities for this novel role: i) acting as a cargo adaptor to promote cargo binding by ACAP1, ii) regulating the GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity of ACAP1, or iii) modulating the ability of ACAP1 to bend membrane. Third, we have also uncovered new insights into the regulation of Grp1, which involves the phosphorylation of a key residue in its PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain, resulting in Grp1 being targeted to the recycling endosome rather than the plasma membrane. We have also identified additional factors that promote this switch. Thus, we will elucidate how these different targeting mechanisms may be coordinated, and thereby contributing to a better understanding of how ARF GEFs are regulated in complex ways to ensure that a transport pathway is properly initiated. As endocytic recycling underlies many key physiologic events, we anticipate that our studies will not only advance a basic understanding of transport mechanisms, but also shed insights into how endocytic recycling is critical for both health and disease states."

Pilot Project Support fulfills two main objectives. First, as shown from our record of past performance, they can be an important part of the support for junior faculty who are embarking on new projects that may not yet have achieved outside funding. Second, and less often, they can play a similar role for more senior faculty who are changing career objectives in order to study the basic biology of aging for the first time. The total award budget is $90,000/yr, distributed as (typically) 6 individual awards. The large majority of awards will be targeted to candidates outside our region. These awards will provide fully subsidized access to our Research Resource Core services, necessary reagents and supplies, mentoring by a senior faculty member, and for external recipients, travel expenses for at least one visit to our Center. This activity is directed by the Core Leader in concert with the Executive Committee of our Nathan Shock Center. We present 1) a plan for the advertising, review and selection of investigators to receive support, 2) a plan for administration of awards, 3) a plan for the career development of individuals who will be selected for these positions, 4) a list of senior faculty who will participate in research career development.

"9391444","Project Summary The specific aims of the Dysmorphology Research Resource are to use the previously established CIFASD physical examination protocol and classification system to perform and/or validate physical examinations of all infants, children and adults who are participants in the CIFASD renewal project, to provide on-going training and re-training of local pediatricians/neonatologists/geneticists who are providing preliminary examinations at some CIFASD sites and to further develop and refine a telemedicine program developed in the last funding period. The overall goals of the Dysmorphology Research Resource is to 1) assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) at all CIFASD project sites where new subjects are being recruited 2) provide, through the telemedicine program, an added source of research subjects resulting in a partial solution to the problems created by the lack of adequate numbers of research subjects with a diagnosis of an FASD, 3) train additional physicians and health care providers, particularly those in low income, underserved areas of the United States, in the diagnosis of FASDs, and 4) through the telemedicine program, reach underserved areas that lack physicians with expertise in clinical recognition of FASDs. In that all children will be evaluated using a standard protocol by one of two physicians (KLJ or MDC) with expertise in recognition of features characteristic of prenatal alcohol exposure dramatically increases the integrity of conclusions that can be drawn regarding the overall aims of the CIFASD Consortium. The outcomes of all clinical studies completed through the Consortium will be totally dependent on these evaluations, either face-to-face or through telemedicine, by the Dysmorphology Research Resource."
"9308034","PROJECT 2  Project 2 of the CREATE RDCRC will explore the genetic determinants of ALS and related disorders using a novel and innovative approach in which we capitalize on shared phenotypic elements across this group of disorders. For Project-2 we will enroll and deeply phenotype 500 patients with ALS and related disorders in whom the genetic cause of disease is not currently known. These data will be combined with the deep phenotypic data collected on 200 patients with ALS and related disorders in which the primary genetic cause has already been identified (Project-1). Genetic studies will identify novel genes for ALS and related disorders, and begin to illuminate the factors that modify the natural course of disease and define endophenotypic features/phenotypic elements that cut cross the boundaries of classic disease entities. This will be achieved by examining both common and rare variation in the context of novel gene discovery in familial and sporadic cases and genetic modifiers in the case of established genetic mutations. All genetic analyses will be based on whole exome sequencing and genome-wide array genotyping as a backbone for the genetic architecture of each sample. In addition to the ~700 exomes we will generate from our deeply phenotyped cohort, we have or expect to have access to ~2,500 exomes from patients with ALS and related disorders, which will be used to confirm/validate the findings in our cohort."
"9405658","PROJECT SUMMARY Currently available HIV formulations necessitate lifelong, daily dosing and after prolonged periods of time, patients can encounter pill fatigue and frequently miss doses of their medication. This can have detrimental consequences on the success of therapy, increasing likelihood of the virus developing resistance to the drugs used. Recently, innovations by leading pharmaceutical companies have demonstrated the potential for long- acting formulations that enable the drugs to be administered just once a month (or even less frequently) but sustain delivery of drug over that period. Although this has the potential to greatly impact the dosing frequency, a major limitation of this approach is the need for effective treatments to use simultaneous combinations of different drugs, and only two drugs have been developed with long-acting formulations. This means that patients must still take daily oral tablets from a class of drugs known as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The two industrial long-acting therapeutic candidates (rilpivirine LA and cabotegravir LA) were manufactured using a milling process that generates solid drug nanoparticles from poorly water-soluble drugs. NRTIs have inherent water-solubility and are, therefore, currently incompatible with the technologies being utilized by pharmaceutical companies to produce long-acting formulations. Using our recent advances in polymer chemistry, prodrug chemistry, pharmacology and predictive modelling we propose to generate and optimize long-acting backbone regimens consisting of NRTIs to match current standard of care and compliment the recent industrial developments. A series of four NRTIs will be studied and we will assess two administration options that will establish the utility for long-acting NRTI delivery and define a new platform technology for many water-soluble drugs. Iteration between the different disciplines involved within the collaborative program will ensure clinically-relevant options are developed which are shelf-stable, and release NRTIs over at least a one-month period. Translation will be de-risked through early safety evaluation. The robustness of each candidate generated, its scalability, sterility and cost effectiveness will also be established. To deliver this ambitious program, each candidate will undergo a sequential and detailed preclinical evaluation of their pharmacology and safety, to enable optimization of favorable properties. Lead candidates will be selected for analysis in vivo by integrating laboratory data through mathematical modeling. Our strategy will develop candidates for long-acting NRTIs and generate proof-of-concept to support future work and attract third party interest. Impact will derive from a new platform for long-acting release and benefits to patients through simplification of therapies and dosing frequency."
"9323224","The Research Development Core of the Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center is an innovative departure from the traditional structure of similar cores in Nathan Shock Centers. Research Development Cores generally support a limited number of junior faculty members (2-4) within the academic institution using a fixed monetary pilot award (e.g. $25,000-50,000). The Development Core of the Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center is designed to provide unprecedented service to the scientific community at large. Our goal is to increase the number of investigators across the country that conduct research in aging by providing funded access to a series of relevant and specialized technologies not often present within an individual laboratory and educational, mentoring, and collaborative resources that aid in the development of and/or transition to an independent career in research in the biology of aging and age- related diseases (Geroscience). Three goals are proposed for the Research Development Core: Aim 1. Support pilot/feasibility projects for young investigators interested in conducting research in the biology of aging; a. investigators outside of Oklahoma will be supported through the Nathan Shock Center, and b. investigators inside of Oklahoma will be supported through local funding sources. Aim 2. Provide collaborative opportunities for mid-level and senior investigators with interests in Geroscience e.g. investigators with experience in diseases associated with aging but with limited experience in conducting aging research. Aim 3.a. Disseminate novel technologies to the aging community and train researchers in best practices, and b. Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the Research Development Core. The goals of the Development Core are highly leveraged using resources available to us from the Reynolds Oklahoma Center on Aging, OUHSC/OMRF and local funding agencies. Based on information provided through our website, at national meetings and direct contact with individuals regarding grant awards (NIA/AFAR), we expect that the unique services of the development core will be widely used by investigators across the country and will advance the field of aging and Geroscience research. We expect that this novel program will be transformative for advancing the careers of young scientists and integrating mid-level and senior scientists to Geroscience research."
"9310054","The cerebral cortex is the most complex part of the brain and is responsible for high-level cognitive processing including language, sensory perception, motor planning, attention, emotion and even consciousness itself. To accomplish these complex tasks, the cortex employs an enormous number of heterogeneous neurons. It has long been a mystery how such a diverse population of cells can be generated during development. The immune system also generates enormous cellular diversity, which it achieves by altering the genomic blueprint of certain immune cells in small, but important ways. It has long been speculated that cortical neuron diversity is also generated in part by DNA variation, but direct evidence of such a phenomenon is lacking. In addition to potentially adaptive roles of genomic alterations in cortical neurons, DNA may also be damaged over time. Neurons are particularly susceptible to DNA damage due to their high electrical and metabolic activity and since neurons are not replaced over the course of a lifetime, this damage accumulates as organisms age. DNA damage may play important roles in the pathogenesis of age-related cortical neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. In both adaptive and pathological DNA variation, excision of chromosomal DNA can lead to subsequent formation of circular DNA molecules from these excised pieces. These circular DNAs are found in neurons early in cortical development, in immune cells during genomic editing and as byproducts of DNA damage and thus may be useful markers for underlying DNA variation. The central goal of this proposal is to investigate how DNA alteration may play a functional role in the initial development of diverse cortical neuron types and how pathological DNA damage may accumulate in these cells during aging. Two specific questions drive this goal: 1) If chromosomal excision is involved in generation of neuron types during development, then do neurons of a similar type share similar profiles of circular DNA molecules? 2) Do neurons accumulate class-specific populations of circular DNA from DNA damage during the course of aging? To address these questions, circular DNA from isolated neuronal populations will be sequenced from young and old mice. Additionally, novel techniques will be developed to examine the distribution of circular DNA molecules directly in tissue. The combination of Dr. Paola Arlotta's and Dr. Constance Cepko's guidance, Dr. David Gifford's computational mentorship and expertise, surrounding research community and available resources at Harvard will greatly facilitate this work. Answering these questions would provide novel insights into our basic understanding of cortical neuron development and function and may potentially uncover important drivers of aging and neurodegeneration.    "
"9302803","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Driven by initiatives such as the Human Genome, 1000 Genomes, ENCODE, and GTEx Projects, genetics and genomics have taken a central role in the biomedical sciences. In the same way, advances in computation are driving the mathematical sciences forward. These factors, the increasingly quantitative nature of biomedical research, and the explosive growth of genomic data have resulted in an increasing demand for individuals trained at the interface of genomics and the mathematical sciences. Recognizing this demand, the NHGRI and NIGMS in 2008 convened a workshop focused on Research Training Needs in Statistical Genetics and Genetic Epidemiology. Participants affirmed the existence of a key need, stating there is not a sufficiently trained cadre of scientists to develop methods and analyze the vast amount of data generated from population genomics studies employing current and rapidly emerging technologies. In the intervening years, the increasing volume and variety of genomic data has made this need even more acute. In a series of workshops in 2012 and 2013, NHGRI advisors reaffirmed this training need, and advocated maintaining investment in genomics sciences training while expanding the statistical and informatics component. The emerging focus on big data in research in general and biomedical research in particular is expanding this need further. The continuing goal of the University of Michigan Genome Science Training Program (GSTP) is to fill this need by training predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees at the interface of genetics, genomics, and the mathematical sciences, with particular emphasis on training statistical human geneticists, genetic epidemiologists, bioinformaticians, and human molecular geneticists with a strong grounding in statistics and computation. The GSTP is based in the participating departments of Biostatistics, Human Genetics, and Epidemiology, and now also the graduate program in Bioinformatics, with other participating faculty in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Environmental Health Sciences; Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology; and Statistics. The fundamental premise of the GSTP is that graduates should have substantial training in the mathematical and biological sciences and at their interface. Such training facilitates communication between disciplines, identification of important problems, and of the statistical and computational tools required to solve those problems. We request support for ten predoctoral trainees and three postdoctoral trainees, consistent with the last five years o the GSTP. Trainees will be supported for two to three years to provide time for the interdisciplinary training we have demonstrated is critical to their success. Graduates of the GSTP will continue to help fill the need for quantitative genome scientists, and in so doing, help the NHGRI achieve its goals of translation of genomic information into advances in our understanding of human health and disease."
"9391516","Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, ?Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)? (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity ?to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.? This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention."
"9303236","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) is a major cause of meningitis and septicemia. Serogroup B (NmB) strains account for 30 to 80 percent of invasive disease in different populations. Capsular polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are available against all of the major serogroups except for NmB, which cross-reacts with host antigens. A protein antigen-based vaccine (referred to as 4CMenB) that targets NmB strains recently was licensed in Europe. However, failure of 4CMenB vaccination to decrease asymptomatic NmB carriage was instrumental in a preliminary decision by policy makers not to recommend routine vaccination in the UK. While considerable data indicate that glycoconjugate vaccines prevent both invasive disease and decrease nasopharyngeal colonization, there are important gaps in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms, and how protein-based vaccines can be improved to decrease carriage more effectively. Our hypotheses are that improving serum antibody quantity and quality (i.e, avidity, breadth of epitope reactivity, and functional activity) and/or targeting additional antigens, will increase the ability of NmB vaccine to decrease carriage. The major challenges that impede investigation of these questions are, 1) the specificity of Nm for the human host, and 2) the lack of appropriate in vitro and in vivo models. For example, human CEACAM1 specifically mediates adhesion of Nm to airway epithelial cells, and human complement factor H (fH) specifically down-regulates complement activation and permits meningococci to evade bacteriolysis in humans. Our laboratory has developed a broadly protective meningococcal native outer membrane vesicle vaccine (NOMV) from mutants with genetically attenuated endotoxin and over-expressed factor H binding protein (fHbp). Data indicate that the quality of the antibody responses to fHbp when over-expressed in an NOMV vaccine is greater than to recombinant fHbp vaccines. To determine the effect of NOMV-fHbp immunization on carriage, and to identify additional antigens that might be added to the vaccine to decrease carriage, we propose to: 1) develop in vitro airway models of meningococcal colonization, 2) generate a transgenic mouse model of human colonization that expresses both human CEACAM1 and human fH, and 3) use these model systems to evaluate the ability our NOMV-fHbp vaccine and new antigens to prevent colonization. The results will increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which vaccination decreases meningococcal carriage, and will further development of a broadly protective serogroup B meningococcal vaccine that prevents both invasive disease and asymptomatic carriage."

"9232384","SUMMARY  Specific skeletal deficits are manifest in all individuals with Down syndrome (DS) but have not been extensively studied. As individuals with DS are living longer, they are increasingly at risk for fractures and osteoporosis that result from skeletal deficiencies. Limited studies of humans with DS show a sexual dimorphism in the development of skeletal deficits, but these differences have also not been well defined. DS mouse models have shown that both bone formation and resorption parameters are affected by trisomy. Genetic studies have shown that overexpression of Dyrk1a, a gene found in three copies in humans with DS as well as in DS mouse models, significantly contributes to DS skeletal deficits. Therapeutic modulations of the DS skeletal phenotypes in mice show that Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an inhibitor of Dyrk1a activity, may improve certain skeletal phenotypes associated with DS. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular, cellular and genetic bases of skeletal phenotypes in DS and develop effective screening, therapeutic and preventive strategies. The objectives of this application are to use DS mouse models to: 1) delineate how development of skeletal deficits differs in males and females with DS, 2) quantify how changing dose and duration of EGCG treatment influences skeletal phenotypes and 3) identify the relative contributions of bone forming and resorbing cells in DS skeletal phenotypes. Our central hypothesis is that an optimal treatment and dosage of EGCG will correct cellular bone deficits and improve skeletal strength in both males and females when administered at an optimal time in development. The rationale for this proposal is to provide necessary preclinical information that will lead to the correction of bone deficits in individuals with DS. This endeavor is significant and timely because it defines sex specific differences in, cellular origins of and etiologically-based treatments for skeletal phenotypes found in all males and females with DS. This proposal is innovative because it will extensively characterize the cellular basis of the skeletal deficits in DS. Additionally, it will quantify for the first time the sexual dimorphism, vertebrate deficiencies, and contribution of trisomic Dyrk1a in bone forming and resorbing activities in skeletal phenotypes of two different DS mouse models. Completion of these aims is expected to provide mechanisms for the sexual dimorphisms in the development of skeletal deficits in DS and propose rational treatments to correct these deficits. This etiological-based treatment of skeletal deficits in a DS mouse model will have a positive impact by providing a preclinical foundation for testing similar pharmacotherapies in individuals with DS."
"9294076","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application entitled Transcriptome analysis of the adherent-invasive E. coli phenotype is submitted on behalf of Dr. Grace Gathungu in response to PAR-13-074 entitled Small Grants for New Investigators to Promote Diversity in Health Related Research (R03). Dr. Gathungu is an African American new investigator board certified in pediatrics and pediatric gastroenterology. The focus of her research is on biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. This R03 award will provide her with the support necessary to: (1) Conduct a focused research project using microbiology and bioinformatics methodology and develop new research technology (2) Establish an independent academic career in IBD research. To achieve these goals, she is guided by mentors: Ellen Li, MD, PhD who is Professor of Medicine at Stony Brook and has a research focus on intestinal microbiota in IBD, Dr. James Bliska a Microbiologist and expert on Bacteria pathogenesis, & Dr. Wei Zhu a Biostatistician. Additional collaborators are: Dr. John Parkinson, Associate Professor of Biochemistry & Molecular and Medical Genetics at the University of Toronto; Dr. Phillip Tarr, Professor of Pediatrics and Molecular Microbiology at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Edgar Boedeker, Professor of Medicine at the University of New Mexico; Dr. Daniel Frank, Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado. There remains a critical need to identify more accurate, reliable and reproducible biomarkers to predict disease progression in patients at risk of serious complications such as fistulae, strictures or surgical management of aggressive Crohn's disease (CD). Evidence from 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing reveals that the composition of microbiota in the ileum is altered in patients with ilea CD. There are greater proportions of gram negative bacteria including Escherichia coli. It is hypothesized that Adherent Invasive E coli (AIEC) are associated with increased pathogenic potential in patients with ileal CD. AIEC while predominantly of B2 and D phylotypes are a heterogeneous group of serotypes. Currently no molecular probe can distinguish AIEC from non-invasive bacteria. The main hypothesis is that that highly expressed genes (during infection) can be used to detect AIEC in clinical samples and genes important for bacterial E. coli pathogenesis can be identified by metatranscriptome analysis. Dr. Gathungu proposes to characterize the transcriptional profile of AIEC bacteria during invasion of host mammalian cells. She will identify unique transcripts for AIEC bacteria and also define genes that are differentiall regulated in bacteria. As demonstrated in preliminary studies, she will then examine patient fecal and ileal biopsy samples for genomic probes that are AIEC-specific and can reliably be used in prospective epidemiological studies. Dr. Gathungu will use advanced bioinformatics and molecular biology techniques. In future studies and through R01 funding, Dr. Gathungu will apply this knowledge to prospective studies in pediatric patients with CD."

Administrative Core Executive leadership of MIDUS will be provided by the Principal Investigator (PI) and Executive Committee (EC, consisting of Leaders/Co-Leaders of the projects and cores). They will be responsible for major decisions regarding implementation and completion of the stated aims of the U19 application. Primary tasks include: monitoring progress in achieving the funded objectives of the research; nurturing effective and synergistic communication and collaboration across projects and cores; managing day-to-day oversight of MIDUS field work and insuring quality control in delivery of comprehensive datasets and documentation to the research community. The PI, EC and MIDUS investigators will work cooperatively with the NIA Project Scientist to refine objectives, methodologies, and aims of the study, including considering alternative approaches and instruments. The PI, EC and MIDUS investigators will also regularly engage with the External Advisory Board, who will provide input on the study aims, proposed changes to content or methods, security procedures, and how to make best use of data collected. Day-to-day oversight of MIDUS involves numerous responsibilities that will be centrally managed by Admin Core Co-Leaders at UW-Madison. Among these is coordination of data collection across projects ? i.e., the biopsychosocial integration that motivates MIDUS hinges on members of the sample participating in multiple projects. This task requires careful sequencing of recruitment from project to project, combined with timely communication among project-specific investigators; such goals will be accomplished with a centrally-managed MySQL database system. The Admin Core will also create and deliver high quality datasets with comprehensive, user-friendly documentation; such goals will be advanced via MIDUS metadata conventions and use of an innovative web-based documentation standard called the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI), which maximizes the availability, discoverability, and clarity of the data. The DDI will facilitate cross-project and longitudinal analyses by producing variable cross-walks (concordance tables) as well as support the delivery of new data and documentation to the scientific community according to timelines determined by the PI and EC. The data delivery task includes managing a preliminary release to MIDUS investigators to vet data quality, along with issuing data updates as they arise. Admin Core Co-Leaders will facilitate public use of MIDUS datasets by giving presentations to interested audiences and developing webinars that describe how to access and work with the ICPSR data. Finally, the Admin Core will oversee and manage linkages to append external data resources to MIDUS datasets. Such external data resources include mortality information, Medicare usage, geo-coding, and links to richer information about medication usage and occupational descriptors."

Using the standard medical conference format, investigators will present their original research to the audience and attendees will have the opportunity to present questions, discuss findings, and share ideas. While the relationship between HHV-6A, HHV-6B & HHV-7 infection and some diseases such as encephalitis, febrile seizures and febrile status epilepticus are well-established, the role of HHV-6 & 7 in other conditions such as acute graft vs host disease, liver failure and pneumonia remains unclear. The inherited form of HHV-6 that affects 1% of the population (chromosomally integrated HHV-6) and recent data suggest that it can activate in immunocompromised patients and recipients of high dose steroids and HDAC inhibitors, with unknown consequences. The international conference on HHV-6 & 7 provides a venue for investigators to discuss these important issues and encourage further understanding in all areas, from molecular biology to clinical research. The conference organizers would like to offer travel grants to a diverse group of speakers and trainees in the United States to travel to the conference in Berlin, Germany. Since there are very few NIH grants awarded to study these viruses, a significant number of participants are unable to attend without some form of subsidy."
"9353265","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In a recent double-blind placebo-controlled study we found the broad spectrum anticonvulsant zonisamide (ZON) to have effects on ethanol consumption that are comparable to those of topiramate. We hypothesize here that the administration of ZON, by attenuating the hyperexcitability of the brain during periods of abstinence, through its neuro-protective effects, and its enhancement of dopamine activity in midbrain and frontal regions will counteract the effects of alcohol that lead to impaired regulatio of emotional and reward processes that control the consumption of alcohol. This will be evident by the normalization of brain activity seen in performance of the alcohol and emotional-word Stroop tasks and in a reduction of the BOLD response to alcohol related images. The results of this study should provide an indication of the neurobehavioral mechanisms through which ZON may act to regulate the consumption of alcohol."
"9305122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lipid membranes are the physical barriers and functional interfaces between cellular compartments, and are therefore involved in nearly every aspect of cellular physiology. To accommodate this exquisite functionality, membranes are composed of a vast array of lipids and proteins that self-organize on a variety of length and time scales. Disturbances to the lipid constituents of cellular membranes are associated with diverse disease phenotypes, including cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, osteoporosis, neurological disorders, and cancer. Moreover, unique to lipids among other cellular macromolecules, lipid phenotypes can be affected directly by dietary lipid abundance and composition. Most notable are the deleterious health consequences associated with overconsumption of saturated and trans-unsaturated fats, and, conversely, the plethora of beneficial effects of ?-3 polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). Despite the broad significance of membrane phenotypes, the detailed lipid compositions determining these phenotypes, lipidomic remodeling during cellular processes, and the susceptibility of membrane composition and function to dietary lipid inputs have not been widely characterized. Recent analytic breakthroughs in holistic quantitation of membrane lipids have revealed that cells produce hundreds of distinct lipid species, and that cellular lipidomes are remarkably plastic, capable of rapid, large-scale, functional rearrangements. These observations prompt the hypothesis that both cell autonomous and exogenous factors drive membrane lipidome remodeling and that the resulting membrane phenotypes directly regulate cell function. To test this broad hypothesis, we propose a combination of mass spectrometry, membrane biophysics, and stem cell biology to characterize lipidomic and biophysical membrane remodeling during the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and how dietary lipids affect this remodeling to regulate MSC differentiation. In Aim 1, we will define the compositional and biophysical differentiation of whole membranes and isolated plasma membranes as MSCs undergo differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts. These observations will be combined with bioinformatic approaches to uncover the compositional determinants of physical properties in biological membranes. In Aim 2, we will extend these observations by investigating the modulation of membrane composition and physical properties by dietary lipids - specifically cholesterol, saturated / trans-unsaturated fats, and ?-3 PUFA. Further, we will evaluate the functional aspects of membrane remodeling by investigating the consequences of lipidomic disturbances on lineage-specific MSC differentiation. Finally, we will explore the molecular mechanisms behind these observations by the experiments proposed in Aim 3. We will dissect the mitogenic and differentiation pathways regulated by membrane remodeling to identify the molecules responsible for transducing membrane phenotypes into cellular signals. The long-term goal of this line of research is to identify modulators of membrane phenotypes for treatment of diseases associated with lipidomic perturbations and for promotion of desired cellular phenotypes, e.g. osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in osteoporosis."
"9386272","PROJECT SUMMARY Perinatal inflammation is an established risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a major morbidity of prematurity characterized by abnormal saccular stage lung development. As the airway epithelium is present at the interface of the amniotic sac environment and the fetal lung, it is well positioned to respond to inflammatory stimuli in amniotic fluid. Therefore, we developed a transgenic mouse model to inducibly express the master inflammatory transcription factor NF-?B, in the airway epithelium (IKTA mice). Using this model, we showed that epithelial-derived inflammation results in profound dilation of terminal airspaces during the saccular stage, but does not alter earlier stages of lung development. Airspace dilation in saccular stage IKTA lungs was associated with reduced expression of important elastin assembly components, especially fibulin-5, by interstitial fibroblasts, leading to altered elastic fiber assembly around distal airspaces. In new preliminary data generated to identify epithelial-derived inhibitors of elastin assembly components in fibroblasts, we found that lungs of IKTA mice and tracheal aspirates (TA) from preterm infants exposed to antenatal inflammation had high levels of IL-1 (both IL- 1? and IL-1?). Neutralizing IL-1? or IL-1? restored fibulin-5 expression in fibroblasts exposed to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) from IKTA mice or TA from preterm infants. Since IL-1 triggers intracellular signaling via NF- ?B, we tested the direct impact of NF-?B on saccular stage lung fibroblasts and observed that NF-?B signaling inhibited fibulin-5 mRNA expression. Finally, by modifying our transgenic mouse model to enable survival beyond the early postnatal period, we found that inflammation-induced disruption in saccular stage elastin organization results in persistent abnormalities in lung structure. Proposed studies will test the hypothesis that during the saccular stage of lung development, epithelial-derived inflammation propagates down-stream NF-?B activation in fibroblasts through IL-1 signaling, resulting in down-regulation of fibulin-5 and other critical elastin assembly components. Disruption of elastin organization during this critical developmental window impairs lung development, leading to abnormalities in lung structure and function that persist into adulthood. Specific aims are: 1) to define the role of IL-1 signaling in regulation of elastic fiber assembly components, 2) to determine the transcriptional regulation of fibulin-5 in lung fibroblasts during development and in response to inflammation, and 3) to investigate the long-term impact of impaired saccular stage elastin assembly. Together, our studies will determine how inflammation during a critical developmental window can modulate lung structure and function, thus providing new insights into BPD pathogenesis and the long-term consequences of altered saccular stage lung development."

"9310077","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of off-patent drugs prescribed to children lack dosing information specific to this population, which can result in treatment failures and toxicities. Dosing information is lacking because clinical trials involving children pose specific challenges, among the most important of which is the large number of children required to estimate appropriate dosing at every stage of child development. Population physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are mathematical tools that incorporate changes of childhood, along with drug characteristics and genetic variances, to find the most appropriate dose for every pediatric age. By incorporating these factors, PBPK models can reduce the number of children needed for clinical trials. This proposal will systematically develop, and prospectively validate, population PBPK modeling in children."
"9513200","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of the vertebrate nervous system requires switching of polymorphic ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes from a neural progenitor complex (npBAF) to a neuron-specific complex (nBAF) at mitotic exit. This switch is in part directed by two microRNAs, miR-124 and miR-9, which when expressed in fibroblasts can convert them into functional neurons. Recent exome sequencing studies have found frequent mutations of BAF complex subunits in non-syndromic mental retardation, microcephally, schizophrenia and less frequent BAF complex mutations in sporadic autism and sporadic ALS. The apparently genetically dominant nature of these mutations is consistent with the instructive role of subunit switching during neurogenesis and suggests that these chromatin regulators may have rate-limiting functions. Relatively little is known of the underlying mechanisms directing subunit switching, or how subunit switching relates to other more well-defined programs of neural development. Also, the mechanisms underlying the contribution of subunit mutations to a diverse range of neurologic diseases in humans are unknown. Indeed most of the mutations are in subunits not required for conventional activities such as nucleosome remodeling. Our preliminary data suggest that repression of three progenitor subunits and their substitution with neuron-specific subunits leads to mitotic exit of neural progenitors (NPGs) and functional differentiation. We will test this hypothesis using genetic approaches and define the genetic circuitry involved in repression of the npBAF subunits and the activation of the nBAF subunits. We will also define the proteins that bind to the neuron- specific surfaces of the complexes that mediate their role in dendritic morphogenesis, dendritic targeting and neural fate determination. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing we will define the genome- wide consequences, which result from the normal exchange of three subunits within these 2 mega dalton chromatin remodeling complexes. Our studies and those of others indicate that an important function of BAF complexes is to oppose Polycomb complexes; however the mechanisms underlying this opposition are not understood. Thus, we will use a method recently devised in our lab to understand the underlying mechanism of BAF-Polycomb opposition. At the conclusion of our studies we hope to have an understanding of the fundamental genetic circuitry and mechanisms critical for this epigenetic switch and to gain insight into the roles of polymorphic BAF complexes in diverse human neurologic diseases."
"9291524","Characterization of Hippocampal Sclerosis in Individuals With Calcified Neurocysticercosis ABSTRACT  Most of the global burden of epilepsy occurs in poor regions of the world, reflecting increased prevalence of risk factors such as perinatal brain damage, traumatic brain injury, and infections of the nervous system including neurocysticercosis (NCC). NCC is endemic in most developing countries, and the prevalence of seizures and epilepsy is consistently increased in individuals with NCC when compared to the general population. Epilepsy is more prevalent in cysticercosis-endemic regions, and cases of chronic focal seizures semiologically related to the localization of a parasitic lesion are frequent. Perhaps more interestingly, information from patients with refractory epilepsy and NCC suggests that in some patients parasites might be involved in epileptogenesis by inducing hippocampal damage, which can become the site of seizure onset. We propose to take advantage of an existing cohort of 228 patients with calcified cerebral cysticercosis lesions as well as 50 control patients with spinal pathologies without cerebral involvement, to demonstrate the association between NCC and hippocampal sclerosis, and to characterize the clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging characteristics associated with hippocampal sclerosis in these individuals. Participants will have hippocampal assessment by non-contrasted brain MRI, and computational morphometry analysis of MRI will be used to characterize specific neocortical and subcortical patterns of atrophy (with the use of volumetric MRI and cortical thickness measures) and to determine whether HS in these patients has the specific pattern of CA2 sparing found in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy or another, non-specific pattern. EEG and Video EEG will be performed to determine whether the location of the epileptogenic region correlates with the location of the HS or a calcified lesion elsewhere. The frequencies of all factors potentially associated with HS (including but not restricted to time with seizures, cumulative number of previous seizures, type of seizures, number and localization of brain calcifications, and EEG abnormalities) will be compared between individuals with and without HS. If NCC-associated HS is the epileptogenic region, and is similar to the HS in MTLE it would provide an opportunity to study epileptogenesis clinically for the most common form of intractable epilepsy."
"9330892","Project summary A haplotype is a sequence of alleles on a chromosome. Two haplotypes are identical by descent if they are inherited from a common ancestor. Segments of identity by descent (IBD) are found at high frequency in population samples and can be detected with high accuracy in high density SNP array or sequence data. IBD segments can be used for computationally efficient and accurate estimation in many health-related applications including estimating population genetic parameters and performing genetic association testing. We propose to develop improved methodology for detecting IBD segments, with particular focus on quantifying uncertainty in IBD segment endpoints. We will also develop methods that use IBD segments to estimate mutation rates, migration rates, effective population sizes, and population split times."
"9391907","Abstract Recent epidemiological studies suggest that Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) may have a prevalence of up to 5% in the population (May, et al. 2014); however, it is rarely diagnosed in adulthood and there are no recognized treatment protocols because, despite decades of research on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), scientific study of adults with FASD is almost unknown. This lack of accurate information is devastating for these individuals, their families and a source of frustration for professionals who encounter affected individuals. Although neurodevelopmental deficits may be persistent, without accurate information about mental and physical health problems associated with PAE, caregivers, health care professionals and policy makers cannot make informed decisions, diagnose accurately, provide care or allocate resources. Supported by the resources provided by CIFASD, the current project is uniquely qualified to address this deficit and carry out the following Specific Aims: 1) Establish a registry of 500 individuals, older than 30 years of age, with known alcohol exposure/FASD diagnosis or who are matched controls who will respond to a health survey, and who will be available for future studies; 2) in affected individuals (FAS or FASD) and controls (120 from Atlanta and 120 from Seattle), to evaluate in depth current status in areas supporting adults physical and social functioning with the goal of refining diagnostic criteria for FASD in this age group and determining the persistence and severity of disability associated with PAE. This activity will include examination of dysmorphology, abstraction of medical records, substance use (self-report and biological samples), cognition and mental health as well as social factors that might contribute to outcomes and disability status. Finally, 3) to assess immune status (in collaboration with Dr. Weinberg) and identify outcomes associated with health indicators."
"9350386","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a revolutionary approach for genome editing of mammalian cells. Recent developments in CRISPR/Cas9 knockout technology as well as dCas9 fused with effector proteins enable high throughput cost-effective gene functional screens but create computational challenges. We have developed a Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK) method for calling genes and pathways from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens. MAGeCK demonstrates better performance than previous methods and identify robust hits, including novel ones, from several published screens. In this proposal, we aim to develop the statistical and computational methods to improve the MAGeCK algorithm to enable quality control, data analysis, and interactive visualizations of CRISPR screen data. In one unified statistical model, the proposed method corrects batch effect at gRNA level, simultaneously estimates gRNA efficiency and gene selection, and identifies differential gene and pathway selection over multiple conditions, and considers sequencing bias and cell doubling time. Specifically, we propose to: Aim 1. Develop robust data normalization methods for CRISPR screens. Aim 2. Develop the statistical and computational framework to call cell- and condition-specific essential genes and pathways from multiple CRISPR screen experiments and conditions. Aim 3. Develop methods to mitigate outlier gRNA effects and use protein interaction network to enhance the performance of CRISPR screen gene calling. Aim 4. Develop user-friendly software features, such as quality control, visualization, design and analysis software for CRISPR screens. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have developed more versatile and reliable analysis algorithms for CRISPR screens under diverse experimental settings. These methods could be applied to CRISPR knockout screens, CRISPRi/a screens, sequencing-based si/shRNA screens, and the phenotype could be cell growth, migration, differentiation, or sorting of GFP-labeled gene expression. Our proposed methods will greatly facilitate the technology adoption to many experimental biology groups, so they can use the powerful genome-wide CRISPR screens under diverse experimental settings to answer important biological questions about gene regulation and drug response."
"9314991","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Modifying T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is a clinically-validated approach for the treatment of some B-cell malignancies. Though efficacious, the genetic modification of these cells is associated with significant drawbacks. For instance, the genetic engineering techniques are tedious, inefficient, and not applicable to all cell types. Furthermore, the modifications are permanent, leading to persistent, severe, and irreversible patient side effects. Because of these drawbacks, the use of an alternative, reversible scaffold to direct therapeutic cell-cell interactions would be highly beneficial. It has been previously demonstrated that a fusion protein comprised of two units of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR2) will spontaneously assemble into a chemically self-assembled nanoring (CSAN) when combined with the chemical dimerizer bis- methotrexate (bisMTX). Recently, an anti-EpCAM scFv was fused to the DHFR2 protein, and a phospholipid was conjugated to the bisMTX species. Assembly of these species formed chemically self-assembled chimeric antigen receptors (CS-CARs) that were embedded in the membrane of T cells and drove selective recognition and killing of EpCAM-positive carcinoma cells. Importantly, the CS-CARs were readily removed from the T cell surface via incubation with the FDA-approved antibiotic trimethoprim, affording a pharmacological mechanism to deactivate the CS-CARs. Despite these positive in vitro results, it remains unclear whether the current structure of the CS-CAR is optimal for the initiation and maintenance of cell-cell interactions. Therefore, the aims proposed in this project are designed to further test the hypothesis that CS-CARs can be used as a rapid, reversible method to modify cell surfaces for therapeutic purposes. Specifically, the results will further the understanding of the structural components of these CS-CARs, providing a rational pathway to optimize their therapeutic efficacy. Aim 1 will focus on a systematic evaluation of each component of the CS-CAR, generating a small library of CS-CAR constructs. This includes variation of lipid species, PEG/peptide linker lengths, and targeting element identity (scFv vs. novel fibronectin engineered via yeast surface display). The ability of the CS-CARs to initiate and maintain specific, reversible cell-cell interactions in vitro will be also established. Aim 2 will evaluate the in vitro efficacy T cells modified with different anti-EpCAM CS-CARs to selectively recognize and kill EpCAM-positive MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. These results will afford optimized CS-CARs suitable for further evaluation in vivo and enhance the field's understanding of designing reversible, therapeutic cell-cell interactions. Therefore, this proposal has broad implications not only for the cell-based treatment of malignancies, but also for other applications utilizing directed cell-cell interactions. Moreover, this application provides a rigorous, yet defined scientific and mentoring framework to foster the applicant's goals of becoming a successful academic physician-scientist."

"9281685","Project Summary/Abstract for Histology Core   The structure and composition of musculoskeletal tissues are tailored to meet their demanding functions.  With injury, aging, and specific diseases, the structure and composition of these tissues deteriorate, resulting in  a decline or loss of biological, phenotypic and mechanical function and properties. Musculoskeletal tissues  each have a wide array of compositional and structural variety with respect to cellular components,  microarchitecture, and extracellular matrix constituents. Careful description and quantification of tissue  structural organization and composition, as well as localization and identification of secreted factors, are  necessary requirements for elucidation of the biologic mechanisms underlying musculoskeletal integrity, injury,  and repair. The overall objective of this Histology Core (HC) is to utilize and develop a wide range of standard  and innovative histological and histomorphometric approaches to evaluate musculoskeletal tissue injury and  repair, and to provide training and funding for new projects and collaborations utilizing these assays.   There is an increasing demand for specialized histological techniques, development of new  histomorphological methods, and customization of histological approaches to musculoskeletal-based  problems. The need for these approaches is ever-broadening due to the recognition that many musculoskeletal  disorders can affect other systems (indirectly, including muscle, bone, and other connective structures). In  addition, some pathologies are true multisystem disorders that also affect musculoskeletal tissues. Thus,  investigators whose interests were initially focused on non-musculoskeletal pathology now also require access  to the advice and services provided by the HC. In addition, with the proliferation of new animal models, it is  critical to be able to characterize their musculoskeletal phenotype, whether it is primarily or secondarily  affected by a genetic disorder or other type of musculoskeletal insult. The HC of the Penn Center for  Musculoskeletal Disorders (PCMD) has flourished under the leadership of Dr. Robert Pignolo, who has been  Director since July 2010. Importantly, the home of HC is in Stemmler Hall, the same building as the other two  Resource Cores and the Administrative Core, defining a clear home for the PCMD overall.   The Specific Aims of the HC are to: 1) To provide guidance and training on the capabilities, advantages,  and disadvantages of the various methodologies to assess musculoskeletal tissue structure and composition  through formal educational enrichment programs and one-on-one interactions, 2) To provide high-quality  expertise and service for histological and histomorphometric assays of musculoskeletal tissues, 3) To develop  new and innovative histologically-based techniques that will be applicable to musculoskeletal research, and 4)  To provide funding for development of new projects and collaborations and to develop preliminary and/or  feasibility data for investigators."
"9368754","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposal is to test the effect of pravastatin, a hepatoselective HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, to delay or avert hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence, and gain information regarding the potential mechanical and molecular mechanism of HCC tumor inhibition by pravastatin. HCC is a highly lethal cancer with rising incidence and mortality rates. Fortunately, liver transplantation (LT) offers patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC meeting certain tumor criteria a new lease on life. The downside is the increasing competition for donated livers requires that patients be waitlisted for months or years, increasing the likelihood for HCC progression, loss of transplant candidacy, and death. Cirrhotic patients with HCC are often treated with locoregional therapies (LRT) to `bridge' to LT, however HCC recurrence following LRT is 70-80%. Clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of adjuvant therapies to delay time to HCC recurrence, allowing patients to remain competitive for curative therapy through LT, is widely considered an area of highly unmet need. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest anti-tumorigenic properties of statins in the liver, and thus they are strong candidates for adjuvant therapy for patients with early stage HCC undergoing LRT. In the proposed study, we will conduct a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase IIB trial to test a 12-month intervention with pravastatin versus placebo on time to HCC recurrence. We hypothesize that pravastatin will reduce time to recurrence. Secondarily, we will also test the effect of pravastatin versus placebo on waitlist drop-off, change in the mechanical properties of the liver (liver stiffness), and change in serum biomarkers associated with tumor development and growth. We will enroll 180 study participants over three years from the large pool of patients awaiting LT at three transplant centers in Los Angeles and Chicago. We will focus on patients with transplant- eligible HCC who have completed an initial LRT with complete response. The investigative team is comprised of talented physicians and scientists with complementary expertise including epidemiology, liver transplant surgery, transplant hepatology, medical oncology, and radiation oncology. We are proposing this clinical trial in a well- defined clinical cohort of patients who are under frequent surveillance to remain eligible for a liver transplant. We will harmonize patient recruitment, collection of biological specimens, and follow-up with routine clinical appointments and tests. The proposed study will provide much needed human experimental data on the therapeutic potential of statins for people with HCC. The mechanisms of action for statins in liver carcinogenesis are not well-understood due largely to lack of available human specimens with detailed clinical and statin exposure data. In this trial, we will collect and store serial blood specimens and liver explant tissue from participants on statin and placebo for mechanistic investigations. The confirmation that statins protect against HCC recurrence will provide enormous scientific and public health impact."
"9240952","Abstract The aim of this Phase I feasibility study is to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the 4- week Time4U Teen Health Intervention (T4U) an intervention to improve the health of teens who live in families experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). Parental IPV is witnessed by 5.5 million American teens during adolescence. These teens are particularly vulnerable to negative health behaviors (substance or tobacco use, unhealthy eating, sexual risk-taking, teen dating violence). Women who experience IPV and their children often seek help at domestic violence shelters (DVS). Many DVS offer peer or professional counseling to assist women to deal with the consequences of IPV; however, counseling services for children are often lacking due to limited resources. The T4U intervention consists of three components: (a) four computer-based, real-time motivational interviewing (MI) sessions with a lay health worker (LHW); (b) online written health messages; and (c) online daily tracking of health behaviors. Expected intervention outcomes are change in behavior (selected by the teen) related to substance use, tobacco use, disordered eating, sexual risk taking, or teen dating violence. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: (a) Assess the feasibility of delivering the T4U intervention in shelters as evidenced by the willingness of teens to participate in four computer-based MI sessions (attendance) and subject satisfaction; (b) Obtain preliminary efficacy of the T4U intervention for use with teens in shelters to motivate change in a selected behavior and change in behavior from baseline to end of the 4-session intervention and 8 weeks after baseline compared to an attention control group; and (c) Obtain qualitative post intervention feedback on T4U intervention components (MI sessions, health messages, health behavior activity tracking system) and AC components (AC sessions, leisure time messages, leisure time activity tracking system) and suggestions for change in both T4U and AC. Using a quasi-experimental design, 100 teens between the ages of 13-18 living with their mothers in DVS, who screen positive for at least one health risk behavior, will be recruited. Fifty will be assigned to the T4U condition and 50 to the attention control (AC) condition. Data will be collected: (a) baseline, post 4-week T4U intervention or AC condition, and 8 weeks after baseline using two tools to measure teens' motivation to change and their engagement in health risk behaviors, (b) during the T4U condition to measure time spent engaging in healthy behavior related to the targeted risk, (c) after each T4U or AC session to measure satisfaction with the sessions, and (d) post 4-week T4U or AC condition to measure satisfaction with online written health messages or leisure time messages (AC group) and online tracking system. All teens in the T4U and AC groups will be asked to engage in qualitative interviews which will be transcribed and analyzed using qualitative description analysis techniques to obtain feedback on the T4U and AC conditions.   "

"9295328","PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Rhee's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in patient-oriented clinical and translational research dedicated to improving the lives of patients with vasculitis. She will build upon her current skills in clinical epidemiology and gain critical experience in the conduct of prospective patient-oriented research, use of deep sequencing methods, and implementation of bioinformatics and advanced epidemiologic methods. Through the K23 award, the execution of the proposed study, and career development activities, Dr. Rhee will acquire the skills and training needed to make important scientific advances in rheumatology. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener's) is a systemic granulomatous vasculitis which often affects the upper respiratory tract and frequently relapses. Prior studies demonstrated that microbes in the nares are associated with relapse in GPA but these studies relied on culture-dependent approaches. Advances in high- throughput sequencing and the development of new tools for analyzing metagenomic data now allow for a better understanding of the complex relationship between the dynamic community of microbes that occupy our mucosal tissues and the host's immune system. We hypothesize that patients with GPA have greater dysbiosis (disruption in indigenous microbiota) in the nares compared to controls and that greater dysbiosis is associated with disease activity in GPA, mediated by an increase in neutrophil activity (a key pathogenic cell in GPA). The Specific Aims are: 1) compare the nasal microbiome between patients with GPA versus controls, and 2) examine longitudinal changes in the nasal microbial composition of patients with GPA and the association of these changes with gene expression profiles in the nasal epithelium and clinical outcomes. A better understanding of the complex microbial interactions with the mucosal immune system in GPA can advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of GPA, help predict future relapse, and inform the development of novel therapeutics. Findings from this study will be applied to applications for funding (R01 and others) to perform large-scale studies of host-microbe interactions in GPA. In order to successfully execute the proposed study and develop a career studying host-microbe interactions in rheumatic diseases, Dr. Rhee and her mentors have formed a comprehensive career development plan which draws upon the expertise of her mentors and the rich resources available at Penn. Dr. Rhee will engage in formal didactics including completion of the Biomedical Informatics Certificate Program, participate in relevant seminars and conferences, and devote at least 75% of her effort to research. Guided by expert mentors and collaborators, the research and training activities outlined in this application will enable Dr. Rhee to grow from an observational epidemiologist into an independent patient-oriented clinical and translational researcher, equipping her with a much larger set of skills to answer important and novel questions about vasculitis."

"9386196","Project Summary/Abstract Hemorrhage following traumatic injury is estimated to be responsible for over 40% of all trauma-related deaths. Ongoing traumatic blood loss is complicated by the well-known ?lethal triad? of coagulopathy, hypothermia and acidosis which results in further unbridled hemorrhage. Uncontrolled bleeding, resultant shock and organ dysfunction remain the leading causes of early in-hospital mortality. Despite advances in trauma resuscitation, a paucity of therapeutic interventions are available early enough to reduce the downstream morbidity and mortality attributable to hemorrhage, shock and coagulopathy. The underlying principle of current resuscitation practice in the hospital focuses on preventing or reversing the effects of coagulopathy with the early use of a balanced component transfusion strategy. This reconstituted strategy has been coined ?whole blood-like? resuscitation despite being inferior from a compositional and hemostatic standpoint relative to whole blood. Whole blood use continues today in specific environments and patient populations and is thought to provide the bleeding patient the identical components they are losing with maximal resuscitative and hemostatic effects. Whole blood has also been postulated to improve microcirculatory hemodynamics, reduce the ?storage lesion? effect and minimize donor exposure risks. Due to the time sensitive nature of the treatment of hemorrhage, the ideal resuscitation intervention would entail use of a blood product containing all essential hemostatic components, closest to time of injury, where prevention or reversal of the devastating downstream consequences of shock and coagulopathy can occur. We hypothesize that the initiation of whole blood resuscitation in the prehospital setting with continuation thru the in-hospital acute resuscitation phase of care will significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality attributable to hemorrhagic shock post- injury as compared to standard prehospital and in-hospital resuscitation practice. This hypothesis will be tested by addressing the following specific aims: Specific Aim I: Determine the feasibility, most appropriate study population and outcomes of a study protocol that will lead to a large multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of prehospital thru in- hospital LTLR-WB as compared to standard care practice in patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock. Specific Aim II: Determine if prehospital thru in-hospital LTLR-WB reduces multiple organ dysfunction, presenting coagulopathy, 24 hour resuscitation requirements and early mortality as compared to standard of care prehospital and in-hospital resuscitation in patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock. Specific Aim III: Determine the primary drivers by which prehospital thru in-hospital LTLR-WB improves clinical, resuscitative and hemostatic outcomes as compared to standard of care prehospital and in-hospital resuscitation in patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock."
"9315934","Abstract: Whereas my previous training has focused on acquiring a strong technical foundation in neuroimaging methods, over time, my interests have evolved from a purely technical focus towards the application of neuroimaging to study brain dysfunction in pediatric patient populations. K01 training and research goals will provide me the skills and expertise needed to excel as an independent clinical imaging researcher in this area. To this end, I will obtain training in advanced state-of-the-art magnetoencephalography (MEG) analysis methods in order to study primary sensory activity in low-functioning children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although neuroimaging studies, including MEG, have investigated sensory processing in ASD, these studies have primarily focused on higher-functioning individuals, as these patients are better able to tolerate neuroimaging exams. This leaves a significant portion of the ASD population unexamined and underserved (approximately 40% of the ASD population is low-functioning). Due to this research bias, relatively little is known directly about brain function in low-functioning individuals with ASD, or about the degree to which findings in higher-functioning ASD generalize to the entire ASD population. Although focusing on low- functioning ASD, K01 training and research is generalizable, specifically applicable to the examination of other low-functioning patient populations such as individuals with moderate to severe intellectual disability and cerebral palsy. It is towards these underserved and understudied low-functioning patient populations that I will focus my subsequent research. K01 work achieves significant advancements in several areas, with advancements moving me towards independence as a clinical imaging researcher. First, as part of my K01 research work, I will develop technical solutions to address primary obstacles to studying lower-functioning populations with MEG, namely the lack of anatomical information from structural MRI and the often considerable subject motion during a MEG exam. This technical work will serve as an enabling technology, allowing the inclusion of lower-functioning participants in MEG imaging studies. Second, significant time is spent on training activities that will provide me with a greater appreciation for the clinical and behavioral phenotypes exhibited in neurodevelopmental disorders as well as improving my understanding of the underlying neurobiology. To this end, under the guidance of Drs. Levy and Miller, I will participate in ongoing educational clinical activities already in place for training psychologists and other clinicians. I will spend 1 day per week in K01 Years 1 and 2 (2 days per month thereafter) performing clinical training and observing clinical and cognitive assessments at the Regional Autism Center?s young child clinic (seeing children under 6 years) and the Center for Autism Research?s school age clinic. These clinics see over 300 patients (~25-50% low-functioning) a year, offering ample opportunity to observe subjects with a wide variety of behavioral phenotypes and severity levels. This is in addition to attending case assessment meetings (as part of clinical observation), bi-monthly clinical team meetings and regular individual meetings with Drs. Levy and Miller. Training in the neurobiology of developmental disorders as well as the neurobiology of primary sensory processes will be achieved via coursework and one-on-one meetings with Dr. Contreras. Training, workshops, and coursework in the biology, presentation and clinical care of neurodevelopmental disorders will better enable me to anticipate and address the specific challenges in the study of these patient groups and to formulate and address biological questions central to these pediatric patient populations. Completion of this K01 encompasses the achievement of significant advancements in MEG acquisition and analysis. In particular, methods for atlas-based head modeling and motion compensation, developed in Aim 1, will permit accurate source localization of evoked primary sensory activity without the requirement of an MRI and in cases of large continuous motion. These methods will enable the study of primary sensory processes in low-functioning and non-compliant patient populations. Similarly, the real-time analysis system (Aim 3) represents a significant step forward in MEG acquisition in these patient groups, promising decreased scan time and thus decreased patient discomfort and fatigue. Technical advancements will be underpinned by additional training in advanced MEG physics and analysis provided Drs. Roberts, Mosher, and Dammers through one-on-one meetings and instruction. The utility and validity of these methods will be demonstrated through their application to low-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and via increases in success rate (evaluable data) and data quality. Investigation of atypical sensory activity, previously only reported in high-functioning ASD, will thus be enabled in a low-functioning ASD population, addressing the critical and presently unevaluated question of the generalizability of sensory abnormalities in ASD. K01 research will provide data in support of a future R01 which will likely focus on contrasting the sensory activity of low-functioning individuals with ASD to non-ASD neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, cerebral palsy) to identify the specific versus common pathways of sensory processing brain abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9312893","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wiring the brain is a complex neurodevelopmental process. When it goes wrong, human neurological disorders can arise with deficiencies ranging from mild to severe. Genes associated with such disorders are important avenues for research because they provide an entry point into understanding the molecular mechanisms of both neurodevelopmental processes and diseases. Some neurological disorders are linked genetically to genes ubiquitously expressed in many cell types whereas others are linked to neurally expressed genes. The X-linked gene doublecortin (DCX) is only expressed in neurons and is a major genetic locus for type I lissencephaly, a neurodevelopmental defect causing mental retardation and untractable epilepsy. Unraveling the molecular and cellular functions of DCX, therefore, not only has significance for advancing our understanding of DCX function in development and the disease mechanisms of Lissencephaly, but more generally advances our conceptualization of which proteins in particular are required to make a neuron and wire the brain. This grant thus goes to the heart of understanding cell-type specific mechanisms for making functional neurons and building functional circuits. The molecular and cellular roles of DCX are still incompletely understood. Much work has focused on the microtubule-binding ability of DCX, and the phenotypes associated with DCX mutations are postulated to be due to microtubule-related defects. Patient alleles of DCX are powerful tools to direct our attention to residues in DCX that are important for normal function. Surprisingly, microtubule defects have not been established for most DCX mutations, and it is thus an open question whether all cellular roles of DCX require microtubule binding. Many additional binding partners, such as the cell adhesion molecule neurofascin and clathrin adaptors, have in fact been identified for DCX, but the roles of these other interacting partners are currently not understood. In preliminary experiments, we have identified a novel function of DCX, namely endocytosis of neurofascin. Surprisingly, DCX-mediated endocytosis of neurofascin does not require microtubule binding by DCX in a PC12 assay. We will test the hypothesis that DCX plays roles in multiple cellular processes, including endocytosis, via separable molecular interactions. The objective of this proposal is to uncover the contributions of DCX-mediated endocytosis in neurodevelopment, including migration, axon growth and guidance and dendrite growth."
"9316617","Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing."
"9326912","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing skin disease that affects children and adults. This disease is a growing public health problem and a large economic burden worldwide. The central and most debilitating symptom in AD is chronic itch. While some patients can be treated successfully with existing therapies, there is a continuing need for the development of new therapies to treat patients who do not respond to current AD treatment strategies. We and others have shown that the production of the type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 by T helper type 2 (TH2) cells and newly identified group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) contribute to AD pathogenesis. Preliminary studies have also shown that the receptors for IL-4 and IL- 13 are highly expressed on itch-sensing primary sensory neurons. However, the precise role of TH2 cells, ILC2s and type 2 cytokines in mediating AD-associated itch remains poorly defined. Further, type 2 cytokines are known to be dependent on Janus kinase (JAK) signaling in immune cells for their effector functions. However, whether JAK signaling in primary sensory neurons elicits itch remains unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that atopic itch arises from interactions between type 2 immune cells and primary sensory neurons via JAK signaling. To test this, in Specific Aim 1 we will employ genetically modified TH2 cell- and/or ILC2-deficient mice to investigate the role of these immune cells and their associated cytokines in evoking neuronal excitation and itch behavior. In Specific Aim 2, we will employ Cre-dependent conditional knockout mice in which Jak1 is selectively deleted from immune cells or primary sensory neurons to determine whether sensory neuron-specific JAK signaling mediates pruritogen-elicited neuronal activation and itch responses. We anticipate that gaining a better understanding of the immunologic pathways that interact with the primary pruriceptors to promote itch in the context of AD could lead to new anti-itch therapies."
"9282442","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biological nitrogen fixation is mediated by the nitrogenase enzyme system that catalyses the ATP dependent reduction of atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia; this reaction is the only known biological mechanism for converting nitrogen from the abundant atmospheric reservoir to a metabolically usable form. Indeed until the advent of the Haber-Bosch process, virtually all nitrogen present in the biomolecules of humans and all other organisms was fixed through the action of nitrogenase in microorganisms. Nitrogenase consists of two component metalloproteins, the MoFe-protein with the FeMo-cofactor that provides the active site for substrate reduction, and the Fe-protein that couples ATP hydrolysis to electron transfer. The mechanistic questions related to how nitrogenase overcomes the kinetic stability of the NN triple bond to fix dinitrogen under ambient conditions have intrigued chemists for the past century and serve as the focus for the present proposal. Using approaches based on biochemistry, X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, experiments are designed to probe the nitrogenase mechanism in molecular detail. These studies will address how substrates bind to the active site FeMo-cofactor, the flow of electrons through the system, and the nucleotide dependent interactions of the nitrogenase proteins, which are essential for developing a molecular mechanism for nitrogenase function. Beyond the specific details of the reduction of dinitrogen, nitrogenase is a prototypic example of an enzyme with multiple and varied iron-sulfur clusters that participate in electron transfer and substrate reduction, as well as providing an excellent model for energy transduction of ATP hydrolysis. Consequently, these studies will further have broad implications beyond nitrogenase for diverse biochemical systems."
"9312759","Project summary- Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway is a common event in human breast cancer and is  most commonly due to PI3K alpha mutation, HER2 amplification, or PTEN inactivation. Activation of the  pathway plays an important role in oncogenesis and tumors with these lesions are dependent on pathway  function, whereas tumors in which the pathway is not deregulated are not. While inhibitors of the PI3K pathway  effectively suppress growth in vivo, they tend not to induce regression. Our proposal is based on the idea that  physiologic adaptation to PI3K pathway inhibitors attenuates the antitumor effects of these drugs and that  inhibition of the adaptation will markedly enhance their therapeutic effects. We have shown that constitutive  activation of mitogenic signaling by oncoproteins is accompanied by exaggerated feedback inhibition  throughout the signaling network. These high levels of feedback play important roles in the biology of  transformation and in the response of tumor cells to targeted therapies. High signaling output causes profound  inhibition of normal signaling pathways and this causes the cell to be hyperdependent on the oncoprotein  dependent pathway. This is responsible in part for the initial sensitivity of these tumors to pharmacologic  inhibition of this pathway. But while the tumor is initially sensitive to inhibitors of the activated pathway,  inhibition relieves feedback, reactivates upstream signaling and this, we believe, attenuates the antitumor  effects of these drugs. Our previous data shows that inhibitors of different nodes in the PI3K pathway (PI3K,  AKT, mTOR) all relieve feedback and that combined inhibition of PI3K signaling and adaptive receptor  reactivation has enhanced therapeutic activity and causes tumor regression. We now propose in Aim 1 to  characterize the relief of feedback responses to selective inhibition of PI3K, AKT or mTOR. In Aim 2 we will  use genetic and pharmacologic modalities to determine which adaptations are most responsible for  maintaining the survival of the tumor in which the oncogenic pathway has been inhibited. In Aim 3, the data will  be used to identify combination therapies based on this concept and test and optimize their antitumor effects in  vivo"

"9513667","Project Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, which occurs de novo or evolves from pre- existing myeloid disorders. The incidence of AML increases with age, and with increasing age, prognosis and overall survival decline. Treatment failure in many patients is attributed to relapsed disease and remains the fundamental clinical challenge in these patients. The exact biological basis of relapse remains unclear. One prevailing theory is that inherently chemotherapy resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs) survive and repopulate the disease. However genetic background must also have an influence on LSC functions since specific mutations are associated with more frequently relapsing disease. It has also been observed that AMLs undergo clonal evolution with relapse, suggesting that pre-existing subclones or chemotherapy induced natural selection contribute to this phenomenon. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that epigenetic mechanisms play a fundamental role in this process. Specifically: i) we observe extensive epigenetic deregulation in all AML patients, ii) specific epigenetic signatures and classifiers are associated with poor outcomes, iii) there is a relative paucity of genetic mutations in AML as compared to solid tumors (based on TCGA data), iv) many of the common genetic lesions in AML directly alter epigenetic gene regulation. Moreover in preliminary studies we observe that AMLs at relapse display large scale epigenetic changes, whereas TCGA finds relatively subtle genetic changes at relapse. Of note, many of the epigenetic changes we observe are in common between patients, suggesting that AMLs may respond and resist chemotherapy using shared or stereotyped mechanisms. Based on these and other considerations we hypothesize that AML relapse and adaptation to chemotherapy is encoded by a combination of epigenetic and genetic lesions that are either present in a subset of AML cells at diagnosis or occur de novo in response to exposure to cytotoxic drugs. We predict that these lesions preferentially disrupt specific biological pathways that directly mediate chemotherapy resistance, and that detection of these lesions at diagnosis will be predictive of unfavorable outcome. In order to test these hypotheses we will perform a genome wide integrative genetic and epigenetic comparison of seventy matched diagnosis/relapse AML specimens including the use of novel methods developed by the applicant. Results will be validated, and the clinical significance determined in an independent cohort of 750 patients all enrolled in a single phase II clinical trial. The biological function of relapse-associated lesions will be confirmed in functional assays, with the ultimate goal of developing targeted therapies to prevent leukemia relapse."
"9307578","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large-scale protein-protein interaction assays are widely useful in studies of protein interaction networks, drug activity, and protein engineering. The protein-fragment complementation (PCA) assay screens for in vivo protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by converting the strength of an interaction to a relative fitness. For each PPI, protein-fragment-containing haploid yeast pairs are mated and the resulting diploids are tested one-at-a-time. We have developed three technologies that will make PCA more repeatable and higher throughput: 1) a random DNA barcode system that allows us to construct millions of uniquely barcoded yeast strains, 2) a double barcode system that translocates two barcodes on homologous chromosomes to close proximity on the same chromosome, and 3) a pooled fitness assay that allows for accurate measurements of the relative fitness of millions of barcoded genotypes simultaneously via next- generation sequencing. We propose to combine PCA with the above three innovations to generate a massively parallel protein-protein interaction sequencing platform (PPiSeq). Random barcodes are inserted into yeast and are mated to existing PCA strains. Mating of barcoded haploid PCA pools and translocation of barcodes in vivo and en masse yields diploid PCA strains, each with a double barcode representing a specific PPI. Growth of cell pools and sequencing of double barcodes yields an accurate fitness measurement of each double barcode in the pool, which can be translated to an interaction score for each pairwise protein combination. PPiSeq will have have several significant advantages over traditional PCA: it is fast, cheap, highly scalable, and has a low barrier to entry. Notably, PPiSeq throughput scales quadratically with the number of PCA strains, while its costs decline at the rate of next generation sequencing costs. Here, we will construct a large diploid PPiSeq library consisting of ~655,000 unique PPIs and ~6 million double barcodes and use this library to measure the interaction score of each PPI simultaneously via pooled growth (AIM 1). One additional major advantage of PPiSeq over traditional PCA is repeatability across perturbations. That is, once constructed, all pairwise interactions can be re-assayed in new environments easily. Here, we will assay how the yeast protein interactome changes in a heat gradient (AIM 2) and in the presence of three antifungal drugs (AIM 3). This work will provide the first genome-scale view of how the protein interactome changes across perturbations. The constructed PPiSeq library will be provided as a resource to the scientific community for future perturbation studies. Additionally, this work will set the stag for future large-scale PPI screens, such as those involved in drug discovery and protein engineering."

The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool (3-5 years) and school aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with IQ ranging from 50-115. Children will be assessed across three time points (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks, T3: 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status. This battery measures key facets of social-communication in ASD using well-validated paradigms appropriate for this developmental and cognitive range. Five Collaborating Implementation Sites (?Sites?), all highly experienced in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the methodologies proposed here in both typical and atypical development, will contribute equally to recruitment, screening, diagnosis, testing, and longitudinal assessment. The Data Coordinating Core (DCC) will provide a secure informatics infrastructure to streamline communication and data flow throughout the consortium to ensure organized, secure data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National Database for Autism Research and NIH/NIMH Data Repositories. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (DAAC) will oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for standardized data collection, processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core will oversee the operations of the Sites, the DCC, and the DAAC to coordinate with federal and private partners in this cooperative agreement to: 1) Compare whether LB measures versus clinician and caregiver assessments of social impairment are more sensitive indicators of clinical status; 2) Evaluate whether this set of ET and EEG measures, individually or in combination, has potential utility as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable measures of change in clinical trials, assessing viability in terms of: construct validity; test-retest reliability, consistency, and stability; discriminant validity ; convergent validity; and sensitivity to change; 3) Collect blood (DNA) samples from subjects and parents of ASD subjects for future genomic analyses and share raw, processed, and analyzed data to create a community resource accessible for use by all qualified investigators."
"9295071","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic studies have demonstrated a central role for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Alzheimer's disease, yet we do not understand at a cellular level how this protein contributes to disease. Endogenous APP is found in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but whether it exerts greater impact on one than the other has not yet been examined. We lack even a fundamental grasp of whether disease-associated APP variants primarily affect the neuron in which they are expressed, or instead act on neighboring cells within reach of secreted fragments. To address these fundamental questions about the basic biology and pathogenic potential of APP, we have developed a set of model systems that combine precise spatial control over the cells in which APP is expressed with reversible temporal control over when it is active. We will use these models to test our central hypothesis that the impact of pathogenic APP depends on both the timing and location of its expression.  Our studies are designed to answer three main questions. In the first aim, we will examine whether pathogenic APP causes distinct impairments in circuit function and cognitive performance when expressed in excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons. We have already characterized the behavioral and hippocampal deficits evoked by excitatory APP expression, and here will create and characterize a mouse model in which APP is limited to GABAergic interneurons for comparison. In our second aim, we will examine how the position of APP-overexpressing cells within the hippocampus affects transmission through the trisynaptic circuit. We will use stereotaxic viral injection to selectively express pathogenic APP within presynaptic CA3 or postsynaptic CA1 neurons to determine which side of the synapse APP acts from and on to impair synaptic transmission in the Schaeffer collateral pathway. Finally, in our third aim, we will determine whether pathogenic APP affects neuronal function through a cell-autonomous or cell-extrinsic manner. We will use viral mosaicism to produce two complementary expression patterns in which isolated APP-overexpressing cells are surrounded by wild-type neurons, or in which isolated wild-type cells are surrounded by APP-overexpressing cells, to test how neuronal physiology is altered by APP expression within the neuron compared to APP expression within its neighbors.  By using the tet-off transgenic system to restrict the location of APP in each of these models, we gain the added flexibility to control when it is expressed. This feature will allo us to distinguish the effects of pathogenic APP on synapse formation during postnatal development from its impact on synapse maintenance and plasticity in the adult. Moreover, by acutely arresting pathogenic APP expression in either of these settings, we will identify which physiological or behavioral changes are dependent on continued production of APP/Aß and which are permanent consequences of past exposure."
"9291455","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatitis is the most frequent complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), accounting for substantial morbidity, occasional mortality, and increased health care expenditures. Until recently, the only effective method of preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) had been prophylactic pancreatic stent placement (PSP), an intervention that is costly, time consuming, technically challenging, and potentially dangerous. We recently reported the results of a large randomized controlled trial demonstrating that rectal indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, reduced the risk of pancreatitis after ERCP in high-risk patients, most of whom (>80%) had received a pancreatic stent. Secondary analysis of this RCT suggested that subjects who received indomethacin alone were less likely to develop PEP than those who received a pancreatic stent alone or the combination of indomethacin and stent, even after adjusting for underlying differences in subject risk. If indomethacin were to obviate the need for PSP, major clinical and cost benefits in ERCP practice could be realized. Objective: To assess whether rectal indomethacin alone is non-inferior to the combination of rectal indomethacin and prophylactic pancreatic stent placement for preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk cases. Methods: We are proposing a comparative effectiveness multi-center non-inferiority study of rectal indomethacin alone vs. the combination of rectal indomethacin and prophylactic pancreatic stent placement for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. One thousand four hundred and thirty subjects at elevated risk for PEP who would normally receive a pancreatic stent for prophylaxis will be randomized to indomethacin alone or the combination of indomethacin and PSP. The proportion of patients developing PEP and moderate-severe PEP will be compared. In addition, we will establish a quality-assured central repository of biological specimens obtained from study participants, permitting future translational research elucidating the molecular and genetic mechanisms of PEP, as well as the mechanisms by which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prevent this complication."

"9341376","PROJECT SUMMARY Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder, afflicting approximately 1 in 5,000 people, that is characterized by development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). These fragile, direct connections between arteries and veins can lead to hemorrhage, anemia, brain abscess, or stroke. For lung, brain, and nasal lesions, the primary treatment options are invasive procedures that ablate, resect, or block flow through the AVM. Liver AVMs cannot be safely treated and severe liver involvement, which can lead to high-output heart failure, requires liver transplantation. Current medical therapies for HHT block angiogenesis or enhance clotting but do not target disease mechanism. As such, the goal of our research program is to understand disease mechanism to seed development of targeted medical therapies for HHT patients. HHT is caused by haploinsufficiency of one of three genes involved in endothelial cell bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling: activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1, or ALK1), endoglin (ENG), and SMAD4. Because signaling is approximately 50% of normal, one approach to therapy is to enhance pathway activation. The highly related BMP9 and BMP10 proteins, produced by the liver and heart, respectively, have been biochemically identified as high affinity ligands for both ALK1 and ENG, and both proteins are detected in serum. To address the requirements for BMP9 and BMP10 as ALK1 ligands in vivo, we generated zebrafish mutants. We found that bmp9 is dispensable, whereas the two zebrafish bmp10 paralogs, bmp10 and bmp10-like, are redundant with respect to embryonic AVM prevention and cardiac trabeculation, but have subfunctionalized to govern post-embryonic vessel maintenance (bmp10) and ventricular chamber growth (bmp10-like). In Aim 1, we will characterize vascular and heart defects in juvenile- to-adult zebrafish bmp10 mutants. We hypothesize that these mutants develop high output heart failure secondary to vascular defects, recapitulating disease progression in HHT patients and implicating BMP10 as the critical HHT ligand throughout life. In Aim 2, we will explore the cellular and molecular basis of heart defects in bmp10l mutant embryos, focusing on development after the linear heart tube stage. In Aim 3, we will use zebrafish, cell culture, and biochemistry approaches to dissect the physiological and biochemical basis for the specific requirement for BMP10 in post-embryonic vessel maintenance. These studies highlight BMP10 as a novel factor in the coordinate regulation of heart and vessel development and maintenance; implicate BMP10 as the relevant protein for ligand-based HHT therapy; and provide an invaluable new model for understanding the mechanistic relationship between AVMs and high-output heart failure."
"9285828","Sensory hypersensitivities are common and distressing feature of the Fragile X Syndrome. This clinical symptom is believed to be associated with neuronal hyperexcitability in neocortex. There are three primary goals of our highly novel and integrated Center program as pursued in Project 3. First, we aim to characterize the neural substrate of auditory sensory hypersensitivities in Fragile X patients using clinical neurophysiology. Second, we will establish mouse-human homologies via parallel 'in vivo' auditory neurophysiology studies in P2 and P3. Third, we will examine neurophysiological effects of single dose administration of minocycline, acamprosate, and lovastatin on resting EEG and auditory evoked responses in patients with FXS, using the same paradigms as in the Fmr1 mouse studies of P2. Auditory sensory responses, repeatedly shown to be highly abnormal in the Fmr1 mouse model and FXS patients, will be analyzed from a bottom-up, local circuit perspective by examining early sensory evoked response amplitudes and habituation to repeated tones. We will also analyze top-down corticocortical control of auditory processing using our recently established talk/listen paradigm. Last, we will perform a time-frequency decomposition of the EEG response to amplitude modulated (AM) chirp stimuli in order to examine local circuit-mediated neural oscillations. For the chirp paradigm, we will focus particularly on higher frequency gamma band activity, which we have found to be highly abnormal in Preliminary Studies in Fragile X as predicted by the neural circuitry model being tested in P1. Data will be examined for correlations between CGG repeat number and gene methylation, and with clinical ratings. Together with the mouse auditory circuit studies in PI & P2, pharmacological studies in P1 & P2, and 'in vivo' mouse auditory processing studies (P2), we will develop a mechanistic understanding of auditory hypersensitivity in Fragile X patients, and more broadly about illness mechanisms and translational strategies for evaluating neuronal  hyperexcitability and its clinical impact."
"9317286","Project Summary Eukaryotic cells have an asymmetric distribution of lipid species across the bilayer of their plasma membrane (PM). The rapid collapse of this asymmetry, involving equilibration of lipids across the bilayer of the PM, is a vital signaling mechanism essential for many cellular processes including myoblast fusion, blood clotting and apoptotic cell clearance. Dysfunction of this process has been linked to many human diseases including bleeding disorders, cancer and autoimmunity. Equilibration of lipid species between PM leaflets is a process reliant on elusive proteins dubbed phospholipid scramblases (PLSases), which catalyze the bidirectional movement of phospholipids across the PM in a non-selective manner. Recent evidence has identified anoctamin 6 (ANO6), a putative ion channel, as an essential component of PLS activity. ANO6 is essential for Ca2+-dependent PLS activity in a wide variety of cell types, but questions remain concerning its role as a PLSase itself or as a vital regulator of this activity. Utilizing a microscopy-based scramblase assay, we have found that transfection of HEK293 cells with ANO6 induces robust Ca2+-dependent membrane scrambling that is absent in non-transfected cells. We identified a region of ANO6 essential for lipid scrambling, we term the scramblase-associated domain (SCAD), and found that insertion of this region into ANO1 (ANO1-SCAD), an ANO6 paralog with no obvious PLS activity, confers Ca2+-depedent PLSase activity, but mutating this region in ANO6 abolished this activity. Given the small size of the SCAD (12 AA), we hypothesize that this domain facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for membrane scrambling, which highlights the merit in identifying SCAD binding partners. ANO6 exists as a homodimer in vivo. Because oligomerization is important for the function of many membrane proteins including ion channels, we hypothesize that ANO6 oligomeric structure is essential for PLS activity and ion transport. We hypothesize that anoctamin 6 plays a vital role in the organization of membrane lipids and protein oligomeric structure is essential for ANO6-dependent PLS and channel activities. In Specific Aim 1 we will identify novel interactors required for the role of ANO6 in lipid organization and ion channel activity using a quantitative mass spectrometry approach to identify ANO1, ANO6 and ANO1-SCAD binding partners and compare these interactomes to distinguish ANO6 specific interactors from common ANO family interactors. In Specific Aim 2 we will investigate the requirement of Ano6 oligomerization in ANO6-dependent PLS and ion channel activities by identifying the ANO6 dimerization domain using mutagenesis and examining how the inhibition of protein dimerization through mutagenesis and the use of dominant negatives effects channel and PLS activity. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying phospholipid scramblase activity. Understanding this process will greatly increase our understanding of cell-cell fusion and provide potential targets for treating diseases in which this process is disturbed (e.g. bleeding disorders, muscular dystrophies, autoimmunity).!"
"9317487","Project Summary Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern hematopoietic lineage specification and differentiation is critical for developing targeted therapies for bone marrow failure and myeloproliferative disorders. Rcor1 (CoREST) is an established cofactor for the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1, however its role in regulating hematopoiesis is unknown. Using a conditional knockout model we now demonstrate that myeloerythroid differentiation is profoundly dependent on Rcor1. The overall goal of this proposal is to the identify the mechanisms by which Rcor1 regulates myelomonocytic progenitors. Specifically we will i) Determine the functions of Rcor1 in myelomonocytic progenitors and monocytes; ii) Identify Rcor1 targets in granulocyte precursors and monocytes and iii) Determine the functions of the Rcor1 target genes and pathways in myelomonocytic progenitor cell differentiation. By profiling the transcriptional programs in Rcor1 deficient progenitors, we will identify functionally relevant transcriptional targets of Rcor1. The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of epigenetic regulation of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and will likely provide important insights relevant to the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders."
"9323354","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation therapy for cancer has systemic consequences that are mediated through danger signaling in irradiated tissues and tumors and that engage the immune system. This proposal aims to understand how different dose-fractionation schedules in radiation therapy shape the immune system. Recent technological advances in physical dose delivery have encouraged innovative use of higher than conventional doses/fraction given over a shorter time. The optimal dose per fraction that generates anti-tumor as opposed to pro-tumor immune responses in humans is not known but preclinical data suggest that doses around 8Gy may be superior. This is the question addressed here by immune monitoring prostate cancer patients receiving hypofractionated and conventional regimens. The study is designed in a longitudinal fashion to detect changes in individual patients over time before, during and after treatment and to probe multiple aspects of their immune responses. Composing immune profiles with time for each patient circumvents some of the problems of individual variation. An additional benefit of this study comes from the fact that both dose-fractionation schedules will be compared side-by-side in one institution, which minimizes potential biases. The methods employed will be based on cutting-edge, sophisticated immune monitoring technologies to track the frequency, phenotype, and function of effector and suppressor lymphoid and myeloid-derived cells as well as humoral responses. They include Dextramer assay, ELISpot, multi-color flow cytometry, ELISA and multiplex technology. The aim is to paint a global immune picture that includes tumor-specific responses - qualitative as well as quantitative - for each patient as they undergo radiation treatment. The study will have high impact. It may provide data for a new paradigm for re-thinking radiation fractionation, the release of danger signals, and the development of tumor-specific immune responses. Knowing how different radiation dose delivery schedules affect the balance between pro- and anti-tumor immune responses is crucial if we are to engage the immune system in the context of cancer treatment, especially if we are to integrate it with other more systemic therapies, including chemo- (CT) and immunotherapy (IT). This study also has the potential to have an enormous impact as a fast-track translational application because it will ultimately allow us to harness the power of the immune system with an innovative approach that takes radiation oncology to the 21st century."
"9353708","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 will prepare the candidate for a career in clinical and translational migraine research focused on identifying mechanisms involved in migraine triggers by examining both clinical and biological phenotypes and linking them to appropriate treatments. To this end, the proposed training plan and research project will explore the hormonal modulation of migraine among women while simultaneously providing in depth experience in clinical epidemiology and biostatistics as well as in reproductive endocrinology. The training plan includes course work and tutorials involving internationally recognized mentors in each area. The research plan takes advantage of a large and rich data set from an NIH funded longitudinal multi-site study, the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN) to assess the influence of sex hormones on headache throughout the menstrual cycle and across the menopausal transition. Migraine is a neurological disorder with significant public health burden. It affects more than 36 million Americans with the annual economic impact in the U.S. estimated to be more than $36 billion (direct medical costs and lost productivity). Migraine is predominantly a disorder of women that has long been linked with sex hormones. However, sex hormones have complex functions that undergo significant changes over the course of women's reproductive lifespan. It has been challenging to study the impact of women's reproductive hormone cycles and the menopause transition on migraine, due to the lack of well characterized daily hormone cycles in women with migraine. Epidemiologic studies show that migraine prevalence increases around the age of menarche, as hormones begin to cycle, and that it declines after menopause. Within menstrual cycles, for the majority of women with migraine, headache attacks are more likely during the two days preceding the onset of bleeding and for the first 3 days of menses. However, although migraine is often attributed to drops in estrogen levels, estrogen withdrawal does not fully explain migraine occurrence across the menstrual cycle. There are limited data regarding the relation of hormonal patterns over the menstrual cycle to migraine, or the relative contributions of estrogen and progesterone. Even less is known regarding the relation of hormone patterns to migraine as women transition through menopause. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in women's vulnerability to hormones, with some women being severely affected by migraines in relation to hormonal fluctuation, while others are minimally or not at all. An ideal way to study the relative contributions of estrogen and progesterone to migraine is to compare ovulatory cycles, where estrogen and progesterone cycle in predictable patterns, with anovulatory cycles where estrogen continues to cycle in the setting of a blunted progesterone profile. No studies have used this approach, and no studies have assessed the relation of hormone cycles to migraine in relation to the stages of the menopause transition. The SWAN study has characterized daily hormone levels as well as daily headache symptom data, and has done so for one menstrual cycle each year for up to 10 years, as these women transitioned from pre- or early perimenopause to postmenopause. The K23 proposal focuses on using 264 women with history of migraine in this unique data set to increase our knowledge of how hormone fluctuations relate to migraine symptoms during the menstrual cycle and across the menopausal transition. Despite the magnitude of public health impact of migraine in women, there is a lack of clinical data regarding hormonal underpinnings of migraine and tremendous heterogeneity regarding the triggering of migraine. Better understanding of the effects of daily hormonal fluctuations on migraine occurrence over the course of menstrual cycle as well as over the menopausal transition can lead to improved parsing- of migraine endophenotypes. This improved awareness will lead to more effective and appropriately timed hormonal treatment of women with migraine."
"9350331","ABSTRACT  Bioartificial liver assist devices (BLADs) typically consist of liver parenchymal cells (differentiated hepatocytes or hepatoma cells) cultured within an extracorporeal system (in this application, a hollow fiber (HF) bioreactor) in order to recapitulate a broad range of differentiated liver functions. Several challenges must still be overcome to realize a viable BLAD, including provision of appropriate oxygenation to the cells in the device. Our work in this area demonstrates that supplementation of hemoglobin-based O2 carriers (HBOCs) into the circulating culture medium of a HF-based BLAD represents a feasible strategy to improve O2 transport to both preserve hepatocyte differentiated functions and maintain a high cell density. However, our prior studies have shown that unmodified bovine hemoglobin (BvHb) is cytotoxic at high concentrations (>15 g/L, see preliminary data). BvHb is a tetrameric molecule (?2?2, Mw ~64 kDa) that exists in equilibrium (KD = 0.2 µM) with ?? dimers (Mw ~32 kDa) in aqueous solution. Because of the small size of the ?? dimers (32 kDa) in relation to the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of typical HF membranes (>35 kDa), these molecules are able to extravasate through the HF membrane and accumulate in the extracapillary space (ECS) of the HF bioreactor which contains the hepatocytes. In the ECS, ?? dimers eventually autoxidize, unfold and release free heme into solution which is cytotoxic. In light of this knowledge, we hypothesize that supplementation of circulating culture medium in a HF-based BLAD with polymerized BvHb (PolyBvHb) will provide the benefits of unmodified BvHb, namely enhance O2 transport, improve hepatocyte differentiated functions, and support a high cell density in the ECS, but without eliciting cytotoxicity. The presence of chemical cross-links within PolyBvHb will prevent cytotoxicity via two mechanisms: (a) by preventing dissociation of ?2?2 into ?? dimers and their subsequent extravasation into the ECS; (b) by preventing globin chains from unfolding and releasing free heme into solution. Three specific aims are proposed to investigate this hypothesis:  Specific Aim 1: To characterize the stability of PolyBvHb in plasma and its effect on the viability, function, and proliferation of liver parenchymal cells.  Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the function of a liver cell microbioreactor with zonated functions induced via controlled O2 tension.  Specific Aim 3: To optimize the zonation and scale-up the HF liver bioreactor oxygenated with PolyBvHb. The proposed studies will generate proof-of-principle data that describe, both in vitro and in a clinically relevant model, the impact of using physiologically relevant oxygen tensions through the use of PolyBvHb on bioreactor performance. These studies will therefore provide the first stepping stones towards future clinical development, which would likely involve large animal (pig) and human studies."
"9318310","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circulating markers from blood represents an exciting in vitro diagnostic scenario because of the minimally invasive nature of securing these markers and the plethora of marker types found in blood, such as biological cells, cell-free molecules (proteins and cell-free DNA) and vesicles (nanometer assemblies such as exosomes). Unfortunately, many of these blood-borne markers have not been effectively utilized in clinical practice to manage challenging diseases such as cancer, infectious diseases and stroke to name a few. This deficiency has arisen primarily from the fact that disease-associated blood markers are a vast minority in a mixed population making them difficult to find and analyze due to the lack of efficient platforms for their isolation and systems that can determine the molecular  structural variations they may harbor. To address this pressing need, a new Biotechnology Resource Center is proposed (CBM2), which consists of a highly accomplished and multidisciplinary team that will generate innovative systems for the selection of circulating markers from whole blood and process disease-specific molecular signatures. The envisioned system takes advantage of multiple length scales (mm-to-nm) to affect unique processing capabilities offered by the system. The system will process whole blood (=1 mL) and concentrate clinically relevant markers to nL volumes (>106 enrichment factor) and search for a variety of sequence variations from both DNA and RNA molecules using a solid-phase ligase detection reaction (spLDR) carried out on millions of polymer pillars fabricated in a single step using replication-based technologies.  spLDR products are electrokinetically swept into nanometer flight tubes with their identification based on molecular-dependent electrophoretic mobilities; single-molecule processing will be carried out using nanometer flight tubes with detection performed non-optically. The system will provide the ability to select all clinically relevant markers (cells, cell-free DNA and exosomes) from a single blood draw and secure pertinent information from those markers in a fully automated fashion to allow transitioning the platform into clinical practice. The research will be facilitated by extensive infrastructure alreay in place and an aggressive Collaborative and Service Project Center portfolio. Novel technology dissemination and training to the biomedical community will be facilitated through compelling workshops offered by CBM2 and the members' extensive networks."

"9315674","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heavy drinking (defined as 4+/5+ drinks per occasion for women/men) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are a significant public health problem. Modestly effective pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for AUD exist, yet some heavy drinking (i.e., relapse) is the most common outcome following AUD treatment. Continued development of innovative and efficacious interventions that reduce heavy drinking and specifically target risk factors for heavy drinking is thus clearly warranted. One novel intervention that has considerable promise for reducing heavy drinking is mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP). MBRP is a behavioral intervention for substance use disorder that was designed to target experiences of craving and other risk factors for heavy drinking. Based on the results of numerous studies, MBRP is feasible and efficacious in the treatment of AUD. However the effect sizes of MBRP remain small and many individuals struggle with engaging in the mindfulness practices early in treatment. There is preliminary evidence from our research group that combining a non-invasive form of brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), may improve engagement with mindfulness practices and lead to significant reductions in heavy drinking following treatment. The goal of the proposed study is to examine the efficacy of a mindfulness + tDCS intervention in reducing heavy drinking and impacting hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change among individuals with AUD who are interested in reducing their heavy drinking. In the proposed study, a research team with complementary expertise in AUD treatment, mindfulness-based interventions, brain stimulation, and cognitive neuroscience will combine self-report, behavioral, and neurophysiological data collection via electroencephalography (EEG) to study the psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms of treatment efficacy following a novel, promising intervention that combines brain stimulation with mindfulness training. The mindfulness based intervention in combination with active tDCS is hypothesized to lead to significant reductions in drinks per drinking day after 8 weeks of treatment and these reductions will be maintained up to 2 months following treatment. Further, the effect of active tDCS on drinks per drinking day at the 2 month follow- up will be mediated by greater mindfulness, greater inhibitory control and reductions in craving and negative affect during treatment and at the post-treatment assessment. Approximately 86 individuals meeting criteria for AUD will be randomly assigned to 8 sessions of either MBRP combined with active tDCS (2.0 milliamp current) or MBRP combined with a sham tDCS (0.1 milliamp current) control condition. The proposed study will examine the efficacy (Primary Aim) and psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms of treatment efficacy using behavioral measures and EEG (Secondary Aim). In addition to addressing the question of whether adding active tDCS to MBRP enhances efficacy, it will further examine issues of neurophysiological and behavioral treatment mechanisms to better inform the design of a future large efficacy trial."
"9304211","PROJECT SUMMARY There is a broad consensus that obesity, diabetes, and its many complications represent one of the major public health crises of the 21st century in the United States and globally. Biomedical research efforts aimed at characterization of the etiology, diagnoses, prognosis, and outcomes of diabetes has increasingly generated large amounts of complex data in many scientific fields including structural biology, informatics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, phenotypic datasets, electronic health records, and public health datasets. Computational and mathematical methods in bioinformatics, clinical informatics, data visualization, and mathematical modeling are needed to analyze and interpret the plethora of data to improve the lives of people with diabetes. With unique resources such as the Utah Population Database, the Utah Genome Project, the Department of Biomedical Informatics, and Utah's Diabetes and Metabolism Center, the University of Utah has an exceptional training environment and has seen many dual-mentored trainees establish independent research careers. In this application we propose to formally establish an NIDDK Interdisciplinary Training Program in Computational Approaches to Diabetes and Metabolism Research at the University of Utah under the leadership of Wendy Chapman, PhD, Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics, and Simon Fisher, MD, PhD, Chief of the Division of Endocrinology and Co-Director of the Diabetes and Metabolism Center at the University of Utah. The proposed multidisciplinary training program spans 18 departments at the University. The goal of this interdisciplinary program is to prepare predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to be leaders in computational and mathematical methods and engage them in the analysis of large data sets involving complex biological problems in diabetes, obesity, and metabolism. Each trainee will participate in a two-year training program that includes a research project with a multidisciplinary mentoring committee, didactic coursework, and professional development opportunities. Each trainee will receive dual mentorship from both a computational and a biological mentor. The mentoring committees, tailored to each trainee's research interests, will draw from a mentor pool of 55 MD and PhD investigators (26 computational/mathematic mentors and 29 diabetes/metabolism mentors). The training program will be overseen by an executive committee comprising the two Principal Investigators and five Co-Directors, all of whom are investigators with strong track records of uncompromising commitment to mentoring trainees. We are requesting support for five trainee positions (three predoctoral and two postdoctoral) to train a total of 12 scientists over 5 years. With this unique interdisciplinary training experience, we expect our trainees to become world leaders in the application of bioinformatics to diabetes, obesity, and metabolism research."

"9298654","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the most fundamental problems in modern biology is to understand dynamic gene activity in time and space in the context of native chromosomes in living cells. The goal of the proposed study is to measure the levels of transcription produced by defined long-range chromosomal interactions in living cells. Traditional live imaging methods lack the spatial resolution to accurately determine the dynamics of gene activity, while bulk assays using fixed material strongly limit investigation of temporal dynamics. Here we propose to overcome these limitations by developing new methods of microscopy and computational analysis. Most of the studies will exploit the unique advantages of the early Drosophila embryo for the development of quantitative live cell imaging methods. Previous studies have identified hundreds of such interactions, and we will sample several of these to provide a titration of varying distances, from tens to hundreds of kilobases, as seen in mammalian systems. There are two specific aims: 1. Develop high-resolution imaging methods and associated computational algorithms for the visualization and quantification of dynamic enhancer-promoter interactions at select endogenous loci in living embryos. 2. Label regulatory regions and associated transcription units of individual genetic loci exhibiting long-range interactions, including trans-homolog associations during transvection at Hox loci, to measure in vivo the effect of chromosome topology on transcriptional activity. We plan to extend this approach to include the visualization of several hundred fluorescent DNA foci in a library of genetically engineered fly lines to establish a general overview of the dynamics of an entire chromosome in a living embryo and its impact on transcription. The successful realization of the proposed studies will greatly augment our current capacity to superimpose whole-genome maps based on fixed tissues onto the dynamic chromosomes of living cells. The resulting technologies will be immediately applied to the visualization of chromosome dynamics in mammalian tissues, particularly multipotent progenitor cells such as mouse hepatoblasts."
"9331739","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this consortium is to establish tools that can be used as biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective assays of social impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials. Specifically, we aim to accelerate the development of effective treatments for social impairment in ASD by validating (a) outcome measures that will be sensitive and reliable assessments of response to treatment and EEG and (b) eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used to reduce heterogeneity of samples via stratification, indicate early efficacy, and/or demonstrate target engagement. The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool (3-5 years) and school aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with IQ ranging from 50-115. Children will be assessed across three time points (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks, T3: 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status. This battery measures key facets of social-communication in ASD using well-validated paradigms appropriate for this developmental and cognitive range. Five Collaborating Implementation Sites (?Sites?), all highly experienced in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the methodologies proposed here in both typical and atypical development, will contribute equally to recruitment, screening, diagnosis, testing, and longitudinal assessment. The Data Coordinating Core (DCC) will provide a secure informatics infrastructure to streamline communication and data flow throughout the consortium to ensure organized, secure data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National Database for Autism Research and NIH/NIMH Data Repositories. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (DAAC) will oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for standardized data collection, processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core will oversee the operations of the Sites, the DCC, and the DAAC to coordinate with federal and private partners in this cooperative agreement to: 1) Compare whether LB measures versus clinician and caregiver assessments of social impairment are more sensitive indicators of clinical status; 2) Evaluate whether this set of ET and EEG measures, individually or in combination, has potential utility as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable measures of change in clinical trials, assessing viability in terms of: construct validity; test-retest reliability, consistency, and stability; discriminant validity ; convergent validity; and sensitivity to change; 3) Collect blood (DNA) samples from subjects and parents of ASD subjects for future genomic analyses and share raw, processed, and analyzed data to create a community resource accessible for use by all qualified investigators."
"9281637","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS in Southern Africa (IeDEA-SA) Collaboration has two key, related overarching research purposes related to the continuum of HIV care: (i) Global surveillance and evaluation of access to, effectiveness and outcomes of HIV care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV-related comorbidity programs (ii) Informing optimal treatment and implementation guidelines for HIV and its comorbidities in resource-limited settings. These areas will be examined across the life course from pregnancy to infants (HIV-infected and exposed), children, adolescents and adults, through regional and multiregional studies, within and beyond the IeDEA-SA consortium. The HIV epidemic is being transformed by massive ART expansion with corresponding declines in AIDS- related deaths and mother-to-child transmission, as well as ART improvements through access to better drugs, laboratory tests and health system innovations. To sustain and improve on hard-won reductions in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, we need to understand and optimize long-term HIV outcomes, including retention in care across life transitions, prevention and treatment of co-morbidity with infections and non-communicable diseases (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular disease and mental health disorders) and address the impact of substance abuse. Hence, IeDEA-SA specific aims are: 1)To study the continuum of HIV and tuberculosis (TB) care from diagnosis through to long-term outcomes; 2)To study co-infections (TB; hepatitis B), cardiovascular and metabolic co-morbidities; 3)To study the burden and care of cancers in HIV+ children and adults; 4) To study the HIV/ART continuum especially long-term outcomes in HIV+ mothers and their children, from pregnancy to exposed uninfected infants through to infected infants, children and adolescents; 5) To study mental health and mental health care provision; 6) To study substance use in adolescents and adults on ART, with a cross-cutting aim (7) To develop and apply state-of-the-art statistical methods, data harmonization standards, data collection and linkage tools. Routine cohort data of nearly 900,000 HIV+ individuals (60,000 <13 years old at enrolment) will be enhanced by linkage to mortality and other disease databases (e.g. cancer and TB) together with targeted additional data collection including tracing studies to minimize mortality and co-morbidity under-ascertainment, and site surveys. Throughout, statistical methods addressing biases in routine cohort data will be developed and used. Southern Africa is the epicenter of the HIV/TB epidemic (HIV prevalence of 10-27% across the region), and IeDEA-SA includes the largest number of adults and children. IeDEA-SA is well-placed to address the specific aims through its long and successful track-record of collaboration between the epidemiologic and operational leadership at the Universities of Bern and Cape Town, clinical, scientific and programmatic experts across Southern African and other IeDEA regions, as well as with WHO, UNAIDS and other information consumers."
"9378831","ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden).

"9474293","Hemodialysis is the most common treatment for kidney failure, requiring the passing of blood out of the body, through a filter, and back into the body. Almost 30% of hemodialysis patients undergo arteriovenous graft procedures involving the insertion of prosthetic shunts (i.e., synthetic tubes) between artery and vein, particularly in the forearm. With the hemodialysis patient population estimated to reach over 500,000 by 2020, the number of patients requiring grafts will reach over 150,000 (30% of 500,000) and most of these grafts will eventually clot. Clotting occurs in these grafts due to blockages that occur in the blood vessel at the outflow site of the graft. As a result, many hemodialysis patients require intervention to open up the narrowing, or stenosis, of the blood vessel. Currently, interventions for clotted grafts involve removal of the clot with a device followed by angioplasty of the vein. Once angioplasty is needed, the lesion will keep restenosing and often the patients need additional declot procedures and repeat angioplasty. While stents are routinely used to open up narrowed arteries, they cannot be implemented in this case. A more mechanically compliant structure is needed. Relatively new, drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are a possible solution. However, DCBs inherently exhibit sporadic and unpredictable drug delivery. Furthermore, DCB drug delivery is currently quite inefficient with much of the drug being lost downstream. This increases the potential for systemic toxicity. In addition, chemical agents (excipients) are needed to control diffusion of the drug coating. These excipients pose a risk of downstream embolism for the patient. A more efficient, safer method of intravascular anti-restenotic drug delivery is needed to improve efficacy and reduce risk of embolism. We propose to develop a nanocomposite-based polymer balloon with microperforations to enable pulsed-flow drug delivery to the lesion. Using our approach, drugs can be efficiently delivered directly to the diseased site reducing the potential for systemic toxicity. Our intravascular drug delivery system is capable of delivering drugs of almost any form, from lipophilic drugs to hydrophilic drugs and even combinations thereof.  -1-"

"9321479","Mitochondria are essential organelles for most eukaryotic cells. They provide diverse metabolic functions including the production of energy and specialized metabolites for biosynthetic processes. To assemble functional mitochondria, proteins and RNAs encoded by both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes are required. In humans, at least 1,000 nuclear encoded proteins are imported into mitochondria, whereas only 13 proteins of the electron transport chain are encoded by mitochondrial genes. The translation of these few but essential mitochondrial encoded proteins requires mitochondrial ribosomes, translation factors, and transfer RNAs, a subset of which must be imported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix. Recent studies in evolutionarily diverse organisms have shown that multiple RNAs are encoded within the nucleus and imported from the cytosol into mitochondria. Our overall understanding of mitochondrial import pathways for nuclear encoded proteins is quite detailed. By contrast, very little is known about the mitochondrial import mechanism for nuclear encoded RNAs or how this new knowledge can be used to deliver specific RNAs into mitochondria.  The revised overall goals of our competitive R01 renewal application are to dissect the main and perhaps only pathway of RNA import into mitochondria and to develop strategies that target nuclear encoded RNAs to mitochondria in reporter constructs and for the treatment of diseases caused by mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In separate studies, we will identify the cohort of RNAs that are imported into mitochondria using next generation RNA-Seq and coupled bioinformatics approaches. Previously, we reported studies that showed that the RNA processing enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is unexpectedly localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), where it functions as a gatekeeper for nuclear encoded RNAs that are imported from the cytosol. Interestingly, PNPase is only present in the genomes of organisms such as flies, worms, and mammals, suggesting that its functions are limited to higher eukaryotes.  To accomplish our revised proposal goals that retain the original essence of the project, we have identified two specific study aims. In Aim 1, additional regulatory components beyond PNPase for the import of nuclear encoded RNAs will be identified. In Aim 2, reporter and corrective nuclear encoded RNA constructs will be engineered to determine the RNA sequence and structural requirements of the RNA import machinery and to develop strategies to treat diseases caused by mutations in mtDNA. For these studies we will take advantage of different model systems that we have established to manipulate PNPase levels and activities.  In addition to increasing our fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms of RNA import into mitochondria and learning the rules for manipulating this RNA import pathway, our renewal application may have a broad impact on public health because our approach could provide a method to ameliorate or possibly cure dozens of human diseases caused by mtDNA mutations."
"9306751","The overall mission of this CHAVI-ID application is to define immunogens and immunization regimens that induce sustained HIV cross-protective B cell and CD4+ T cell responses in preclinical models and, thereby, guide product development strategies for a preventive human AIDS vaccine. Focus #1 will concentrate on B cell and antibody research to facilitate the development of immunogens and immunization protocols that elicit protective broadly neutralizing antibody responses.    Our overall strategy in this focus can be briefly summarized in the following goals: 1) To fully define a comprehensive map of the broadly neutralizing (bn) epitopes of the HIV Env spike. Breakthroughs in generating broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) in the last two years are bringing this goal within reach; 2) To determine which of the HIV bnMAbs provide the most effective protection against viral challenge in the non-human primate (NHP) model. At the same time, we shall closely monitor developments in the field, including suggestions that some non-neutralizing antibodies may have protective qualifies that might be exploited in vaccine discovery; 3) To determine which HIV broadly neutralizing Abs (bnAbs) are most readily elicited through natural infection and how and when they are elicited using several large cohorts to which we have unique access; 4) To determine which immunogens and immunization strategies best stimulate HIV bnAb generation in the knock-in mouse and NHP models, drawing upon data collected on bnAbs in goals 1-3 and emerging from Focus #2. As we gather together information on optimal immunogens and immunization strategies, we will move forward with small-scale human trials with the advice and close involvement of our Vaccine Discovery Scientific Research Support Component."
"9332379","Understanding tobacco flavor effects on waterpipe smokers' experiences and exposures Abstract: Waterpipe (WP) tobacco smoking (a.k.a. hookah, shisha, narghile) is increasing rapidly in the United States (US), particularly among young people. Time trends of WP smoking among youth in the US, show that WP smoking has become comparable to cigarette smoking among high- school students for the first time ever in 2014. Evidence suggests that WP smoking can lead to dependence, other tobacco use, and many of the known smoking-related diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. These alarming trends led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 to propose including the WP under its regulatory authority, allowing the FDA to apply evidence-based regulatory approaches to control WP spread in the US. Given the salience of flavored tobacco in shaping the ?WP experience?, regulating WP tobacco flavor represents a promising approach for the FDA to curb WP use among US youth. This project aims to assist the FDA in these efforts by providing answers to specific questions pertinent to the potential of WP regulation through flavor. These include: - How would flavor manipulation affect the smoking experience and satisfaction of WP users at different stages of their smoking trajectory - How would smoking non-preferred flavor or unflavored WP tobacco reflects on smokers' exposure to nicotine, and dependence; and - How would flavor manipulation influence puffing behavior and exposure to toxicants such as carbon monoxide (CO) among WP smokers. Answers to these questions will help the FDA predict the impact of flavor regulation on WP experimentation and continued use. In this study, we will use clinical laboratory methods to answer these questions, where we will recruit two groups of WP smokers based on their use frequency: low (Beginners) vs. high frequency (Experienced) smokers (72/group; total 144; age 18-30). Each participant will undergo 3 WP smoking sessions that differ by flavor (preferred flavor; non-preferred flavor; unflavored), while measurement of WP satisfaction, dependence, harm perception, and exposure to nicotine and toxicants will be conducted. The response of WP smokers at different stages of their WP smoking trajectory (Beginners vs. Experienced) to flavor manipulation, will allow us to predict the effect of limiting flavors on a wide range of WP smokers. This project promises to provide the first evidence to guide the FDA in terms of the potential of regulating WP flavored tobacco on WP uptake and use in the US."
"9312758","Metastasis is a major cause of morbidity in breast cancer patients so a deeper understanding of the  mechanisms underlying this process is of obvious importance. We have identified a set of proteins, called Id  proteins, which facilitate the early stages of breast cancer cell growth in the lung metastatic site and whose  overexpression in breast cancer is associated with the ability of these cells to remain in an undifferentiated,  stem-like state. These proteins appear to antagonize the mesenchymal, migratory state that allow cells in  the primary tumor to initially break off from the tumor bulk and travel through the blood stream. Indeed, we  postulate here that the Id proteins allow for breast cancer cells in circulation to reacquire an epithelial-like  fate whereby growth and colonization are facilitated. In this proposal we will explore the mechanism  whereby the Id proteins induce this recolonization phenotype by identifying the proteins that are affected  by Id directly and indirectly. This section will be a collaboration with Joan Massague and Filippo Giancotti.  In addition , we will identify the key mechanisms whereby Id itself is upregulated during the metastatic  process under the control of the TGF? growth factor. This section will be a collaboration with Joan  Massague. Finally, having identified a small molecule the affects the ability of Id proteins to associate with  their target proteins, we will attempt to further develop this novel class of compounds for anti-metastatic  efficacy in pre-clinical models. This section will be a collaboration with Neal Rosen, Larry Norton and Joan  Massague."
"9331731","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a gold standard treatment for patients with advanced coronary artery disease, with over 400,000 cases performed each year in the US. While arterial grafts have greater long- term patency compared to vein grafts, their use is limited by availability, and saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) are used in the majority of patients. Following CABG surgery, SVG failure occurs at alarmingly high rates, with 5- 10% of SVGs occluding within the first month after surgery, and 40-50% of SVGs failing within 10 years. The risk of SVG disease and the complex mechanobiology of graft failure are known to be associated with mechanical stimuli, including hemodynamics and vessel wall mechanics. However, standard computed tomography (CT) imaging provides no direct means to characterize these stimuli. Recent advances in multiscale modeling now permit physiologic closed-loop simulations with realistic material properties, avoiding prior limitations f idealized anatomy, rigid walls, and incomplete coronary models. We propose a novel coronary simulation framework that can comprehensively characterize bypass graft hemodynamics and wall mechanics using only non-invasive clinical data. We propose that validated simulations with realistic hemodynamics and wall motion, in concert with modern imaging techniques will enable post-CABG risk stratification and early identification of patients at high risk for saphenous graft failure. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) design and validate a novel closed-loop multiscale CABG simulation framework that can predict local hemodynamics and wall mechanics using only non-invasive clinical data, 2) quantify and compare the mechanical stimuli acting on arterial and vein grafts in patient- specific models, and 3) develop a pilot risk stratification scoring system for post-CABG patients by correlating mechanical stimuli with clinical outcomes in vessels with and without SVG disease. The proposed work is significant and innovative because it will (1) use patient-specific simulations to virtually revers SVG disease thus using patients as their own control (2) enable early identification of patients at increased risk of SVG obstruction whose outcomes may be improved by more intensive treatment and monitoring, (3) enable future vessel wall growth and remodeling simulations which rely on mechanical stimuli data, (4) combine high resolution imaging with sophisticated multiscale modeling of the complete coronary circulation, and (5) directly validate model predictions against clinical data and report confidence intervals on simulation results. This project assembles a unique team including an adult cardiologist and imaging specialist with a background in physics, and an engineering team with established expertise in cardiovascular biomechanics. We will build upon our extensive experience with patient-specific blood flow simulations, and a successful track record of clinical translation and multi-disciplinary collaboration. Our translational goal is to provide clinicians with new tools to improve management decisions for CABG patients at risk for graft failure and improve outcomes."
"9307958","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Airway infection begins the cascade of inflammation and pathology that destroys the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Therefore, early intervention aimed at correcting the initial host defense defects could dramatically improve the course of CF lung disease. We discovered that in newborn CF pigs, the ASL was more acidic, and bacterial killing was impaired. Reducing ASL pH in non-CF pigs inhibited bacterial killing,  and raising ASL pH in CF pigs rescued bacterial killing. These results directly link the loss of CFTR, an anion channel that facilitates HCO3 transport, to an initial host defense defect. We studied children with CF and found that like newborn CF pigs, they had reduced ASL pH. However in adults, ASL pH did not differ between CF and non-CF, suggesting that the inflammation associated with chronic disease may have  elevated the pH. In preliminary work, we found that cultured porcine CF airway epithelia lack cAMP stimulated HCOs transport, but freshly isolated CF airway epithelia retain some HCO3' secretion. The overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms that control ASL pH in CF airways and to learn how pH influences bacterial killing by ASL antimicrobial peptides and proteins. To achieve our goals, we will use a novel porcine model of CF that will allow us to investigate the airways immediately after birth and then as airway disease progresses. Aim 1. Does respiratory virus infection and/or  bacteria-induced inflammation change ASL pH and bacterial killing? Infection with common respiratory viruses predisposes infants to airway bacterial infections. We hypothesize that loss of CFTR hinders a normal compensatory response that enhances anti-bacterial activity and thereby increases the risk to CF airways of bacterial infection. Conversely, we hypothesize that the onset of inflammation with early bacterial  infections triggers enhanced ASL alkalinization as well as antimicrobial peptide production. Discovering the mechanistic bases by which inflammation enhances bacterial killing in CF will suggest interventions to augment antibacterial innate immunity. Aim 2: How is HCO3 secretion regulated in CF airway epithelia?  In the absence of CFTR, CF airway epithelia can still support some HCO3 secretion. We will identify the channels and transporters that control HCO3 secretion, and we will learn how inflammation modifies their expression. The results will suggest potential means to raise ASL pH in CF airways and enhance bacterial killing prior to the onset of disease. Aim 3: How does pH affect bacterial killing by ASL antimicrobial  peptides? Preliminary data show that reduced pH inhibits bacterial killing by some antimicrobial peptides.  Our working hypothesis is that pH affects charge-dependent binding of antimicrobial peptides to the bacterial cell wall, and hence killing. We will also identify bacterial genes that interfere with normal pH-sensitive antimicrobial peptide killing. Understanding the mechanisms involved in these processes will aid understanding of why some bacteria are resistant to ASL antimicrobials."
"9302855","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glutamate receptors that are selective for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) are a major class of neurotransmitter receptors that are essential for brain function. Abnormal regulation and dysfunction of NMDA receptors have been associated with many brain disorders including epilepsy, autism, stroke, and schizophrenia. NMDA receptors play a critical role in the development of neuronal circuits, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this proposal we focus on the role of NMDA receptors in the maturation of neurons and synapses during early life. Specifically, we will address two important questions: 1) What is the role of NMDA receptors in the development of function and morphology of neurons; and 2) What is the role of NMDA receptor alternative splicing in the maturation of excitatory synapses and in the regulation of network excitability. The answers to these questions have broad implications for brain disorders. We use a multidisciplinary approach to address these questions, taking advantage of genetic manipulation, electrophysiology, anatomy, and molecular analyses in the mouse."
"9312902","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project will provide the infrastructure, expertise, and tools for a National Chimpanzee Brain Resource for neuroscience research. Chimpanzees are the closest living relatives of humans, sharing more than 98% DNA similarity. As a result, chimpanzees possess a number of behavioral and cognitive abilities that distinguish them from other nonhuman species often used in behavioral and biomedical research such as mice, rats, and monkeys. Such abilities include basic symbolic communication, self-recognition, third party reconciliation and consolation, tool use, imitation learning, and empathy. Thus, chimpanzees are a unique species for understanding recently evolved cognitive phenotypes, some of which are abnormally manifest in neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. However, the chimpanzee resources managed by the NIH have been underutilized, particularly in the context of neuroscience. There is a broad community of researchers who would benefit from a National Chimpanzee Brain Resource. As part of this project we will create an infrastructure that will:  (1) manage communication with National Primate Research Centers and the National  Chimpanzee Sanctuary (Chimp Haven) to coordinate brain collection and shipping; (2) acquire  high resolution structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging of postmortem fixed brains; (3)  provide open access to and a catalog of T1-weighted structural MRI and resting state fMRI scans  of a sample of chimpanzee brains; (4) develop an online, minable database so that scientists can  query the collection of MRIs and tissue samples and submit requests. We will also develop tools  that will include: (1) MRI-based template of the chimpanzee brain with probabilistic maps of  cortical regions determined by cytoarchitectonic methods; (2) an online searchable database of  grey and white matter volumes, as well as cortical thickness, of key brains regions of interest,  including region-of-interest maps; (3) a database of chimpanzee brain connectivity that will be  developed from diffusion tensor images; (4) a detailed chimpanzee brain atlas created from  histological sections; (5) coordination with the Allen Institute for Brain Science to begin creating  a chimpanzee gene-expression map. Furthermore, we will obtain a behavioral database from chimpanzees to enable the investigation of brain anatomy-behavior-genomic associations. Data on motor skill (tool use, grasping skill), laterality, social and physical cognition (gaze following, initiating and comprehension of social communicative skills, spatial memory, object permanence) will continue to be obtained and data on social behavior (i.e., grooming, social play) and temperament will also be collected for each individual."
"9282545","The Pilot Core (Core B) will develop and conduct innovative research projects examining the ways in which  online and offline social networks affect and are affected by health, health behavior, and well-being. These  new pilot projects are all related to our primary overall themes of novel methods for survey research and  data collection and of mechanisms of behavior change. Possible measures of well-being reflect several  constructs, improvement in any one of which might be said to enhance human well-being: health, health  behavior, subjective affective states or traits (e.g., happiness, life satisfaction), quality of life, and social  connectedness and engagement. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: (1) to support  pilot projects that translate discoveries about network structure and function into a better understanding of  the ways in which they might be exploited to enhance well-being; (2) to support pilot projects that  demonstrate how social network insights might affect how interventions are delivered so as to improve the  well-being of older people (by providing a more comprehensive understanding of social influences on health  behaviors); and (3) to support pilot projects that use novel methods for survey research or data collection,  including new software tools and the application of data science (e.g., by exploiting so-called big data). This  type of translational research offers the promise of understanding and exploiting social network structure and  function to deliver better and more effective health interventions and of shedding new light on many  important problems, including obesity and epidemics of bad health behaviors; nosocomial infections in  nursing homes; diffusion of innovations among networks of physicians; health disparities; cost-effectiveness  assessments of clinical and policy interventions; and the efficacy of community-based interventions.

"9327799","Reduced bone quality is a key determinant of skeletal fragility in CKD, but the details of this effect are not well defined. Non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks (formed via advanced glycation end-products, AGEs) negatively affect bone mechanical properties and AGEs are elevated in the blood and bone of patients and animals with advanced CKD. We propose that skeletal accumulation of AGE collagen cross links may play a critical role in CKD skeletal fragility and reducing AGEs may represent a novel approach to reduce fracture risk in CKD patients. The overall goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that skeletal AGEs induce negative mechanical and cellular effects in CKD and that circulating AGE levels can help in CKD patient fracture discrimination. This goal will be accomplished through a combination of pre-clinical experiments using our established model of progressive CKD (the Cy/+ rat), novel human biopsy assays, and state-of-the art bone imaging with second generation high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography. The multi-university interdisciplinary team is perfectly positioned to undertake this translational work based on their clinical and preclinical expertise in bone, collagen/AGEs, mechanics, and CKD. In Aim 1 we will determine if AGE- lowering drug treatments that reduce endogenous AGE production or gastrointestinal absorption improve the skeletal properties of animals with progressive CKD. In Aim 2 we will assess the effect of disease severity on human bone AGE accumulation and its relationship to mechanical properties by measuring bone AGE levels and mechanical properties from transiliac crest bone biopsies from patients with CKD. In Aim 3, we will quantify the ability of AGE levels to improve fracture discrimination in CKD patients. In Aim 4, we will determine if AGE accumulation in the bone extracellular matrix impairs bone marrow derived osteoblast differentiation, function and AGE receptor expression. The current proposal will build on our body of work characterizing abnormal bone quality in patients with CKD by studying how agents that modulate AGEs through different mechanisms alter skeletal accumulation of AGEs and bone mechanical properties in animals and humans. If these studies show efficacy in benefiting skeletal mechanical properties, these treatments could be rapidly translated into the clinical setting."
"9297189","Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and recent data indicate that alcoholic liver disease affects over 10 million Americans. Epidemiological studies suggest that alcohol consumption also modulates the risk for the development of type 2 diabetes, the most common metabolic disease among older North Americans, with light alcohol consumption decreasing risk and chronic heavy alcohol consumption increasing risk in a J-shaped curve. Chronic, heavy ethanol exposure results in the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Since insulin resistance is commonly associated with the progression of liver disease in individuals with metabolic syndrome, as well as the development of type 2 diabetes, we hypothesize that ethanol-induced insulin resistance also contributes to the progression of alcoholic liver disease. In the past granting period, we have made significant progress in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which chronic, heavy ethanol feeding results in the development of insulin resistance, both in relation to glucose and lipid homeostasis. We have identified adipose tissue as a specific target of ethanol action. While the role of adipose tissue in the regulation of energy stores has long been appreciated, there is a growing understanding for the critical role of adipose tissue in regulating metabolic homeostasis, including the ability to modulate insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and liver, contribute to the regulation of inflammatory responses, as well as regulating appetitive behaviors. Given these essential roles for adipose tissue, the long-term goals of this research project are to investigate the mechanisms by which ethanol disrupts the metabolic and regulatory activity of adipose tissue and.determine the impact of these chronic ethanol-induced changes in adipose tissue in mediating the pathophysiological effects of chronic ethanol. During the extension of this research plan, we propose to investigate the hypothesis that changes in the metabolic and regulatory activity of adipose tissue in response to chronic ethanol consumption are important contributors to spreading of tissue injury between organs, particularly to the liver and kidney. We will investigate the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms for activation of complement in adipose tissue after chronic ethanol exposure; Specific Aim 2: Determine if blockade of the Clq pathway and complement activation can prevent or reverse adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance after chronic ethanol; Specific Aim 3: Understand the broader impact on the ethanol on the adipocyte secretome and the influence of the adipose secretome in the spread of tissue injury after chronic ethanol feeding. Understanding the mechanisms by which chronic ethanol disrupts the metabolic and regulatory activity of adipose tissue, and the impact of these changes on hepatic function, will likely lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or reverse alcoholic liver disease. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and recent data indicate that alcoholic liver disease affects over 10 million Americans. The long-term goals of this research project are to investigate the mechanisms by which ethanol disrupts the metabolic activity of adipose tissue and determine the impact of these chronic ethanol-induced changes in adipose tissue in the development of alcoholic liver disease."

"9281781","Project Title  Rescuing Fragile X Syndrome by Targeting p70 S6 Kinase 1  Abstract  Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the lack of fragile X mental retardation protein, a negative regulator  of translation. We previously showed that mTORC1 signaling, as measured by phosphorylated p70 S6  kinase 1 (S6K1) and elF4E-elF4G interactions, is elevated in FXS model mice. We then found that genetic  ablation of S6K1 could correct molecular, synaptic/ and behavioral phenotypes displayed by the FXS mice.  These findings have laid the groundwork for this proposal, where our central hypothesis is that excessive  activation of S6K1 is a causative factor in the molecular, synaptic, and behavioral abnormalities in FXS. To  test this hypothesis, we propose to 1) determine whether the S6K1 inhibitor PF-4708671 reverses  phenotypes displayed by FXS model mice, 2) determine whether inhbition/deletion of S6K1 corrects  exaggerated translation by reducing ribosome transit time in FXS model mice, and 3) determine whether  excessive activation of S6K1 contributes to exaggerated translation and increased RTT in cells from FXS  patients. These studies have the potential to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of FXS, and  by extension, other developmental disabilities"
"9391909","Alcohol (ethanol) exposure during pregnancy is a well-recognized cause of birth defects and central nervous system disturbances that lead to cognitive and behavioral problems across the lifespan. Although clusters of physical features, in particular those involving the craniofacies, and neurobehavioral symptoms define fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), there is considerable variation in the consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. This variation impedes the accurate diagnosis of FASDs and confounds our complete understanding of the damage that can be caused by alcohol exposure. While some of the individual differences in the consequences of alcohol exposure are due to variations in the timing of exposure, genetic variability is a strong modifier of the effects of ethanol exposure. Elucidating the genetic factors that confer risk and resilience has been a slow process, usually accomplished by comparing ethanol?s effects among various strains of animals, or by candidate gene approaches. Here, we propose a cross-species genetic analysis, utilizing state-of-the-art whole transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-Seq), high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques, and genetic screening to drive the discovery of novel candidate genes that modify susceptibility to early gestational ethanol exposure. In Aim 1, RNA-Seq will be performed after ethanol or vehicle exposure in two closely related mouse strains that differ in their susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of ethanol. This experiment will reveal a number of genes that are differentially expressed in these ?at risk? and ?resilient? strains. Candidate genes are then refined and tested for significant associations with craniofacial and neuroanatomical dysmorphology, as well as neurobehavioral changes, using our zebrafish high-throughput screens, mouse MRI analysis (with Hammond) and mouse behavioral phenotyping. The dual species approach affords a highly conserved FASD model that is more relevant than studying either species alone. In Aim 2, we will perform an unbiased forward genetic screen in zebrafish to identify mutations that suppress the teratogenicity of ethanol. The roles of these genes will be tested in mice to identify conserved mechanisms of ethanol teratogenesis. These conserved genetic mechanisms of ethanol teratogenesis can then be tested by CIFASD members Foroud, Hammond, Mattson in human populations with prenatal ethanol exposure who vary in their craniofacial and neurobehavioral manifestations. Likewise, human whole-exome sequencing experiments proposed by Dr. Foroud will generate numerous candidate genes that will be tested and confirmed in our animal models for the purpose of identifying conserved teratogenic mechanisms. These highly translational studies will significantly contribute to our understanding of the genetic factors underlying the susceptibility to prenatal ethanol exposure, which may be used to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of FASD, as well as provide insight into the teratogenic mechanisms of FASD."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this consortium is to establish tools that can be used as biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective assays of social impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials. Specifically, we aim to accelerate the development of effective treatments for social impairment in ASD by validating (a) outcome measures that will be sensitive and reliable assessments of response to treatment and EEG and (b) eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used to reduce heterogeneity of samples via stratification, indicate early efficacy, and/or demonstrate target engagement. The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool (3-5 years) and school aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with IQ ranging from 50-115. Children will be assessed across three time points (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks, T3: 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status. This battery measures key facets of social-communication in ASD using well-validated paradigms appropriate for this developmental and cognitive range. Five Collaborating Implementation Sites (Sites), all highly experienced in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the methodologies proposed here in both typical and atypical development, will contribute equally to recruitment, screening, diagnosis, testing, and longitudinal assessment. The Data Coordinating Core (DCC) will provide a secure informatics infrastructure to streamline communication and data flow throughout the consortium to ensure organized, secure data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National Database for Autism Research and NIH/NIMH Data Repositories. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (DAAC) will oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for standardized data collection, processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core will oversee the operations of the Sites, the DCC, and the DAAC to coordinate with federal and private partners in this cooperative agreement to: 1) Compare whether LB measures versus clinician and caregiver assessments of social impairment are more sensitive indicators of clinical status; 2) Evaluate whether this set of  ET and EEG measures, individually or in combination, has potential utility as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable measures of change in clinical trials, assessing viability  in terms of: construct validity; test-retest reliability, consistency, and stability; discriminant validity ; convergent validity; and sensitivity to change; 3) Collect blood (DNA) samples from subjects and parents of ASD subjects for future genomic analyses and share raw, processed, and analyzed data to create a community resource accessible for use by all qualified investigators."
"9306902","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for elevated cholesterol, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease throughout the life course. Although parents exert one of the strongest influences on children's health, parent-focused programs to prevent and treat child obesity have had modest success. Parental stress is an understudied factor that may compromise parenting practices related to children's dietary intake and physical activity. However, research linking parental stress and children's obesity risks has suffered from weaknesses including cross-sectional designs, retrospective measures of stress, the failure to consider within-day processes, and a lack of focus on mediating mechanisms-leaving little information to guide the development of prevention and treatment programs that reduce the effects of parental stress on children's obesity risk. To address this gap, we propose a longitudinal study testing a novel conceptual model purporting that the effects of parental stress on children's physical activity and eating behaviors operate through within- day processes that contribute to children's long-term obesity risk in an accumulated manner over time. In the proposed study, 200 working mothers and their 9 to 11 year-old children (N = 400 total) will participate in 6 semi-annual assessments waves across 3 years. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and salivary cortisol sampling methods will capture within-day stress processes. Each assessment wave will consist of EMA, salivary cortisol sampling, accelerometry, and 24-hour food intake recalls across 7 days in combination with retrospective paper-and-pencil surveys; and height, weight, and waist circumference assessments in mothers and children. The primary aims are to test hypotheses that (1) greater maternal stress at any given point in the day will predict lower physical activity levels and less healthy eating by children at subsequent points in the day; these within-day effects will be (2) mediated by weight-related parenting practices (e.g., modeling, encouraging, and limiting of children's physical activity and eating) and children's stress, and (3) weaker in households that have rules about children's eating and physical activity, and stronger in households experiencing food insecurity; (4) greater intra-individual variability (i.e., within-person fluctuations) in maternal stress across each 7-day wave will be associated with lower overall physical activity levels and less healthy eating in children across that same 7-day wave; (5) greater maternal stress at baseline will be associated with greater decreases in children's physical activity and health eating, and greater increases in obesity risk over the next 3 years; and (6) change trajectories of maternal stress and children's obesity risk will be inversely relate over the 3 years. The results will inform the development of novel interventions that help working mothers to reduce the negative effects of stress on weight-related parenting practices, and foster family environments that can buffer the effects of maternal stress on children's obesity risk. Given the detrimental health effects of childhood obesity, such information could have significant public health value."
"9380884","ABSTRACT  The central goal of this proposal is to establish the accuracy of brain tumor perfusion imaging. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI is one of the most widely used advanced imaging techniques in neuro- oncology. Multiple studies have shown how DSC-MRI measures of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) can differentiate glioma grades, tumor types and identify tumor components in non-enhancing glioma distinguish tumor recurrence from post-treatment effects, and predict tumoral response and patient survival after targeted therapy. Despite DSC-MRI's potential impact on clinical care, its broad scale integration has been slow, in large part from a lack of consensus about methodology and how to prevent potential rCBV inaccuracies. Although DSC relies on the assumption that gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) remain within the vascular lumen, this condition is often violated in vivo. If not corrected for, contrast agent leakage effects lead to rCBV inaccuracy, misdiagnosis, and potentially mistreatment. While numerous leakage correction strategies exist, a fundamental limitation has prevented the standardization and wide-spread adoption of DSC-MRI methodology: To date, no study has validated the accuracy of leakage corrected rCBV measures in patients. The lack of validation impacts DSC-MRI standardization efforts, the establishment of rCBV thresholds for clinic use, multi-site comparisons and clinical trials. Given the importance of rCBV accuracy we propose to address this through two highly focused studies. First, we aim to validate rCBV accuracy by comparison to an intravascular reference standard in high-grade glioma patients. Multiple acquisition and analysis techniques will be investigated. Second, using a novel in silico digital phantom we aim to systematically define the range of DSC-MRI protocols that maintain consistent rCBV measurements. Impact on Healthcare: Our primary deliverable is to provide the neuro-oncology community with validated image acquisition and analysis methods for accurate rCBV mapping in brain tumor patients. Validated DSC-MRI techniques will improve its clinical reliability and justify its use across a range of clinical scenarios, including tumor localization, therapy response assessment, surgical and biopsy guidance, and multi-site clinical trials of conventional and targeted brain tumor therapies. !"

Moreover, protein synthesis levels, which are aberrantly high in the absence  of FMRP, return to normal when CPEB, S6K1, or PI3K are ablated or inhibited. The RNAseq/bioinformatics  (RB) core will provide computational analysis of newly developed genome-wide methods to investigate  translational control and cytoplasmic polyadenylation in genetically-altered mice. The RB core will also serve  as a data hub and standardize analysis for the three projects, and will provide an interface to sequencing  facilities for the generation of cDNA libraries and deep sequencing.

"9236190","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Commensal intestinal microbes are now increasingly recognized to control systemic immune homeostasis and responsiveness. The greatest density of commensal bacteria reside within the intestinal lumen, and accumulating evidence shows these microbial communities play pivotal roles during infection with more pathogenic microbes. Studies using model viral pathogens to probe host defense shifts following antibiotic induced eradication of commensal enteric bacteria consistently show blunted expansion of protective virus specific CD8+ T cells that parallels increased susceptibility to viral infections. Interestinly, these immune modulatory benefits of commensal bacteria appear restricted to viral pathogens since our initial studies show commensal intestinal bacteria simultaneously impair host defense against disseminated infection with the human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. Antibiotic induced eradication of commensal enteric bacteria accelerates C. albicans fungal clearance and improves host survival by unleashing more robust and sustained expansion of neutrophils. However, in addition to neutrophils, other protective antifungal adaptive immune components are also likely unleashed by depletion of commensal bacteria since differences in fungal pathogen burden and survival are only appreciated during later time points after infection (days 10-20), yet conspicuously absent at early post-infection time points (day 5) before adaptive immune components are fully engaged. In particular, the accelerated expansion and more efficient mobilization of neutrophils after antibiotic induced eradication of intestinal bacteria strongly suggests IL-17 producing (Th17) CD4+ T cells as the likely adaptive component responsible for these protective shifts in antifungal immunity. These findings form the scientific premise for our overall hypothesis that commensal enteric bacteria dampen the priming and differentiation of fungal-specific Th17 CD4+ T cells that promote antifungal immunity through IL-17 production. Furthermore, given the potent ability whereby the TLR4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide, restores susceptibility to disseminated C. albicans infection in a dose dependent fashion when administered intra-rectally to commensal bacteria eradicated mice, our secondary hypothesis is that shifts in systemic immune cell responsiveness that control antifungal immunity is dependent on intestinal recognition of commensal bacteria through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). These innovative hypotheses will be addressed with the following specific aims: (1) Identify shifts in C. albicans fungal-specific CD4+ T cell priming controlled by intestinal commensal bacteria; (2) Investigate the necessity for TLR4 in commensal enteric bacteria mediated susceptibility to systemic C. albicans infection; (3) Determine the contribution of commensal bacteria stimulation through TLR4 among intestinal epithelial cells compared with hematopoietic immune cells in controlling antifungal immunity. Successful completion of these studies will establish the molecular and cellular immune mechanisms whereby commensal enteric bacteria control systemic antifungal immunity."
"9293987","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K24 application provides 33% salary support to Dr. Hauser to allow him to mentor MD or MD/PhD fellows, improve his mentorship skills, and pursue patient-oriented research in the area of hospital-acquired bacterial pathogens. In particular, this award will allow him to continue current research on the role of Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion in the progression of pneumonia. Bacterial type III secretion systems form needle-like structures that inject toxins called effector proteins directly into the cytosol of host cells. The goal of this study is to determine how P. aeruginosa wields effector proteins in vivo to cause severe pneumonia. The focus will be on interactions between the host innate immune system and effector proteins. The relevance of these findings will be confirmed in human patients infected with P. aeruginosa. In addition to expediting current research, this award will allow Dr. Hauser to expand his research into a new area. Approaches used in the past to address the question of why some P. aeruginosa strains are more virulent than others will now be applied to another hospital-acquired pathogen: Acinetobacter baumannii. Accessory genomic elements (genetic material found in some strains but not in others) will be identified that encode pathogenic factors and enhance the virulence of strains containing them. These markers for hypervirulent strains will be validated in human patients with A. baumannii infections. Both these projects further characterize disease mechanism by utilizing studies involving face-to-face contact with patients. They are thus ideal training vehicles for junior clinician investigators. In summary, this K24 award will provide salary support and research funds to allow Dr. Hauser to spend more of his time mentoring clinical fellows in patient-oriented research, to expand his patient-oriented research activities, and to enhance his mentoring skills."
"9304059","Project 2 Abstract This project bridges long-acting antiretroviral therapeutic nanoformulation (nanoART) synthesis, viral tissue reservoir targeting and pharmacodynamic tests in rodents and large animal confirmatory studies when required. Three aims joint the project. The first, seeks to determine the effectiveness of the targeted drug formulations for sustained antiretroviral and immune responses in chronically HIV-1 infected humanized mice treated with decorated or targeted nanoART. Reductions in viral load and restored CD4+ T cell numbers will be assessed when compared against results seen with native drug, formulations containing untargeted ART and those animals treated with an irrelevant control drug (for example, fluconazole). Parallel tests for potential tissue and cellular toxicities and ?putative? drug-drug interactions, a special concern in the drug-abusing population, will be determined. The second seeks to evaluate further the most effective drug particles with the goal of quantitatively determining the subset of immunocytes in its tissue locale (gastrointestinal associated lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, lymph node and brain) that harbor residual virus. The, third will use combinations of antiretroviral and immune modulatory agents (for example, an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitor (IDIO, GSK3176181A) to induce HIV-1gag/pol-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes with the ?putative? goal of viral eradication. The most effective tested combinations for each of these aims will be cross-validated in SIV/SHIV infected rhesus macaques. The development of an injectable combination nanoART that can be dosed once every 6 months is realistic. Cabotegravir, is an already long-acting integrase inhibitor, currently in phase II trials. With a demonstrated half-life of 21?50 days following a single parenteral dose, it has the potential for an every three-month dose. Our own preliminary data offered in this project shows an up to 5-fold improvement in PK from what is being administered to eople with an even larger increase in drug reservoir targeting. This combined with the generation of polymer-encased pro-drugs of lamivudine and abacavir with markedly extended drug half-lives makes combination long-acting therapy realistic and without our grasp. On balance, we also acknowledge the obstacles. But balanced prior scientific successes, broad in-house technical experience and resources including trained personnel, equipment and infrastructure can meet the challenges. Further support includes access to developed and new antiretrovirals with support from GlaxoSmithKline and drug libraries. NanoART will include cell targeting to monocyte-macrophages and to subcellular organelles (late and recycling endosomes). We posit that modifications made of formulations in size, composition, coating, and charge will enhance nanoART cell uptake and potentiate subsequent drug delivery and release into viral reservoirs. These include susceptible CD4+ T lymphocytes. The establishment of the Nebraska Nanomedicine Production Plant, a good manufacturing production facility now housed at the medical center has enabled improved scale-up production of nanoART."

"9312313","?REVISED  ABSTRACT requested for 1U01MH106660 - 01A1  PI Name: JOHNSON, JENNIFER E   There were nearly 12 million admissions to US jails in 2012.  Jailed individuals face a disproportionate risk for suicide. The time of arrest and jail detention represents an acute stressor that further exacerbates this risk. The epidemic of suicide during jail detention has been recognized. However, less attention has been paid to the high suicide risk and mortality in the months following jail release, as individuals re-enter their communities, are faced with financial, legal, and social stressors, and have increased access to lethal means. Given that roughly 10% of all suicides in the U.S. with known circumstances occur following a recent criminal legal stressor (often arrest and jail detention), reducing suicide risk in the year after jail detention  could have a noticeable impact on national suicide rates. Unlike prison, where individuals have already been sentenced and typically stay from months to years, most pretrial jail detainees are released within days. Therefore, brief interventions are required. Stanley and Brown?s Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) is a brief, adjunctive suicide risk reduction intervention developed for suicidal patients presenting to urgent care settings. SPI incorporates evidence-based suicide  risk reduction strategies in a low intensity, low cost intervention that can be delivered by a broad range of clinicians, making it scalable in the mental health resource-poor justice system. SPI reduces subsequent suicidal ideation and attempts among at-risk individuals in emergency rooms. However, there is no previous test of this intervention (or any other) for reducing suicide risk following jail release. This RCT ? the Suicide Prevention Intervention for at-Risk Individuals in Transition (SPIRIT) ? evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SPI for reducing suicide events (attempts, suicide behaviors, and suicide-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits) and attempts among 800 suicidal pretrial jail detainees from two jails in the year following jail release. It assesses critical mechanisms of suicide reduction in our target population: treatment utilization, suicide-related problem-solving, and belongingness. SPI will consist of safety planning during jail detention and follow-up phone sessions after jail release. Research with previously incarcerated individuals and with suicidal individuals in the community has shown that telephone follow-up intervention is feasible and powerful in building trust and reducing risk among these disenfranchised, isolated populations. This study will be the first randomized evaluation of a suicide prevention intervention in the vulnerable year after jail release. Beyond the human suffering and costs at an individual level, suicidal behavior incurs high economic costs in terms of health care costs and lost productivity. Jails are a catchment area for at-risk individuals at a time of high life stress and high suicide risk, providing an important opportunity for intervention, one that is currently being missed. This study will provide the data on costs and cost-adjusted outcomes that systems need to make informed decisions about adoption, speeding implementation. Thus, the study will contribute to knowledge about both mechanisms of action and system-level intervention effects."
"9517215","R&R Item 7. Project Summary / Abstract The long term objectives of this program are to 1) increase the number of engineers who understand that they have a direct effect on the safety of workers who work with the equipment and work systems engineers design, and 2) increase the number of engineers who choose to go into applied or research positions in the area of occupational safety and health. Annually, five traineeships in Occupational Safety and Ergonomics are available in the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering (ISE) at OSU. These provide educational opportunities to engineering students at the master's level who are interested in pursuing industrial, consulting, or academic careers in occupational safety and ergonomics or related areas. Plans of study typically require 4-5 semesters to complete. Students take courses in occupational biomechanics and ergonomics, cognitive engineering, occupational health, occupational safety, human error and systems failure or resilience engineering, and experimental design. Students are trained in responsible research practices and have opportunities to get involved in cutting edge research that addresses a number of original NORA Priority Research Areas, including Low Back Disorders, Musculoskeletal Disorders of the Upper Extremities, Traumatic Injuries, Emerging Technologies, Special Populations at Risk, Exposure Assessment Methods, and/or Intervention Effectiveness Research. Research projects, seminars, internships, a safety practicum, and other opportunities expose students to several NORA Sectors, including Healthcare, Manufacturing, Public Safety, Service workers, and Warehousing. Students learn from OSU faculty, experienced practitioners, and workers. Students learn about safety and ergonomics fundamentals and emerging trends and concepts, such as resilience, systems thinking, and wellness approaches to OSH. Laboratory facilities and equipment the students work with are state-of-the-art, including OSU's new Spine Research Institute.  OSU's College of Engineering continues to improve and refine strategies for recruiting top-notch graduate students from groups that are underrepresented in engineering. The training program has actively participated in these strategies. The program has strong institutional support, as demonstrated by the provision of Tuition Awards for the trainees, which provide for full tuition support for up to two years per student. Advisory Board members bring experience from labor, industry, research, government, and education, and provide the program with important, relevant outside perspectives, as well as providing direct support to students through internships, safety practicum sponsorships, guest lectures in classes, and seminars. Program graduates become valuable employees because of the breadth of their training, sector exposure, and instructor exposure; some graduates opt to build upon that strong foundation of knowledge with further education and training at the doctoral level."
"9298684","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions are at the core of all biological processes. Despite the existence of powerful methods such as the yeast two-hybrid and its variants, comprehensive quantitative surveys of molecular interactions remain low-throughput, costly, labor-intensive, and suffer from biases that limit coverage to only a few percent of all possible interactions. A major challenge in biology is to develop novel methods that allow rapid, near- comprehensive coverage of all bi-molecular interactions. If they were available, such ultra-deep interactome maps will revolutionize biology by providing a rich knowledge scaffold for a systems-level understanding of biological processes and their high-level organization. We propose to develop a revolutionary ultra-high- throughput technology to easily and comprehensively map protein-protein, protein-DNA, and protein-RNA interactions in any organism of interest. The technology will be: (1) ultra-high-throughput, allowing a single investigator to conduct a deep and comprehensive survey of all pair-wise interactions (e.g. ~109 for all human proteins) in a single tube; (2) It will have the sensitivity and dynamic-range to provide a quantitative readout of interaction-strengths; (3) It will be extremely fast, enabling a single investigator to conduct a global survey on the timescale of a few days; (4) It will enable the monitoring of interactome dynamics-as a function of cellular- state or other perturbations; (5) it will capture the native in vivo physiological state of proteins; and (6) It will be extremely lo-cost and not require the use of specialized robotics or large laboratory real estate. The comprehensive and quantitative nature of these maps will allow us to go beyond the current low-hanging-fruit limits, and for the first time, measure the entire distribution of interaction strengths. This capacity will reveal an unbiased view of connectivity and modularity, potentially revamping our fundamental understanding of molecular network evolution and function. The unprecedented scale of these observations will present unique opportunities for extracting novel insights that are not possible with the low coverage and sparsity of existing technologies. In the second major aim, with the development of computational tools, we aim to achieve a predictive understanding of the observed molecular interactions in terms of nucleic-acid and peptide sequence- motifs that mediate interactions. The astronomical scale of these observations may enable a new plateau in understanding and modeling molecular recognition rules, paving the way for ab initio engineering of molecular network architecture and dynamics."
"9295058","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Being transparent about the use of data collected during clinical care is important to establish trust relationships between patients and researchers. We propose to develop a system to elicit patient preferences for clinical data sharing that takes into account what data are going to be shared and who is going to be the recipient of shared data. Lessons learned from a pilot study indicate that providing such options in a real clinical setting does not result in massive patient withdrawal in data sharing. The proposed project will generate practical tools and knowledge to guide the development and implementation of informed consent management systems. We plan to conduct a large-scale study in which we will:  (1) Determine the best way to present data sharing preferences to patients. Specifically, we will compare preferences elicited via a simple interface (where data categories, such as laboratory tests, and data recipients, such as researchers working in non-profit institutions, will be available) or a complex interface (where items within each data category and within each category of recipients will be available, such as genetic tests and researchers working in the pharmaceutical industry, respectively). These selections will be honored by the research data delivery team through links to our clinical data warehouse for research.  (2) Study patient characteristics associated with data sharing preferences for 1,200 randomly sampled patients from 39 diverse general and specialty clinics. Where applicable, we will also compare patient selections for their own data to selections they would make as surrogate decision makers for others. We will conduct surveys where patients can indicate their subjective perception of disease, and we will objectively assess disease severity from EHR data for comparison. This will help us understand whether disease severity plays a role in data sharing preferences.  (3) Statistically analyze the degree to which patient preferences affect shared data. This will be important so we can ascertain the quality of data that are shared for research."
"9386948","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sex steroid signaling in the lung (particularly estrogens) is of considerable interest, given epidemiological data showing more asthma in pre-menopausal women and aging men, making this of importance in both sexes. However, a fundamental issue is that while studies in immune cells and some animal studies suggest estrogens enhance inflammation per se other studies find that estrogens blunt asthma symptoms, and furthermore blunt airway reactivity. These conflicting data reflect the complexity of estrogen signaling that cannot be explained by effects on the immune system alone, and could involve perhaps opposite effects on structural cells of the airway. In this regard, what is also not clear is whether specific estrogen receptors (ERs) play differential roles that might explain these contrasts. The overall goal is to understand ER expression and signaling in structural airway cells in the context of inflammation and asthma, using airway smooth muscle (ASM) as a model. In asthma, inflammation enhances ASM contractility, proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. We find that human ASM from both sexes expresses ER? and ERß but not G-protein coupled GPR30. While estrogens can non-genomically reduce ASM [Ca2+]i, what is not known are: A) Effects of inflammation or asthma on ER expression and functionality; B) Roles of ER? vs. ERß in inflamed/asthmatic ASM, particularly genomic actions likely more relevant in vivo. Preliminary studies in human ASM show: 1) Asthmatic or cytokine-exposed ASM from both sexes express more ERß than ER?; 2) With inflammation, ERß functionality is enhanced compared to ER?, helping reduce [Ca2+]i, ASM proliferation and ECM at physiological estradiol levels; 3) ER? and ERß signaling diverge in inflamed ASM, with differential effects on cAMP vs. NF?B  and p38.  In vivo, in a mixed allergen mouse model with a Th2 immune profile, ASM ERß is increased (less so in epithelium), while ERß KO results in greater airway thickening, reactivity, and ASM expression of Ca2+ regulatory and ECM proteins. Conversely, ERß-specific agonists blunt inflammation, airway reactivity and remodeling, and ASM expression of ECM proteins due to mixed allergens. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that inflammation leads to a differential and greater role for ERß in ASM, and that ERß can blunt contractility and remodeling. These concepts will be explored via the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: To determine mechanisms by which inflammation alters ER expression profile in human ASM; Aim 2: To determine the enhanced and differential role of ERß in human ASM contractility with inflammation/asthma; Aim 3: To determine mechanisms by which ER? vs. ERß blunt human airway remodeling; Aim 4: In a mouse model of allergic asthma, to determine the effect of ER? vs. ERß on structural and functional airway changes. In Aims 1-3, we will use human ASM tissues from 30-50y old non-asthmatic and asthmatic males and females to examine mechanisms by which inflammation/asthma alters ER? vs. ERß expression (Aim 1; focusing on NF?B, MAPK and STAT6), and mechanisms by which ER? vs. ERß reduce [Ca2+]i/contractility (Aim 2) and remodeling (proliferation, ECM; Aim 3), focusing on the differential roles of cAMP/PKA/CREB vs. NF?B and p38. In Aim 4, a mixed allergen model will be applied to ER? vs. ERß KO mice with/without ovariectomy and with/without THC or DPN (specific agonists) treatment. Structural, functional and signaling changes in ASM relevant to ER? vs. ERß will be evaluated. The clinical significance lies in understanding how sex steroids influence structural airway cells in inflammation and asthma, overall helping to appreciate the mechanistic bases of the conflicting data regarding estrogens and asthma."
"9484756","PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States comprising almost half of the immigrant population and by 2060 are estimated to represent 29% of the total population. Although often treated as a homogeneous population, Latinos vary in culture as well as in genetic ancestry admixture. The former may influence symptom experience and responses as well as self-management needs. The latter influences disease risk and treatment responses, and Ancestry Informative Markers have been developed to quantify admixture for Latinos in the Americas. However, little is known about how these cultural and genetic factors interact in the context of symptom science. The goal of the Precision in Symptom Self-Management (PriSSM) Center is to advance the science of symptom self-management for Latinos through a social ecological lens that takes into account variability in individual, interpersonal, organizational, and environmental factors across the life course. The aims of the PriSSM Center are to:  1. Develop sustainable interdisciplinary, biobehavioral research capacity for symptom self-management  research by establishing a sociotechnical infrastructure including centralized research resources,  2. Enable symptom self-management feasibility research that will develop into new programs of research  and independent investigator research applications by supporting six pilot projects,  3. Advance symptom self-management for Latinos through synergistic research activities informed by a  social ecological lens and precision medicine approaches, and  4. Assess the PriSSM Center activities, impact, and sustainability through formative and summative evaluation. To achieve the aims of the PriSSM Center, the Administrative and Pilot Projects Cores are complemented by a Precision Medicine Core. This aligns with the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model and its four components: 1) complex symptom or cluster identification, 2) phenotypic characterization, 3) biomarker discovery, and 4) clinical application. The Columbia University School of Nursing has a robust research base of symptom self-management studies. There are multiple areas of innovation within the PriSSM Center: use of the Social Ecological Model as the theoretical underpinning for the Center, application of data science methods, and the integration of Ancestry Informative Markers and genetic findings related to common and rare conditions as common data elements in all pilot projects. The PriSSM Center will use the exceptional institutional resources and the proposed research activities to reduce the knowledge gap related to the science of symptom self-management for Latinos of diverse heritage."
"9253402","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this research is to define the specific roles for IL-7, IL-15, and IL-2 in gastrointestinal ILC3 development and plasticity. Compared to other lymphocytes, the greatest frequency and diversity of ILCs exist in the GI tract. Notably, ILC3, the innate counterparts of TH17, are found during homeostatic conditions at especially high frequencies here. Sustained crosstalk between ILC3 and the microbiota suggest that ILCs may have a role in IBD development, and several investigators have demonstrated that ILC compartments are altered in Chron's disease patients and in mouse models of colitis, with a decrease of IL-22 producing ILC3 and increase of inflammatory IFN? producing ILC1. The mechanisms that lead to ILC3/ILC1 balance in steady state and deregulation during colitis remain incompletely understood, but evidence suggests that these processes are regulated in part by IL-7, IL-15, and IL-2. In the current paradigm of ILC development, ILC classes are thought to diverge in their cytokine requirements, as ILC1 depend on IL-15, while ILC3 are reported to require IL-7. Our preliminary studies in IL-7 receptor deficient (IL-7Ra-/-) mice demonstrate that IL-7 signaling is not strictly required for NKp46- or NKp46+ ILC3 development in the siLP. However, these mice do have alterations in ILC compartments, exhibiting a reduced frequency and total number of NKp46+ ILC3, reduced total number of NKp46- ILC3, and increased frequency and number of ILC1 in the small intestine lamina propria. Furthermore, we find NKp46+ ILC3 are significantly reduced in IL2ra-/- mice compared to IL2ra+/- control. Based on our preliminary data, we challenge the current paradigm of ILC development and hypothesize that IL-7, IL-15, and IL-2 can provide partially redundant survival signals to ILC3, but also have non-redundant roles by modulating development, plasticity, and function. This hypothesis raises important questions that will be addressed in this proposal: 1) How does loss of IL-7 signaling result in an ILC3 defect; 2) What is the role of IL-15 and IL-2 in ILC3 development and plasticity? To determine how IL- 7 regulates ILC3, we will perform experiments in IL7Ra-/- and IL7Ra-/- x Rag1-/- mice. To determine the role of IL-15 and IL-2 in ILC3 development and plasticity, we will perform experiments in IL-2ra-/-, IL-15-/-, and IL7Ra-/- x IL-15-/- mice. The long-term goal of this proposed research is a better understanding of IBD pathogenesis."
"9321772","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in neuroscience, genetics, and the understanding of the biology of behavior have provided an opportunity to make profound advancements in understanding and treating mental illnesses. In order to take advantage of these advances, the next generation of researchers in psychiatry will need focused training that integrates translational research with clinical/behavioral training. While there is concern in the field of profound shortage of physician-scientists being trained (Yager et al., 2004; Fenton et al. 2004; Psychiatry's Identity Crisis 2012), there is also reason for optimism, in that the number of MD/PhD medical school graduates applying for psychiatric residencies has increased. Federal research monies have increased substantially to psychiatry departments over the last few decades, and yet, the percentage of psychiatrists with adequate research training, dedicated research time, and leadership roles (e.g., Principal Investigator) on funded grants lags well behind other areas of medicine (Kupfer et al., 2002). In order to address these needs, we are requesting support for the development of a translational clinical research training program. The Translational Research Activities In Clinical Neuroscience (TRAIN) program is designed to provide exceptional training and mentoring to psychiatry residents with the express goal of generating clinical and translational researchers in psychiatry who will go on to become independent physician-scientists. This program will focus on the relationship between disruptions in underlying genetics and neurobiology and how they relate to adaptive behavior, as in the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. This program will provide psychiatry residents training and mentorship from nationally recognized translational researchers in psychiatry. The program includes faculty mentors at UT Southwestern with active research programs, as well as meetings and instruction by nationally recognized researchers at other institutions. The program is also designed to reach out to students in training to recruit th best minds to become clinical researchers."
"9278322","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early experiences develop students' interest and knowledge, and contribute to later success in science- related careers, but many students are behind in STEM areas by third grade. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) offer a vision for science learning that connects core scientific ideas, crosscutting scientific principles and scientific and engineering practices. Scientists and educators at Baylor College of Medicine will develop, evaluate and disseminate new science and health teaching resources for grades K-3 to improve students' learning experiences, skills development and attitudes toward STEM that address NGSS disciplinary core ideas in the life sciences. The resources will be appropriate for use during class time or after school, and will reinforce development of reading/language arts skills. The project builds on multiple successful NIH-funded curriculum development programs and will be evaluated in schools with high enrollments of underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged students. Project specific aims are to: 1) Recruit and support a team of teacher leaders, who will work together and with scientists and educators to guide the development of four NGSS-aligned curriculum modules (one for each grade: K, 1, 2, 3), designed to provide 3-6 weeks of inquiry-based instruction in school or informal learning settings, with connections to health and reading/language arts. 2) Successively field-test each curriculum module and supporting materials, in collaboration with project partners, using a well-matched comparison group study design, with random assignment of groups to treatment (implementation) or comparison conditions; 3) Revise the modules and supporting materials based on field test outcomes; and develop web-based tools- such as social media-discussions, streaming video lesson demonstrations and downloadable teaching materials-to create a dynamic, web-based curricular and professional development resource for teachers. 4) Disseminate the curriculum and related resources-lesson demonstrations, teacher professional development, and student materials-via the established, high traffic website, BioEd Online (www.bioedonline.org), and through other, more traditional pathways to reach national audiences with high quality, low-cost science teaching resources. All aspects of the project will be evaluated, both formatively and summatively, to gauge the quality and effectiveness with which project components are delivered and implemented, and the overall value of the experiences provided to teachers and students. We will measure changes in teachers' content knowledge, teaching practices, and science teaching efficacy beliefs. In addition, we will examine students' content knowledge and students' motivation and attitudes toward STEM."
"9294099","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goals of this proposal are to comprehensively identify the specific sequence variants involved in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), to explore how these key IPF sequence variants contribute to the etiologic, biologic, and clinical phenotypes of this disease, and then examine the generalizability of these genetic risk variants to other ethnic groups. We chose to focus on IPF in the competitive renewal since IPF is the most common and severe fibrosing idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (fIIP), is a well-defined phenotype (1- 3), is more strongly associated with the MUC5B promoter variant than other forms of fIIP (Table 1) (4, 5), composed 81% of the cases in our GWAS (6), and is associated with 16 of the 24 fIIP GWAS loci (Table 1). The overall concept driving the proposed research is that while our GWAS loci can be used to define risk of disease, identification of the specific variant(s) and gene(s) within the 16 high priority PF loci is needed to make progress on understanding disease pathogenesis (7, 8), prognosis (9-25), treatment (26-29), and survival (30), all of which remain major problems in understanding and treating patients with IPF. The findings from the initial cycle of our R01 lead us to conclude that IPF is caused by rare, uncommon, and common variants in a number of risk genes that function alone and/or in concert with or without cigarette smoking to influence the risk of developing both familial and sporadic forms of IPF and that the genetics of IPF may help us identify disease earlier and understand the biological and clinical heterogeneity of this disease. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that specific gene variants and gene variant x gene variant interactions with or without cigarette smoking result in unique etiologic, biologic, and clinical phenotypes of IPF. In Aim 1, we will sequence these targeted regions (16 loci; 6.17 Mb DNA) in 1500 cases of IPF (200 familial and 1300 sporadic) and 1500 controls; thus identifying a broad range of sequence variants potentially associated with IPF. In Aim 2, we will validate these novel sequence variants in independent populations of patients with sporadic IPF (200 familial and 1300 sporadic) and unaffected controls (N=1500). The goal of Aim 3 is to understand how the specific genetic variants identified in Aims 1 and 2 interact with the MUC5B variant, and then explore MUC5B x gene variant, gene x gene, and gene x smoking interactions, and the relationship of genetic variants and interactions to unique biological and clinical manifestations of IPF. In Aim 4, we plan to examine the generalizability of the genetic risk variants to other ethnic groups."
"9306749","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central hypotheses of this CHAVI-ID application are that a successful HIV vaccine should elicit protective antibodies (Abs), and that the combination of B cell and CD4+ T ceil responses is critical for the induction and long-term maintenance of vaccine protection. The overall mission of the application is to define immunogens and immunization regimens that induce sustained HIV cross-protective B cell and CD4+ T cell responses in preclinical models and, thereby, guide product development strategies for a preventive human AIDS vaccine. We propose to develop an HIV vaccine based on a deep understanding of the critical attributes of immune responses that provide protection against AIDS viruses, through two focused and highly integrated efforts. Focus #1 will concentrate on B cell and antibody research to guide the development of immunogens that elicit protective HIV antibody responses in appropriate animal models. Focus #2 will concentrate on CD4+ T cell research, taking advantage of key preliminary data to maximize the T cell help offered to B cell responses through immunization, and to harness the direct antiviral activity of CD4+ T cells. We argue that this combined approach will lead to the discovery of novel immunogens and immunization strategies that will generate measurable cross-protective antibody responses. We will then build on such advances iteratively, by improving the most promising constructs and protocols until vaccine protection is achieved. A critical component of our proposal is the strength of our research team in immunology, virology and structural biology. The Director, Dennis Burton, has made major contributions to understanding broad antibody neutralization of HIV and antibody protection in animal models of HIV infection. The Scientific Leadership Group (SLG) members are Rati Ahmed, Michel Nussenzweig, Bruce Walker and Ian Wilson, who have made crucial advances in describing the structure and function of antibodies against HIV and the induction and maintenance of B and T cell immunity to the virus. The team will be sustained by five Scientific Research Support Components (SRSCs), including strong Operations and Management, that have been assembled to maximally accelerate progress toward the designated goals."
"9439075","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hematologic disorder accompanied by severe pain, inflammation and vascular injury. We propose that nociceptor activation by ongoing hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R) injury leads to the release of neuropeptides by sensory nerves in the skin, stimulating vascular insult and mast cell activation in SCD. In turn, mast cell tryptase activates protease activated receptor 2 (PAR 2) on sensory nerve endings maintaining nociceptor sensitization and release of SP and CGRP resulting in exaggerated neuroinflammation, vascular injury and central sensitization in SCD. Sickle mice show hyperalgesia which is further elevated by H/R and attenuated by non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist CP55940. Our preliminary data indicate that mast cell activity and Evans blue dye leakage are increased in the skin of sickle mice Vs control, which are inhibited by CP55940. Our general hypothesis is that neurogenic inflammation contributes to pain in SCD and that cannabinoids offer the unique advantage of providing analgesia by disrupting neurogenic inflammation and nociceptor sensitization, thereby preventing central sensitization. We also hypothesize that objective, non-invasive measures of pain - EEC and functional MRI - can be used to optimize analgesic treatments in SCD. These hypotheses will be tested in the following aims. SA#1. A multicellular repertoire involving mast-, endothelial-, glial and neuronal cells orchestrates neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia via distinct cellular receptors and signaling pathways, which will be intercepted by cannabinoids utilizing specific cannabinoid receptors (CBR). SA#2. Cannabinoids will attenuate central sensitization in sickle mice and pain in human subjects. SA#3. Simultaneous non-invasive fMRI/EEG multimodal neuroimaging will provide an effective means to quantify pain.

"9361851","PROJECT SUMMARY Multidisciplinary approaches are being utilized by the investigators of the Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network (NNE-CTR) to advance translational medicine for health problems endemic in the aging, rural populations of northern New England, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and substance abuse. These approaches are heavily dependent on bioinformatics, biomedical and clinical informatics, data mining of electronic health records, large data management, high throughput genomic analyses, delivery of integrated clinical, research and administrative data, and study design and statistical analysis support for clinical and epidemiologic investigators. The goal of the Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics Core (CRDEB) is to support and educate NNE-CTR Cores and investigators in the appropriate use of these computationally-intensive approaches and technologies in their studies. Accordingly, the CRDEB Core will provide the following types of support to participating investigators and their collaborators: 1) Support for research navigation, study design and statistical analyses for epidemiologic, clinical and translational studies will utilize a Clinical and Translational Research Catalyst model that has been successfully used to foster T1 and T2 translational research at Maine Medical Center (MMC) to engage new clinical and basic investigators in translational research. This Core will also support a Practice-based Research Catalyst who will facilitate T3 and T4 research with clinicians in the Rural Health Research and Delivery Core; 2) Support for genomic analyses, including data management and analysis of high-throughput genotyping and next generation sequencing data, as well as data mining of publicly available genomics resources, will take advantage of the extensive computing resources and bioinformatics specialists in the molecular Bioinformatics Shared Resource at the University of Vermont (UVM); 3) Support for computer program, plug-in, and applications development for biomedical informatics and clinical informatics analyses, mining electronic health records, and querying public genomic and other research and administrative data sources will be provided. The enablement of contemporary biomedical research increasingly requires the development of new approaches for organizing, analyzing and retrieving data from a plethora of sources and transforming them into knowledge that can support research endeavors. Biomedical informatics is the trans-disciplinary science that is specifically focused on the development, deployment, and evaluation of such techniques. We will extend the methods and tools for delivering integrated clinical, research and administrative data that have been developed by the Biomedical Informatics Unit at UVM, as well as the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics collaborative and its common data model, currently in use at MMC, to all NNE-CTR investigators."
"9301068","Structural and Functional CNS Abnormalities in Myotonic Dystrophy type 1  Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy, causes dramatic unparalleled multisystemic effects. The complicated clinical presentation of DM results from broad underlying molecular changes, including misprocessing of a family of genetic transcripts caused, at least in part, by sequestration of the RNA binding protein, MBNL. The complex DM phenotype follows a multiphasic time course, in which specific features appear at various ages from infancy through adulthood, each DM patient having overlapping developmental, degenerative and physiological deficits. Clinical focus on skeletal muscle in DM, although important, can obscure the devastating CNS effects of the disorder, including: developmental cognitive impairment, progressive loss of executive function, personality and behavioral changes, social interactions in the autism spectrum, and central hypersomnia. To clarify pathophysiology, and facilitate treatment of the CNS effects, the proposed studies will quantitatively characterize a clinically important but poorly defined feature, central hypersomnia, a physiological abnormality that may measurably respond to pharmacologic or genetic treatment. The sleep abnormality will be studied in the context of other defined CNS features including altered white matter integrity (using novel MRI measures), loss of executive function and measurement of CSF abnormalities. While optimism has grown for treating skeletal muscle in DM with antisense oligonucleotides, the proposed studies will now help clarify molecular pathophysiology while also defining methods for studying CNS response to treatment, and establishing methods to compare mouse models with the clinical disorder, allowing future detailed insights into the cause and treatment of this common, complex and devastating disease."
"9325540","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand how TRPM8 is modulated by PIRT. The motivation for this proposal is the significant health relevance associated with regulating TRPM8 signaling cascades. TRPM8 is an ion channel that functions as the primary cold sensor in humans. This channel was initially found to be an oncogene that is upregulated in a number of types of cancer and is currently under evaluation as a target of anti-cancer therapy. More recently, TRPM8 has been identified as an attractive target for pharmacological intervention of obesity and chronic pain. It was recently shown that PIRT, a small membrane protein with two transmembrane helices, directly interacts withTRPM8 and alters the response to diverse stimuli. The mechanism of modulation is not currently understood and there is no structural information regarding this complex. In this proposal we will use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), electrophysiology, biochemistry, and computational structural biology to generate an experimentally restrained integrative structural model of the TRPM8-PIRT membrane protein complex. Aim 1 will isolate and characterize the regions of the proteins that are required for complex formation using a mix of electrophysiology, NMR binding, and biochemistry studies. This aim will also, for the first time, probe the TRPM8-PIRT complex stoichiometry and identify the PIRT lipid binding site for phosphoinositides. Aim 2 will produce the first structure of the human membrane protein PIRT, a comparative TRPM8 model, and an experimentally restrained integrative structural model of the TRPM8-PIRT complex. Aims 1 and 2 are independent yet cooperative in nature: the results from Aim 1 can be used to guide the integrative structural biology in Aim 2 and the output from Aim 2 can be used to generate hypotheses and instruct the isolation of the complex functional determinants. We have generated significant preliminary electrophysiology, NMR, and computational data that suggest these aims are feasible during the timeframe of this proposal. For Aim 1, both NMR and electrophysiology data that suggest the TRPM8 voltage-sensing domain is key to PIRT modulation and we have isolated specific residues in TRPM8 that are key to functional modulation. Preliminary data for Aim 2 suggest that NMR structural studies of PIRT will result in the first structure of this protein. The proposed structural and functional analysisof PIRT modulation of TRPM8 will increase our understanding of how to regulate this channel. Moreover, understanding the structure and function of PIRT may provide an alternative therapeutic pathway to modulate TRP channel function with potentially fewer off target effects."
"9394849","Abstract The hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a major regulator of cell differentiation, tissue polarity and cell proliferation. Hyper-activation of this pathway has been found in skin, brain, gastrointestinal, prostate, lung, pancreatic and breast cancers. Tumors overexpressing Hh ligands also activate this signaling pathway in neighboring endothelial cells, fibroblasts and immune cells all of which subsequently produce growth and survival factors, chemokines and angiogenic molecules that create a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Macrophages representing 10-50% of the tumor stromal mass in most solid tumors, demonstrate great phenotypic heterogeneity and diverse functional capabilities under the influence of local tumor microenvironment (TME) stimuli. Macrophages continuously infiltrate into the TME, where they are polarized to become pro-tumorigenic tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that display an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype. These TAMs facilitate tumor growth, angiogenesis, matrix remodeling, metastasis and immune evasion. However, it remains largely undefined what promotes the polarization of M2-type, immunosuppressive TAMs and the mechanisms through which TAMs suppress anti-tumor immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Using a murine model of hepatoma, we demonstrated that defective hedgehog (Hh) signaling in myeloid cells resulted in impaired M2 polarization of TAMs, leading to a significant reduction of tumor growth and increase in CD8+ cytotoxic T cells infiltration in vivo, suggesting a critical role for Hh signaling in the polarization of M2 macrophages and the regulation of anti-tumor immunity. We further showed that Hepa1-6 hepatoma cells secret sonic hedgehog (Shh) ligands and Shh could directly drive M2 polarization of macrophages in vitro. Taken together, we hypothesized that tumor-derived Hh ligands directly act on tumor-associated macrophages to induce M2 polarization and promote tumor growth by regulating T cell function. To test this hypothesis, we propose to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Investigate whether tumor-derived Hh ligands directly regulate M2 polarization of TAMs; 2) Uncover the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying Hh-induced M2 polarization of TAMs; and 3) Elucidate whether Hh-dependent M2 polarization of TAMs promotes tumor growth by regulating T-cell functions. The long-term objective of this project is to define the role of Hh signaling in tumorigenesis by providing a mechanistic understanding of its effects on macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment and its contributions to immune cell dysregulations, cancer development and progression, which may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting paracrine Hh signaling in the tumor microenvironment."
"9293179","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although there has been intense study of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for alcohol use disorders, up to 75% of individuals meeting criteria for an alcohol use disorder (AUD) never seek formal treatment for their drinking. However, a large proportion of these non-treatment seeking individuals are able to reduce their drinking or even quit drinking on their own. Thus, gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms of behavior change (MOBC) among people who self-change in the absence of treatment may provide some key insights into the most critical change mechanisms that could become potential targets for intervention development. While the amount of behavioral/psychosocial research on MOBC in self-changers has increased over the past decade, there has been a notable absence of research examining the neurocognitive mechanisms that contribute to behavior change. A significant body of animal and human work has investigated the neural correlates of the development and maintenance of AUDs, but there is a dearth of literature on AUD recovery. Cross-sectional research has found that networks involved in alcohol cue reactivity and stress reactivity appear to become more engaged with greater AUD severity, and those networks involved in cognitive control tend to decrease with increased AUD severity. Thus, it could be expected that as drinking quantity/frequency and AUD severity decrease, there may be a reversal of these changes. While some cross-sectional neuroimaging research suggests that recovery of function does occur after long-term abstinence, to date there is a lack of studies investigating change in functional brain response longitudinally. To address this gap, the current proposal aims to examine a community sample of heavy drinkers in a longitudinal design in order to study the psychosocial, behavioral, and neural mechanisms that underlie changes in or maintenance of heavy drinking. Multi-modal neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)) will be used to identify the regions and networks in which change occurs (i.e. fMRI) and the temporal engagement of neural networks (i.e. MEG) related to reductions in drinking over time. Comprehensive assessments of psychosocial and behavioral functioning will be obtained at baseline, and then at 3-, 9-, and 18-month follow-ups. In addition, participants will complete MRI sessions at each visit (baseline, 3, 9, and 18 months) as well as an MEG session at baseline and 18 months, during which participants will complete tasks measuring cognitive control, cue reactivity, and stress/negative affect reactivity. Psychosocial, behavioral, and neura mechanisms of behavior change will be examined using state-of-the-art data analytic techniques, many of which have been pioneered by the research team. Examining the MOBC at multiple levels of analysis in heavy drinkers who change on their own, we will be able to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential mechanisms on which to focus treatments and will provide a key comparison group for future MOBC studies."
"9520566","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Paramyxoviruses are globally prevalent human pathogens and include measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial, human parainfluenza, and the henipaviruses. The henipaviruses, represented by Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses are the deadliest paramyxoviruses. NiV's mortality rate in humans is 40-92%, averaging 75% in the latest outbreaks. Animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission have been reported for NiV, underscoring the need for research and treatment development. NiV is thus classified as a Risk Group 4 and a Category C priority pathogen in the NIAID Research Agenda. Dissecting the mechanisms required for infection and spread will provide new targets for antivirals to block critical early steps in disease pathogenesis. Both paramyxovirus entry into mammalian cells (viral-cell membrane fusion) and syncytia formation (cell-cell membrane fusion) require membrane fusion, which necessitates the coordinated actions of two viral proteins: the attachment (HN, H, or G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. How G/F interactions link cell receptor binding to F-triggering remains a critical knowledge gap for the paramyxoviruses, including NiV and HeV. Numerous structural and functional features of G/HN/H and F are conserved among the paramyxoviruses. G/HN/H has a receptor-binding globular (head) domain connected to its transmembrane anchor via a stalk domain. F is a trimeric class I fusion protein with canonical structural/functional features common to its class. Class I fusion proteins are synthesized as trimeric precursors that are cleaved for activation into a metastable pre-fusion conformation, poised for enabling membrane fusion. Cleavage generates a new hydrophobic N-terminal fusion peptide (FP) that is buried intra-molecularly until F-triggering and pre-hairpin intermediate (PHI) formation, when the FP is inserted into the target cell membrane. The PHI contains two helical regions (HR1 and HR2) with high propensity to bind each other to form a six-helix bundle (6HB), enabling membrane fusion. Our preliminary studies suggest a mechanism by which receptor binding causes structural changes in the NiV-G head that expose a NiV-G stalk C-terminal domain to trigger NiV-F. In Aim 1 we will determine if specific domains in the NiV-G head and stalk are necessary and sufficient for NiV-F triggering and viral entry. We uncovered three new fusion-modulatory regions in NiV-F: HR3, N1, and N4. In Aim 2 we will determine if upon NiV-G signaling, these fusion-modulatory regions destabilize the pre-fusion NiV-F conformation and/or modulate later steps in fusion. We discovered that NiV G/F dissociation is important during membrane fusion. In Aim 3 we will identify the most critical interactive domains in the pre-fusion G/F complex, and determine if these G/F interactive domains shift during NiV membrane fusion. Understanding the determinants of G/F that modulate membrane fusion can offer new targets for anti-paramyxoviral therapeutic design."
"9281684","Project Summary/Abstract for Biomechanics Core  While musculoskeletal tissues have multiple biological roles, their primary function is to provide mechanical  load support and motion to the body to enable the activities of daily living. These load and deformation  requirements vary with tissue type and location, but include significant mechanical complexity such as high  stiffness and strength, anisotropy, nonlinearity, and viscoelasticity. With injury, aging, degeneration, or disease,  musculoskeletal tissues may experience a decline in mechanical function, and this loss of function can  originate at different length scales. With development, growth, and therapeutic treatment, the mechanical  function can improve and change across these same length scales. In short, it is essential that assessment of  musculoskeletal tissue mechanics be a primary focus in both basic and translational studies of musculoskeletal  tissue formation, development, degeneration, and treatment. Moreover, the innovation and sophistication of  biomechanical quantification must continue at a pace on par with the ever-deepening knowledge of  musculoskeletal tissue molecular biology, with advances in molecular and imaging technologies, and with new  therapeutic developments in order to discern the functional outcomes in these studies. In particular,  biomechanical testing must provide information across length scales to inform our understanding of  degeneration and regeneration processes. Therefore, the overall objective of the Biomechanics Core is to  develop and provide a wide range of innovative biomechanical approaches to evaluate musculoskeletal tissue  function in the context of damage, repair, and regeneration, and to provide training and funding for new  projects and collaborations utilizing these assays. Over the last decade, our Biomechanics Core at the Penn  Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders (PCMD) has grown into a thriving resource for the University of  Pennsylvania and Philadelphia area musculoskeletal research community. In this submission, we will further  expand our services to meet the increased demand for specialized techniques and develop new and innovative  methods that address the multi-scale mechanics of musculoskeletal tissues. These developments will provide  customized services that enhance the research productivity of our members. The Specific Aims of the  Biomechanics Core are: 1) To provide guidance and training on the capabilities, advantages, and  disadvantages of the various methodologies to assess musculoskeletal tissue biomechanical function through  formal educational enrichment programs and one-on-one interactions, 2) To provide expertise and service for  biomechanical assays of musculoskeletal tissues, 3) To develop innovative biomechanical testing techniques  that will be applicable to musculoskeletal research, and in particular those that provide information across  tissue length scales, and 4) To provide funding for the development of new projects and collaborations and to  develop preliminary and/or feasibility data for investigators."
"9335229","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Even with the advent of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), for the foreseeable future the Medicare  Advantage (MA) program is likely to remain numerically the most important alternative to Traditional Medicare  (TM). Although MA currently enrolls over a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries, the reimbursement reductions  ushered in by the ACA could diminish the array of supplemental benefits offered to MA beneficiaries, increase  premium and cost sharing levels, and decrease the willingness of both beneficiaries and plans to participate.  Moreover, many of these changes could also affect selection, the management of care, and prices private MA  plans negotiate with health care providers with repercussions for the entire delivery system. Given the  prominence of MA in the Medicare program, evaluating these critical aspects of MA in light of these policy  changes represents an important opportunity for research. In addition, despite substantial new and important  contributions by our team to the understanding of current risk adjustment methods in addressing risk selection,  their adequacy in the face of the ACA's payment cuts remains an open question.  This project continues our study of the provision of services, selection, and the quality of care under MA and how  all of those change over time as new policies are implemented. By continuing the complementary stock and flow  comparisons of health risks in the MA and TM populations that we have employed using both administrative and  survey data, we will clarify how payment changes affect the performance of MA and TM. Furthermore, through  the incorporation of data from Truven MarketScan as well as from several additional health plans that serve this  market, we will be able to examine for the first time pricing MA plans obtain from providers and examine how  those prices change over time and relate to market-level factors such as provider concentration. In short, in our  current Program project we have developed methods to address the salient policy issues that MA poses, we  have addressed them at a time when reimbursement was becoming more generous and MA was expanding, and  now we can apply our methods to a more austere reimbursement policy in which successful ACOs may  nonetheless decide to convert to MA plans."

"9301657","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience.

"9301017","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) is a method for observing the three- dimensional structures of large macromolecules. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular particles, and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. The proposal aims to develop and apply to experimental data novel algorithms for solving two difficult mathematical problems posed by this technique of structural biology. First, classical cryo-EM reconstruction techniques assume that the particles are identical. However, in many datasets this assumption does not hold. Some molecules of interest have more than one conformational state. These structural variations are of great interest to biologists, as they provide insight int the functioning of the molecule. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of algorithmic and mathematical framework for determining structures associated with heterogeneous particle populations. The proposed algorithm is not only faster than existing techniques but is also mathematically provable to reveal the different conformations if the number of images is sufficiently large. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the particle size. Images of small particles are often too noisy for existing methods to provide valid three-dimensional reconstructions; although the images contain structural information, the assignment of orientations to the individual particles is unreliable. The second area of investigation focuses on developing a radical new approach for reconstruction of small particles without the need for determining particle orientations."
"9402547","Acute pancreatitis (AP) remains a challenging clinical problem, particularly in patients with severe disease. Despite its disease burden, therapy remains supportive at best coupled with removal of precipitating factors that may include alcohol or biliary obstructing calculi. We showed a protective effect and therapeutic role of hemin (hemoglobin prosthetic moiety that upregulates hemeoxygenase-1, HO-1) in experimental AP via recruitment of HO-1+ F4/80+ cells to the pancreas. Moreover, we also elucidated mechanism for beneficial effects of HO-1 downstream effectors. Given these results, we propose to test the hypothesis that there is shift in immune response during recovery from AP as compare to acute phases of AP and we propose here to understand these mechanisms in order to improve our understanding of immune pathways that promote recovery and resolution of the inflammation. The specific aims of our proposal are: Aim 1: Phenotypic and functional assessment. Here we will test the hypothesis that resolution of AP is associated with an increased adaptive and decreased monocyte/macrophage recruitment as compared to acute phase of AP. Aim 2: Cellular cross talk in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. Here we will test the hypothesis that activated pancreatic stellate cells secrete factors that alter pro-inflammatory macrophages recruited during acute phase of AP into suppressive macrophages that promote recovery. Aim 3: Innate immune activation and cell damage associated signals in pancreatitis. Here we will test the hypothesis that unlike macrophages in acute phase of AP, macrophages during recovery mediate recovery by suppressing T cell activation and proliferation. During severe or acute phase of AP however, macrophages sense cellular damage components and activate pathways that perpetuate pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Findings from this project will allow for a better understanding of immune responses and infiltrates associated with acute phases of AP and recovery. In addition to the gained understanding of immune mechanisms that mediate and/or allow progression of AP and recovery, the potential impact of this project is of great clinical significance, as our studies may lead to the development of novel therapies that can alter clinical practice in a disease for which no active therapy is available."
"9383217","PROJECT SUMMARY Children with ?high-risk? leukemia receive intense treatments that, while life-saving, can also cause them to develop problems with the way they learn and think. This does not happen to all children receiving these treatments, but we cannot yet predict who will develop problems. One reason that we lack this information is that it is often difficult to test changes in the way children learn while they are receiving medical treatment. Children may feel too sick to complete testing, psychologists are not always available to do the evaluations, and insurance companies may not cover the testing that is needed. In this project, we aim to identify the first signs of changes in thinking and learning using a short, computerized testing program. The tests can be given in clinic by nurses or other staff, and cost very little money. We will test children starting shortly after leukemia is diagnosed, and several times during the course of their treatment, so that we can identify problems as soon as they start to occur. Children in our study will also receive a one-hour evaluation with widely-used tests of learning and memory, given by a psychologist, five years after their diagnosis. We will determine whether results from the computerized tests are able to predict performance on the more traditional tests given by the psychologists. If computerized testing done early in treatment helps us to better predict who will go on to have difficulties, we can help to slow down or eliminate these problems. Finally, we want to determine the extent to which other factors also contribute to problems that develop as a result of leukemia treatment. We are especially interested in looking at factors known to affect children's thinking and learning skills, like a family's access to resources, mental health difficulties, and medical problems that can occur during treatment. We will also be asking children to tell us about how tired, sick, or in pain they are right before they complete the computerized testing program. Because there is some evidence indicating that these types of symptoms may affect children's performance on cognitive tests, we believe that it's important to describe any impact that these symptoms have on children's thinking and learning, both early in treatment and also much later. If we can better understand how all of these factors relate to survivors' patterns of thinking and learning, we can better predict which individuals may be affected by those problems.      "
"9307801","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a novel technology that allows one to image the spatiotemporal dynamics of the epigenetic functional status of histones within the chromatin in real time, thus enabling 4D-nucleome imaging in living cells at single cell level. The proposed molecular imaging system is developed by using a one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library screen to identify short peptide(s) that activate fluorescence of organic dyes or molecular rotors. Activation of fluorescence is coupled to alterations of their chemical environment including conformational change upon ligand binding and phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, or ubiquitination of the peptide. These peptides can then be genetically fused to target proteins such as histones to enable functional cellular imaging in living cells in real time. We will adapt our newly developed technology to the epigenetics studies in this application.  Hypothesis: The Genetically Encoded Small Illuminant (GESI) technology, comprised of OBOC combinatorial peptide library design and serial screening of huge arrays of immobilized bead (~1 million diversities) under pre-defined conditions, enables identification of short peptide- dye pairs that can be used as genetically encoded illuminants to probe post-translational modification of histones in nucleosomes, temporary and spatially in living cells in real time, thus enabling 4D nucleome imaging. Fluorescently activated GESI sites can be covalently marked for subsequent correlative fluorescent and electron microscopy, and chromatin precipitation via dye/GESI interaction.  Impact: GESI peptides can specifically bind to and activate the fluorescence of selected organic dyes. Some GESI peptides will do so only after binding to cellular components such as Ca2+, conformational changes or post-translational modifications (PTMs). Therefore, when expressed in a living cell, they can illuminate the spatiotemporal regulation and modification of proteins of interest. The genetic illuminants are small (1200-1900 daltons), thus can be readily inserted along the sequence of the native proteins without interfering with their physiological functions. Multiplexing is possible and allows us to study cross talks of different histone PMTs and/or recruitments of histone binding proteins in real time.  Specific aims of the proposed project are: Aim 1. To design and synthesize a series of organic dyes suitable for GESI reporting in the nucleus of living cells. Aim 2. To develop GESIs to track the spatiotemporal dynamics of subtype of histone H2A (H2AX and H2AZ). Aim 3. To develop GESIs to newly identify acylations status of N-terminus histone H2A/H3 inside living cells."
"9211412","SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to identify the epigenomic changes in adult stem cells during aging and in response to rejuvenating interventions, with the objective to restore youthful function to old stem cells. The adult brain contains a reservoir of neural stem cells (NSCs) that can give rise to new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes throughout life. However, during aging, the ability of NSCs to give rise to new neurons dramatically deteriorates. Exciting emerging data suggest that NSC decline can be reversed in part by blood factors, exercise, and diet, indicating that specific molecular mechanisms could integrate these external stimuli and reverse the decline of these cells. However, the molecular bases of the reversible age-dependent changes in NSCs in response to environmental cues have been elusive.  Our lab has embarked on a massive effort to identify changes in the epigenome and transcriptome of NSCs during aging. Our results have uncovered a new chromatin signature ? broad H3K4me3 domains ? that marks genes that are critical for NSC identity. Intriguingly, this signature also marks genes with increased transcriptional levels and consistency (i.e. reduction of transcriptional noise). The central hypothesis of this Project is that chromatin changes during aging reduces the robustness of transcriptional outputs, and that restoring such epigenetic changes could rejuvenate the transcriptional output and function of old NSCs. As such, the Specific Aims of this proposal are: 1. To understand how broad H3K4me3 domains and their transcriptional outputs are influenced by increasing age and by rejuvenating strategies in old animals; 2. To specifically modulate broad H3K4me3 domains at critical functional genes in NSCs to reprogram transcriptional outputs and function in old NSCs; 3. To generate systems-level aging models based on single cell gene expression changes in the aging neurogenic niche.  This study should provide unique mechanistic insights into the regulation of transcriptional outputs, including transcriptional noise versus consistency, and how they are altered during aging in regenerative cells. This study should also provide a fundamental understanding of aging in a complex system, comprising a population of regenerative and more committed cells. Together, this knowledge should pave the way for building new methods for `epigenetic reprogramming' of old cells to restore youthful function to old cells and tissues."
"9351174","The urinary outflow tract includes the Ureteropelvic junction, Straight Ureter, Trigone, Bladder and Urethra; structures critical for transport, storage and excretion of urine. Obstruction that blocks the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder, or reflux can result in hydronephrosis, a defect commonly detected in antenatal ultrasound that occurs in about 1% of the population. In the majority of individuals hydronephrosis will self- resolve without causing renal damage, however in a small number of cases hydronephrosis persists and can cause damage to the kidney and bladder. At present there is no way to distinguish between these outcomes. Identifying mutations that lead to VUR and obstruction will be important for diagnosis and clinical management of CAKUT, however understanding how and at which stages molecular pathways act will be essential for validation and interpretation of new findings from genetic studies. In Aim 1, we will characterize the process of ureter maturation in the developing human urinary tract and we will generate a temporal and spatial Atlas of Gene expression. We will focus on genes that when mutated in mice or humans cause CAKUT in collaboration with the Gharavi Lab. These studies will be performed as part of the GUDMAP Consortium, and Aimed at producing an atlas of gene expression in the developing human urinary tract. The urinary outflow tract is lined with a specialized epithelium called the urothelium that maintains a waterproof and toxin resistant barrier that extends from the renal pelvis to the proximal urethra. The adult urothelium is one of the most quiescent epithelia in the body, but can rapidly regenerate in response to acute injury from Urinary tract infection (UTI) or exposure to toxins. However chronic injury caused by recurrent or persistent UTI, abnormal sensory nerve stimulation or chemicals can permanently damage the urothelium most likely due at least in part, to depletion of progenitor populations that normally produce superficial cells after injury. At present there is now way to repair or regenerate the damaged urothelium The studies proposed here will produce a molecular atlas of stromal/urothelial signaling pathways that are expressed during urothelial stratification and define urothelial sub-populations at functionally distinct sites in the developing human urinary tract. Understanding how urothelial cells are programmed and sustained, and how they regenerate will be important for generating sub-populations from IPS cells and will be critical for developing new strategies for treatment of patients with damaged bladders."
"9310449","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an initial submission for a K23 award by Dr. Meyeon Park at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Park is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This K23 award will provide Dr. Park with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) to study the mechanisms of kidney injury and CKD onset in individuals with cardiovascular disease; 2) to study novel risk factor pathways in individuals with cardiovascular disease who develop CKD; and 3) to become an expert in the novel application of a method of magnetic resonance imaging for detecting kidney hypoxia in vivo. To achieve these goals, Dr. Park has assembled a mentoring team led by a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Shlipak, Professor and Chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine at the San Francisco VA Medical Center, and a co-mentor, Dr. Chi-yuan Hsu, Professor and Chief of the Division of Nephrology at UCSF. Her larger mentoring team also includes Dr. Eric Vittinghoff, Professor in the Division of Biostatistic at UCSF and an expert in longitudinal analyses of repeated measures. Dr. Peter Ganz, Dr. Yerem Yeghiazarians, and Dr. Zhen Jane Wang are close collaborators and scientific advisors who will lend scientific expertise in the areas of cardiovascular biomarkers, coronary angiography, and renal imaging, respectively. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is extremely prevalent in the U.S. adult population and is a strong and independent risk factor for development of CKD, which adds excess morbidity and mortality to an already deadly condition. Few studies have focused on identifying risk factors for development of CKD in this group, and there is incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of early kidney disease onset in this setting. Dr. Park's research will first examine the impact of CVD on kidney injury detected by novel urine biomarkers and on clinically evident kidney disease outcomes (Aim 1). She will then focus on individuals with ischemic heart disease to examine candidate risk factor pathways leading from atherosclerosis to reduced kidney function in this group, including potentially via acute kidney injury (Aim 2). Finally, she will study kidney hypoxia using Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI) and correlate this with kidney injury markers (Aim 3). This research will form the basis for future work investigating strategies for CKD risk stratification and early detection and intervention among CVD patients, which will be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award period."

"9300934","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proteome can be viewed as constellations of interacting protein modules, which are organized into organelles, molecular machines, and signal transduction networks. To date, the interaction partners for only a small fraction of expressed proteins are known, yet protein-protein associations are a major driving factor in understanding protein function and activity. During the last 2 years, we have implemented a high-throughput protein interaction pipeline for analysis of protein interactions for ~10,000 human proteins in 293T cells tagged at their C-terminus with an HA tag with joint support by NHGRI and Biogen-Idec. We refer to this as a first- pass interactome analysis. This has led so far to the analysis of ~5900 proteins (Sept. 20th, 2014) by AP-MS, 2594 of which have already been deposited in the BioGRID database based on their inclusion in a first paper describing the pipeline. Additional interactions are being released quarterly and all are free to the public. The development of the infrastructure required to perform a project of this scale is unprecedented in the field of interaction proteomics. Indeed, we have developed numerous new informatic and operational elements into a pipeline that allows a small team of scientists to perform an analysis of 500-600 baits by AP-MS per month. Numerous quality control measures have been developed, and comparison of the interaction partners of the first 2594 bait proteins with existing protein interaction databases reveals extensive overlap with the highest quality CORUM database, while also providing experimental evidence for over 20,000 novel interactions that have not been previously reported. The network identifies more than 250 clusters of proteins, and includes both known and novel complexes. In this proposal, we seek to continue the production of this pipeline with 3 major goals, which were chosen as priority objectives based on discussions with NHGRI. In Specific Aim 1, we will complete the analysis of the remaining ORF clones that are available (~4000 clones). We will also re- visit 1,000 ORFs that failed to generate stable cell lines in the first pass analysis, and will examine 1,000 membrane proteins using a different detergent that more readily solubilizes certain classes of membrane proteins than the detergent used in the first-pass analysis. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the cell-type specificity of interactions for the first 2600 baits in a second cell line (HCT116), thereby providing validation for a subset of interactions and revealing candidate cell-type-specific interactions. In Specific Aim 3, we will employ a Tandem Mass Tagging approach to compare interactions for ~50 important disease genes and several mutant alleles for each, thereby implementing a highly comparative platform for understanding how disease mutations alter signaling networks, molecular machines, and pathways. All data will be disseminated through public databases and will be subject to extensive bioinformatics and network analysis."
"9397329","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is inarguably pivotal to not only hormone-sensitive but also advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Therefore, AR inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, the next generation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have shown their effectiveness in metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) treatment, however, the majority of patients progress due to the development of drug resistance. Androgen receptors variants has emerged as one of the mechanisms of resistance to these drugs. ARv7 and Arv567 splice variants that found lacking the ligand ?binding domain are constitutively active in the nucleus and thus restore AR function despite AR inhibitors. Currently no effective treatments exist for advanced prostate cancer and the only available treatment options is taxanes chemotherapy. Our improved understanding of tumor biology and our continued appreciation for what the microtubule targeting agents can do have helped pave the way for a new era in the treatment of cancer. We have reported that microtubules and the dynein motor protein is required as transportation system for AR for its nuclear translocation and activity and that taxanes inhibit AR signaling downstream of microtubule inhibitors. In addition, we identified that the AR hinge region mediates binding to microtubules is present in ARv567 but missing from ARv7. Therefore, the ARv7 does not bind to microtubules nor its nuclear localization is affected by taxane treatment. These data suggest that ARv7 confers resistance to ADT therapy and taxanes, the most important therapeutic modalities in mCRPC. To date, the molecular underpinnings of clinical ARv7 confer resistance to therapy are poorly elucidated. Therefore, investigations on mechanisms of androgen receptor splice variants ARv7 nuclear translocation and activity are urgently needed, in order to help identify novel biomarker of resistance to novel androgen deprivation and taxanes therapies in mCRPC. A successful completion of this proposal may result in an important positive impact in the field of tumor biology and therapeutic applications of drugs that target PCa."

The upward trajectory of high-impact peer-reviewed collaborative research, guided by center strategic planning and evaluation, illustrates the effectiveness of MCC senior leadership in organizing and coordinating the faculty and resources of VCU to focus them on resolving cancer-related problems."
"9380395","Disordered control of smooth muscle function is common in gastrointestinal diseases, which cost billions of dollars in health care spending each year. Gastroparesis is one of the most significant manifestations of gastrointestinal dysmotility, particularly in diabetes mellitus. However, therapeutic options are limited reflecting incomplete understanding of cellular dynamics within the neuromuscular compartment. Previous research has identified interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) as the cell type most commonly affected in gastroparesis. ICC serve as the physiological pacemaker for phasic contractile activity and mediate cholinergic and nitrergic neuromuscular neurotransmission. Diabetic ICC depletion may arise from reduced insulin/IGF1 signaling and macrophage action, which interfere with expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit. A critical gap in our knowledge is the lack of understanding of the fate of ICC lost from these insults. Cell death has been observed but not consistently, prompting investigators to hypothesize ICC transdifferentiation, which could be reversible. However, evidence of ICC survival following loss of Kit and other biomarkers has been elusive. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to identify ICC fates, their mechanisms and reversibility in diabetes. Our central hypothesis is that depletion of the ICC transcription factor Etv1 from reduced Kit signaling, together with inhibition of ?erasers? of repressive epigenetic marks due to disturbed mitochondrial metabolism, lead to decommissioning and eventual silencing of super-enhancers that normally drive the transcription of genes critical for ICC identity including Kit. These changes are accompanied by the upregulation of the closely related gene Pdgfra, conferring on the surviving ICC the identity and function of ?fibroblast-like cells? (FLC), which mediate purinergic neuromuscular neurotransmission. Specific Aim 1 is to provide definitive evidence of ICC- to-FLC phenotypic switch using in-vivo genetic lineage tracing and novel cell lines combined with phenotyping by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Western blotting and transcriptome sequencing in cell populations purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Specific Aim 2 is to establish the epigenetic mechanisms underlying ICC dedifferentiation and phenotypic conversion into FLC. We will analyze histone and DNA marks, Etv1 binding and chromatin conformation in specific loci and genome-wide. We will perform mechanistic studies using RNA interference (RNAi), as well as in-vitro CRISPR-Cas9-mediated and in-vivo Cre-mediated genome editing combined with longitudinal analysis of gastric emptying. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the role of succinate in the epigenetic repression of ICC genes using RNAi, in-vivo genome editing and the above epigenomic and phenotyping methods. To facilitate translation of our findings, we will validate key mechanisms in human tissues and attempt to restore ICC in mice using epigenetic drugs approved for use in humans. The concept of manipulating interstitial cells via epigenetic reprogramming of cells with persistently altered transcriptional programs will change how we think about neuromuscular plasticity in health and disease."
"9312331","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effect of ABCD1 upon Brain Endothelium in X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy PI: Patricia L. Musolino, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Musolino is board-certified child and neurocritical care neurologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and instructor in at the Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Musolino's research interest lies in the translation of discoveries in human genetics to clinical application in X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and related neurogenic disorders. Leveraging her PhD thesis work in molecular neuroscience and ongoing postdoctoral training in neuroimaging and in- vitro modeling of the blood brain barrier (BBB), Dr. Musolino will build on mentored project and structured educational activities to gain proficiency in the following new research areas: (1) Novel applications of neuroimaging techniques for biomarker selection, disease prediction, and risk stratification; (2) Design experimental in-vitro assays to measure the impact of single genes upon BBB biology; (3) Pursue research in translational genetics to leverage insights from in-vivo neuroimaging-derived parameters to test single gene effects in-vitro; and (5) Master advanced statistical and neuroepidemiology methods vital for the design of clinical studies that test efficacy and effectiveness of interventions in neurogenic disorders. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a devastating neurologic disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids that affects 1:17,000 individuals in the U.S. Approximately 60% of male patients with ALD will convert to a devastating rapidly progressive form of inflammatory demyelination that leads to a vegetative state or death within 2-3 years. An important challenge facing clinical care of patients with ALD is the lack of robust predictive tool and model systems. Unfortunately current treatments targeting diffuse metabolic or hematopoietic cell correction either fails to prevent cerebral disease or carry high toxicity. BBB disruption has for a long time been implicated as crucial to disease progression, and preliminary data suggests that decreased dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR perfusion in the white matter precedes lesion progression. Based on these observations and preliminary work in-vitro Dr. Musolino hypothesizes that increases in white matter BBB permeability can be detected with DSC MR Perfusion prior to lesion progression and are the result of the lack of functional ABCD1 in brain endothelium. To test this hypothesis Dr. Musolino will probe the effect of ABCD1 deficiency upon BBB integrity at both the tissue and molecular level by (1) Applying new DSC MR perfusion algorithms to determine if regional changes in white matter microvascular permeability occur prior to lesion progression in patients with ALD (Aim 1) and; (2) Evaluating in-vitro the effects of lack of ABCD1 upon the barrier function of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (Aim 2). If validated by this study, Dr. Musolino's approach sets forth a successful strategy to: (1) establish mechanisms involved in the phenotypic conversion; (2) identify which patients are at risk of developing cerebral disease; (3) monitor and improving our current treatments and; (4) develop an assay to screen for novel therapeutic targets. Dr. Musolino's multidisciplinary team of mentors include Dr. Florian Eichler, expert in leukodystrophies, and Dr. Bruce Rosen, world leader in advanced functional neuroimaging, as well as collaborators and senior faculty members with complementary expertise that will guide this research and promote her career development during the transition to become an independent investigator."
"9511953","ABSTRACT  While the importance of chemical modifications of DNA and proteins is well established, relatively little is known about how the post-transcriptional modification of mRNA transcripts affects their function. The most common modified base seen on cellular mRNAs in mammals is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and recent data demonstrate that the total loss of m6A formation can have severe deleterious consequences, for example blocking the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. However, how m6A regulates mRNA expression remains to be established. Moreover, previous work has revealed that several viruses encode mRNAs that undergo m6A modification suggesting that such modifications likely exert a positive effect on virus replication. This grant proposal seeks to define the sites of m6A modification on HIV-1 transcripts and to determine how these modifications affect HIV-1 gene expression and replication. Using the PAR-CLIP technique, we have identified several specific binding sites for the human YTHDF m6A reader proteins on the HIV-1 genome that are also bound in vitro by an m6A-specific antibody. Of interest, these m6A editing sites are conserved across a wide range of HIV-1 isolates. We have demonstrated that these viral m6A sites are maintained in indicator constructs containing segments of the HIV-1 genome and have observed that mutagenesis of these m6A sites results in a significant reduction in mRNA expression. Consistent with the hypothesis that m6A editing positively regulates HIV-1 gene expression, we have observed that overexpression of the human YTHDF2 reader protein in human CD4+ T cells enhances HIV-1 replication while knock out of the YTHDF2 gene by genome editing inhibits HIV-1 replication. This grant first aims to define the locations of m6A modifications on the HIV-1 genome at single nucleotide resolution and to then quantify the degree of editing at each site. We will then use targeted viral mutagenesis to determine precisely how specific m6A modifications affect HIV-1 gene expression and replication. In parallel, we will examine how the overexpression, in CD4+ T cells, of key cellular proteins involved in ?writing?, ?reading? and ?erasing? m6A marks, or their elimination by genome editing using CRISPR/Cas, affects HIV-1 replication. Finally, we intend to extend this analysis to the experimentally tractable animal retrovirus murine leukemia virus in order to determine whether m6A editing represents a general strategy to promote retroviral gene expression and replication."
"9281901","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic inflammation, defined by a persistent elevation of local and systemic pro-inflammatory factors, is a hallmark of biological aging. We and others have shown that chronic levels of circulating downstream markers of systemic inflammation are associated with age-related disease states, particularly cardiovascular disease, as well as longevity. However, accumulating evidence suggests that upstream mediators of inflammation are more likely to play a causal role in disease pathogenesis and, in turn, serve as effective therapeutic targets. Upstream initiation of inflammation in humans is governed primarily by small molecule effectors of arachidonic acid metabolism, termed eicosanoids. These bioactive lipid effectors of both pro- and anti-inflammatory activity include thromboxanes, prostaglandins, lipoxins, and leukotrienes. To date, the interaction between eicosanoid pathways and age-related disease phenotypes remain poorly understood, thus limiting our ability to harness their therapeutic potential. This proposal aims to provide a more detailed understanding of how upstream eicosanoid pathways can be variably active, imbalanced, and perturbed in relation to an individual?s propensity for developing or escaping age-related disease. Emerging data suggest that select eicosanoids and genetic polymorphisms in enzymes contributing to their biosynthesis are associated particularly with cardiovascular risk as well as longevity, but comprehensive studies in large cohorts are lacking. Advanced methods using mass spectrometry now allow for the rapid and accurate quantification of >150 upstream eicosanoid mediators representing the multiple enzymatic origins. We will use these methods to comprehensively assay distinct pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids and examine their relation to measures of healthy cardiovascular aging and longevity outcomes in a large cohort of women, enriched with individuals representing the spectrum of risk factor burden as well as a range of achieved lifespans. The goal of this study is to advance our understanding of how upstream inflammatory pathways are related to healthy aging and longevity in women, who continue to outlive men and yet carry a greater burden of chronic disease in later life than men for reasons that remain unclear. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to assess whether circulating eicosanoid mediators of systemic inflammation are associated with longevity in women; and, (2) to evaluate the association between distinct eicosanoid mediators of systemic inflammation and morbidity profiles in women. Our systematic approach to comprehensively investigating the components of upstream inflammatory activity in a large, well-phenotyped cohort promises to yield important insights into the determinants of healthy aging and longevity. Importantly, given its focus on upstream inflammatory activity, this work will pave the way for follow-up studies investigating the efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapies (both existing and novel agents) for modulating variation in distinct eicosanoids as well as outcomes."
"9321382","Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to promote an independent research career by bridging the candidate's training in infant development and pediatric neuroimaging with innovations in biomedical imaging, advances in statistical methods for longitudinal data analysis, and cutting- edge clinical science.  The candidate's short-term goal is to identify changes in the brain that accompany transitions in social behavior in typical infancy and disruptions thereof in ASD. This work is motivated by a recent finding that preferential attention to the eyes of others?a basic mechanism of social adaptive action in typical infants?was not immediately diminished in infants later diagnosed with ASD. Instead, infants later diagnosed with ASD exhibited a slight but significant increase in eye-looking at 2 months, which then declined; in contrast, typical infants exhibited a relative low point in eye-looking at 2 months, which then increased. The timing of this difference coincides with a developmental transition, around month 2, in which typical infants are thought to move from experience-expectant mechanisms of social adaptive action (that is: subcortically- mediated, `reflex-like' behaviors) to experience-dependent ones (i.e., cortically-mediated voluntary actions that build iteratively on new experiences). This theoretical account suggests a specific hypothesis in ASD: reflex- like adaptive action may initially be present, while the emergence of experience-dependent voluntary social adaptive action subsequently fails. This study will test this hypothesis by measuring, from birth to 6 months in infants at low and high-risk for ASD,: 1) the decline of reflex-like predispositions and the emergence of voluntary behaviors (eye-looking and social smiling, measured by eye-tracking and parent-infant interaction); and 2) developmental change in subcortical and cortical networks (measured by fMRI and DTI) and their relationship to unfolding behavior. To achieve these aims, the candidate will receive training in 5 areas: 1) phenotypic assessment of infants at low and high-risk for ASD; 2) advances in eye-tracking technology that optimize data acquisition in neonates; 3) innovations in biomedical imaging for improving acquisition and pre- processing of infant neuroimaging data; 4) analysis of infant resting-state fMRI and DTI data; and 5) breakthroughs in statistical methods for the analysis of infant longitudinal data. The training plan is supported by a multidisciplinary team of mentors?including Drs. Ami Klin, Warren Jones, John Pruett, Gordon Ramsay, and Xiaoping Hu?and the strengths of two centers within Emory: the Marcus Autism Center, one of only three NIH Autism Centers of Excellence, providing groundbreaking research and clinical care for individuals with ASD, and the Biomedical Imaging Technology Center, a center for cutting-edge biomedical imaging research. The intersection of these strengths provides an ideal training environment for promoting the candidate's long- term goal of understanding the pathogenesis of ASD and informing intervention."
"9301601","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project employs a combined experimental and computational approach to develop mechanisms by which ordinary proteins can be converted into molecular switches. Induced domain swapping (INDOS) is a technology that allows the function of a protein or enzyme to be switched on and off by a small molecule drug, metal ion, or change in pH. INDOS will be used to manipulate cellular pathways, in living cells and in real time, to examine their roles in health and disease. Protein fragment exchange (FREX) and alternate frame folding (AFF) are mechanisms by which an arbitrary binding protein can be turned into a fluorescent biosensor. We will generate a family of sensors for detecting a variety of biological targets in vivo and in vitro. The impact of this study lies in that the switching mechanisms being developed: (i) are general and can be applied to many proteins; (ii) are versatile, allowing the resulting switches to perform a variety of new and useful functions; and (iii) will provide insight into their underlying molecular phenomena (domain swapping, fragment complementation, and circular permutation), all of which occur commonly in nature yet are poorly understood."
"9274102","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There does not currently exist a technology that predicts the course of aberrant fracture during the critically-important early healing phase (<4 weeks post-operative). This represents a significant clinical detriment and impedes decision-making with regard to whether the administration of additional therapies (such as biologics) should be implemented. Accordingly, we have previously developed a biocompatible, microelectromechanical rigid substrate sensor (bioMEMS) that telemetrically reports fracture fixation plate implant strain data. The overarching goal of this research endeavor is to evolve our innovative bioMEMS sensing technique into flexible multi-sensor configuration embodiments (fs-bioMEMS) in order to affect a significant improvement in post-surgical orthopaedic diagnostics. In this proposal, we seek to apply our bioMEMS technology to facilitate post-surgical diagnostics for two of the most prevalent orthopaedic fracture conditions in contemporary medicine (namely, difficult diaphyseal and metaphyseal fractures). There is a very high clinical demand for diagnosing early and aberrant fracture healing. The inability to detect these events is a major limiting step for implementing new and relatively non-invasive revision strategies. We have developed an innovative technology that seeks to overcome this challenge by reporting the transient load transfer profile between bone and implanted hardware. A unique embodiment of this technology includes using a flexible substrate that allows for implementation of the sensor architecture on implants with curved surfaces, providing implementation on a much broader range of implants including IM rods and curved fixation plates. Therefore, more challenging fracture patterns can be monitored during the early healing phase, including diaphyseal and supracondylar fractures. In addition, in order to overcome the considerable inherent variability associated with different loading conditions, our group has redesigned the sensor's circuit architecture to be responsive to principal strains. The proposed research seeks to further develop the fs-bioMEMS sensor architecture in order to optimize multi-sensing methods (Specific Aim 1) and use an in vivo platforms to evaluate the sensor's ability to monitor and predict fracture healing (Specific Aims 2 and 3). In addition to monitoring the healing cascade, we also propose to examine the intra- implant strain profiles and resultant healing effects associated with plates having different rigidities (Specific Aim 3) in order to address how different fractures could be more optimally treated"
"9320724","RESEARCH & RELATED - OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the Program Project is to explore the functional properties of the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors through the development of suitable novel ligands and by obtaining structural and functional information on these receptors. During the current cycle, we have developed high-affinity covalent and non- covalent CB1/CB2 ligands to study their foot-printing at the receptor using a Ligand Assisted Protein Structure (LAPS) approach which includes the use of covalent ligands, receptor mutants and LC/MS/MS methods. The results are further elaborated using computationally-derived receptor models. To date, our results provide initial evidence that different classes of cannabinergic ligands interact and activate/deactivate the CB1 and CB2 receptors through distinct binding motifs associated with distinct ligand-receptor conformations. In parallel with our ligand and CB1/CB2 structural work, our collaborators have provided evidence that CB1 (Bohn) and CB2 (Mackie) different agonists activate these receptors through distinct signaling pathways (functional selectivity). We have hypothesized that the individual ligand- receptor binding motifs we have identified, in turn, may be associated with distinct identifiable signaling pathways leading to different ligand-associated pharmacological profiles. A central theme for this Program Project renewal application is that distinct signaling profiles identified within CB1 and CB2 will allow us to design functionally selective ligands. This novel functional pharmacophore-based drug design should lead to new ligands with improved pharmacological profiles. This Program Project renewal proposes to: 1) design and synthesize first and later generation covalent and non-covalent ligands to be used to probe the functional properties and binding motifs of the key classes of cannabinergic ligands; 2) identify the binding motifs of the covalent ligands by using receptor mutants and LC/MS/MS methods; 3) Identify CB1 and CB2 signaling profiles of the most successful ligands; and 4) evaluate in vivo the CB1 and CB2 ligands using the mouse tetrad test as well as in animal models for neuropathic pain. The results to be obtained will serve as a basis for the development for therapies for addiction and pain."

"9310038","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease has been a leading cause of death worldwide. Although there have been many advances in the medial management and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease, issues still arise due to the usage of synthetic materials. These complications typically are associated thromboembolic events such as stenosis and the lack of growth potential. Here we aim to improve upon the design of vascular grafts, and vascular implants in general, by developing a graft with a patterned and functionalized surface which we hypothesize will encourage cell proliferation and expansion across our biodegradable scaffold. As such, a tissue engineered vascular graft that has an endothelial cell monolayer covering the inside of the graft prior to implantation will mitigate problems such as stenosis due to endothelial cells modulating vascular homeostasis. Furthermore, the polymer scaffold will break down over time leaving the native tissue to take over the structural support of the implant and thus will allow for the implanted region to grow and develop with the individual. Three aims are proposed to address this hypothesis: (1) in vitro testing and development of the patterned and functionalized substrates; (2) in vitro assessment of bioreactor seeding and expansion of hiPSC-derived ECs to form a monolayer on the vascular graft; and (3) in vivo assessment of the hiPSC-derived EC seeded vascular grafts. The goal of this project is to develop a patient-specific tissue engineering solution to problems with cardiovascular disease utilizing 3D printing technology and human induced pluripotent stem cells. We are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to 3D print luminal features on a vascular graft that can influence the phenotype and response of endothelial cells. The combination of 3D printing cues for cells in conjunction with hiPSCs can be used in many other applications and this approach would be a proof of concept while addressing a clinically relevant need. Additionally, this project will provide me with training necessary for my advancement necessary as an independent researcher. Research activities will be comprised mainly of research (80%), writing grant proposals and manuscripts, and meeting with my advisors (10%), advising undergraduates and graduate students and managing the laboratory (5%), and engaging in professional activities (5%)."
"9306086","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The objectives of the Molecular Mechanisms of Toxicity Training Program are to provide pre-doctoral trainees with a fundamental education in the mechanisms by which environmental exposures induce human disease, integrated with the basic cellular processes upon which environmental agents impact and cause disease. The training program is based on an understanding of biochemistry, physiology, and molecular/cell biology, toxicology courses in mechanisms by which environmental agents induce toxicity, together with the cellular and molecular processes by which the body defends itself against environmental insult. This didactic training is intimately coupled with in-depth laboratory research training. The goal is to prepare the next generation of scientists to address the ever-present environmental challenges to human health by the prevention of disease, either by nutritional or life-style intervention where possible, or by otherwise exploiting human defense systems. The Training Program is based in the Department of Toxicology and Cancer Biology (DTCB), a basic science department in the College of Medicine that grants the Ph.D. in toxicology and provides an administrative and teaching nucleus of 18 Core Faculty. Joint Faculty from the Colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Agriculture enrich the diversity of training opportunities; 26 of these Core and Joint Faculty with strong research programs make up the Training Grant Faculty. This application requests support for 4 pre-doctoral trainees, and is focused on three disease areas that have an environmental basis: Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease and Neurotoxicity/Neurodegenerative Disease. Oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair and metabolomics are mechanistic themes that underlie many of the research programs and provide highly collaborative and multidisciplinary approaches to problems, thereby providing a rich research training environment. The pre-doctoral training program requires a Biomedical Base (18 credits, including Ethics in Scientific Research), a Toxicology Base (12-14 credits), and an Elective identified by the student's Advisory Committee (3 credits). Pre-doctoral trainees will be supported for a maximum of three years, e.g., years 2-4 of doctoral training. Current enrollment in the Toxicology Ph.D. program is 25, including three Underrepresented Minority students. Recent minority graduates have been primarily recruited from the University of Puerto Rico and have been supported by T35 and R25 NIEHS mechanisms that support summer research experiences in Toxicology; this longstanding tradition of a diverse student body continues to attract new minority students to the training program. The University continues to provide strong support for the DTCB in the form of student fellowships, supplementation to this Training Grant, and new faculty lines, space and equipment so that the program has grown vigorously over the last five years, and is anticipated to continue to do so."
"9327010","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One essential feature common to all demographic phenomena is variability across units of analysis. Individuals differ greatly not only in attribute and outcomes of interest to social and behavioral scientists, but also in how they respond to a common treatment, intervention, or stimulation. We call the second type of variability heterogeneous treatment effects. The proposed research assembles an interdisciplinary team, encompassing such diverse fields as sociology, economics, statistics, and demography, to investigate the consequences of and methodological approaches to heterogeneous treatment effects. The proposed research has five specific aims:  1. It will demonstrate, with combined observational and experimental data, heterogeneous treatment effects in demographic research.  2. It will develop new statistical methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using the instrumental variable approach with quasi-experimental data.  3. It will further demonstrate the usefulness of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in observational data with propensity score methods, especially with applications to studies of the impact of family-level shocks on children's psychosocial skills.  4. It will demonstrate, through micro-level simulations, that in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects, the use of standard statistical methods may give rise to treatment effect estimates with compositional biases.  5. It will develop a set of diagnostic and analytical tools that will help researchers and practitioners o analyze heterogeneous treatment effects in demographic research. The proposed research will provide new knowledge and practical solutions for dealing with heterogeneous treatment effects in demographic research. We will make computer programs produced by this research publically available. We expect several articles and a book to result from the project."
"9355189","?    DESCRIPTION:   Safe, injectable, elastomeric biomaterials to augment tissue volume and improve biomechanical functions during tissue regeneration remain as a significant clinical need. One example is preterm birth, which occurs in greater than 500,000 pregnancies per year, or 12.3% of all pregnancies in the U.S., and for which there remain poor clinical options. To address this need, in our recent studies we have developed a new family of silk protein-based elastomers with an extraordinary range of mechanical features and based on an FDA approved material. The features of these protein elastomers include tunable mechanics, tunable biodegradation, biocompatibility and options for growth factor decoration, suggesting a suitable match to the needs in the field of soft tissue augmentation. The hypothesis is that modulating silk elastomer formation and functionalization can provide a new family of injectable elastomers to meet a broad range of tissue augmentation needs, such as for the treatment of preterm birth. The planned studies build on our extensive preliminary data, with both fundamental biomaterials studies planned, combined with a targeted clinical application where new options are a current critical need. The goal is to restore cervical tissue functions and prevent preterm birth in instances where dysfunctional cervical tissue is the cause. The three Aims focus on optimizing the biomaterial properties to match mechanics, injectability and kinetics, in vitro assessments of mechanical and biological functions, and in vivo studies of cervical augmentation in a rabbit model."
"9394169","Children with autism struggle to recognize facial expressions, make eye contact, and engage in social interactions. Many of these children can have dramatic recoveries, particularly if social skills are taught from an early age. However, in today's healthcare system the delivery of the behavioral intervention is bottlenecked by a sharp and increasing imbalance in the number of behavioral therapists and the number of children in need of care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop mobilized methods of care delivery. We have developed an artificial intelligence tool for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass through an Android app and delivers instantaneous social cues to individuals with autism in their natural environment, providing therapy that today is given only by clinicians in non-scalable person-to- person sessions. The system leverages Glass's outward facing camera to read a person's facial expressions and passes facial landmarks to an Android native app for immediate machine learning-based emotion classification. The system then gives the child wearer real-time social cues and records social responses. We believe that the system's ability to provide continuous behavioral therapy outside of clinical settings will enable dramatically faster gains in social acuity that will, within a limited and self-directed period of use, permit the child to engage in social settings on his/her own. This proposal outlines three main aims needed to test, refine and optimize the tools and a series of validation experiments needed to bring our system from prototype to a viable clinical tool that every family can use regularly from home for precision healthcare. RELEVANCE {See instructions): We have developed a combined software-hardware solution built on top of Google Glass that enables real lime expression recognition and field-of-view eye tracking to capture social interaction data and give guiding social cues to an individual with Autism. This project will test and optimize the potential of this tool to provide continuous and naturalized behavioral therapy to children with autism from their homes."
"9361607","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematuria is the most common presentation of bladder cancer (BCa) with 22% of patients with gross hematuria and 8% of patients with microscopic hematuria harboring BCa. Voided urinary cytology (VUC) is the most widely used urine-based assay (and gold standard) for detecting BCa; however, it fails to detect approximately 50% of low-grade or early stage BCa when it is most curable. Furthermore, the detection rate of VUC for recurrent BCa is not much better. Because of this severe limitation, all patients with hematuria and who are under surveillance to monitor for recurrent BCa must undergo an invasive examination of the urinary bladder, where a miniature camera is inserted into the bladder and the bladder inspected. We propose to improve the detection of BCa by utilizing a multiplex ELISA for the detection of a previously validated BCa- associated diagnostic signature (signature) in voided urine. Hypothesis A molecular profile exists that a) is specificall associated with BCa and b) can be utilized to indicate the presence of BCa in non-invasively obtained voided urine samples. This hypothesis will be tested by completing the following Specific Aims: 1) To validate the multiplex ELISA for BCa detection in subjects presenting with gross hematuria, 2) To validate the multiplex ELISA for BCa detection in patients with a history of BCa currently undergoing tumor surveillance and 3) To investigate the ability of the BCa-associated diagnostic signature to determine risk of disease. Significance This research will open the door for improving on the non-invasive methods for detecting BCa and will have a marked impact on patient care. Methodology Our group has developed and tested a multiplex ELISA towards this signature. In this proposal, we will test the multiplex ELISA in 2 independent studies: patients presenting with gross hematuria and BCa patients undergoing tumor surveillance. Expected Results The validation of the multiplex ELISA will reduce the need to subject large numbers of patients who do not have BCa to frequent, uncomfortable and expensive cystoscopic examinations. Specifically, we would anticipate a reduction in the number of cystoscopies/year by 500,000, which would translate into cost savings of $225 million/year."
"9352266","Abstract  Bipolar disorder is a severe, persistent, and common psychiatric illness that is associated with a staggering 46% lifetime prevalence of alcohol-related disorders. Alcohol use disorder in patients with bipolar disorder is associated with numerous adverse consequences including increased hospitalization, poor outcome during hospitalization, violence towards self and others, and treatment nonadherence. Thus, the development of effective treatments for patients with bipolar and alcohol use disorder is a major public health concern. However, to date, few placebo-controlled trials have been conducted in patients with bipolar disorder and alcohol use disorder. Our group conducts clinical trials in persons with bipolar disorder and substance use disorders. A particularly promising medication that we have investigated is the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole.  A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of aripiprazole is proposed in 132 outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder (depressed or mixed mood state) and alcohol use disorder, with active alcohol use. Alcohol use will be the primary outcome, with alcohol craving and mood symptoms as secondary outcomes. To reflect the diversity of our geographic region, both English- and Spanish-speaking participants will be included. The study design includes a 12-week acute phase with a maximum aripiprazole dose of 15 mg/day. A 4-week extension phase for completers with at least one heavy drinking day at week 12 will explore an aripiprazole titration up to 30 mg/day. To standardize management of other psychotropic medications (e.g. mood stabilizers, antidepressants), concomitant medication changes will be managed in both groups using a treatment algorithm. Relationships between changes in alcohol use and changes in mood will be explored. Outcome measures will include alcohol use assessed with the Timeline Followback method, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology?Self-report, Young Mania Rating Scale, Penn Alcohol Craving Scale, as well as liver enzyme and carbohydrate deficient transferrin levels. Side effects, including those associated with antipsychotics, will be monitored. Additionally, blood samples will be obtained for genotype analysis, as well as laboratory values including blood sugar and lipid levels. A research team with extensive experience in dual diagnosis, mood disorders, clinical trials, statistics, and alcohol research will conduct the trial."

"9308031","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The Clinical Research in ALS and related disorders for Therapy Development (CREATE) RDCRC will focus on ALS and a group of related degenerative disorders that includes PLS, HSP, PMA, and FTD. This group of disorders is unified by their degenerative nature; their overlapping phenotypes resulting from degeneration of upper motor neuron, lower motor neuron and frontotemporal neuronal systems; their overlapping genetic susceptibility; their shared underlying biology; and their uniform lack of effective therapies. These disorders also share common challenges with respect to biomarker and therapeutic development - challenges that might be overcome through a shared experimental approach. The over-arching goals of the CREATE RDCRC are to better understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype for this group of disorders, and to develop disease biomarkers with a view to facilitating drug discovery and therapeutic development for patients afflicted with one of these neurodegenerative disorders. The CREATE RDCRC brings together a multi-disciplinary group of investigators and a diverse array of patient advocacy groups representing the patient populations that are the focus of our research efforts. These include the ALS Association, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the Spastic Paraplegia Foundation, the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration, the ALS Recovery Fund and PatientsLikeMe. The diversity of expertise within the CREATE RDCRC spans clinical neurology (neuromuscular disease and cognitive/behavioral neurology), genetics, genetic epidemiology, molecular neuroscience, biomarker development, drug discovery, biostatistics, and clinical trials, as well as patient advocacy, education and outreach. The CREATE Consortium, therefore, is a truly translational enterprise that effectively bridges the gap between basic scientists and investigators engaged in applied clinical research. Our new collaboration with the Ontario Brain Institute Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative, and the European STRENGTH Consortium significantly enhance the potential impact of this RDCRC."
"9380214","Spiral ganglion neurons transmit auditory information from cochlear hair cells to the neurons of the cochlear nucleus. Thus, spiral ganglion and cochlear nucleus neurons are essential for normal hearing and for restoration of hearing via cochlear or cochlear nucleus implants in deaf individuals. However, in some circumstances these neurons may degenerate or die after deafening, limiting the potential efficacy of these devices. The reasons for this neurodegeneration and its variable nature after hair cell death remain unclear. Recent findings from our labs have revealed that elements of the innate immune system are recruited to the spiral ganglion and cochlear nucleus after deafening and suggest that the activation status of immune cells is an important determinant of neuronal survival in both structures. We also show that these elements of the innate immune system have profound effects on the survival of the auditory neurons, in some cases being cytotoxic, in others possibly neuroprotective. In at least one deafness model, the immune response, remarkably, may be a principal cause of spiral ganglion neuronal death after deafening. To resolve these complex and disparate effects of the innate immune system on auditory neuronal survival ? with the long-term goal of developing immunotherapies for neuroprotection ? we propose to systematically delete specific components of the innate immune system involving Natural Killer (NK) cells, macrophages, or microglia to determine their effect on neuronal survival. The experiments will use transgenic mice and, in some cases, inhibitory antibodies. Both macrophages and NK cells are recruited into the spiral ganglion in response to hair cell injury. The proposed experiments will determine whether macrophages and NK cells are neurotoxic or neuroprotective in the injured cochlea and the roles of specific cytokines and chemokines in stimulation and potential neurotoxicity of these immune cells. A parallel series of studies will focus on neuroimmune interactions in the cochlear nucleus, in which extensive research by one of the co-PI's has shown that neuronal survival depends on afferent input during a `critical period' in early postnatal maturation. In contrast, mature cochlear nucleus neurons survive deafferentation. Preliminary data suggest that this may be due to neuroprotection by microglia (the resident immune cells of the CNS.) The proposed experiments will test this hypothesis. Together, these studies will test fundamentally new hypotheses implicating specific components of the innate immune system as critical, if not optimal, targets for neuroprotective therapies to promote survival of cochlea and auditory brainstem neurons after cochlear pathology."
"9312858","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Self-regulation failure has been implicated in the development of obesity in children. Little is known, however, about the extent to which children's stress responses (a marker for self-regulation) in infancy and early childhood predict body mass index trajectories, nor do we fully understand the ways in which children's bio-behavioral responses to stress, including eating in response to stress, influence adverse weight outcomes. The mechanisms by which children's biological stress responses and behavioral self-regulation are linked to obesity are largely unknown; we propose that dysregulated eating is one key mechanism. The proposed study takes an integrated, bio-psychosocial, developmental approach to examining behavioral, biological, and eating regulation as key bio-behavioral underpinnings of obesity in rural children. Building on data collected from birth through grade 5 as a part of the ongoing Family Life Project (Children in Rural Poverty: Risk and Protective Mechanisms), we propose to examine bio-behavioral mechanisms involved in the development of obesity in young children. The Family Life Project is a multi-site, longitudinal study which examines distal and proximal influences on rural children's development. Data were collected on ~1300 infants and their caregivers at study entry, and more than 1,000 children have been followed through grade 5. In addition to measures on children's stress response, behavioral self-regulation, and body mass index (BMI), a number of parental and family environmental factors have been collected on children since birth. Using a planned missingness design, we propose to collect new information from 750 families on children's (mean age = 12yrs) biobehavioral and eating regulation in response to stress, and their relations with family environment and obesity. An experimental study (in a subset of 375 families) will provide a unique opportunity to examine the causal effects of stress on eating behavior and self-regulation under standardized conditions. We will also examine the influence of early exposure to family adversity (e.g., harsh parenting and household chaos) on children's regulatory capacity, and the trajectory of BMI from age 24 mos to 12yrs. We will also examine the extent to which individual characteristics (e.g., race) and biobehavioral predisposition to obesity (maternal weight status and stress regulation) moderate these relations. While several studies have outlined various behavioral and environmental influences on children's development of obesity, the proposed study will objectively measure children's capacity to self-regulate in several domains of development, and will examine the extent to which family and household factors contribute to self-regulatory capacity, and its potential influence on children's BMI trajectory and obesity development from early childhood to adolescence."
"9301606","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Project 2 will expand our knowledge of FSHD biomarkers to enable identification of FSHD disease genes and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms responsible for FSHD muscle pathology, and facilitate pre-clinical studies to develop FSHD therapeutics. In Aim 1, biomarkers for FSHD will be identified and validated using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and qRT-PCR analyses of muscle and myogenic cells from affected and unaffected subjects in FSHD family cohorts and in nonmanifesting carriers. Our large collection of muscle and cells available in the Cell Core will enable statistically powered studies to identify quantitative differences in the expression of coding and non-coding RNAs and splicing variants and candidate modifiers of disease severity, also being investigated in Project 1 by exome sequencing. The expression and functions of candidate disease biomarkers and modifier genes and their encoded proteins will be investigated in FSHD cells (Aim 1) and humanized mouse xenograft models (Project 3), and by using morpholino antisense inhibition to evaluate their functions in FSHD pathophysiology (Aim 3). Aim 2 will investigate epigenetic and regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of DUX4-fl and non-coding RNAs transcribed from the D4Z4 FSHD disease locus. Investigations focus on nonmanifesting carriers and unaffected members of FSHD families to test the hypothesis that disruptions in the DNA methylation status of the D4Z4 locus are early modifiers of genetic and regulatory disruptions leading to FSHD disease. Aim 3 is a collaboration with our industry partner, Genzyme, to develop antisense oligo morpholino technology for investigating the disease functions of DUX4-fl and other candidate FSHD disease genes identified in Aim 1. The initial objectives are to develop and validate DUX4-fl morpholinos for RNA-seq studies to identify downstream targets of DUX4-fl regulation in FSHD cells as candidate FSHD disease genes. Cell morpholino studies will enable use of morpholinos in pre-clinical drug development studies in humanized mouse xenograft models in Project 3 to investigate the roles of DUX4-fl and other candidate disease genes in FSHD muscle pathophysiology."
"9348680","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Newborn screening (NBS) is designed for pre-symptomatic identification of serious conditions for which there are effective treatments that must begin early. Central to NBS policy is evidence that pre-symptomatic treatment is more effective than treatment after symptoms appear. Unfortunately, such evidence is difficult to amass because most nominated conditions are rare and the effort required to identify pre-symptomatic infants for clinical trials is substantial. Researchers and advocates find themselves in a classic ?Catch 22? situation?NBS cannot happen without sufficient evidence, but gathering this evidence necessarily requires large-scale population screening. This problem is such a formidable barrier to translational research that many disorders will never have the evidence needed to justify inclusion in NBS programs. We propose to develop and implement Early Check?a research program in which voluntary screening for a panel of conditions is offered on a statewide basis. Early Check would allow rapid screening for new candidate conditions, advance understanding of early disease, and facilitate registry and clinical trial recruitment. We will build and implement an experimental research program with an ongoing evaluation component in which we revise and improve the program as we learn from our implementation experiences and engagement with the general public and families directly affected by screening. Once we have finalized all aspects of the program, we will offer screening for a gradually expanding set of conditions to all 120,000 birthing families per year in North Carolina. Our first condition offered for screening will be spinal muscular atrophy, a life-threatening degenerative motor neuron disorder. We will determine participation rates; conduct screening; return results; provide counseling and clinical services; support families in caregiving decisions; inform families of ongoing clinical trials; provide support for families in deciding whether they want to participate in a clinical trial; and follow children and families over time to study benefits, harms, and psychosocial outcomes of screening. We will seek external funds to expand Early Check to other candidate disorders, such as fragile X syndrome. Implementation data will be used to refine the process, inform replication, and establish an infrastructure for testing other candidate conditions. To achieve long-term viability, we will develop a model of public-private partnerships based on collaborative engagement with federal agencies, foundations, patient advocacy groups, and industry."

"9314610","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Child maltreatment is a complex, insidious problem that exerts an astronomical toll on individuals, families, and society. Advancing knowledge regarding the early developmental processes that contribute to adverse outcomes in maltreated children is thus of high public health significance. The development of trust in young children is an expanding area of inquiry. In addition to further investigation of normative processes in trust competencies, limited research has been conducted to elucidate contributors to individual differences in trust development. Significantly, no research has investigated trust in maltreated children, despite the likelihood of trust capacities being jeopardized in these youngsters. Accordingly, research on emerging trust in maltreated children would address a critical barrier to understanding important, unstudied impairments in early social development that have crucial implications for subsequent interpersonal and relationship functioning in maltreated individuals, and consequent mental health liabilities.  In the present application, we propose to recruit 300 36- to 42-month-old children from low income families; 150 children will have a history of child maltreatment and 150 will have no maltreatment history. The children and their mothers will participate in four laboratory sessions to assess components of epistemic trust, self- reliance vs. deference in trust decision-making, and source memory. The three epistemic trust tasks vary in terms of the degree of cognitive vs. socio-affective sources of information. Mother-child attachment security, theory of mind/false belief understanding, and inhibitory control also will be assessed. Additionally, separate Event Related Potential assessments will be conducted with stimuli yoked to that used in the three epistemic trust assessments. Accordingly, the measurements to be obtained constitute a multilevel assessment of diverse domains that are implicated in contributing to individual differences in the development of children's early trust capacities. Moreover, investigation of these domains holds great promise for identifying mechanisms that may contribute to difficulties that young maltreated children are likely to exhibit in the development of trust.  Assessing the consequences of maltreatment occurring in the first three years of life on children's ability to develop trust in others has important implications for their social, interpersonal, and affective development, as well as subsequent mental health. The research also will greatly expand the understanding of normative trust development. This research will have important implications for public health. In addition to advancing knowledge regarding the multilevel developmental roots of early difficulties in trust development, the research will provide valuable direction for early prevention and intervention strategies. Given the multiple mechanisms that are likely to be identified in contributing to early, compromised trust development, insights into different intervention targets will be elucidated."
"9310629","Abstract  Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global threat. Many argue that we have reached a post-antibiotic era, when simple bacterial infections could result in devastating consequences. To address this crisis, extensive efforts are needed to develop strategies to better use existing antibiotics, in addition to developing new ones. In particular, it is critical to understand how bacterial populations respond to antibiotic treatment and how antibiotic treatment can modulate the generation and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A major mechanism of rapid spread of antibiotic resistance is horizontal gene transfer (HGT), especially conjugation. We recently showed that in a broad range of conjugative systems antibiotics determine conjugation dynamics primarily by serving as a selective driver. In particular, antibiotics can both promote and suppress HGT dynamics, depending on how antibiotics affect growth rates of populations undergoing conjugation. Based on these results, the central goal of the proposed research is to examine in depth how antibiotic treatment can be applied to minimize the spread of antibiotic resistance genes or to force the reversal of the resistance once it was acquired. To achieve this goal, we will first quantify HGT in a library of bacterial isolates expressing extended spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs). The measured parameters will allow us to expand our models to clinically relevant organisms. We next will integrate modeling and quantitative experiments to define antibiotic dosing and combinations regimes that modulate population dynamics to minimize fraction of resistant organisms and to reverse antibiotic resistance. The proposed research will generate unprecedented, quantitative measurements of modulation of HGT by antibiotics and other environmental factors. The antibiotic dosing strategies will be useful for guiding the use of antibiotics in the clinical setting."
"9363863","Majority of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis (HD) experience a  substantial symptom burden, which significantly impairs their health-related quality of life  (HRQOL). Additionally, patient symptoms of depression, pain and fatigue are associated with  increased hospitalization and mortality, potentially mediated by behavioral factors such as  non-adherence to medication and dialysis, as well as biological factors such as inflammatory  cytokines. Given the limited effectiveness of prior interventions to alleviate symptoms and improve  HRQOL in HD patients, and lack of evidence on their effect on bio-behavioral mediators, our  proposed study fulfills a critical need for providing patient-centered dialysis care, while  advancing mechanistic insights into the underlying inflammatory process. Our team has successfully  demonstrated the effectiveness of a stepped collaborative care intervention (SCCI) in other  chronically ill patient populations. Collaborative care provides an integrated multi-disciplinary  structured management plan; and a stepped approach for pharmaco- and/or behavioral-therapy allows  for individualization of treatment according to patients? clinical status, preferences and  treatment response. In order to simplify the delivery of  the behavioral therapy component of SCCI  and reduce the associated patient and provider burdens, our multi- disciplinary team of experts in  nephrology, psychology, and health technology pioneered and tested the delivery of behavioral  therapy using video-conferencing in dialysis units. Our pilot study showed that this approach is  feasible, acceptable and requires minimal additional resources. The goal of the proposed   Technology Assisted Stepped Collaborative Care Intervention (TASCCI) study is to test the  effectiveness of SCCI for alleviating symptom clusters and improving HRQOL in a multi-center  randomized controlled trial of 150 diverse HD patients from Pennsylvania and New Mexico. We will  compare the effectiveness of our intervention with an attention control arm of technology-delivered  health education to improve key patient- centered outcomes. Specifically, we will examine 1)  changes in depression (primary outcome), pain, fatigue and HRQOL after 12 week intervention (Aim  1), 2) effect on medication and dialysis adherence (Aim 2); and 3) changes in levels of  inflammatory biomarkers (Aim 3). This study directly responds to call from Kidney Disease Improving  Global Outcomes (KDIGO) for integration of symptom assessment and management in routine ESRD care.  TASCCI may provide a feasible and resourceful approach to alleviate common patient symptoms and  improve HRQOL for HD patients that could be readily adopted and integrated in routine dialysis care  for wide-scale dissemination."
"9331720","Abstract  The aim of our proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms that link transcription of specific RNAs in the  nucleus to their translation (RNA processing). ?We have identified and characterized a novel and highly  conserved gene, ?Zfrp8/PDCD2, ?and shown that it is essential in stem cells in flies, mouse, and human, and  that it is also required for growth of cancer cells. We discovered ?Zfrp8/PDCD2 ?is required for the nuclear export  of select mRNAs and TE transcripts. Also it interacts with the small ribosomal subunit and forms a complex  with mRNA binding proteins. Our data suggest that Zfrp8/PDCD2 controls subcellular localization of select  RNAs and the association of mRNA­RNPs with ribosomes. We also have identified Tet/TET1 as a new  Zfrp8/PDCD2 interacting protein. In vertebrates, TET proteins function in DNA demethylation converting  5­methylcytosine (5mC) into 5­hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), modifications that are not detected in  Drosophila DNA. A recent study shows that vertebrate Tet proteins can also convert 5mrC to 5hmrC in RNA.  Inspired by this discovery, we have shown that 5hmrC also exists in flies and depends on Tet activity. We  hypothesize that Tet modifies specific transcripts and regulates the recruitment of Zfrp8 to these RNAs, so  controlling their processing and translation.    We propose to test this hypothesis by a combination of molecular/biochemical and genetic  experiments. We will identify 5hmrC­modified transcripts transcriptome­wide and study their integrity, levels,  and localization in wild type and mutant tissues. We will map the Tet binding sites on DNA and compare their  location to 5hmrC­modified transcripts. Finally, we will test how ?Tet? and ?Zfrp8? affect ribosomal occupancy of  mRNAs and establish how ?Tet? and 5hmrC affect their translation. In addition to investigating the mechanism by  which ?Tet? and 5hmrC regulate RNA metabolism and how Z?frp8? affects the process, we will determine the  importance of both genes in development and stem cell differentiation by studying the mutant phenotypes of  new ?Tet ?alleles and ?Tet? and ?Zfrp8 KD ?tissues. Because of the conservation of both Tet and Zfrp8/PDCD2 our  results are likely to shed light on the same process in mouse and human.      "
"9241891","?     DESCRIPTION:     Hyperglycemia (i.e., elevated blood glucose) affects approximately 40% of acute ischemic stroke patients, regardless of a diabetes history. In experimental and clinical studies, hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic brain injury by perpetuating aberrant glucose metabolism and hyperglycolysis-associated oxidative injury from excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Clinically, to address hyperglycemia in stroke, insulin has been implemented to normalize serum glucose levels. However no clear beneficial outcome has resulted from such treatment, mainly because of persistent hypoglycemia or inadequately controlled glucose levels. Therefore development of an alternative and effective therapy for hyperglycemia in stroke is highly desirable. Glucose is initially catabolized by glycolysis, and subsequently through the aerobic pathway to produce cellular ATP needed as the primary energy source for neural activity. In ischemia while oxidative phosphorylation of glucose is impaired due to oxygen deprivation, brain cells attempt to meet their new metabolic challenge by increasing anaerobic glycolysis (hyperglycolysis). Anaerobic glycolysis, which is very inefficient in ATP production, induces lactic acidosis thus ROS, especially upon reperfusion. ROS is further produced by activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX), which is generated during ischemia and enhanced by NADPH production through hyperglycolysis. Hibernating animals are known to adapt to a significant decrease of blood flow to the brain, which would be deleterious to a non-hibernating animal. Similarly, induction of a hibernation-like status after stroke may blunt brain damage associated with decreased or absence of blood flow. Experimental studies by us and others have demonstrated depressive roles of ethanol (ETOH) and phenothiazine neuroleptics (Chlorpromazine and Promethazine) in decreasing not only brain activity and glucose metabolism, but also ischemic brain damage. These effects raise the possibility that ETOH and phenothiazine drugs might serve as a novel neuroprotectant by its ability to regulate brain glucose metabolism after stroke. The proposed studies here address this putative capability. In rodent transient and permanent stroke models, we will first establish whether post-ischemia administration of ETOH or Chlorpromazine+Promethazine combination reduces brain injury and improve functional outcome (Aim 1). We will then test whether the proposed therapy reduces glucose uptake, utilization, metabolism and thus hyperglycolysis, in ischemic penumbra and hyperglycemia-associated brain (Aim 2). We will also determine whether our therapy prevents oxidative injury by ameliorating elevated glucose transporter expression and NOX complex formation and activation (Aim 3). Because post-stroke insulin treatment has been controversial, the proposed treatments may be more effective in reducing hyperglycemia-enhanced ischemic injury by both slowing cerebral glucose metabolism and attenuating glycolysis-associated NOX activity. This therapeutic value would then be developed as an effective approach in diabetic and stroke-induced hyperglycemia."
"9269503","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Local HIV epidemics in the Asia-Pacific region are frequently concentrated within key populations engaging in male-to-male sex, injection drug use, and sex work, and largely occur in low- and middle-income settings where concurrent acute and chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C) are common and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The IeDEA Asia-Pacific Research Collaboration has established a network of 60 clinical centers and research partners in 13 South, Southeast, and East Asian countries and Australia, that is evaluating a range of factors driving the epidemic and HIV disease and treatment outcomes in order to better understand how changing global treatment guidelines are being implemented, and to inform clinical practice and policy. The overall scientific goal is to evaluate the impact of HIV disease, co-infections, co-morbidities, an antiretroviral therapy management on short- and long-term clinical and programmatic outcomes in the region, and compare them across the IeDEA global consortium.  The research agenda relies on data from core adult and pediatric cohorts, and supplemental cohorts of adolescents and acutely infected men who have sex with men, as well as targeted sub-studies on co- infections, non-communicable diseases, cancers, and drug use. Analyses addressing the specific aims will examine short- and long-term outcomes along the treatment and retention cascade, including time to treatment initiation, tolerability and durability of antiretroviral regimens, loss to follow-up, treatment failure, drug resistance, and cancer risk. Outcomes will be disaggregated by age (e.g., children, adolescents, adults, older adults), sex, key affected populations, and country income levels. This will be complemented through sub- studies of incident sexually transmitted infections and HIV treatment adherence among those using amphetamine-type stimulants, co-infections with tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, and adolescent transition to adult care. Studies will be supported by robust data management and analysis infrastructure, which has facilitated the successful harmonization of intra-regional data definitions and methodologies across 13 countries, as well as with IeDEA as a global consortium. Data collection and analytical methods will expand to increase the generalizability and the scope of research, and will utilize innovative research tools, including mHealth applications, online data and surveys, and social media outreach. IeDEA Asia-Pacific follows a model of shared leadership that prioritizes the engagement of local investigators in the development and implementation of cohort concepts, thereby building capacity well beyond the central coordinating and data centers and enhancing the impact of the work. Successful implementation of these studies will inform local and regional HIV clinical management practices and programs, and add to global understanding of the epidemiology of HIV, co-infections, and associated health outcomes."

"9354261","SUMMARY ? CORE D The Drug Discovery Core will be a resource providing support for individual investigators in Projects 1-3 through a state-of-the-art, rational-design drug discovery program for early preclinical design of putative antiinflammatory and anti-aggregation agents. The Core already catalogs almost 2500 compounds in two libraries, and another library is under construction. After an initial round of screening in biological assays (Projects 1 and 3), the Core will use the resulting data in previously developed ?training? algorithms (nonlinear QSAR based) for in silico molding of the key structural elements that will not be, at this point, biased toward any known identity or structure. In parallel, the Core will use its extant computational tools to design compounds with structural elements known or predicted to act as pharmacoperones or IL-1 receptor antagonists. ADMET information will be applied as a filter to rationally select compounds with druglike attributes (e.g., gut absorption, plasma stability, and blood-brain barrier permeability). The Core will also be responsible for synthesizing sufficient quantities (scaling-up) of the most promising second-generation compounds for further evaluation in cell-culture and in vivo experiments. All the Projects are expected to utilize Core D facilities for the evaluation of novel molecular entities as therapeutic agents having the ability to interact with the potential therapeutic priorties of each arm of the inflammation, proteinopathy, insulin-resistance triad."
"9302143","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 13% of the population, and its prevalence in the United States is increasing. Regardless of the underlying etiology, CKD tends to progress once renal function falls below 50%. Glomerulosclerosis is a hallmark of CKD of all etiologies, suggesting that diverse primary diseases engage common final pathways of disease progression. Unfortunately, there are currently no specific therapies for slowing the progression of CKD and glomerulosclerosis. Interestingly, it has been known for decades that IgM and C3 are deposited in the glomeruli of some patients with CKD, although the significance of these deposits has remained elusive. Recent work has revealed that natural IgM (i.e. IgM that has not undergone somatic mutation) binds to neoepitopes expressed on injured cells. The tissue-bound IgM activates the complement system, contributing to further injury. This discovery prompted us to reexamine the significance of glomerular IgM deposits in patients with CKD. We have found that IgM binds to specific epitopes expressed in the glomeruli of mice after chemical, inflammatory, and ischemic injury. The glomerular IgM triggers complement activation, causing further renal injury. Our preliminary data also demonstrates that complement activation fragments are elevated in the plasma of human patients with CKD. The overall hypothesis of the current proposal is that natural antibody IgM binds to neoepitopes expressed in the glomerulus after a wide range of insults, and bound IgM activates the complement cascade. Once this injurious immune process starts, it generates additional neoepitopes for natural IgM, perpetuating the renal injury even if the primary disease process ceases. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be pursued. 1) Test whether natural IgM causes progressive glomerulosclerosis. In this aim we will test whether mice deficient in soluble IgM are protected from CKD progression in two animal models, and we will test the ability of specific monoclonal IgM antibodies to restore injury. 2) Investigate the mechanisms of complement-mediated glomerular injury. The hypothesis for this aim is that C3a and C5a are generated in the glomeruli of subjects with CKD and promote glomerulosclerosis. We will examine the effects of these complement activation fragments on the different glomerular cell types in vitro and in vivo. 3) Develop novel therapies for the treatment of progressive CKD. The hypothesis for this aim is that a novel complement inhibitor that specifically targets injury-associated glomerular epitopes will slow the progression of renal disease. The experiments in this proposal will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of CKD and foster the development of improved immunomodulatory treatments for this disease."
"9490202","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Homelessness in Veterans is a widespread problem and is a high priority at the national level. The 2010 Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness has as one of its goals to Prevent and end homelessness among Veterans in five years. The Supplemental Report to the 2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress offered a bleak account of the status of homeless Veterans: On a single night in January 2009, 75,609 Veterans were homeless. Veterans are homeless at about twice the rate of non- Veteran adults in the U.S. A joint program between Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the VA offers housing assistance and supportive services to homeless Veterans through the HUD - VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program. This program is a tremendous accomplishment; however, housing status is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for successful community integration. Other important facets of community integration include social connections with family and friends, participation in work and school, and activities of daily living (shopping, transportation. These aspects of community integration frequently remain unchanged after housing is achieved. For those with severe mental illness (SMI), such as psychotic disorders, rates of homelessness are 10-20 times higher than in the general population. Little is known about predictors of functional outcome within the very large group of homeless Veterans with SMI. The research aims for this project are to determine which specific factors (i.e., neurocognition, social cognition, or motivational variables) predict functional outcome in homeless Veterans with psychotic disorders. In the proposed 3-year study we will recruit 120 Veterans with a history of a psychotic disorder who are in the HUD- VASH program and assess their community integration over a 12 month period prospectively. The goal is to identify the primary determinant(s) of outcome to be included in a subsequent treatment study. The aims of the proposed project are based on previous research at the VISN 22 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) at VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (GLA) on predictors and determinants of functional outcome in SMI. When we complete this study we will know which factors are key determinant(s) of community integration in homeless Veterans with psychotic disorders and will have the necessary information to propose a larger intervention study. We view the current application as the start of a concentrated and systematic research program dedicated to improving the lives of homeless Veterans with SMI."
"9338223","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application aims to sustain and enhance opportunities for intensive basic, translational and clinical research training in adult and pediatic nephrology.

We are particularly proud of our trainees' performance, including those directly supported by the T32, and others who have benefitted from the infrastructure the T32 has provided and the collaborative spirit it has fostered. While our clinical research programs are particularly strong, we are committed to maintaining a flexible and rigorous training program that leverages the broad scientific excellence of Stanford University. Research opportunities available to candidates have diversified and expanded. Our program is interdisciplinary, as 27 of the 37 Training Faculty hold primary or secondary appointments in basic science departments or Institutes (Chemical and Systems Biology, Developmental Biology, Molecular & Cellular Physiology, Computer Science, Cardiovascular Institute, Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine), Health Research and Policy, or other research institutes and/or graduate schools at the University. It should be emphasized that ours is the only program at Stanford specifically directed at training scientists for research and teaching careers in adult and pediatric nephrology (and if expanded, in urology). Thus, continuation of this program - newly titled as the Adult and Pediatric Nephrology and Urology Research Training Program - is essential for Stanford to function as a major training center in kidney and urologic disease research."

"9325330","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common type of cardiomyopathy, affecting as many as 1 in every 250 individuals, and represents a significant public health concern due to its high mortality and morbidity rates. The disease, characterized by systolic dysfunction and left ventricular dilation, is a leading cause of heart failure and a prevalent indication for heart transplant. The pathophysiology of DCM has remained elusive because of the heterogeneity of the disease, in which numerous mutations to cytoskeletal proteins, e.g. vinculin, VCL, and sarcomeric proteins, e.g. ?-tropomyosin, TPM1, have been implicated; these diversities are compounded by the fact that cardiomyocytes (CMs) from adult hearts are difficult to isolate and culture, making in vitro analysis difficult. With th huge burden DCM creates for affected families and society, there is a significant need to develop accurate disease models that unravel complex pathophysiology and enable the development of effective treatments. To address this need, we propose to develop an in vitro model of DCM using CMs generated from patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and investigate the cellular pathology associated with the disease. hiPSC-CMs used in these studies originate from a family cohort carrying mutations in VCL and TPM1, where multiple family members heterozygous for both mutations have been diagnosed with DCM. In Aim 1, we will generate CMs from the patient-derived hiPSCs and familial controls. Additionally, we will create isogenic lines using genome engineering to mutate the loci of interest in familial control lines and to repair mutations in patient lines. Patient hiPSC-CMs will be assessed for structural abnormalities, such as sarcomere or intercalated disc disorganization, and compared to familial and isogenic controls. In Aim 2, we will utilize functional analyses - i.e. calcium imaging, voltage imaging, traction force microscopy, multielectrode array recording - to characterize the electro-mechanical coupling in patient and control hiPSC-CMs. The assays will determine any functional aberrations resulting from VCL/TPM1 mutations within the familial and isogenic lines. Results from these studies will create a better understanding of the role of VCL/TPM1 mutations in the development of structural and functional abnormalities that may combine to cause DCM in patients, and potentially provide insight into future therapeutics."
"9238278","Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes about 800,000 new infections each year in the United States, with health-care costs approaching 2 billion dollars/year. Various surface components, including lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and opacity protein(s) (Opa(s)), are important in mediating disease. The objectives of this proposal are to understand how Opa and LOS function in disease, and determine if their interaction enhance virulence. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that expression of specific Opa/LOS combinations promotes GC- GC interactions to produce biofilms with different disease potentiating properties and antibiotic resistance profiles. We intend to test our hypotheses by pursuing three specific aims: We will determine how Opa and LOS function cooperatively to promote bacterial-bacterial interactions, how bacterial-bacterial interactions effect the antibiotic resistance properties of GC biofilms and how bacterial aggregation influences adherence, invasion and/or transmigration. The results from our study will allow us to define how LOS and Opa variation contribute to disease pathogenesis. The impact on human health is expected to be significant, because with the new knowledge gained, we will be better positioned to understand what is needed to make a successful vaccine and what challenges we will face in developing new approaches to the treatment of gonorrhea."
"9306759","The Glycobiology Core will provide a resource for all Center members providing expertise and facilities in glycan/glycoprotein engineering and structural analysis of glycans.    Approximately half of the molecular mass of HIV gp120 is comprised of N-linked glycans that shield the protein backbone. These glycans impact on vaccine design in three distinct ways. Firstly, the carbohydrates themselves are distinct from typical human glycosylation and can serve as a target for broadly neutralizing antibodies. Secondly, the glycans of gp120 limit or modulate antibody recognition of underlying protein epitopes. Finally, both viral (and immunogen) glycans can interact with host cell lectins and trigger major immunomodulatory signaling pathways. The Glycobiology Core is devoted to supporting Center members in  the optimization of these critical parameters for vaccine design."
"9292247","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to characterize the mechanisms of allostery and drug recognition within the small multidrug resistance (SMR) protein family. Multidrug resistance (MDR) to antibiotics is the ability of bacteria to confer simultaneous resistance to a wide variety of chemically distinct molecules. While several new antibiotics exhibiting different chemical scaffolds have been successfully developed and modified, MDR remains a pervasive problem in hospitals and clinics. We will reveal the allosteric control mechanism and molecular interactions at the atomic level that enable SMR proteins to recognize a wide variety of drugs. These molecular motors require energy dependent conformational transitions and protein-protein macromolecular assemblies to carry out function. Our high-resolution structural biology approach will employ NMR spectroscopy to reveal the details at the molecular level. While biochemical and biophysical studies have laid the foundation for this research, the molecular mechanism by which these proteins recognize drugs, become activated, and subsequently confer resistance is unknown. Our studies will provide a structural dynamics-function correlation for providing insight into this significant human health problem, and in doing so will reveal a molecular picture of the MDR phenomenon from the standpoint of the SMR family that can be applied to other families in order to better understand clinical resistance."
"9313316","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The Translational Systems Core (Core C) will interface with the Project Leaders (Hammond, Roth, and Dillmann), Core A (Farquhar) and Core B (Miyanohara). This shared resource is designed to provide Program scientists, in a single facility, specific techniques that are labor intensive, highly specialized, not generally available to individual laboratories, and expensive. The specific translational systems provided by this Core include detailed cardiovascular physiological studies, the development of cardiovascular disease models, virus vector gene transfer methods, and detailed analysis of excitation-contraction coupling. Physiological assessment will include: i) Transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate cardiac chamber size, wall thickness, and function in vivo; 2) Assessment of contractile function of the heart, including measurement of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship; 3) The study of isolated perfused hearts, which will allow more refined and specific measurements of LV contractility in a controlled setting isolated from complex reflex activation and adrenergic activation associated with surgical preparations; 4) Telemetry to assess blood pressure and ECG in ambulatory rodents. 4) Detailed cardiac myocyte calcium handling analysis, performed via patch-clamp methods, will be performed at UCLA by a collaborator, Dr Joshua Goldhaber. In addition to providing these studies for all Program Scientists, the Translational Systems Core will provide a highly cost efficient means to conduct such studies in a centralized and well-equipped location, circumventing the need for redundant efforts of individual participating laboratories. By consolidating physiological model development and assessment and viral gene transfer, the cost savings will be considerable."
"9315679","Abstract Large meta-analyses indicate that acamprosate and naltrexone improve alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment outcomes. However, these medications are only effective in a subset of individuals with AUDs, prompting the need for reliable predictors of treatment outcomes that can be used to personalize treatment selection optimizing clinical benefits. It is widely known that genetic variation contributes to inter-individual differences in drug response, and it is expected that genomic factors can aid in prediction of clinical response to treatment of alcohol dependence. Prior candidate gene studies have identified several genetic variations associated with differential outcomes following treatment of alcohol dependence. However, no genome- wide pharmacogenomic studies of acamprosate or naltrexone treatment response have been published. We propose to perform a comprehensive set of genome-wide association studies using samples from three of the largest studies of acamprosate and naltrexone completed to date (COMBINE, PREDICT and CITA), to identify genetic markers associated with AUD treatment outcomes. Data from patients treated with acamprosate, naltrexone, or placebo will be used to identify predictors of drinking outcomes regardless of pharmacological intervention, while stratified analyses and gene-drug interaction analyses will be used to identify treatment- specific (i.e. pharmacogenomic) predictors of acamprosate and naltrexone treatment outcomes. Pathway-based gene set analyses will complement genome-wide association analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms, as a powerful approach to aggregate modest genetic association signals to identify biological pathways involved in treatment outcomes and drug-specific response. The comprehensive genome-wide search for genetic markers associated with response to acamprosate and naltrexone may not only provide essential information for advancement of precision medicine for AUDs, but may also advance knowledge about the mechanism of action of these medications enabling further drug discovery. Being the first study of its kind, this exploratory/developmental R21 grant will also provide critical information for designing future studies aimed at developing genomic predictors of AUD treatment response."
"9392726","Project Summary NYU School of Medicine, the Mailman School of Public Health, the Wadsworth Laboratories of the NYS Department of Health, and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center respond to PAR-16-098, proposing to leverage two unique and contemporaneous cohorts to examine chemical and psychosocial stressors in relationship to proximity to the WTC site and self-reported exposures, and evaluate birth, neurodevelopment and cardiometabolic outcomes. The first is comprised of mothers who delivered in one of three lower Manhattan hospitals in the months after the disaster, and the other is the northern Manhattan-based Columbia Children's Environmental Health Center (NM) cohort. The NM cohort includes children born just before and after September 11, 2001 permitting nested evaluations of stress-related exposures. Except for cardiometabolic outcomes, the data are already available including freshly obtained measurements of POPs, which we will extend to include PFCs with NIOSH support. In both populations, neurodevelopmental outcomes have been assessed through 6-7 years of age. Taking advantage of temporal and geographic differences in these cohorts, we will compare both psychosocial and chemical exposures and their association with outcomes among children who were and were not prenatally exposed to the WTC disaster. This study leverages previously measured biomarkers and prospectively collected data on psychosocial stress. In addition, we will be the first to examine physical health of adolescents exposed in utero to the WTC disaster. While other studies have examined non-invasive measurements of central and peripheral arterial stiffness, ours is one of the first to examine chemical exposures in relation to these endpoints in adolescence. Preclinical measures included in the proposed project may be more sensitive cardiovascular endpoints reflecting environmental influences in homogeneous populations such as young children and adolescents. The study is led by an international leader in children's environmental health who has conducted the only in-depth physical health studies of children exposed to the disaster (Trasande) with leaders of two large birth cohorts, one including children born in three lower Manhattan hospitals; and another of upper Manhattan children that will serve as a comparison (Herbstman, Perera, and Rauh). If WTC chemical exposures are associated with these outcomes, the study findings could facilitate proactive interventions such as treatment with antihypertensive medications which have been documented to prolong survival among adults with suboptimal cardiovascular profile."
"9316685","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past 5 years, continuous-flow (CF) rotary pumps have replaced volume-displacement pulsatile-flow pumps because of their simplicity, increased mechanical reliability, improved durability, smaller size, and better outcomes. In contrast to left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), existing clinical total artificial hearts (TAH) are all volume-displacement pulsatile-flow pumps, and they have significant limitations in their large size and durability. In response to these limitations, Cleveland Clinic has been developing a unique, valveless, and sensorless CFTAH with induced pulse under the current NIH-funded program (R01 HL096619). It has a single, continuously rotating, brushless DC motor and pump assembly with a centrifugal pump on both ends of the rotor. The pump passively balances left and right atrial pressures without sensors and is small enough (6.6 cm in diameter and 9.8 cm in length) to fit in small patients. The most recent, three consecutive calf experiments, conducted with no anticoagulation therapy, demonstrated outstanding biocompatibility with no thromboembolism in any organs. The animals remained healthy and were sacrificed at the planned duration of 30 or 90 days, which is the current world's record for longest duration of implant for a TAH with a single moving part. The objectives of this competitive renewal application are (1) to improve and refine the current CFTAH design by implementing the lessons learned from the prior program, (2) to develop a new continuous patient monitor (CPM) to enhance the real-time output of hemodynamic and pump information, and (3) to study the effects of pulsatility on pathophysiology with this ideal experimental platform. Specific aims to achieve these objectives are (1) Analyze the system requirements and refine the pump design, with input from clinical and industry experts and CFD analysis, to further improve biocompatibility, inherent hydraulic pump regulation, durability, and automatic flow control. (2) Develop and evaluate the real-time CPM using power and force- balanced rotor position signals to estimate pump flow, systemic and pulmonary pressure gradients and vascular resistances, inlet pressure difference, left and/or right suction and its severity, and blockage proximal to the pump, (3) Complete in vitro validation of system performance and level of hemolysis over the clinically relevant range of operation, (4) Complete in vivo animal experiments to validate hemodynamic response, biocompatibility, self-regulating mechanical design, and automatic speed control, and (5) Evaluate the effects of nonpulse or reduced pulse on hemodynamic response and pathophysiology with the same device by performing in vivo pulsatility studies. The successful completion of this program will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of this CFTAH technology, making it ready for technology transfer, and ultimately providing clinicians with a valuable treatment option for patients with biventricular heart failure, which is the goal o this project."
"9285825","Sensory hypersensitivity is commonly seen in FXS patients and the FXS mouse model - the Fmr1 knockout  (KO). Recent data suggests that this abnormality stems from hyperexcitability in sensory circuits. We have  established that cortical microcircuits are hyperexcitable in the Fmr1 KO mouse model, and that sensory  responses are enhanced in Fmr1 KO mice and FXS patients. Thus, investigation of sensory sensitivities is  clinically relevant, but perhaps more important is the promise of sensory system studies to advance  understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of hyperexcitabiity in neocortical circuitry that could  represent a primary pathophysiological factor impacting the development of a wide range of perceptual,  cognitive, and language skills in FXS. Further, we have identified biochemical signaling mechanisms that  may underlie hyperexcitability involving processes that we and others have uncovered that can be examined  in detail in KO mouse models and tested in FXS patients to develop a foundation for novel therapeutic  development. The striking consistency of findings across levels of investigation and species offers an  unprecedented opportunity to investigate mechanisms of brain dysfunction in a mouse disease model and  translate it directly to patients - a multidisciplinary mission that is ideal for a Center environment. Our Center  is organized to pursue precisely this aim with a tightly integrated and highly novel scientific program of  translational research. Project 1 (Huber/Gibson; UTSW; co-PIs) will determine the cellular, molecular and  synaptic mechanisms of auditory neocortical dysfunction using in vitro brain slices in FXS mouse models.  Project 2 (Razak/Etheil/Binder; UCR; co-PIs) will study auditory sensory processing deficits in vivo in FXS  mouse models, test mechanisms, and examine developmental and structural correlates of these deficits.  Project 3 (Sweeney/Byerly, UTSW, co-PIs) will investigate auditory cortical processing deficits using novel  neurophysiological strategies in individuals with FXS. All Projects will examine candidate mechanisms of  sensory hyperexcitability with an acute pharmacological probe strategy to test mechanisms of interest in  parallel studies of mice and patients"
"9351566","Project Summary/Abstract Studies are proposed to improve understanding  of the structure and organization of declarative memory and the function of the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe structures. In particular, the studies will test two contrasting views of hippocampal function, one that emphasizes memory and one that emphasizes spatial cognition. The work involves 8 separate studies, organized as two related topics: A. Memory and spatial cognition; B. Autobiographical memory and construction of episodes. A salient aspect of the proposed work is the continuing opportunity to study memory-impaired patients with bilateral hippocampal lesions or larger medial temporal lobe lesions that are well characterized in terms of quantitative neuroanatomy. Topic A attempts to reconcile two traditions of work on the hippocampus, one emphasizing memory and memory impairment and the other focusing on spatial navigation and spatial cognition. Topic B grows out of the recent explosion of interest in autobiographical memory, future imagining, scene construction, and the broad topic of mental time travel. A1 and A2 will study navigation and map reading ability in hippocampal patients and healthy volunteers in conditions where the burden on memory is minimal. A3 will test the ability of hippocampal patients to make horizontal shifts in perspective in extra-personal space. A4 will test the ability of hippocampal patients to accomplish shifts in perspective from overhead views to ground-level views of an environment. B1 will examine autobiographical memory and future imagining in hippocampal patients in conditions when minimal prompts are provided, following one of the protocols that have been used in this kind of work. B2 will explore these same abilities in hippocampal patients using extensive probing, following the main alternative protocol that has been used. A number of novel methods will be brought to the analysis of narrative constructions, including the unique opportunity to exchange data with another laboratory (full transcripts) in order to explore why laboratories have obtained different results when analyzing autobiographical narratives. B3 will use fMRI to ask whether hippocampal activity during the recollection of episodes correlates with particular aspects of narrative content, including the amount of spatial detail in the narratives. A second study asks in individuals with hippocampal lesions what other structures support recollection of episodic detail and whether activity in these structures correlates with aspects of narrative content. B4 involves a prospective, naturalistic, study of the capacity of hippocampal patients to construct episodic recollections about a structured event in which they participate. The proposed studies involve brain structures known to be important for declarative memory and for understanding memory impairment as it occurs in a number of psychiatric conditions. The work should provide new tests, improved understanding of the conditions that affect memory, and better insights about the ways that declarative memory is affected in mental disorders."
"9304185","PROJECT SUMMARY Orofacial clefts are among the most common birth defects in the U.S., occurring in 1/800 live-births. The lifetime cost for medical treatment, educational services and lost productivity averages more than $100,000 per affected person. While a number of contributory genes have been identified, there is a continued need to understand the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. We identified the first de novo mutations in a novel cytoskeletal SPECC1L gene in patients with oblique facial clefts. Recent identification of SPECC1L mutations in patients with syndromic and nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate suggests that insights into the cellular and molecular mechanism of SPECC1L function will be directly relevant to both severe and common facial malformations. Our data show that Specc1l is expressed in the neural folds at E8.5, including in pre-migratory cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs). Later at E9.5, it is expressed in post-migratory CNCCs, and in the branchial arches at E10.5. To study SPECC1L function, we have generated severe, hypomorphic and conditional mouse alleles of Specc1l deficiency. The severe mouse allele is embryonic lethal at E9.5 with defective neural tube (NT) closure and incomplete delamination of post-migratory CNCCs. The hypomorphic allele shows incompletely penetrant perinatal exencephaly phenotype. Moderate mutants with one hypomorphic and one severe allele show highly penetrant palate closure delay. In addition, SPECC1L-deficient cells show altered adherens junctions (AJs) and reduced PI3K-AKT signaling, both in vitro in cultured cells and in vivo in Specc1l mutant tissue. Modulation of cell-cell contacts is important not only for CNCC delamination from the neuroectoderm, but also for ?collective? migration of CNCCs to their defined destinations. The central hypothesis of this project is that SPECC1L modulates cell adhesion and collective migration by regulating the density of epithelial and mesenchymal cell-cell contacts through PI3K-AKT signaling. In Aim 1, we propose to investigate the effect of Specc1l dosage on craniofacial development using our hypomorphic, severe, and conditional mouse alleles. In Aim 2, we will investigate SPECC1L mediation of AJ stability and PI3K-AKT signaling using small molecule modulators of PI3K-AKT pathway. We will also explore the mechanism underlying SPECC1L mediation of AKT stability. In Aim 3, we will use live-imaging to quantitatively assess changes in collective cell behavior. Analyses will be conducted in ex vivo cultured E8.5 neural plate explants, with CNCCs marked with Wnt1-Cre or Sox10-Cre. Successful completion of these studies will establish novel SPECC1L-based links between AJs, cell polarity and PI3K-AKT signaling during facial morphogenesis and palate closure. Understanding the correlation between SPECC1L dosage or functional deficiency and collective cell migration will provide targets for future therapeutic or preventative strategies against orofacial clefting."

"9123669","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension, also called high blood pressure (BP), is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Nearly one-third of all U.S. adults have hypertension, but only half of these cases are successfully controlled by medication or diet. The negative public health consequences are profound. American Indians (AIs) have disproportionate CVD morbidity and mortality, and they have higher burdens of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking than other races. Yet AIs are rarely represented in national studies on hypertension management. Most interventions targeting CVD have focused on reservation-based AIs, even though 71% of AIs live in urban areas. This urban population is an invisible minority, with high rates of disease and disability, and low rates of healthcare usage. Medication alone is suboptimal for controlling BP; a heart-healthy diet is preferable. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is a high-impact lifestyle intervention for primary and secondary prevention of CVD that centers on a low-salt, low-fat diet emphasizing fresh fruits and vegetables. In a randomized trial, the DASH diet lowered systolic BP by 11.5 mm Hg in participants with clinical hypertension. However, the DASH diet never been tested in AIs. We therefore designed an 8-week DASH intervention to improve BP control in hypertensive urban AIs. Our  American Indian Five Nuts and Beans Project  (AI-5) includes culturally tailored DASH education that emphasizes low sodium intake, traditional Native foods, and maintaining healthy eating habits, plus a $30 weekly credit for home delivery of groceries that meet DASH guidelines. Home delivery is a creative solution to logistical barriers, such as limited access to fresh produce, that often deter residents of poor urban neighborhoods from maintaining a healthy diet. The control condition will receive printed educational materials and a $30 weekly credit for grocery delivery, with no purchasing restrictions. Our randomized trial will test AI-5 i a total of 400 adult AIs with inadequately controlled systolic BP (140-159 mmHg). We will recruit and randomize 200 participants from each of 2 urban clinics: one in Spokane, WA, the other in Oklahoma City, OK. Our primary outcome is systolic BP measured after the 8-week intervention and again 12 weeks later. Secondary outcomes are other modifiable CVD risk factors, risk scores for heart disease and stroke, and dietary habits. We will also conduct an embedded pilot study to inform future research on long-term sustainability and impact. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) evaluate the effect of the AI-5 intervention on BP and secondary outcomes in adult AIs with poorly controlled hypertension, and 2) conduct a pilot study among 100 intervention participants after the intervention concludes by randomizing half to receive 6 weeks of dietician support (pilot  intervention) and the other half to receive no further support (pilot control). We will collect BP data at 6 and 9 months post-baseline. This approach will have important public health implications and will inform efforts to export interventions for CVD and hypertension to other urban and rural AI groups."
"9306034","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer cells accumulate mutations in protein-coding genes, leading to altered protein products called neo- antigens. These neo-antigens can be recognized by elements of the adaptive immune system and lead to killing of cancer cells. Moreover, these neo-antigen coding mutations are theorized to be the targets of immune cells that are activated by a novel class of immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs. Thus, describing the neo- antigens found in cancer is an important goal with important applications to human health. Our long-term goal is to understand the extent to which cancers gain or lose certain mutations in response to the selective pressure of the adaptive immune system. The first objective in this proposal is to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the neo-antigens that accrue in human tumors. We will accomplish this objective using DNA and RNA sequence data collected from thousands of cancer patients across 10 tumor types by consortia such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We will compare the properties of tumor mutations that can be recognized by the immune system against those that cannot be recognized by the immune system and identify cancer-type specific differences in these mutations. In some cancers, there are thousands of mutations that lead to neo-antigens, yet these cancers are not eliminated by the immune system. Our second objective is to identify if mutations that code for neo-antigens have been depleted in human cancers. To accomplish this objective, we will leverage the genetic differences between patients that affect their ability to recognize neo-antigens as foreign. Thus, we will identify if cancer patients have selectively lost mutations that code for neo-antigens that their immune system are capable of recognizing."
"9302557","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Homeostatic synaptic scaling is an important form of plasticity thought to be essential for maintaining stable function in developing neural circuits. Synaptic scaling scales the strength of all of a neuron's excitatory synaptic strengths up or down in the correct direction to stabilize neuronal firing rates. These homeostatic adjustments in synaptic weights are accomplished in large part through changes in the synaptic accumulation of GluA2-containing AMPAR at synapses, and appear to operate on all excitatory synaptic inputs onto a given neuron in response to changes in the neuron's own firing. Despite great recent interest, the molecular and biophysical mechanisms that enable this homeostatic adjustment of AMPAR abundance during synaptic scaling are still poorly understood, and many of the assumptions underlying this model of synaptic scaling (such as its global nature) remain largely untested. In this proposal we aim to illuminate the mechanisms that lead to enhanced synaptic AMPAR abundance during scaling up, and to test the idea that this form of plasticity acts on all excitatory inputs to stabilize neuronal firing in vivo. This proposal is built around or recent observation that the AMPAR-binding protein GRIP1 is essential for the regulated increase in synaptic AMPAR abundance during scaling up, and that this process requires direct interactions between GRIP1 and GluA2. Here we proposed to determine how (at the biophysical level) this regulated interaction between GluA2-GRIP1 drives an increase in synaptic AMPAR abundance, by using a variety of cutting edge imaging approaches. We will test two alternative models: first, that GRIP1 traffics to synapses along with AMPAR and enhances synaptic capture of the receptor, and second, that GRIP1 enhances synaptic delivery of modified AMPAR that have an enhanced affinity for synaptic scaffolds. Further, we will use the tools we have generated through these in vitro studies to selectively disrupt AMPAR trafficking during synaptic scaling up in vivo, in order to probe the mechanism and function of synaptic scaling within intact neocortical circuits."
"9336969","PROJECT SUMMARY  The large number of recent animal and clinical studies outlined within this application raises the possibility that  highly selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the M1 subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor  (mAChR) may provide a novel approach in the treatment of cognitive disturbances and negative symptoms  commonly associated with schizophrenia. The discovery of VU0467319 as a highly selective M1 PAM, which  display properties indicative of a preclinical drug candidate, provides an opportunity to advance it to nonclinical  safety testing for ultimate clinical assessment. Key requirements for the continued development of a successful  clinical therapeutic includes a favorable safety and tolerability profile in nonclinical species and a predicted  human pharmacokinetic profile amenable to oral dosing in healthy volunteers. In Project 3 we propose to  synthesize VU0467319 with appropriate certificates-of-analysis and GMP standards in order to characterize  the safety and pharmacodynamics of VU0467319 in preclinical and clinical studies, the approach of which  satisfying the expectations and guidance of both US and nonUS regulatory agencies. Preclinical safety studies  will be conducted in rats and dogs to assess the safety and tolerability of VU0467319, and its metabolites, in  preparation for a Phase I clinical trial. The assessment of the mutagenicity and clastogenicity potential, the  overt organ toxicity, and the safety pharmacological profile for VU0467319 represents the primary deliverables  of our preclinical drug development program. A successful safety and toxicity assessment will result in the filing  of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of  a Phase I clinical trial. Should a toxicity or adverse pharmacology risk be identified, an advantage of our  approach is the real-time data availability to Project 2 and the influence of the finding on the design of a backup  M1 PAM candidate."
"9408928","PROJECT SUMMARY  In spite of recent new drug developments, platinum-based drugs such as cisplatin are still widely used to treat solid organ malignancies. Besides its limited efficacy, serious side effects have been associated with the use of cisplatin, such as bilateral and irreversible hearing loss. In the cochlea, cisplatin can trigger the production of reactive oxygen species, and activate several other signaling pathways. A variety of agents, mainly based on their antioxidant properties, have been tested against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. However, many of them show limited efficacies, and also interfere with the therapeutic effect of cisplatin. Extensive in vitro studies have indicated that flunarizine (Sibelium), a drug that blocks T-type calcium channels, can protect cochlear cells against cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. This drug also has strong anti-tumor activities that act synergistically on several important aspects of cancer treatment. Our preliminary studies have found that flunarizine can synergistically induce cell death with cisplatin in one lung cancer cell line, and it can also protect noise-induced hearing loss. Based on these findings, we propose to develop a new cancer drug combination by testing whether flunarizine can synergistically induce cancer cell death with cisplatin, and at the same time, prevent cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death globally, and cisplatin is widely used to treat this disease, here, we will first determine the cytotoxic effects of flunarizine and cisplatin in two lung cancer cell lines: A549 and H1975, and determine whether flunarizine and cisplatin have synergistic effects in these cancer cells when used in combination (Aim 1). We will then determine whether flunarizine can prevent cisplatin- induced ototoxicity in vivo (Aim 2).  In short, based on previous studies and our preliminary data, our project goal is to repurpose flunarizine to combine with cisplatin against solid tumors with a focus on lung cancer. This project will generate data important to complete an Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling data package for future clinical studies. The ultimate goal is to develop an effective cancer drug combination with fewer side effects."
"9304286","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposal is designed to determine how intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics regulates epithelial plasticity, with a focus on distinct types of ell differentiation. Transitions in the fate or morphological state of epithelial cells are central to metazoan development, homeostasis, and tissue repair. Our preliminary data indicate that increased pHi is necessary for three types of epithelial differentiation programs, the transdifferentiation of epithelial to mesenchymal cells (EMT), adult epithelial stem cell differentiation, and embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation. EMT is necessary for normal development, contributes to organ repair after injury, including aberrant repair leading to fibrosis, and promotes cancer metastasis. The genetically distinct process of adult stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is a fundamental part of the program of adult homeostasis and tissue repair. The differentiation of ES cells mimics the process of lineage specification and expansion during embryonic development. Hence, resolving how these three types of epithelial differentiation are regulated has broad significance for both normal and pathological cell behaviors. Our data support testing the central hypothesis that increased pHi is necessary for different types of epithelial cell differentiation. In Aim 1 we will identify molecular mechanisms or pHi-regulated EMT based on our findings that increased pHi is necessary for EMT of lung and mammary epithelial cells. We will reveal stage-specific pHi dynamics and its regulation of actin filament remodeling and transcriptional events during EMT by using real-time imaging of genetically encoded biosensors with clonal cell models in 2D and 3D cultures as well as in vivo analysis of zebrafish neural crest development. We also will identify molecular mechanisms mediating pHi-dependent EMT by testing established and predicted pH-sensing proteins identified using an analytical combination of protein structures, cancer mutation databases, and a newly developed bioinformatics program that identifies titrating ionizable residues in proteins. In Aim 2 we will determine how pHi regulates differentiation of adult and embryonic stem cell lineages based on our findings that increased pHi is necessary for in vivo differentiation of the Drosophila ovarian follicle stem cell lineage, and for spontaneous differentiation of mouse ES cells. We will resolve how pHi dynamics regulates established cell lineage markers and the role that pH sensors play in Drosophila follicle cell and mouse ES cell differentiation, including investigating pHi-dependent hedgehog and wingless signaling, as suggested by our preliminary data. We bring to these studies new views on signaling mechanisms at the molecular level from our expertise in bridging structural and cell biology, quantitative live cell imaging, and Drosophia genetics. Although pHi is routinely measured in tissue culture cells, few studies have investigated pHi dynamics in vivo. Successful completion of these studies will provide substantial insight into a significant and unstudied mechanism for the regulation of epithelial plasticity, revealing new regulators for therapeutic targeting of disease-associated differentiatio programs."
"9302489","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both adults and children with an estimated 750,000 cases per year in the United States. To improve outcomes in these patients, it is vital to increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and identify new therapeutic targets. Sepsis occurs when the tightly controlled host response to infection extends beyond the local environment and into the systemic circulation. This results in complex interactions involving microbes, blood cells, and the endothelial barrier in the microcirculation that can progress to vascular collapse and organ failure. Neutrophils are key early responders to infection. Neutrophils kill microbes by phagocytosis and by oxidant-mediated microbe killing in the surrounding environment. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a major mediator of oxygen-dependent microbicidal activity. MPO catalyzes the conversion of H2O2 to the potent oxidant, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which reacts with both microbial and host molecular targets including proteins and lipids. The Ford group at Saint Louis University (SLU) has used physiological, biochemical and bio-organic approaches to demonstrate that the vinyl ether bond at the sn-1 position of plasmalogen lipids is targeted by HOCl, resulting in the production of 2-chlorofatty aldehyde, which is metabolized to 2-chlorofatty acid under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. These chlorinated lipids are elevated in activated neutrophils as well as in in vivo inflammation models including LPS treatment, Sindai virus exposure and peritonitis. Pilot studies show elevated levels of chlorinated lipids in a rat model of sepsis, and in human plasma of sepsis patients compared to controls. Additional preliminary data provide strong evidence that chlorinated lipids modulate leukocyte, platelet and endothelial cell function in the microcirculation and in isolated cell systems. Accordingly, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group with three PIs to test our hypothesis that chlorinated lipids produced by activated leukocytes during sepsis are mediators of severe endothelial dysfunction resulting in multiple organ failure. This hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that chlorinated lipids produced by neutrophils are key mediators of endothelial dysfunction and organ damage during sepsis. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that chlorinated lipids mediate dysfunction in human endothelial cells. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that plasma 2-ClFA levels indicate both severity and therapeutic effectiveness in sepsis patients. Overall, a multi-disciplinary approach will examine the role of chlorinated lipids produced as a result of leukocyte activation during sepsis as indicators of the severity of human sepsis, and mediators of vascular endothelial dysfunction examined both in vivo in the rat microcirculation and in vitro for mechanistic insights. The project is innovative and significant. These studies are designed to discover new paradigms for the role of neutrophils in eliciting endothelial dysfunction providing new targets for therapeutics to treat septic patients."
"9351179","PROJECT SUMMARY  An impressive suite of tools is available for studying prostatic epithelial cells; surprisingly few exist for prostatic stroma, even though it drives most of the prostate's significant biologic behaviors. Prostatic stroma initiates glandular development and releases paracrine signals that stimulate epithelial growth during benign hyperplasia and cancer. It also synthesizes extracellular matrix molecules that mediate regenerative repair and increase organ stiffness, factors recently associated with urinary dysfunction. Pinpointing prostatic stromal progenitors and factors involved in their proliferation and differentiation are the first steps in identifying cellular mechanisms responsible for stroma-based disease processes. Our first aim uses a mouse genetic approach to identify progenitors giving rise to prostatic fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, perivascular cells and urinary striated muscle sphincter myocytes. We will use immunostaining and multispectral imaging to assign lineage labeled cells to two- and three?dimensional maps of prostatic stromal sub-compartments. These data will be presented using an innovative online tool that connects researchers with validated cre-expressing mouse lines and stromal- cell selective antibodies. Our second aim is to create a developing human prostatic stroma RNA and protein expression atlas to stimulate hypotheses that are relevant to prostatic disease causing behaviors of stromal progenitors identified in Aim 1. We will map expression patterns for key growth factors, receptors, and transcription factors that potentially mediate prostatic stromal and epithelial differentiation. This work complements the high-resolution developing mouse prostatic atlas we made previously for GUDMAP. Our results will be used to generate online tutorials of prostate development and we will identify homologous compartments between mouse and human. We will annotate human data when possible with the same terms used previously to annotate mouse data, providing a searchable online dataset which enables investigators to compare RNA/protein expression between mouse and human and identify conserved pathways across species. Our data will equip the prostate research community with the necessary tools to design and test new hypotheses about the pathogenic role of prostatic stroma in benign hyperplasia, inflammation, pain, and cancer."

"9324378","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), is an hnRNP family protein, whose intracellular aggregation has been etiologically implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron degenerative disease (affecting two per 100,000 people worldwide) and about 40% of other common neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Primarily involved in RNA processing, TDP-43 also binds to DNA; but its DNA binding functions are not investigated. While hereditary mutations in TDP-43 have been linked to ALS, the molecular mechanism(s) of its pathology contributing to neuronal death are still unclear. The unique feature of TDP-43 pathogenesis in ALS is its nuclear clearance and simultaneous cytoplasmic aggregation in affected motor/cortical neurons. Furthermore, significant accumulation of genomic damage is observed in TDP-43-linked diseases and previous studies identified a key DNA repair protein `Ku' in TDP-43 immunocomplex from human cells; which raises the possibility of TDP-43's involvement in DNA damage repair, which has not been investigated. In support of this, our preliminary data demonstrate: (1) involvement of nuclear TDP-43 for efficient DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) in neurons; (2) TDP-43's recruitment at the DSB sites and stable interaction with DSBR proteins; (3) marked increase in DSB accumulation, and delayed DSB repair in TDP-43-depleted neurons and their sensitization to DSB-inducing agents; and (4) strong correlation of TDP-43 nuclear clearance/functional loss with accumulation of DSBs in ALS-affected human post-mortem spinal cord tissue. Based on these, which warrant a detailed investigation into the role of TDP-43 in neuronal genome damage response, we propose that the loss of nuclear TDP-43 causes deficient repair of DSBs in neuronal genomes, leading to persistent accumulation of lethal DSBs, which promote cell death. Thus the central goal of this project is to test this novel hypothesis to establish that TDP-43 pathology-induced DNA repair deficiency is a key etiological factor in ALS/other neurodegenerative diseases. Using state-of-the-art approaches and multiple model systems, we will comprehensively test this hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To characterize TDP-43's involvement in DSBR in neuronal genomes, and confirm that persistent genomic damage due to TDP-43 depletion causes cell death. Aim 2: To establish the molecular mechanism of TDP-43's function in DSBR using our novel in vitro reconstituted DSBR assay and test the impact of ALS-linked TDP-43 mutants in repair. Aim 3: To unravel the linkage of TDP-43 pathology (nuclear clearance) and neurodegeneration, with the genomic damage in tissues from TDP-43 (WT/mutant) transgenic mice and human ALS postmortem brains. This grant application with many innovative aspects and based on strong preliminary data represent previously unexplored area of ALS research and understanding this phenomenon could open up new avenues of therapeutic interventions."

"9284524","?    DESCRIPTION: This is an application for renewal of grant T32-MH018870, Training in Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders: From Animal Models to Patients (continuously funded since 1988). In the past 10 years, 28 fellows have been selected to enter the training program: 39% MDs, 21% MD/PhDs, 11% Clinical Psychologists, and 29% Basic Science PhDs. 43% of fellows have been recruited from the Columbia Psychiatry Residency program, 43% have been women, and 7% have been either an Underrepresented Minority or Disadvantaged trainee. The graduation rate of the fellowship has been 95% over the last 10 years (19/20). Currently, there are 6 fellows: 2 third-year, 3 second-year and 1 in the first year of training; 2 new fellows have been accepted to begin before the end of 2014-both psychiatrists and one an MD/PhD. Of the 19 fellows who have graduated the program in the past 10 years, 12 (63%) have been awarded K awards and 4 K award submissions are currently in preparation or under review from current fellows or very recent graduates. 3 graduates (16%) have already received R01s with another 2 listed as key personnel on R01s (including 1 role as a subcontract PI). 2 graduates have received R21s, and several others have applications pending. In total, all 19 graduates have received substantial independent funding including R01s, K awards, R21 awards, NARSAD awards, and grants from New York Stem Cell Science and other funding agencies. Of the 19 graduates, 14 (74%) are in full-time academic research positions: others are involved in research in industry or in clinical administration.  In the last submission of this T32, reviewed o 11/16/2009, the committee concluded: Overall, the strengths of this outstanding application significantly outweighed the minor concern [new Program Directors], and the reviewers felt the training program was succeeding in training translational and interdisciplinary researchers within the field of schizophrenia research. The last submission described a training plan that strengthened the opportunities in translational research by enhancement of the didactic teaching program, and through the strategic addition of faculty mentors in this area. Since its renewal, we have taken substantive steps to further improve our training program. Importantly, we have also developed a program to recruit to the Psychiatric Residency at Columbia MD/PhDs whose focus is neuroscience research. This program provides substantial research time and funding during the residency. This program has been a very effective recruitment tool for the residency and also provides a very strong pipeline of MD/PhD physician-scientists for the fellowship. Another development that will enhance recruitment for this T32 and the residency is Columbia's new neuroscience building to be opened in 2016. This building will house approximately 65 neuroscience research labs, 20 of which will be new hires. Thus the training and job opportunities after graduation for fellows will be significantly increased in the near future. There have been substantial advances in the didactic program, and the Program Directors now have 7 years of experience in their positions."
"9304285","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) play a conserved and essential role in cytokinetic abscission, the final step of cell division that physically separates daughter cells and can go awry during cancer development. The homologous family of ESCRT-III proteins plays key roles in this process by forming filaments that appear to constrict the intercellular bridge and promote abscission. ESCRT-III filaments also recruit MIT domain-containing proteins that we hypothesize provide a host of critical, but largely uncharacterized activities required for cytokinesis. To define these processes in molecular detail, we will analyze the structures, interactions and cytokinesis functions of the 12 human ESCRT-III and 21 MIT proteins.  We have determined the crystal structure of the ESCRT-III protein, IST1, in its closed conformation and obtained a high resolution cryoEM structure of a helical co-polymer formed by IST1 and its ESCRT-III binding partner, CHMP1B. This is the first such reconstruction, and it reveals a remarkable assembly in which the two ESCRT-III subunits adopt radically different structures. The double-stranded helical filament comprises an outer strand of closed IST1 subunits and an inner strand of highly extended CHMP1B subunits. We will now test a series of structure-based mechanistic hypotheses for ESCRT-III filament formation and function, focusing on the importance of subunit conformational flexibility. IST1 can also form membrane-associated, double-stranded helical filaments that extrude membrane tubules from liposomes, and we will characterize this membrane remodeling reaction in biochemical detail.  The MIT ATPases VPS4 and Spastin localize to intercellular bridges during cytokinesis by binding to MIT interaction motifs (MIM) within the exposed C-terminal tails of polymerized ESCRT-III subunits. Less well characterized MIT proteins have diverse effector domains that include kinases, proteases, and deubiquitinases, and we propose that a complex network of MIM-MIT interactions recruits these activities to the intercellular bridge to function in cytokinesis. In support of this idea, we have determined solution structures of three quite distinct ESCRT-III-MIT complexes and shown that an MIT kinase, ULK3, functions in cytokinesis, is recruited to intercellular bridges, and can phosphorylate ESCRT-III subunits. We have crystallized the ULK3 MIT-IST1 interaction complex and will now characterize its structure and associated biochemistry and then expand our studies to include global analyses of the structures and ESCRT-III interactions of all human MIT proteins.  Finally, we will use cell-based assays to validate and extend our biochemical and structural studies and to screen the entire set of human MIT proteins for cytokinesis functions. Together, these studies will characterize the fundamental activities of ESCRT-III proteins; i.e., forming filaments, recruiting MIT proteins to function in cytokinesis, and facilitating membrane fission. Our studies will also identify the subset of MIT proteins that function in cytokinesis, elucidate their structural biology, and reveal how they are recruited."
"9354260","Introduction ? Project 1 We appreciate the concerns of the reviewers, and have modified our project accordingly in many aspects.  Major changes between previous and current proposals include i) In June, for family reasons, Dr. Zawada accepted a position in the department of neurology at UColorado. ii) Toward tighter integration of the projects, the PD mouse model work has been supplanted by analysis of the BRI-A?42 model used in Project 2. iii) Hypothesis has changed focus to neuronal stress and microglial response interactions as governed by APOE genotype, favoring resilience or dysfunction, and ways in which drugs can intervene in these processes. iv) As previously proposed animal models and experiments are no longer proposed in this iteration, any reviewer concerns dealing with these animal models are not considered in this introduction. ??why the investigators do not simply examine all of the markers in all human brain regions examined...?  Taking the advice of the reviewer, we have decided to pursue this course, and have added the proposed  brain regions to Aim 1. ?How many human brains will be examined per condition??  A more detailed answer is elaborated in Core B?s introduction, but, in brief, based on biostatistical power  analysis on our expected effect sizes, we plan to study 6 brains per condition, with more to be added if necessary. ?Will quantitative IHF be performed at UAMC and IBC or both?...? This will be performed at both institutions. This is now explained in detail in the introduction to Core B, but in  brief, in our long-term collaboration, we have maintained laboratories with similar skills and identical  procedures. Images will be captured at their respective sites, but experimental quantitation will be  performed by Project 1 personnel at UAMS. ?How will the data be analyzed? Labeling intensity, stereological counts, percent immunoreactivity within a  field? Which statistical tests will be employed?? Much of this has been addressed in the re-written Project 1, however, labeling intensity will be the principle  measure in IF/IHC data, with statistical analyses tailored to the question being asked. In some cases,  intensity-per-field analyses will be sufficient, in which case images will be averaged over the whole area  and each case will be considered one data point. In other cases, cell-by-cell intensity measures will be  necessary, or even subcellular localizations, such as nuclear NEDD8 translocation. Most disease vs.  control data will be analyzed by t-test with ?=0.05, and error bars will be reported as SEM. ??using an antibody against P2yR12 might be useful in the Aim 1 studies.?  Taking the advice of the reviewer, we will add P2yR12 antibodies to analyses in both Aim 1 and Aim 3. ??The distinction between Project 1 work and Core work needs to be made clearer (e.g. what will Project 1  personnel do on Aim 1?).? The staining and initial evaluation of the tissue integrity, as well as image capture, will be performed by Core B  personnel at UAMS or ICL. Analysis of data, experimental design, statistical tests, and interpretation of  results will be performed by Project 1 personnel. Manuscript preparation will involve relevant Project and  Core members. ?Readouts are unclear?, ?The specifics? were not well defined in the first aim??  Taking the reviewer?s advice, greater care has been taken in the Approach to clearly delineate exactly what  will be measured and their interpretations, including numbers, Braak stage, and comorbidities. ??in Aim one, any observations will necessarily remain correlational.?  As is always the case in human autopsy material, only correlational data can be gleaned. This concern is  addressed by complementary in vitro and in vivo experiments to strengthen the correlative nature of Aim 1.  However, we believe it is the goal of in vitro and in vivo studies to mimic human conditions, making it  imperative to understand in the detail we can in experimental settings and what we see in human disease. ??that the studies will provide ?the first systematic? relationship to the neuroinflammatory [aspects in AD,  etc? ] This is not clear in the experimental plan... this concern was addressed by Dr. Griffin.? We have clarified our experimental plan in each of the aims we now propose, and have added much new data  to support the validity of pursuing our hypothesis and have provided more detail regarding methodology  and analysis, including which diseases are studied, and the regions to be examined. ?The PL has not set criteria for [prioritization]? for drug selection.? Our goal here is to inform Core D as we reveal disease-related mechanisms in Aim 1. In view of the new data  presented here as preliminary work, we are already coordinating with Core D for the design of specific  BBB-permeant drugs directed toward inflammatory and proteostasis pathways. These are now proposed to  be tested in Aim 2d and Projects 2 and 3."
"9320782","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five women worldwide carries latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and 3 million are diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB) each year. Women are most likely to convert from latent to active TB during and immediately after pregnancy. The immunologic conditions responsible for this phenomenon are not understood. This knowledge gap impairs our ability to develop effective LTBI screening tests for pregnant women and accurately predict which patients should be targeted for TB prevention. The need is urgent. TB is a leading cause of maternal mortality, especially among HIV-infected women. Maternal TB is also an important children's health issue: Maternal TB more than doubles the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission and significantly increases the risk of mortality for the newborn and other young children living in the household. Our recent research shows that pregnant women with LTBI have diminished IFN-gamma response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific antigens during the 3rd trimester and return to baseline 3-6 months postpartum. We hypothesize that the increase in regulatory T cells (Treg) during pregnancy reduces multi-functional CD4+ T-cell production of Th1 cytokines in response to MTB antigens, which increases the risk of progression to active TB. In partnership with BJ Medical College and the National Institute for Research of Tuberculosis/ intramural NIH-supported ICER program in India, we propose a longitudinal cohort study to describe the timing, extent, and causes of these immune changes. We will also follow women prospectively and identify immunological correlates of TB reactivation. Pregnant women with LTBI will be enrolled from the antenatal clinic in Pune, India, during their 2nd trimester with additional visits at 3rd trimester, delivery 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. At each visit, we will screen for active TB. We will also collect blood samples for IFN-gamma release assays, cytokine assays, flow cytometry, and gene transcription studies. Our first aim is to quantify the extent and timing of the suppression of Th1 cytokine production in response to MTB-specific antigens, a process that likely contributes to the reactivation of LTBI during pregnancy. By including both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women, we will further explore how HIV affects this suppression. Our second aim is to describe the cellular mechanisms underlying the suppression, which we believe is related to increase Treg frequency in pregnancy. Our third aim is to use cytokine and RNA expression profiles to identify a biosignature associated with progression to active TB. These findings will provide a comprehensive picture of the immune changes of pregnancy that compromise a woman's ability to contain MTB in its latent form. The study will also provide a path towards identifying a diagnostic biomarker to enable clinicians to identify and treat pregnant women at highest risk of developing active TB."
"9361854","PROJECT SUMMARY To address the health issues of the mostly rural northern New England population and build translational research capacity, there is a compelling need to integrate the clinical and translational research infrastructure into a network that brings together the diversity of resources and expertise of Maine Medical Center and the University of Vermont in the Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network (NNE-CTR). The goal of the Translational Research Technologies Core (TRTC) of the NNE-CTR is to provide coordinated access to state-of-the-art core facilities developed at the institutions through a combination of COBRE, INBRE, institutional and other forms of support over the last several years. The TRTC will provide access to instrumentation, expertise and other resources crucial to the success of clinical and translational research by NNE-CTR investigators. These resources include infrastructure and technical expertise for genomic, epigenetic, proteomic, cell and tissue analyses and clinical and translational genomics. In addition to providing infrastructure, instrumentation and expertise, the TRTC will provide education and training to investigators about current and emerging technologies that will be essential to the success of their research activities. The TRTC will coordinate all of these activities through a web-based portal that will serve to integrate all of these resources, thus creating a single point of entry for accessing core resources at NNE-CTR partner institutions. To accomplish these goals we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will establish the infrastructure necessary to coordinate access to NNE-CTR core facilities. A robust, highly functional web-portal will be an enabling step towards this goal. In Aim 2, the TRTC will develop, in collaboration with the Professional Development and Pilot Projects Program Cores, outreach and education programs to enhance awareness, understanding and use of advanced biomedical technologies. In Aim 3, the TRTC will work with the Tracking and Evaluation and Administrative Cores to develop evaluation tools to measure the use of core facilities and their effectiveness in advancing clinical and translational research in NNE-CTR as well as to determine the future infrastructure needs of NNE-CTR investigators. By increasing the capacity for clinical and translational investigations through enhanced access to biomedical technologies, new discoveries will be made that will directly benefit not only the health care needs of the rural northern New England population, but that of the nation."
"9302485","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The methods of behavioral and social science research are changing rapidly. Methodologic development and increasing trans-disciplinary thinking is creating exciting new opportunities for researchers and a need for ongoing educational efforts that can ensure researchers maintain cutting-edge facility with the evolving science. Such educational efforts need themselves to evolve and adapt both to teach current and innovative methods and to incorporate advances in our understanding of how to most effectively deliver educational content. We propose to develop a state-of-the-science, sustainable, and adaptable educational platform around innovative methods for the behavioral and social sciences. The proposed Methods INnovation eDucation Suite (MINDS) project will offer training in innovative methods in the behavioral and social sciences while taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by new technologies for innovative approaches to delivering this material. Overall our objectives are to (1) develop a comprehensive set of week-long short courses aimed at biomedical, behavioral, and clinical researchers and practitioners around key methodological approaches in the behavioral and social sciences (including issues of data visualization, modeling/simulation, innovative study design, adaptive data collection, and modern measurement issues), (2) enable a broad audience, untethered by geography, to participate in these focused short-courses through the development of digital versions of the same courses and (3) nurture a community of scholars interested in behavioral and social science research through the creation and curation of a dynamic digital space that includes essential resources and educational materials related to behavioral and social science research, opportunities for intellectual exchange, and novel tools that can help the behavioral and social science researcher in his/her daily work. Importantly, we aim to capitalize on a unique existing platform -the Epidemiology and Population Health Summer Institute at Columbia (EPIC)- that already offers weeklong courses in both in-person and digital formats and that has a track record of success to build the MINDS program, affording an effective, and cost-efficient approach to deliver educational opportunities to behavioral and social science researchers worldwide."
"9277345","ABSTRACT ? RESOURCE CORE (RC) 2 Pharmacological aging-modulating interventions that have been validated in animal models are ready to be translated into human clinical medicine. Among those interventions are the FDA-approved agents rapamycin, metformin and acarbose, thus, the time has arrived to test potential aging-modulating drugs in humans. The goal of the San Antonio Older Americans Independence Center (SA OAIC) is to advance discoveries made in animal models (invertebrates and rodents) towards relevant human trials. To support this goal, the mission of the Clinical Research Core [(henceforth dubbed Research Core 2 (RC2)] is to provide knowledge, skills, techniques, logistical, and clinical research support to foster an understanding of the functional and physiological effects of pharmacological and nutraceutical interventions on aging in older people. RC-2 capitalizes and builds upon the rich tradition and institutional support of aging research in San Antonio, as well as the dedicated commitment of our investigators to translational research, thereby ensuring the success of the Core. RC2 will provide clinical research guidance to support human trials that test interventions capable of modulating the aging process to improve and extend the healthspan and lifespan of older Americans. The Specific Aims of the Clinical Research Core are to: 1) Assist basic and clinical investigators in developing rigorous and appropriately powered clinical studies and trial concepts that will lead to innovative approaches to improve healthspan and lifespan; 2) Facilitate implementation and execution of translational human studies and clinical trials by investigators; 3) Provide expertise and coordinated access to resources and technology in both our OAIC and facilities throughout our institution to maximize the depth of phenotypic characterization relevant to aging in trial outcomes; 4) Provide training in clinical research for early-stage faculty and those new to clinical research. To achieve these aims, the RC2 Core will provide research project consultation and planning, assist with safety and regulatory compliance processes, facilitate subject recruitment and retention, and coordinate relationships with relevant OAIC Cores and other Core facilities of our institution. Importantly, RC2 will be critical to the OAIC?s goal of developing a clinical focus to conduct clinical research in geriatrics with emphasis on transformative translational research to advance discoveries from basic aging research to clinical trials and ultimately to clinical geriatrics. We will train early-career investigators, and partner with other OAICs, institutions, and the public to advance translational aging research. This Core will integrate other important OAIC core functions to ensure efficient trial design and execution, including integrating studies with the OAIC Biostatistics and Data Management Core (RC3), Research Career Development Core (RCDC), and the Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC). RC2 will work in synchrony with the Pre-Clinical Core (RC1) so that studies conducted by both cores are compatible and thereby facilitate translation into subsequent human trials."
"9335231","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medicare beneficiaries also eligible for Medicaid - the duals - are a heterogeneous, vulnerable, high-cost, high-priority group. Duals are on average sicker than Medicare beneficiaries not eligible for Medicaid, often with multiple chronic conditions. Conflicting regulations and incentives between Medicare and Medicaid fragment care, reduce quality, and increase total spending. With their complex needs, dually eligible individuals are especially likely to benefit from coordinated care, yet this group is less likely than other Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in coordinated care plans. The juxtaposition of high need and cost, an inefficient Medicare/Medicaid partnership, and overreliance on fragmented care models creates an opportunity for policy to both improve care and economize on public funds. Eight states have signed a memorandum of agreement with CMS, and one state (Massachusetts) has already launched its demonstration. A fundamental and innovative feature of the new state models for duals is a restructured choice environment, in which a dual beneficiary must opt-out of a coordinated care plan rather than, as now, opt-in. Project 4 focusses on the supply, demand, and normative properties of this design choice inspired by findings in behavioral economics. Using national data and data from three selected states (California, Illinois and Massachusetts) we study supply by plans in the two regimes, including examining plan decisions about supplemental benefits. We also compare choices by dual beneficiaries in the opt-in and opt-out environments, assessing the relative importance of standard choice variables and factors that may be associated with cognitive errors. Finally, we apply theory-based assessments of the functioning of the opt-in versus opt-out choice environments, drawing on research from behavioral economics, public finance and health insurance markets."
"9249443","The Administrative and Biostatistics Core will provide the overall leadership as well as the infrastructure for the Program Project Grant (PPG). The 3 Projects in the PPG represent independent but highly interactive proposals by experienced investigators who have a long track record of collaborative studies. A major goal of the Core, therefore, is to ensure optimal interaction and integration among the Projects. These diverse Projects also need the appropriate infrastructure and logistical support, such as sample acquisition and storage, data management, and central administrative coordination. Finally, throughout the history of this PPG, the Core has provided statistical support to the investigators and trainees associated with the Projects. This is the only Core being requested in support of this PPG, owing in large part to the unique environment at Mayo, where institutional Cores provide much of the needed scientific infrastructure. Thus, the Specific Aims for the Core are 1) To provide the administrative leadership for the PPG; 2) To provide the appropriate infrastructure for the conduct of the studies; and 3) To provide the biostatistical and bioinfomatic resources needed for the design and analysis of the studies. Aim 1 is accomplished through an internal Administrative Committee that will meet on a regular basis as well as an external Advisory Committee that will meet by teleconference annually and at least once in person during the funding cycle. Aim 2 is accomplished by a dedicated sample processing and data management team, along with administrative support. Aim 3 relies on the expertise of Dr. Therneau, Ms. Atkinson (a Masters level statistician who has had a long-term participation in the PPG), and a data analyst. These individuals accomplish complex statistical functions and also provide statistical advice and support to each of the investigators. Collectively, the Administrative and Biostatistics Core is the underpinning of this highly successful endeavor. This is reflected, in part, by the unique ability of our group to combine knowledge gained from population-based epidemiology studies, intensive human investigation, animal studies, and basic bone biology. Moreover, the success of the infrastructure and biostatistical support is perhaps best reflected by the ongoing productivity of our group, thus making the sum clearly greater than the parts."
"9320726","RESEARCH & RELATED - OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Administrative Core (Core A) is a centralized facility designed to manage all operations related to this PPG. It facilitates the interactions between the collaborating laboratories and is located within the Center for Drug Discovery (Northeastern University). During this cycle, the Administrative Core has been functioning very effectively. Suitable modifications were made to accommodate new directions and personnel changes. The major tasks of this Core component will continue to be: a) communicate the central scientific theme to which all component projects will direct their research efforts and maintain a focused approach while fulfilling the PPG's overall specific aims; b) manage the fiscal aspects of the PPG, maintain financial records and other administrative functions; and c) promptly and properly distribute or coordinate the distribution of materials (novel ligands; other ligands developed in the PI's laboratory; receptor mutants) produced under the auspices of Core B and the other projects. The Administrative Core also takes responsibility for synchronizing the operations and communications between the individual laboratories involved in the PPG and other laboratories which interact collaboratively at no cost to the project. This effort includes recording and distributing materials produced to the participant laboratories and to the collaborating laboratories, together with maintaining and updating the data base related to this collaborative effort. Additional specific coordinating efforts include maintaining regular telephone conferences, the yearly group meeting of participants and collaborators, as well as other communications and the quarterly meetings with the Internal Advisory Committee, as well as the yearly formal meeting with the External Scientific Advisory Committee. The Administrative Core will manage the shared resources that are required for the performance of the interrelated tasks for the individual research projects. General administrative support related to this Program Project, including financial management, correspondence and preparation of reports and proposals, will also be provided by this Core Facility. The administrative portion of this grant seeks to keep all three projects and Core B focused on the overall research goals and to enhance communication between each branch of the grant. It will enhance the ability of collaborating laboratories to focus on the central PPG's overall goal which is the development of therapies for addiction and pain."
"9440951","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A randomized controlled trial is proposed to study the effect, in a cohort of racially and ethnically diverse group of overweight and obese pregnant women, of an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) compared to Usual Care (UC) on gestational weight gain (GWG), infant fatness, and mothers' post-delivery weight retention. Women in the ILI arm will receive intensive counseling during pregnancy and group counseling after delivery regarding behavior, nutrition, and physical activity change. Visits to counselors will be weekly and additional telephone and internet contacts will occur. The mothers' will be assessed at 14 and 36 weeks of pregnancy and at 12 weeks and 52 weeks post-delivery. The measurements will be anthropometry, whole body MRI, EchoMRI, and whole body plethysmography (BodPod). The infants' measurements will be anthropometry, whole body MRI, EchoMRI, and whole body plethysmography (PeaPod) for fatness 12 weeks and 52 weeks. Mothers and children will have cardio-metabolic risk factors measured in plasma. Data will be collected regarding mothers' dietary intake and physical activity (questionnaires and accelerometry) to assist in counseling. Other data to be collected include questionnaires on quality of life, socio-economic status. Careful record will be kept of expenses in providing the ILI, so that cost analysis of the intervention can be calculated. The study is powered on the primary outcome, fatness of the infants at birth. We require 180 participants to attain appropriate power. We will enroll 210 so as to allow for some dropouts along the way. Each mother will be followed during pregnancy and for a year post delivery. Each infant will be followed for a year after birth. We have the ability o continue to follow these participants if further funding is forthcoming, as they are all local to or hospital's catchment area and our own physicians. If aims are achieved, namely that both children and mothers profit from the intervention, there should be a paradigm shift in how overweight pregnant women are treated. At present, there is a dearth of behavioral advice and intervention relating to GWG and physical activity provided to these women.  Positive results from our study would provide evidence for ILI preventative intervention."
"9312729","Abstract: Project Overview for Structural and Functional Studies of Ebola Virus RNA synthesis Ebolaviruses (EBOVs) are non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses (NNSVs) and Category A Priority biodefense pathogens that cause frequent lethal hemorrhagic fever, including the devastating and ongoing outbreak in West Africa. Approved anti-EBOV therapeutics are lacking. EBOV replicates with high efficiency in vivo while effectively evading host innate antiviral immunity. The unrestrained replication and associated inflammation leads to death. A complete understanding of EBOV pathogenesis therefore requires understanding how the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) complex interacts with host factors. The overarching goal of this program project proposal is to understand the mechanisms of RDRP function by defining the interactions among its components and with the host proteome and by defining signals that regulate its function. Toward this goal Project 1 will identify cis- and trans-acting factors that impact EBOV RDRP activity. Project 2 will define a structural basis for the EBOV RDRP complex, identify regulatory mechanisms, and determine species and strain specificities, and Project 3 will use genome-wide RNAi and proteomic strategies to identify host factors that modulate RDRP function. Project 1 provides functional context into which a subset of Project 3 ?hits? can be interpreted, while Project 3 will likely identify host factors relevant to the findings of Project 1. Project 2 will provide a structural framework that will be used to integrate findings from both Projects 1 and 3. Together, these studies will provide mechanistic insights into how protein-protein and protein-vRNA interactions control EBOV RDRP function. Research projects are supported by an Administrative Core, a Protein Production and Protein Interaction Core, and critically, a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) Core. Core B will generate unique reagents, including monoclonal and synthetic antibodies. Core C (BSL4) will provide unique capabilities to obtain materials from and perform tests using wild type and mutant EBOVs as well as pathogenesis evaluation. The work will be performed by highly productive and collaborative investigators with expertise in every aspect of the proposed studies, including biochemistry, EBOV pathogenesis, high throughput screening and data analysis, immunology, proteomics, structural biology, and virology. These studies will provide unprecedented insights into the components of the EBOV RDRP and in its interaction with the host as well as species and strain differences that affect the RDRP complex. We also expect to identify specific viral and host factor interactions as novel therapeutic targets."

"9302514","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis is caused by imbalanced lipid metabolism and represents a leading death cause in United States. Epidemiological studies showed that patients with systemic autoimmune diseases exhibit a higher incidence of atherosclerosis. Conversely, hyperlipidemia has been known to accelerate autoimmune diseases in humans and in animal models. However, there is a considerable gap in our understanding how atherosclerosis impacts the development of the autoimmunity, and vice versa. Our long-term goal is to elucidate novel cross-regulatory mechanisms governing the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and related autoimmune diseases, which will lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions for the treatment of these devastating diseases. The primary objective of this R01 application is to investigate the critical cross-regulation between atherosclerosis and autoimmune T cell responses with specific emphasis on Th17 responses. It is our central hypothesis that proatherogenic conditions promote autoimmune Th17 responses through T cell-intrinsic mechanisms which in turn accelerate atherosclerosis. The rationale is that identifying the cross-regulatory mechanisms will enable us to gain multi-disciplinary insights into the pathogenesis of the diseases. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1) Determine the role of proatherogenic condition driven Th17 responses in the development of autoimmunity and atherosclerosis; 2) Determine cell-intrinsic regulation of oxidized LDL signaling in Th17 cells. Under the first aim, animal models of autoimmune lupus and atherosclerosis will be used to examine the role of proatherogenic condition-driven Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Under the second aim, biochemical and genetic tools will be used to dissect molecular mechanism for cell intrinsic function of oxidized LDL signaling in promoting Th17 lineage commitment. Our approach is innovative, because it employs interdisciplinary concepts and unique powerful genetic tools to examine mutual pathogenic regulation between atherosclerosis and autoimmune T cell responses by placing hyperlipidemia as an autoimmune mediator. The proposed research is highly significant, because it is anticipated to substantially advance and expand our understanding of how cardiovascular and immune systems cross-talk during the development of atherosclerosis and autoimmunity. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to lead to the development of novel immunologic and pharmacologic strategies for the treatment of atherosclerosis and associated autoimmune diseases."
"9356588","To understand brain function in health and disease it is essential to rapidly monitor signaling in neural circuits. Two-photon microscopy is a core tool for neuroscience research because it enables neuronal activity to be monitored at high spatial resolution deep within brain tissue. However, the mechanical scanning and focusing of conventional designs severely limits the temporal resolution of 30 imaging and brain movement complicates recordings. We have developed a novel compact acousto-optic lens (AOL) 3D two-photon microscope that overcomes these limitations, allowing high speed imaging over volumes spanning hundreds of micrometres and real time correction of the brain movement that occurs in awake behaving animals. The agile 3D random access pointing and scanning (RAPS) at 20-40 kHz bridges the gap in the temporal resolution between optical imaging and electrophysiology. Moreover, compact design features of our AOL enable it to be added to existing two-photon microscopes at relatively low cost. This proposal aims to refine and rapidly disseminate this powerful new technology. Technology refinements include expanding the volumes that can be imaged and extending AOL-based real-time movement correction from 20 to 30. The close collaboration with experimentalists in our lab and other key leading groups distributed worldwide (to whom the technology will be initially disseminated) will ensure that current and new features of the AOL, as well as the open source GUI software, are robust and meet the requirements of the neuroscience community. This will deliver new, urgently needed technological developments required for investigating neural circuits and accelerate dissemination of this world leading technology well ahead of the 3 year timescale that is required by commercial manufacturers to bring a product to market."
"9313616","Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 15-20% of patients, and is defined by tumors that do not overexpress the estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptors. This aggressive subtype has a significantly worse overall survival compared to non-TNBCs and importantly, these patients lack options for targeted therapy. To identify novel subtype-specific therapeutic targets, we must first understand the biological underpinnings of the disease. DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer, as it can regulate gene expression of both tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. We found TNBC tumors have genome-wide hypomethylation compared to other subtypes and normal breast controls. Our preliminary data suggest most of this hypomethylation occurs outside of CpG islands (CGI). TET1 is a DNA demethylase that converts methylated cytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which can then be further oxidized or converted to un- methylated cytosine. TET1 has a CXXC DNA binding domain that allows it to recognize and bind to CGIs, but this domain limits its ability to demethylate sites outside of CGIs. However, we discovered a novel isoform of TET1 (TET1ALT) that lacks the CXXC domain, but retains the demethylase domain. Thus, TET1ALT may contribute to the demethylation observed outside of CGIs. Our analyses of TCGA data revealed TET1 and TET1ALT are upregulated in a subset of TNBC patients and that this is associated with hypomethylation and activation of genes in the PI3K pathway. We hypothesize that a subset of TNBC tumors upregulate TET1 and TET1ALT, leading to demethylation and activation of oncogenes, thereby driving tumorigenesis. We plan to test our hypothesis by overexpressing both TET1 and TET1ALT in normal mammary cells and measuring genome- wide DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation, and gene expression changes. This will allow us to determine if TET1, TET1ALT or both are leading to the demethylation and PI3K activation that we observed in our TCGA analyses. We will investigate whether the TET1 isoforms affect transformation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo by using xenograft and transgenic mouse models. This proposal will provide the mechanistic basis for targeting PI3K in breast cancer, provide methylation based biomarkers for response to therapy and further, will validate TET1 as a potential new druggable target that could be very specific for TNBC."
"9297395","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in MeCP2, a methyl-CG-binding protein that functions as a regulator of gene expression, are a major cause of Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked progressive neurological disorder associated with profound cognitive impairment in girls and women. MECP2 mutations also cause an array of other neurological disorders, including nonsyndromic mental retardation, learning disability, and autism. While the selective inactivation of MeCP2 in neurons has been suggested to be sufficient to confer a Rett-like phenotype in mice, the specific mechanisms by which the loss of MeCP2 function in postmitotic neurons gives rise to RTT pathology remain enigmatic. In preliminary studies we have discovered a subtle, yet consistent genome-wide length-dependent increase in the expression of long genes (>100 kb) in MeCP2-deficient neurons that correlates with phenotypic onset and severity in a variety of RTT models. These MeCP2-regulated long genes encode factors that modulate neuronal physiology, including a number of loci implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Remarkably, the long genes that are misregulated in RTT have a high density of non-CG DNA methylation (mCA) throughout their transcribed regions. Taken together with recent evidence that MeCP2 binds mCA with high affinity, our findings suggest that MeCP2 tempers the expression of long genes in the developing nervous system by binding mCA within their transcribed regions. Moreover, these results suggest that global disruption of the expression of long genes and/or the fidelity of transcription may underlie significant aspects of RTT pathology. To investigate these possibilities and to gain further insight into MeCP2 function in both neural development and RTT etiology, we propose (1) to characterize how non-CG DNA methylation contributes to MeCP2 function, and (2) to investigate the role of neuronal length-dependent gene misregulation in RTT pathophysiology. It is our hope that the proposed experiments will provide a better understanding of MeCP2 function, give insight into RTT etiology, and ultimately provide new opportunities for the development of therapeutic strategies to alleviate RTT pathology."
"9352233","ABSTRACT Congenital diseases of the genitourinary tract (kidneys, bladder, ureter, urethra etc.) are a leading cause of organ failure carrying with it an increased risk of death, and are a growing public health burden. At present, the only therapies are dialysis (for the kidneys) and organ transplantation. With the demand for transplants far exceeding supply there is an imminent need for alternate therapies. A comprehensive understanding of how the genitourinary tract develops in utero is necessary to effectively develop novel therapies to replace or repair injured tissue. The GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) has been successful at providing a high-resolution map of gene expression in the mouse GenitoUrinary system. However, a similar description has not been available for the human genitourinary system, nor has it been possible to develop optimized experimental techniques to grow, expand and differentiate human genitourinary progenitor cells in vitro. These research efforts by the developmental biology community have been hampered by the lack of a central hub for the procurement, quality control and distribution of human genitourinary samples. The Health Sciences Tissue Bank (HSTB) at the University of Pittsburgh has been involved in human tissue procurement for over 18 years, with a long standing history of collecting, maintaining and disbursing quality samples to research scientists, both in house and outside the University of Pittsburgh. HSTB is embedded within the Department of Pathology of the University of Pittsburgh Health Systems; thus providing rapid access to very high quality tissue and biological specimens. HSTB has established consenting protocols in line with the best practices recommendations from the NIH, a strong informatics backbone to facilitate specimen procurement and annotation, and has in place a robust quality control and quality assurance programs. The HSTB biorepository is fully accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). HSTB has an established program accruing fetal tissues. The fetal tissue IRB has been in place since 2005. HSTB has the infrastructure for dissecting specimens and collecting different tissue types. In this calendar year, we have disbursed over 300 fresh samples collected from 77 cases. The collections can be significantly ramped up as material could have been accrued from as many as 725 cases last year. We have preliminary data showing that we can isolate the human urogenital system (kidneys, ureters and bladders) from various developmental ages (6-24 weeks). We have produced publication quality images of these genitourinary organs (including kidneys and bladder) and have also been able to isolate and expand cells from various genitourinary organs. Further, we have shipped high quality tissue to various GUDMAP investigators and they have verified the quality of the tissue sent. We propose to act as both the GUDMAP Tissue Hub and Tissue Gathering site to build upon the pre-existing specialized collecting abilities of HSTB and provide high quality genitourinary samples to members of the scientific community including those within GUDMAP."
"9321765","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The application is to renew the T32 application for a Training Program in Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases from Boston University Medical Center, a Program that has been funded by the NIH since 1964. During this period, numerous postdoctoral fellows have been trained by this Program, many of whom have gone on to successful careers in academia. More recently, the inclusion of predoctoral trainees has resulted in their having a similar rate of successful careers in academia. As the composition of the Boston University Medical Center faculty has changed, and the health problems of the population, local and nationwide, have evolved over these past ca. 50 years, the translational and basic research focus and strengths of the program have evolved to meet these changes. Thus, in the current application, we emphasize four Program areas for the training of postdoctoral and predoctoral scientists and physician/scientists in which we have considerable strength. These are: i. basic (molecular, cellular) endocrine and metabolic science related to obesity and diabetes. ii. translational aspects of diabetes and obesity. iii. vascular biology and its relationship to metabolic disease. iv. thyroid and vitamin D biology, long BU specialties. To address the major health-related issues in these areas, trainees will utilize a variety of relevant animal models, in vitro cell systems as well as bringing a major focus to human metabolism at both the cellular and organismal levels. Trainees will be able to understand multiple aspects of metabolic diseases in one or more of the areas noted above, and they will be able to apply this understanding in a translational fashion to disease prevention, treatment and eventual cure. The need for such training is underscored by the explosion of metabolic disease, not only in the USA, but worldwide. The training team consists of scientists, clinicians and physician/scientists, in multiple departments at BU Medical Campus, who are highly accomplished, interactive and broadly experienced. Consequently, trainees will have access to state of the art knowledge, resources and technology provided to them by cutting edge investigators."
"9275500","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical image quality can be objectively defined in terms of diagnostic decision accuracy in clinically relevant perceptual tasks. Because of the high cost and effort involved in evaluating image quality using clinical studies, especially in early technological developments, there has been an ongoing effort to develop numerical algorithms (model observers) that can be applied to images to predict human accuracy in clinically relevant perceptual tasks. In recent years model observers have transitioned from laboratory investigations to actual tools used in technology development in the industry and for image quality evaluation by manufacturers to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration. However, the recent increase of the use of 3D medical images (computed tomography, breast tomosynthesis, magnetic resonance) has motivated a need for the development of the next generation of model observers. A fundamental limitation of current model observers is that they disregard that the human brain processes an image with decreasing spatial resolution from the point of fixation. With 3D data-sets, radiologists rarely exhaustively fixate every region of every slice; instead, they process a significant portion of images with their retinal periphery which has drastically different visual processing. Increased computer power and recent advances in the understanding of the computational neuroscience of visual search provide the opportunity to develop the next generation model observers which potentially can more accurately characterize how radiologists scrutinize medical images, as well as their decision accuracy and errors. The current project proposes to develop the 1st model observer to emulate radiologists by processing medical images with varying spatial processing resolution across the human visual field, searching through the image with simulated eye movements, and reaching a decision through integration across fixations. The foveated search model, which makes eye movements unlike any previous model observer in medical imaging, will be the 1st model to emulate radiologists in making two distinct types of errors: search errors ( missed lesions that are not fixated) perceptual errors (missed lesion that are fixated). The decisions and eye movements of over twenty radiologists reading digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images will be compared to the newly proposed foveated search model and a comprehensive list of existing non-scanning and scanning model observers in what will represent the most extensive validation study to date of model observers with actual radiologists' decisions. The newly proposed model will be utilized to optimize DBT acquisition geometry and compared to use of current metrics of medical image quality. If successful, the newly proposed foveated search model will allow for more accuracy assessment of medical image quality, could be utilized to accelerate the evaluation of new technology, optimize parameters of current technology and gain a better understanding how radiologists search and reach diagnostic decisions."
"9431365","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (Overall ICRC Summary and Personnel) PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The mission of the Center for Injury Research and Policy (CIRP) is the prevention and control of fatal and nonfatal injury (unintentional and intentional) and related disability among children and adolescents. With innovative research as its core, CIRP works to continually improve the scientific understanding of the epidemiology, biomechanics, prevention, acute treatment and rehabilitation of injuries. CIRP serves as a pioneer by translating cutting edge injury research into education, policy, programs, and advances in clinical care. CIRP's structure and culture foster integrated interdisciplinary collaboration among its world-class team of research scientists, staff, and partners, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, public and private sector entities, community groups, professionals, parents, and other stakeholders. CIRP is widely recognized as an effective voice and change agent for pediatric injury prevention and control, and plays a critical role as a resource at local to global levels for translation of injury research into practice. CIRP's administrative core provides leadership, oversight and support through effective communication, fostering a positive culture of collaborative productivity, professional development of faculty and staff, and effective monitoring, evaluation and quality improvement feedback for center actvities. CIRP's outreach core facilitates translation of research into practice through collaborative partnerships; leadership in advocacy, consultation, and technical assistance; and development, dissemination, and promotion of use of high quality, evidenced-based, pediatric injury prevention information and resources. CIRP's training and education core provides training and education opportunities to students at undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels to prepare the next generation of injury prevention professionals, and to public health and other professionals to promote an interdisciplinary approach to this public health problem at local to global levels. CIRP's research core facilitates high-quality research, which will fill important gaps in our knowledge and lead to the prevention and control of pediatric injuries through translation into effective education, policies, programs, and other interventions. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Prevention of injuries among children and adolescents deserves special focus and attention, because injuries are the leading cause of death and acquired disability among our nation's youth, and because children have unique anatomic, physiologic, psychological, and other developmental characteristics and needs that require different strategies and interventions for effective injury prevention and control, when compared with adults.

Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (Comstock Small Research Project) PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Several state level concussion policies have been passed or are in development. The content of these policies vary dramatically, the policies vary in the age of young athletes covered by the legislation, and vary in the level of sport covered by the legislation. Although all state level concussion policies have the same goal ? to make sports safer for young athletes by reducing morbidity/mortality associated with concussion ? these differences in policies are very likely to influence their effectiveness. No evaluation of these state level concussion policies has occurred to date. The objective of this research project is to evaluate state concussion policies' effectiveness/outcomes, both those that have already been passed and those that will be passed over the next 5 years, using data from The National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study (High School RIOTM), currently the only sports-related injury surveillance system capturing concussions in a large national sample of high school athletes. Specific aims are to 1) identify and investigate components of state concussion policy development/passage that may act as effect modifiers which influence their effectiveness (e.g. involvement of community stakeholders, use of data to drive discussions, etc), 2) evaluate the effectiveness of current state concussion policies by comparing pre and post policy passage concussion data and comparing states with and without concussion policies, 3) prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of state level concussion policies passed over the next 5 years, and 4) determine how specific components of state concussion policies (e.g. who is authorized to clear an injured athlete to return to play, are coaches required to take a concussion education course, etc) impact their effectiveness. The practical long term goal of this effort is to reduce the morbidity/mortality associated with concussion among young athletes by identifying the components of the most effective state level concussion policies. An additional long term goal is to identify factors associated with development/passage of state level concussion legislation and effective components of state level concussion legislation that may provide guidance for state level legislative efforts in other injury prevention arenas. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project is relevant to public heatlh because understanding what compentents of legislative injury prevention policies are most effective will lead to improved effectiveness of future legislative efforts. The project will impact public health by both retrospectively evaluating preveiously passed state level concussion policies and prospectively evaluating policies wich will be pased during the next 5 years. This project is releveant to the CDC NCIPC's mission to reduce morbidity/mortality associated with TBI.

Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (McKenzie Small Research Project) PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Research findings are typically published in reports and academic journals, venues that are rarely accessed by parents who are a primary target group for such research. Because of this, injury researchers are increasingly active at disseminating and translating research findings through local and national media. While news coverage of pediatric injury studies appears to be a useful way to disseminate information little is known about where parents typically access such information, whether parents understand messages about injury-related studies, whether they further disseminate this information and how they make decisions based on information provided by media sources. There exists, therefore, a critical need to understand how parents access, understand and use pediatric injury news. Our objective in this application is to assess how parents access, understand, react to and further disseminate information from media sources reporting on pediatric injury studies that focus on motor vehicle crashes and use of child safety seats and poisoning prevention and the safe storage of poisons and household cleaners. Upon successful completion of this project it is our expectation that we will have a better understanding of the types of media that parents access, as well as how they understand and use information conveyed in such media to prevent injuries. Aim #1: Determine parents' media access and use patterns to enhance dissemination of pediatric injury research findings; and Aim #2: Evaluate parental understanding of news messages about pediatric injury research findings. A mixed-method approach will be used. We will conduct a nationally representative online survey with 1000 parents of children 0-6 years about media access and use patterns and we will conduct focus groups with 65 parents, in which actual news segments will be used as stimulus material, to evaluate parental understanding of messages and how this varies by health literacy skills. This contribution will be significant because we expect the research will generate valuable information for injury researchers, communication specialists and others who disseminate pediatric injury research findings. The proposed research is innovative because we will make use of actual news segments on pediatric injury research findings. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This research is relevant to public health because the dissemination of injury prevention information is crucial for ensuring that a key audience is informed about safe practices. This will impact public health by ensuring that parents have access to and understand messages provided. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the CDC's mission that pertains to preventing pediatric injuries and reducing their consequences.

Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (Xiang Small Research Project) PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Drug overdoses and poisonings have become a major public health problem in Ohio as unintentional drug poisoning surpassed motor vehicle crashes and suicide in 2007 to become the leading cause of injury death in Ohio. Death certificate data and hospital discharge data have been used to describe the burden of drug poisonings in Ohio. However, drug poisoning surveillance based on death records and inpatient hospital discharge data are limited by the timeliness of their data collection and the capability of their ICD-9-based coding system in identifying important prescription drugs. Furthermore, data are lacking about drug poisonings among adolescents and young adults in Ohio. In collaboration with the Ohio's poison control centers and the Ohio Department of Health, we propose to use the national and Ohio poison control centers' data to study drug poisonings among adolescents and young adults aged 10-29 years in Ohio. The specific aims of our proposed project are: 1) to compare 2010 national and Ohio poisoning control centers' data to identify major drugs that are responsible for drug poisonings in adolescents and young adults in Ohio; 2) to assess the trends of drug poisonings in adolescents and young adults from 2000-2011 in Ohio; 3) to compare rate of drug poisonings at the county level and to identify counties that have higher than the state average rate of drug poisonings. Our research activities proposed in aims 1 and 2 is expected to identify the major drugs that are responsible for drug poisonings in Ohio adolescents and young adults. Aim 3 is expected to allow us to identify target areas for future intervention programs. To help translate our research findings into drug poisoning interventions in Ohio, we plan: 1) to disseminate our findings at local stakeholder meetings; 2) to publish a special report; and 3) to submit and publish one peer-reviewed journal article. The proposed project is significant because findings from this project are needed to guide intervention programs to prevent drug overdoses and poisonings among adolescents and young adults in Ohio. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Drug overdoses and poisonings have become a major public health problem in the U.S. in recent years. The proposed research project will provide statistical data about drug poisonings among adolescents and young adults in Ohio, which could be used to guide intervention programs to prevent drug overdoses and poisonings in local communities.

Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (Smith Small Research Project) PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Being asleep at the time of a residential fire is an important risk factor for fire-related death. Children 5-12 years of age are unlikely to be awakened by a conventional residential tone smoke alarm. However, findings from our preliminary research strongly suggest that an effective and practical alarm for this age group is achievable. Building on our previous work, the objective of the first phase of this study is to determine key smoke alarm characteristics that will awaken children and prompt their escape. The objective of the second phase of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the child voice smoke alarm in awakening older adults 65-84 years of age. Using a randomized, non-blinded, repeated measures, clinical intervention design, the objective of the first phase of the study will be achieved in two linked studies. Study 1 (currently ongoing) will identify the critical elements (i.e., use of child's first name and/or behavior commands in message content) in the maternal voice alarm that are significantly associated with polysomnography- defined awakening and successful completion of simulated escape behaviors by children after awakening from slow wave sleep. Study 2 will take the voice alarm script that was the most successful in Study 1 in awakening and prompting children to perform the simulated escape behaviors, and will compare mother's voice to a female stranger's voice using this script. In addition, a low frequency 520 Hz square wave tone smoke alarm will be included as a stimulus in Study 2 to evaluate the influence of alarm signal frequency on awakening. Study 3 will take the voice alarm script in Study 2 and compare it with a 520 Hz square wave tone smoke alarm and a hybrid (520 Hz square wave tone and voice) alarm in awakening older adults age 65-84 years old from slow wave sleep and prompting their performance of a simulated escape procedure. A conventional residential tone smoke alarm will be the reference stimulus in all three studies. The research is highly innovative, because 1) sleep stage is monitored, which is a critical factor influencing sleep arousal, 2) subjects perform a simulated escape procedure (in addition to awakening, people must escape to survive a residential fire), and 3) the influence of sleep inertia on performance of the escape procedure is assessed. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed research is significant, because it will allow the development, for the first time, of an effective and practical smoke alarm for children and older adults, which would provide an opportunity to reduce fire- related morbidity and mortality.

"9301333","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Under the current award, we have acquired exciting new evidence that satellite cells are necessary for the proper remodeling of the extracellular matrix during hypertrophy. We reported that in muscle depleted of satellite cells there was a significant increase in fibrosis that was associated with a blunted long-term hypertrophic response. Our preliminary data show that activated satellite cells/myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) are capable of repressing the synthesis of extracellular matrix components by fibroblasts through exosomal delivery of microRNAs. We hypothesize that the loss of satellite cells removes this brake leading to the over-production of collagen and fibrosis, ultimately limiting long-term hypertrophic growth. We further hypothesize that fibrosis as a result of loss of satellite cells preferentially limits growth in fast muscle fibers, whereas growth of slow fibers i limited by myonuclear domain size. Thus, fast fibers display a relatively flexible myonuclear domain, whereas slow fibers may have a more stringent requirement for satellite cells for growth. The objectives of this proposal are to use genetic mouse models and in vitro cell culture to investigate these novel roles for satellite cells in skeletal muscle adaptation by pursuing the following aims. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms underlying satellite cell regulation of extracellular matrix remodeling during skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Aim 2 will determine if fibrosis attenuates long-term hypertrophy in satellite cell-depleted muscle, and the influence of fiber type composition. Aim 3 will determine if there is a fiber type-specific requirement for satellite cell fusion during skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Our published work and new preliminary data clearly show that our understanding of satellite cell function in adult skeletal muscle adaptation remains incomplete. The studies described in this proposal address this fundamental gap in our knowledge and are expected to provide critical information necessary to more effectively evaluate the use of satellite cells as a therapeutic agent to prevent or restore the los of skeletal muscle mass associated with dystrophies, cancer, age and rehabilitation following disuse."
"9360001","The expansive goal of this project is to develop new means to visualize the activation of endogenous voltage gated ion channels (VGICs). Difficulties in identifying when and where specific VGICs become involved in electrical signals limit our fundamental understanding of neuronal circuits and impede the discovery of therapeutics. Novel tools to image the activity of VGIC subtypes enable fluorescence imaging of channel participation in physiological and pathophysiological signaling. Technology to see specific ion channels activate could aid in validation of drug targets for a host of maladies, including chronic itch and neuropathic pain. Neurons exhibit tremendous diversity in their electrical signaling, a consequence of the distinct collections of VGICs different cells. Understanding how individual VGIC subtypes contribute to electrical signaling remains a significant challenge. We propose to develop ion channel activity probes to monitor activity of VGICs in neurons. This technology we are developing can, in principle, be used to target any subtype of VGIC."
"9321238","ABSTRACT: Many immigrants groups are either too small, resulting in a large number of screening interviews to recruit a sufficiently large sample, or are reluctant to respond to conventional surveys for fear of repatriation if they are undocumented, resulting in incomplete or biased samples. This proposed study extends work on an innovative approach, Network Sampling with Memory (NSM), to efficiently and cost-effectively sample from a rare population of immigrants in the U.S. In this proposed project, we will take three important steps designed to make NSM a viable alternative for researchers in the field. First, we will use NSM to collect data on a rare population, Chinese immigrants in a well-defined geographic area (the Raleigh- Durham, N.C. metro area), which will allow a comparison of the results from our network-based sample to population estimates from the American Community Survey. Second, we will experimentally field three different survey modes: telephone, face-to-face, and online modes of data collection to identify the factors that enable NSM to generate large-scale samples with minimum cost and maximum response rates. Third, we will disseminate the computer code necessary to make NSM available for public use, which will facilitate the extension of NSM to additional immigrant groups and other rare or hidden populations, on a larger geographic scale, and promote the use of NSM by other researchers. The network data collected as part of NSM will also allow the analysis of network-related social processes associated with labor market and health outcomes and network-based measures of immigrant social incorporation.  "
"9365554","ABSTRACT The short-term safety and efficacy of bariatric/metabolic surgery for the initial remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in patients with moderate to severe obesity is well established. However, there are no prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have tested long-term efficacy, durability, and safety of this approach. Moreover, Level-1 evidence regarding the risks and benefits of bariatric/metabolic surgery in patients with diabetes and only mild obesity is limited. In this context, four investigative groups (Cleveland Clinic, Joslin Diabetes Center/Brigham & Women's Hospital Boston, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Washington) have completed RCTs that evaluated the short-term (1-3 years) effectiveness of bariatric/metabolic surgery compared to multidisciplinary medical and lifestyle management of T2D and body weight, including among patients who are only mildly obese or merely overweight. Investigators from these four RCTs have now formed the Alliance of Randomized Trials of Medicine versus Metabolic Surgery in Type 2 Diabetes (ARMMS-T2D) consortium. With the support of an NIH U34 planning grant, we have prepared this U01 application to obtain long-term follow-up data from 302 patients with T2D and a BMI of 27-45 kg/m2 (35% with baseline BMI <35 kg/m2), who were randomized to surgical or non-surgical diabetes management approaches. These RCTs include a set of common measures, and all of them have completed and published at least one-year follow-up assessments. Through the U34 mechanism, we merged study participants and harmonized study procedures and outcome metrics into a unified, prospective, longitudinal, observational framework, and to date, we have successfully enrolled 244 participants into a short-term 2 year follow-up. The primary goal of this U01 is to determine long-term (7-year) durability of glycemic control (percentage change in HbA1c from baseline) following random treatment allocation to bariatric surgery or medical/lifestyle intervention. Secondary outcomes include rates of diabetes remission and relapse, efficacy outcomes including fasting plasma glucose, body weight, blood lipids, blood pressure, albuminuria, macro- and microvascular events, cardiometabolic risk score, and quality of life, and safety including hypoglycemia and major cardiovascular events. In exploratory analyses, we will identify clinical predictors of diabetes remission and relapse. Our large, unified cohort will form the first RCT to address these questions, and it represents a cost-effective way to generate essential long-term data. ARMMS-T2D is expected to have high impact because it will provide the largest body of long-term Level-1 evidence to inform decision-making regarding comparative durability, efficacy, and safety of bariatric/metabolic surgery relative to medical/lifestyle management of T2D among patients with mild to moderate obesity."
"9281618","We propose a renewal to our currently funded NIA Roybal Center for Translational Research on Aging at  Princeton University, with the overall objectives of (1) Exploring the unique components of experiential  wellbeing (ExpWB) through the measurement of positive and negative experiences in the context of the  DRM, and continuing to explore the relationship between ExpWB and evaluative measures (EvalWB) such  as the Cantril ladder and life satisfaction measures; (2) continuing to explore the magnitude of survey mode  effects, contextual effects, and other biases in existing measures of both ExSWB and EvalWB and methods  for mitigating them; (3) investigating the extent to which people's perceptions of their SWB adapts to  changes in life circumstances (e.g. long-term unemployment, chronic disease, and widowhood) and how  those relationships differ over the lifecycle; (4) Exploring the 2010 and new 2012 combined affect and time  use data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics. The overall goal is to enhance our ability to  understand numerous facets of the aging process by clearly separating actual experiences of daily life from  the cognitive processes that give rise to reports of life satisfaction or overall happiness. As per the goals of  the Roybal RFA, we do not expect to produce definitive answers to all of questions addressed in the  proposal; our goal is to extend the work from the current grant to support subsequent large-scale studies."

"9330592","Prions or PrPSc are proteinaceous infectious agents that consist of misfolded, self-replicating states of a sialoglycoprotein called the prion protein or PrPC. Prions cause prion diseases, a family of transmissible neurodegenerative maladies that have no treatment and are 100% lethal. A number of other amyloidogenic proteins associated with several neurodegenerative diseases show prion-like self-replicating behavior in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, PrPSc is unique in several important aspects. PrPSc shows incredibly high infectivity titers, transmits efficiently between organisms via natural routes, and replicates in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) in addition to the CNS. Moreover, prion diseases in humans can originate from transmission of animal prion diseases. Why is PrPSc so incredibly transmissible and how does it escape the host immune system? In the past, the amino acid sequences of host PrPC and strain-specific structures of donor PrPSc were identified as key parameters that control prion replication. The current application is based on new evidence we have obtained strongly suggesting prion transmission is linked to the extent of sialylation modification of PrPSc. The fact that N- linked glycans of PrPC and PrPSc are sialylated was described more than 30 years ago. Yet, prion sialylation has been completely ignored, mostly due our limited knowledge of the roles of sialylation in biology. In mammals, sialylation of glycans is proposed to act as a part of a ?self-associated molecular pattern?, helping the immune system to discriminate between ?self? and ?altered self? or ?non-self?. Here, we propose a new hypothesis that sialylation of PrPSc controls both its fate and the outcomes of prion infection in an organism. In support of this hypothesis, we found showed that administration of PrPSc with reduced sialylation levels to animals does not cause prion disease or prion infection. The first aim of this application will provide a thorough evaluation of the hypothesis that sialylation of PrPSc controls its fate in an organism, including its trafficking, clearance and, most importantly, disease outcome. The second aim will elucidate the underlying mechanisms why secondary lymphoid organs are highly permissive to prion transmission and, specifically, the role that sialylation plays in cross-species prion transmission. The third aim will test a novel hypothesis that sialylation of PrPC creates a replication barrier and, as such, controls the susceptibility of cells and/or tissues to prion infection. As a whole, this work will establish the role of sialylation in prion diseases. This study will likely lead to new insight into our understanding of prion propagation and transmission, which may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9312303","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Transcriptional enhancers have emerged as predominant functional elements in the noncoding portion of the human genome. Mounting evidence supports the existence of hundreds of thousands of enhancers in our DNA, far outnumbering the ~20,000 protein-coding genes. The fundamental importance of enhancers in humans becomes increasingly appreciated as human genetic studies implicate rapidly growing lists of noncoding sequence variants in human disease, of which many are likely to alter enhancer functions. Over the past two funding cycles of this R01, our group has been a leader in identifying and characterizing enhancers that are active in vivo in developmental and disease-relevant tissues, including developing and implementing strategies for enhancer discovery in the human and mouse genomes and building large catalogues of in vivo enhancers characterized in transgenic mouse assays. A fundamental finding from these studies is the complex nature of in vivo enhancer activity in time and space, which is not readily captured in cell lines, requiring studies directly of human or mouse tissues. Despite substantial progress in annotation of enhancers in the human genome, significant questions regarding distal enhancers remain, including: (1) How essential are enhancers in organismal function? (2) Which genes does each of these distant-acting enhancers regulate? (3) What differences in enhancer landscape exist among different cell types located within the same heterogeneous organ or tissue? (4) How can we enable and facilitate the discovery of mechanistic links between enhancers and human disease? Accordingly, in this competitive renewal, we propose to: (1) Use the exciting Cas9/CRISPR technology in conjunction with our established pipeline for large-scale mouse oocyte injections to efficiently and cost-effectively generate a series of enhancer knockout mice to assess enhancer function in vivo, (2) capture genome-wide enhancer-promoter interactions directly from mouse tissues to experimentally determine which genes specific enhancers regulate in vivo, (3) develop technology to use individual enhancers with well-defined activity patterns as drivers to isolate pure populations of labeled cells from transgenic mouse tissues, which will enable enhancer characterization at cell type-specific resolution, (4) continue to provide community access to genomic enhancer resources including high-throughput transgenics and new streamlined Cas9-engineered enhancer knockout capabilities to define enhancer function in vivo and assess the functional significance of variants linked to human disease. Through these studies, we expect to gain significant insight into the role of enhancers in mammalian biology, revealing the impact of enhancer deletions on gene expression and downstream phenotypes, the regulatory targets of enhancers, and the cell type specificity of enhancer activity within mammalian tissues. With the projected growth of clinical whole-genome sequencing, this work will be vital to aid in understanding and predicting the consequences of sequence variation in noncoding elements in human physiology and disease."
"9385497","Abstract The extent, nature and pathogenesis of neuro-cognitive impairments among individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) are poorly understood. Patients with T1DM are living longer and thus are commonly entering an age (50+) when such impairments become more evident, but are, as yet, understudied. Past, small studies suggest aspects of cognition, brain structure, function and chemistry that may be affected by T1DM and may increase in severity and clinical importance with aging. The Diabetes Control & Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions & Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study affords an unparalleled opportunity to use longitudinal data gathered over 30 years from early in the course of illness, among this well- characterized cohort, to examine important and unresolved questions about the frequency and pathogenesis of neuro-cognitive impairments as patients enter the age of highest risk. DCCT/EDIC participants have had continuously high rates of participation (currently 94% of the surviving cohort), and are now returning for an additional five years of follow-up (2017-2022) for ongoing and new biomedical assessments including evaluation of cognitive functioning and depression. This application, submitted in response to RFA-DK-16-007, will leverage available data collected in this cohort from past evaluations and from the new planned 5-year follow-up. We plan to assess effects of risk factors including: exposure to hyperglycemia as documented by HbA1c measurements during DCCT/EDIC, recurrent severe hypoglycemic events, variation in glycemia using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM ), history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and presence of micro- vascular and macro-vascular complications on the integrity of the brain evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the association of brain changes with neuro-retinal degeneration assessed by a novel method-Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT). We hypothesize that the presence of T1DM, prior conventional DCCT treatment assignment, elevated HbA1c levels and history of severe hypoglycemia will lead to reduced total brain volume, our primary outcome, and also result in detectable vascular, neuro-degenerative, neuro- chemical and functional changes assessed by MRI. In addition, we postulate that these primary risk factors in concert with other secondary risk factors (e.g.: glycemic variation, hypertension & micro-vascular and macro- vascular disease), will differentially affect frontal & temporal regions. Changes in the brain will be associated with decreased cognitive functioning, especially on measures of psychomotor efficiency. To reach these goals 400 T1DM subjects from the DCCT/EDIC cohort randomly selected to represent a broad range of biomedical outcomes will be compared with a non-diabetic control population (n=100) of similar age and social/educational background using identical cognitive and neuro-imaging techniques. Completion of these aims will determine key predictors of neuro-cognitive impairments in patients with T1DM and guide personalized strategies to mitigate this risk in providing clinical care for patients with T1DM."
"9315860","Establishing a sustainable and CRT-informed overall research environment that more strongly motivates  and prepares students for research careers and reduces the leakages that occur is an essential aim in our  work to help students to successfully navigate these transition points.

"9314034","Project Summary/Abstract  This project aims to address the influence of a unique parenting behavior ? indulgent parenting ? on adolescents? well-being, which is highly relevant to the NICHD?s mission of promoting adolescent development. As the current culture of the U.S. promotes parental indulgence, indulgent parenting may play a critical role in accounting for the current health problems among adolescents. Despite the prevalence of such parenting practice, little research exists. To fill the gap, in this project, we propose to examine the effect of indulgent parenting on the behavioral and emotional well-being of adolescents from diverse backgrounds.  Three specific aims are proposed: 1) evaluate the prevalence and degree of indulgent parenting and delineate cultural and socioeconomic variations; 2) examine the association between indulgent parenting and adolescents? behavioral and emotional problems; and 3) investigate the cognitive mechanisms linking indulgent parenting and adolescents? behavioral and emotional problems.  Data will be collected from 9th to 11th grade students from two developmental schools. The unique feature of these schools is that, rather than by geographic proximity, the students are enrolled from seven counties, therefore more diverse and representative than those in local private or public schools. A total of 450 adolescents are projected to participate to fill out an online survey. In addition, their primary parents/caregivers will be invited to participate and fill out an online survey. Measures include the key variables and other demographic and background information. Various statistical modeling will be utilized.  The project is significant in that it has the potential to make important theoretical contributions to the field by conceptualizing indulgent parenting as a multi-dimensional construct. Further, this project could provide much needed empirical evidence on how indulgent parenting is associated with behavioral and emotional well- being of adolescents from different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Findings from this project could provide valuable information for preventive intervention programs for adolescents and parents.  In addition, the project is innovative in that it could improve over previous studies in many aspects, such as using a multi-dimensional approach, examining cultural and socioeconomic variations with a cultural ecological perspective, collecting data from multiple informants, and using advanced statistical techniques.  The team is capable to accomplish the field work and do the science. This project could serve as a necessary first step to establish basic knowledge for future studies, such as the studies of the long-term effects of indulgent parenting into young adulthood and cross-cultural phenomenon of such parenting practice and their implications."
"9338280","Project 3 Summary Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessively inherited syndrome characterized by bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition, and congenital anomalies. FA is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in any of 16 genes which function coordinately to promote DNA repair and prevent apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines. Treatment options for marrow failure in FA include androgens and hematopoietic stem cell transplant, but clinical outcomes have been limited by treatment-related toxicities. To address this challenge, this project will investigate and develop alternative medical therapies with greater efficacy and reduced side effects. The mechanism of action of therapeutic agents carries profound implications for FA patient prognosis. Agents that block adaptive stress responses to DNA damage may improve marrow failure but at the risk of promoting the survival of genetically damaged cells which may increase the risk of clonal evolution. Our hypothesis is that compounds that rescue hematopoiesis by protecting from DNA damage provide opportunities to develop safer and more effective therapies to treat marrow failure in Fanconi anemia. The prior funding period of this program project resulted in the identification of several small molecule compounds that improve growth and hematopoiesis in murine models and immortalized cell lines. The molecular mechanism(s) whereby these compounds rescue FA cells will be investigated in Project 1 (PI: Dr. Grompe) and Project 2 (PI: Dr. D'Andrea). Project 3 focuses on evaluating these compounds in primary FA bone marrow cells and FA induced pleuripotent stem cell (iPSC) models (Aim 1) to investigate their effects on hematopoiesis, DNA damage, DNA repair response, and clonal outgrowth. Compounds that rescue hematopoiesis by reducing DNA damage will be prioritized for clinical trial development in Aim 2. Potential biomarkers of DNA damage will be developed for correlative biological studies within the clinical trial. The successful completion with these aims will yield a clinical trial protocol and associated regulatory documents ready to implement by the completion of this project. These agents may be broadly applicable for the treatment of marrow failure in general."
"9333087","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, with a 5-year survival rate of <15%. This alarming prognosis makes clear the urgent need for new efficacious agents for its treatment. Phospho-sulindac (PS), a novel compound developed by us, inhibits the growth of lung cancer xenografts by 87-103%, eliminating, in one study, 3/7 lung cancer tumors. In addition to its remarkable efficacy, PS has an exceptional safety profile. Thus PS has a strong potential of becoming an efficacious agent for the treatment of lung cancer. Our preliminary data indicate that the mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of PS is, in its essence, the following: PS induces oxidative stress, which activates redox-sensitive signaling cascades, which in turn block cell cycle progression, inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis; the end result is inhibition of tumor growth. The development of oxidative stress by PS is due to: a) activation of NADPH oxidase, which generates the free radical superoxide anion; and b) suppression of several members of the antioxidant system of the cell, both enzymatic (the thioredoxin system, peroxiredoxin, cytoglobin, superoxide dismutase) and chemical (glutathione).These effects increase rapidly the cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) shifting the redox balance towards oxidative stress. In vivo, co-administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine and PS suppresses oxidative stress and eliminates the anticancer effect of PS on lung cancer xenografts. Our hypothesis is that PS is a highly effective and safe agent for the treatment of lung cancer acting predominantly by inducing oxidative stress. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Assess the efficacy of PS against lung cancer in animal tumor models: We will expand the efficacy studies to include xenografts of additional cell lines mirroring the genetic subtypes of lung cancer and a transgenic model of lung cancer. 2) Validate efficacy results in patient-derived lung cancer xenografts. They provide excellent prediction of drug efficacy in humans; we will study tumors with KRAS or EGFR mutations. And 3) Study in vitro and in vivo the molecular targets involved in the induction of oxidative stress by PS and the downstream signaling pathways that mediate its anticancer effect. We will evaluate the main contributors to oxidative stress and signaling pathways downstream of oxidative stress."
"9348388","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive Functions (EF) are higher-order cognitive processes (e.g., working memory, set-shifting, inhibitory control) that support self-regulation of behavior and develop in early childhood. Early EF abilities are robust predictors of academic readiness and socio-emotional competence; and EF interventions have been identified as potential paths for decreasing health-related disparities experienced by disadvantaged populations. EFs are highly malleable in early childhood and social influences seem to play a significant role in contributing to individual differences in children's abilities; however, curren developmental models lack specificity with respect to which caregiver behaviors are the most influential. Recent domain approaches to parenting propose that the socialization of children occurs within distinct domains (e.g., guided learning, control, and reciprocity) and domain-specific parenting practices serve to promote domain relevant child outcomes. The current application will apply this novel domain approach, which may provide conceptual clarity to developmental models of child EF, and enhance the ability to draw firm conclusions about the key parental socialization behaviors associated with individual differences in children's EF abilities. This will be accomplished by testing the differential associations among parental socialization practices and child EF, with the hypothesis that parenting practices within the guided learning domain will be more proximally related to child EF outcomes in comparison to other socialization domains (AIM 1). Second, differential susceptibility frameworks have identified child temperamental characteristics of negative emotionality and exuberance as plasticity factors that evince heightened sensitivity to both positive and negative aspects of parenting; however, this has yet to be examined within the context of child EF. The present study will integrate differential susceptibility and domain frameworks to delineate whether this 'for better or for worse' pattern as it pertains to child EF is specific to variations in guided learning parenting practices (AIM 2). Aims will be tested within a study of 162 socioeconomically and racially diverse mothers and their 5 year-old children. New elements of this work include the application of a domain approach to parenting in examining specific parental socialization practices associated with individual differences in child EF, integration of differential susceptibility framework to examine how child temperament fits within this model, observational coding of different domains of parenting and child temperament, and multi- method assessments of child EF (performance-based tasks, caregiver reports). Findings will enhance understanding of the interplay between parenting practices and individual child variables in association with individual differences in children's EF. Research also has the potential to identify specific targets for parenting interventions towards supporting child EF outcomes, and the child characteristics that moderate their efficacy."
"9360133","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA modifications are ubiquitous in biology and present in all classes of cellular RNAs including eukaryotic messenger and long non-coding RNA. A large fraction of mammalian mRNA/lncRNA modifications are also known to be reversible, highly dynamic, and occur in cell type and cell state dependent manner. The dynamic RNA epitranscriptomes, those involving N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in particular, are known to regulate many cellular activities including mRNA splicing, export, cytoplasmic localization, stability, translation activity, microRNA processing, immune tolerance, and to impact cellular processes including proliferation, development, circadian rhythm, and embryonic stem cell differentiation. Consider m6A in mRNA/lncRNA as an example, dedicated writers, erasers, and readers exist in human cells to orchestrate an additional layer of complex post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. Emerging new functions of RNA modifications are expected to follow, with significant implications on many aspects of human health and disease. Despite high potentials and promises, current epitranscriptome studies are significantly hampered by the lack of technologies that enable quantitative mapping of any type of mRNA/lncRNA modifications at high resolution and high sensitivity. This proposal will develop new methods that target five abundant mRNA/lncRNA modifications, namely m6A, 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), pseudo uridine (?), and 2'O- methyls (Nm) for high-throughput sequencing at single-base resolution and suitable for low input RNA isolated from just hundreds to thousands of cells. New bioinformatics tools will be developed in order to facilitate data analysis. The general approaches proposed can be broadly applied to sequence RNA modifications in other RNA species including more abundant ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, snRNA, and snoRNA as well as miRNA and piRNA. We will apply the newly developed methods to obtain base-resolution maps of RNA modifications in order to associate with human diseases, and to proof-of-principle studies in neuro-biology. Our proposed research will establish high-throughput, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity methods for epitranscriptome research in all biological areas."
"9404083","PROJECT SUMMARY  Current approaches to treat sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in newborns suffering from congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection rely on off-label, systemic antiviral therapy requiring high dose, long duration treatment with demonstrated hematologic toxicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. Furthermore, it is unknown whether systemic delivery of antivirals maintain inner ear drug concentrations within an appropriate therapeutic window for sufficient lengths of time to achieve therapeutic effect. A novel delivery system for long- term, controlled release of antivirals to the inner ear would constitute a dramatic improvement in CMV-related SNHL treatment options. Our proposed strategy uses Unisun technology to create a long-acting single transtympanic injection of ganciclovir-loaded microspheres for round window membrane (RWM) localization and sustained-release to the inner ear. The central advantage of our approach is that Unisun allows for precise control of particle size, shape, material, and drug release rates.  Our long-term goal is for transtympanic delivery of Unisun-enabled ganciclovir-loaded microspheres to be the standard-of-care for newborns suffering from CMV-related SNHL. We hypothesize that microspheres can be retained on the RWM for over four weeks and that ganciclovir release can be maintained (~65 µg/day) to sustain a therapeutic concentration in the inner ear fluid. We expect that this novel approach to localize ganciclovir treatment to the inner ear will dramatically improve the safety and efficacy of antiviral therapy for CMV-related SNHL over current non-FDA approved options.  Orbis? research team will first develop and characterize the relationship between the microsphere size, material, drug concentration and ganciclovir release profiles to establish the feasibility of achieving long-term, controlled release to the inner ear (Aim 1). We will then determine the optimal microsphere immobilization strategy to enable RWM localization for a minimum of one-month with minimal toxicity in a guinea pig model (Aim 2). This Unisun-enabled drug-delivery strategy addresses issues of dosage accuracy and long-term release. In addition, Unisun-based encapsulation is highly adaptable and can serve as a transtympanic delivery platform for multiple drug classes. This unique strategy has significant potential to become the standard-of-care for treatment of CMV-related SNHL."

Training activities will include didactic coursework and specific workshops, directed readings and one-on-one tutorials with mentors, and instruction in the responsible conduct of research. The candidate will receive mentorship from a Training Team comprised of globally renowned experts in the fields of HIV epidemiology, mixed methods research, and socio-structural intervention implementation in low-resource settings. Her applied research training will take place in Mbarara, Uganda in collaboration with Mbarara University of Science and Technology. Mbarara District is a rural region, approximately 275 kilometers southwest of the capital city of Kampala, with an HIV prevalence of nearly twice the national average (12%). Prior research in Mbarara has demonstrated the importance of Traditional Healers in providing healthcare for communities in this area, but little is known about Traditional Healer practices or rates of HIV testing (or HIV infection) among their clients. Specific aims of this study are to: 1) identify key socio-structural factors that frame HIV testing behaviors among Ugandan adults who utilize Traditional Healers; 2) investigate acceptability of providing point-of-care HIV testing at Traditional Healer practice locations; and 3) develop and pilot a prospective HIV testing intervention among Traditional Healer patients to promote earlier diagnosis. Results will generate effect estimates for parameters needed to inform power calculations for a subsequent, large-scale cluster-randomized HIV testing intervention at Traditional Healer practice locations, and will position the candidate to develop an R01 application for submission to NIMH at the end of the award period. The proposed work represents a high priority research topic designated by the NIH Office of AIDS Research to ?reduce incidence of HIV/AIDS ? [by] developing, testing, and implementing strategies to improve HIV testing and entry into prevention services?."
"9323221","ABSTRACT  The Program Enhancement Core will oversee all activities conducted by the Center, promote/publicize the services of the Research Cores, and evaluate performance. The Core will interact with all the Research Cores, providing administrative support, including the collection of frozen tissue/cell samples and fee-for-services from investigators using the Cores. The Program Enhancement Core will provide both intellectual and organizational leadership in developing the first Geroscience Consortium in the nation. This consortium will be fostered through meetings, workshops, conferences and research seminars and promote interactions and collaborations between faculty in aging and Geroscience faculty. Through an innovative Discovery Bioinformatics Component, investigators will be provided with statistical and bioinformatics support, including unique bioinformatics tools and methods. The Discovery Bioinformatics Component faculty have invented and experimentally validated a computational method to infer gene relevance to age-related phenomenon by analyzing co-expression correlations across thousands of publicly available microarray experiments and cross-referencing the most correlated gene sets against the peer-reviewed literature to identify their commonalities. For the first time, investigators studying age-expression correlations in model organisms will be able to relate their observations to humans and to predict whether age-expression changes in a tissue are consistent between organisms. The specific aims of the Program Enhancement Core are:  Aim 1. To provide administrative/management support for the Center. The Core will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the center; will oversee budgets, including cost recovery for the Research Cores; will promote the integration of services among the Research Cores; and will conduct annual internal and external evaluations every other year.  Aim 2. To promote/publicize services and activities provided by the Research Cores. The Core will be responsible for making the scientific community aware of services provided by the Research Cores through a series of mechanisms.  Aim 3. To provide the intellectual and organizational leadership to develop a premier research program in Geroscience in Oklahoma. The long-range goal of the Core will be to establish an Oklahoma Geroscience Consortium.  Aim 4. To provide Research Cores and investigators with the services of the Discovery Bioinformatics Component. The Discovery Bioinformatics Component will provide Research Cores, as well as Pilot Project Investigators and Center Faculty, support with statistical and bioinformatic analyses as well as assistance in discovering and interpreting biological changes that accompany aging."
"9268454","DESCRIPTION         Veterans with Parkinson's disease (PD) have impaired mobility, which adversely affects their quality of life. The candidate has demonstrated the effectiveness of adapted tango dance, in which participants both lead (internally guide: IG) and follow (externally guide: EG) movement (Hackney & Earhart 2009, 2010). To improve outcomes, the underlying neural mechanisms for both motor impairments and improvement must be investigated. IG and EG movements have distinct neural patterns. Individuals with PD have trouble with IG movement but this problem is helped by strategies employed while leading. During following, participants with PD can exploit multiple external cues, which facilitate movement in PD, because EG tasks bypass the basal ganglia (Freedland et al., 2002). In older veterans with PD, we aim to determine neural activation patterns during IG and EG lower limb movement and then examine effects of IG and EG training on neural activation in conjunction with mobility improvements. The long-term goal is to optimize motor training for veterans with PD by understanding lower limb motor circuitry in PD as well as neural changes in circuitry through which training is effective. The objectives are as follows: 1. To explore neural activity of lower limb movements in veterans with PD under IG and EG conditions, and then to evaluate neural changes in circuitry after IG and EG training through adapted tango, using a randomized controlled trial design 2. To gain expertise in imaging of complex neuromotor systems of veterans with and without PD, and then apply this expertise to the evaluation of neural circuitry changes as a result of training. 3. To gain further experience in rehabilitative study methodology. 4. To Improve hypothesis generation, reasoning ability and problem solving while investigating PD motor impairment, its underlying mechanisms and response to targeted training. Mentoring: The mentoring team combines faculty with expertise in fMRI, rehabilitative clinical trials, and the care of persons with PD. Mentors include Krish Sathian, MD, Ph.D. (Primary, neurology, imaging), Steven L. Wolf, PhD. PT (motor rehabilitation, clinical trials), Daniel Corcos (PD, imaging, motor rehabilitation) and Bruce Crosson (PD, imaging, neurocognitive evaluation), Ph.D. Marian Evatt, MD and Kaundinya Gopinath, Ph.D. will serve as clinical and research collaborators, respectively. Career and Research Plan: Career development activities include coursework and seminars in neuroscience, imaging, statistical and rehabilitative methodology. The candidate's mentors will provide structured readings and discussions on motor systems, the pathophysiology of PD, motor rehabilitation and imaging applications. The research plan will begin with an fMRI investigation. We will examine neural correlates of a clinically-used foot-tapping task, during IG and EG conditions in veterans aged 40-70 with and without PD. Then, we will assess the relative effectiveness of IG versus EG training during an adapted tango class, compared to a behavioral control for improved mobility and foot tapping, Participants with PD will be assessed for disease severity, and will receive tests of outcome measures while OFF medications, 1 week before training, and 1 week and 1 month after training. Participants must attend 20 lessons of IG or EG adapted tango in 12 weeks, taught by an experienced instructor. In an fMRI scanner, we will assess participants for improved foot tapping after training and investigate changes in activation in specific neural circuits in conjunction with training effects upon mobilit. The candidate expects the proposed career and research plan will prepare her to apply for Merit Review funding to establish independence as an investigator. This plan will also provide greatly needed evidence to support guidelines for the treatment of motor impairment in veterans with PD."
"9301307","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our project seeks to determine mechanisms and functions of electrical synapse plasticity (ESP) induced by NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation in mammalian brain. ESP induced by NMDAR activation that strengthens electrotonic coupling was observed in a fish cranial nerve synapse and in retina and recently in the mammalian inferior olive (IO) by our group, suggesting a general mechanism. The IO is an excellent system to study ESP because interneuronal communication in the IO occurs only by electrical synapses and because the IO has well-defined roles in behavioral adaptations, such as during vestibulo-ocular reflex adaptation and eyeblink conditioning (EBC). A significant challenge is to determine whether strengthening ESP synchronizes in vivo network activity to modulate behavior. Two mechanisms are involved in strengthening ESP in the IO: 1) it requires stimulation of CaMKII; and 2) it occurs within glomeruli of dendritic spines in which NMDARs are in close proximity to gap junctions. Thus, the science in this application addresses 2 important questions: 1) is there a role for NMDA-receptor stimulation of CaMKII in the IO for in vivo activity coherence underlain by ESP to influence behavior?; 2) what protein interactions in IO neurons underlie NMDAR-mediated ESP? Our experiments will determine: 1) whether impairing ESP as measured in vitro reduces activity coherence in the in vivo IO; 2) whether impairing ESP within the IO impairs the adaptive timing of movement measured by eyeblink conditioning; 3) how ESP changes the protein interactome of connexin36; and 4) whether scaffolding proteins implicated in the structural relationship between connexin36 and the NMDAR are necessary for ESP. Successful completion of the project will point to new processes that contribute to optimal brain function whose disruption may contribute to brain disease."
"9306712","Project Summary/Abstract ? Project 3 The goal of this ethnographic study is to understand the cultural context of postpartum pelvic floor support following vaginal delivery, as experienced by Mexican-American and Euro-American women. Major risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse (POP), experienced primarily by parous women, include vaginal childbirth, family history, and age; some studies find an association with Hispanic heritage. Preventive measures have been understudied, in part because it is infrequent for women to visit a physician regarding symptoms of a vaginal bulge until the vaginal wall descends to or below the level of the hymen. Future advances in preventing pelvic floor disorders will only be achieved if research efforts are directed toward understanding the impact of early changes as well as the implementation context for preventive strategies. Currently, little is known about how women become aware of early changes in vaginal support and its meaning for them. Specifically, we are interested in the early occurrence of pelvic floor changes, how they are perceived, and how women come to understand these changes and respond to them. We will explore the experience inter- generationally by interviewing primiparous women and their intimate others (mothers, partners, sisters, confidants) regarding the transmission of cultural knowledge, including onset, prevention, management, and self-care, especially related to 1) inklings and understandings of early changes in vaginal support, 2) their interplay with physical activity, and 3) how to translate this knowledge into early detection, improved care, and quality of life. In Aim 1 we use techniques of focused ethnography to describe Mexican-American and Euro-American women's experiences and cultural knowledge of postpartum pelvic floor support changes, including how early changes interplay with physical activity. In Aim 2, the collective knowledge gained from the entire parent P01 and novel findings from this project will be compiled into a nationally-disseminated, web-based resource toolkit for women, their families, and clinicians. The toolkit will include a checklist of early pelvic floor changes that we will develop in English and Spanish and preliminarily validate in this study."

Our five- year research plan will focus on scientific questions that the contributing cohorts cannot answer individually and which do not overlap with existing projects. During the five years of the next IeDEA round, the overall aims of WADA are: 1) to measure trends and characteristics of antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation in different HIV programs throughout West Africa. This will follow the adoption of the new 2015 WHO guidelines promoting universal tests and treat; 2) to characterize the strategies used at site and country levels to increase the degree of viral load suppression among HIV-infected adults and children on ART: a) changes in routine and targeted prescription of HIV plasma viral load; and b) improvements in both the retention in care and adherence to ART; 3) to document the trends in ART response and impact in HIV- infected specific populations, focusing on adolescents transitioning in care, individuals with hepatitis B co- infection, HIV-2 infected patients and women of reproductive age especially on the relationship between HIV care and reproductive health services. To date, the pooled database assembled by the WADA Collaboration in the current IeDEA cycle includes 84,594 HIV-1 infected adults and 6,043 HIV-infected children who initiated ART in 28 clinics; in addition the database also includes data from 5,209 HIV-2 or HIV1&2 infected adults of whom 3,984 are on ART. The next round will involve 22 HIV clinical centers (adults: 12, pediatrics: 10) in eight countries (Benin, Cote d'Ivoie, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo). Among them, two adult clinics and one pediatric clinic are new collaborating centers. WADA is coordinated at the Bordeaux School of Public Health (ISPED) in Bordeaux University, France with a WADA Regional Office hosted by PAC-CI, a research-oriented non-governmental organization situated in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. This research team has a long-lasting experience in observational HIV research including large-scale prospective cohorts in West Africa. Data will be collected from affiliated cohorts every year according to standardized procedures and will be merged at the Coordinating Center in Bordeaux. Capacity building in participating centers will include funding for local human resources, training on data quality, on-site technical support and annual meetings to reinforce the technical and scientific network. The priority research agenda will address the following topics:, trends in ART initiation and response, retention in care, natural history of HIV-2 and HIV-1/HIV-2 infections, cancer, hepatitis B co-infection, mental health, pregnancy outcomes, adolescent and pediatric access and quality of care."

"9312891","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a common neurological disorder affecting neonates and infants, characterized by increased head size, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation, and CNS disability. Neurosurgical removal of CSF offers palliative treatment, yet affected individuals still suffer from neurological sequelae and a need for continual CSF removal and shunt revisions. No truly disease-modifying therapies are currently available. Our proposal explores a new mechanism in the etiology of PHH, particularly occurring during prenatal or premature life, through the actions of lysophospholipids (LPs). These small, membrane- derived lipids include the glycerophospholipid known as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) that can be present at high levels in blood or hemorrhagic fluids. LPA activates a family of LPA receptors, and preliminary data demonstrate the involvement of at least one receptor, LPA1, in mediating the actions of hemorrhagic fluids and LPA in promoting PHH in an animal model. This model also recapitulates comorbid changes within the brain that have been associated with prenatal PHH in humans. Three specific aims will be pursued over a 5-year period to test the hypothesis that the initiation and progression of PHH involves LPA signaling that further provides a foundation for developing new, therapeutic approaches. Aim 1. Assess effects of prenatal LPA exposure on neuroanatomical changes associated with PHH. Aim 2. Assess intracranial fluid composition and compartments in the PHH mouse model. Aim 3. Determine LPA-dependent PHH developmental timing and assess therapeutic tractability."
"9211411","SUMMARY  The loss of tissue regenerative capacity is an almost ubiquitous aspect of mammalian aging. Underlying this age-related change is a decline in the potential of tissue-specific stem cells to participate in tissue repair and regeneration. In skeletal muscle, this has been amply demonstrated for the resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs), whose response to injury has been shown to decline with age in response to cell-intrinsic changes and to suppressive activity from the aged systemic milieu, the former perhaps arising from the latter. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of the cellular changes that integrate these diverse inputs to render a MuSC less responsive with age remains to be determined. Likewise, the molecular basis for the cellular memory that persists ex vivo and that can be ?reprogrammed? in vivo in response to different environments remain to be elucidated. Understanding these fundamental mechanisms of MuSC aging provide the potential for being able to intervene to restore youthful characteristics to aged stem cells, thus enhancing aged tissue repair and regeneration.  Toward these goals, this Project focuses primarily on epigenetic mechanisms based on the hypothesis that it is the epigenome that integrates diverse signals, mediates cellular responses, and is amenable to reprogramming in response to diverse environmental influences. In collaboration with Projects 2 and 3 and with Core C, we will explore the epigenetic features and regulators of young and aged MuSCs, in terms of transcriptome (RNA-seq), epigenome (ChIP-seq), and nucleosome positioning (ATAC-seq). In collaboration with Core B, we and Projects 2 and 3 will explore in more detail the notion of ?epigenetic rejuvenation? by studying the epigenetics of aged MuSCs (and other stem cells) exposed to rejuvenating interventions that have been shown to restore youthful function to aged stem cells. We will examine a specific histone mark, trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) what we have shown previously to be strikingly enriched in aged MuSCs. We will examine how that pattern changes in response to rejuvenating strategies and how it is regulated by chromatin modifiers. In collaboration with Project 3, we will explore the role of DNA methylation in MuSC aging, also testing how this epigenetic pattern, and resulting cellular function, changes in response to Core B interventions and to alterations in expression of DNA demethylases. We will also use modified CRISP/cas9 technology to modify DNA methylation in a locus-specific manner. Finally, in collaboration with Project 2, we will explore the population dynamics of MuSC aging by using single cell RNA-seq analysis to evaluate changes in clonal diversity and to test for clonal expansion, a process that we will also explore independently using clonal lineage tracing strategies. We will work closely with all members of this Program to integrate our efforts to lead the field of epigenetics of stem cell aging."
"9396689","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This project seeks to engineer a potent, specific, and clinically relevant treatment platform to target B-cell lymphoma, which is often refractory to chemotherapeutic treatments. To accomplish that goal, this project develops a peptide-based nanoparticle platform for disrupting oncogenic protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and inducing cell death specifically in lymphoma B cells without targeting other cells. Cancer cells often upregulate pro-survival PPIs to sequester and inactivate tumor suppressor proteins and evade programmed cell death, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Despite intensive pharmacologic efforts to target and disrupt oncogenic PPIs, only one FDA-approved small-molecule drug exists to do so. Synthetic peptides, in contrast, have emerged as promising tools for disrupting PPIs because they more accurately mimic the large, alpha- helical binding domains known to be crucial for many PPIs. However, major barriers remain to successful in vivo delivery of therapeutic peptides to their intracellular targets, including: (i) short circulation half-lives, (ii) non-specific cellular targeting, (iii) poor cellular penetration, and (iv) poor binding affinity due to loss of alpha- helical secondary structure. Two molecular engineering approaches, hydrocarbon ?stapled? peptides and peptide-amphiphile (PA) nanoparticles, have been used to overcome subsets of these obstacles, though neither overcomes them all simultaneously. Hydrocarbon stapled peptides are formed by adding a hydrocarbon ?staple? across alpha-helical turns of a peptide to physically lock it in an alpha-helical conformation and more accurately mimic the structure of the native protein and improve binding affinity to its target. PA nanoparticles, meanwhile, enhance therapeutic peptide circulation times, serum stability, and cellular uptake, and can be functionalized with targeting moieties to actively target specific cell types. This project seeks to simultaneously overcome the barriers to therapeutic peptide delivery by combining hydrocarbon stapled peptides and PA nanoparticles. This work aims to do so in three ways. First, synthesize and characterize a p53-mimicking stapled PA (p53-sPA) designed to reactivate tumor suppressor protein p53 and reinstate cell death in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a cancer in which most clinical cases have wildtype p53 inactivated by aberrant PPIs. Second, deliver p53-reactivating nanoparticles specifically to malignant DLBCL cells using antibody single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) specific for B-cell surface antigen CD19. Lastly, combat chemotherapeutic resistance in DLBCL using mixed PA nanoparticles to spatially constrain the delivery of synergistic peptide therapeutics targeting the p53 and BCL2 pro-survival PPIs. The success of these aims will create a new treatment paradigm for potently and specifically killing cancer cells while avoiding the development of chemotherapeutic resistance."
"9269267","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) describe an approach to science education that explicitly integrates three dimensions of the scientific endeavor- Science and Engineering Practices, Disciplinary Core Ideas, and Crosscutting Concepts. A major challenge to implementing this vision is the lack of NGSS-aligned curriculum materials and teachers' need for professional development that builds their ability to effectively implement this new approach to instruction.  To address the curriculum need, the Genetic Science Learning Center (GSLC) at the University of Utah will utilize the experience it has gained over the past three years in developing NGSS-aligned curricula as well as its award-winning expertise in developing effective, interactive, multimedia learning experiences, to produce two new life science curriculum units.  The goals of the Genes and Microbes: Engaging Students and Teachers in NGSS-Aligned Curricula and Professional Development project are to:  GOAL 1: Educate secondary-level students about the impacts of genes and microbes on health and disease so that they can make informed choices related to their health. Objective 1: Produce two curriculum units that each address the three dimensions of the NGSS. Objective 2: Evaluate the efficacy for student learning of the two curriculum units using small-scale randomized controlled trials.  GOAL 2: Prepare teachers to use the two curriculum units through online professional development courses, and workshops at the state, regional and national levels. Objective 1: Hold six online professional development courses for 180 middle and high school teachers at underserved schools across the US. Objective 2: Present five or more dissemination workshops on the units at science teacher conferences.  The middle school unit will address the NGSS topic of Structure and Function using microbes as a means to engage students in learning cell biology. The high school unit will address the Disciplinary Core Idea of Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits, using human traits to learn about inheritance, sources of genetic variation, probability and risk. Each unit will integrate Science Practices and Crosscutting Concepts and both will focus on the Practice of engaging in argument from evidence. Once developed, the GSLC will hold online courses for 180 middle and high school teachers from underserved schools, providing experience with NGSS- aligned curricula via the units and building skills in evidence-based argumentation and other Practices.  The project will leverage the GSLC's expertise in producing highly effective, NGSS-aligned curricula and professional development programs. The units will be broadly disseminated via our Learn.Genetics and Teach.Genetics websites, which are used annually by >18 million visitors who come from every country."
"9284448","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to explore a new mechanism of kidney regeneration which is based on newly identified angiogenic and glomerulotrophic functions of macula densa (MD) cells, and to test its potential therapeutic utility in chronic kidny disease (CKD). Our overall, long-term vision is that a new therapeutic approach, fundamentally different from existing strategies, one that amplifies this novel intrinsic renal repair mechanism, will provide the ultimate cure for this devastating disease. The salt-sensing macula densa (MD) cells of the distal tubule are chief cells within the kidney, strategically positioned at the glomerular entrance, and play key sensory and regulatory functions in body fluid- electrolyte homeostasis. Preliminary work using intravital multiphoton microscopy (MPM) of the same intact kidney region over several days provided visual clues that in response to MD-derived signals, mesenchymal progenitor cells residing in the renal interstitium proliferate and migrate towards the MD, and via the vascular pole into the glomerulus and proximal tubules. Therefore we hypothesize that MD cells are master regulators of renal tissue remodeling, and perform this new, non-traditional function via the generation of novel secreted angiogenic and glomerulotrophic factors, and their paracrine actions on the reactivation and recruitment of mesenchymal progenitor cells. Further, we hypothesize that augmenting these MD mechanisms in CKD may result in rapid tissue remodeling and improved kidney structure and function (regression). This project will use comprehensive experimental approaches including new transgenic mouse models, cell fate tracking, MD transcriptome analysis, bioinformatics, MPM imaging, and a model of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The specific aims are to (1) functionally characterize the novel renal tissue remodeling function of MD cells, and to (2) examine the effects of MD activation on kidney structure and function in CKD. These novel MD cell functions may be targeted in the future development of new therapeutic approaches for the better treatment of CKD."
"9370219","PROJECT SUMMARY The continued and inevitable emergence of antibiotic resistance demands a vigorous and sustained effort to identify fundamentally new targets and strategies for innovative antimicrobial therapeutics. Antibiotic-resistant enterococci are major causes of hospital-acquired infections. Enterococci are successful hospital-acquired pathogens in part because of their intrinsic resistance to commonly used antibiotics that target the bacterial cell envelope, such as cephalosporins. However, many questions remain regarding the genetic and biochemical basis for cephalosporin resistance in enterococci. In preliminary studies we identified two widely conserved genes encoding ?conserved hypothetical? proteins of unknown function (termed IreB and IreC) that modulate intrinsic enterococcal cephalosporin resistance. IreB acts as a negative regulator of cephalosporin resistance, while IreC promotes resistance. However, the mechanisms by which IreB and IreC influence cephalosporin resistance are unknown, and few clues are available to guide the development of hypotheses to explain their roles. The research proposed here is designed to elucidate new insights into the roles of IreB and IreC in the biological processes that drive enterococcal cephalosporin resistance. To do so, we will use unbiased, genome-wide genetic approaches to identify cellular factors that influence cephalosporin resistance in cooperation with IreB and IreC. By doing so, the research proposed here will provide new insights into the fundamental biological processes that drive key antibiotic resistance in enterococci and may define new targets for innovative therapeutics designed to impair enterococcal antibiotic resistance."

Our proposed approach presents a strong experienced NERI team, which builds upon decades of successful close collaboration with NHLBI, and ensures efficient scientific and administrative support to the PHN, using 21st century technologies.  A multiple PI leadership plan is proposed to continue the leadership roles shared by Ms. Miller (Network Operations) and Dr. Stark (Statistics), with clearly delineated roles and responsibilities for leading and directing the DCC."
"9305080","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a single central aim project to investigate the role of autologous endothelial cells (ECs) in regulating the generation of definitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). The transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) allows for the cure of patients with hematological disorders. Because of limited availability of HSCs from donors, derivation of HSCs from hPSCs provides an alternative source of HSCs for bone marrow transplantation. However, generation of hPSCs-derived HSCs that are capable of long-term engraftment and differentiation to multilineage hematopoietic cells remain significant challenges, which limits progress of the clinical applications of stem cell therapy and gene therapy using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The difficulty to efficiently generate HSCs from hPSCs is possibly due to a restricted temporal window and demanding niche cues for HSC emergence and development from hPSCs. During embryonic development, hemogenic ECs, a specified subset of ECs in vascular endothelium of aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM), give rise to multipotent HSCs. We hypothesized that during hPSC differentiation, autologous ECs provide vascular niche to promote the generation of definitive HSCs from hemogenic ECs in multiple stages, including hemogenic EC-to-hematopoietic transition, pre-HSC maturation to HSCs, and HSC expansion. We have developed a novel reporter system to monitor definitive HSC emergence from hemogenic ECs by utilizing Runx1 enhancer and minimal promotor of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) gene. Using this reporter system and cell immunophenotypes, we will test our hypothesis, and investigate the role of extracellular ATP/adenosine from vascular niche in regulating the generation of definitive hematopoietic cells from hemogenic ECs. CD73, an ecto-5'-nucleotidase that convert AMP to adenosine at cell surface, plays a key role in extracellular ATP metabolism and the generation of adenosine. Adenosine-receptor signaling promotes definitive HSPC generation in AGM. However, CD73 is absent in hemogenic ECs. We will use CD73-deficient hiPSCs and pharmacological regents to investigate how extracellular ATP/adenosine regulates definitive HSPC generation. To evaluate their functionalities of repopulation and differentiation in vivo, we will characterize hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells derived from hemogenic ECs by a human-to-mouse xenogeneic transplantation model, which represents powerful tools and essential preclinical platform for assessing human HSC function. Our investigation will provide new insight into the human HSPC generation regulation mechanism, accelerate the establishment of a novel strategy to generate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and lead to a preclinical study for cell-based therapy for hematological disorders."
"9303434","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a worldwide epidemic that contributes considerably to the overall cost of health care in developed nations. The number of people afflicted with this complex disease is increasing at an alarming pace-a trend that is likely to continue for many years to come. The overall goals of our proposed research are to identify the mechanical culprits that dictate the bifurcation of the system from the stable healthy state into the instable state of HF and to determine the borderline between physiological/compensatory and pathophysiological/non-compensatory growth and remodeling (G&R). To address these goals, our research approach is to experimentally inform and validate multiscale laws of myocardial growth and remodeling (G&R) using three different clinically relevant large animal HF preparations in order to predict the propensity of patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) developing HF. Our specific Aim 1 is to elucidate a predictive validated multiscale law of myocardial G&R in eccentric hypertrophy associated with cardiac dilation. We hypothesize that a fiber-strain-based growth law can predict cardiac G&R in response to volume-overload, i.e., elevated myofiber strains stimulate concentric growth. Competing hypotheses based on stress-, strain rate-, and strain energy will be tested. Aim 2 is to validate a predictive multi-scale law of myocardial G&R in concentric hypertrophy associated with wall thickening. We hypothesize that a unified cross-fiber strain based growth law can predict cardiac G&R in response to pressure-overload. Similar competing hypotheses as in Aim 1 will be tested. In Aim 3, we will apply these G&R laws to predict the propensity for HF in ischemic heart disease based on specific mechanical indices of myocardial function. We hypothesize that there exists a threshold of a maximal rate of change of strain in reference to sarcomere length, above which compensatory G&R is not possible and the physiological negative feedback loop to maintain homeostasis gives way to a positive feedback loop that leads to progress remodeling and ultimate demise of the myocardium. Successful completion of this work will provide a fundamental understanding of the response of myocardium to mechanical stimuli that has substantial clinical relevance. Scientifically, this approach will provide the first ever validated and calibrated predictive micro-structural model of myocardial growth and remodeling that is fundamental to cardiology, tissue engineering, cardiac rehabilitation, and cardiac surgery. Clinically, we will provide a specific mechanical index to predict the propensity of HF in ischemic heart disease that may have a significant healthcare implication."
"9309088","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Weakness is a major complication of critical illness that complicates recovery both during the first few weeks following illness as well as the quality of life 1 to 2 years after the illness. During the acute recovery period, weakness often prevents patient weaning from the ventilator, prolonging intensive care unit stays, and leading to greatly increased cost, complication rates and mortality. In a recently published paper we found, in both patients and rats, that difficulty in recruitment of motoneurons to fire is an important contributo to weakness triggered by critical illness. Preliminary data presented in this grant suggests difficulty recruiting motoneurons to fire may persist after recovery from critical illness and thus may contribute to long term weakness. Reduced motoneuron excitability as a mechanism of weakness has never been proposed and thus represents a novel area of research into weakness triggered by critical illness. In vivo intracellular recording from motoneurons in adult rats will be used in combination with modeling of motoneuron excitability to identify potential mechanisms underlying the reduction of excitability. Potential mechanisms will further be explored using dynamic clamp of motoneurons in vivo to correct the defect(s) in ion channels that underlie the reduction in excitability. Preliminary data suggests we have identified a class o drugs that can correct the defect in excitability. It is our hope that identification of drugs that improve motoneuron excitability will rapidly translate to new therapy that improves the rate of rehabilitation and the quality of life for patients after hospital discharge."
"9312757","Project 1  Title: TGF?, PI3K and HER2 pathways in breast cancer metastasis  Leader: Joan Massagu?, Ph.D.  Key Personnel: Swarnali Acharyya, PhD, Research Associate   Yilong Zou, Graduate Student  PROJECT SUMMARY:  Even if diagnosed at an early stage and surgically removed, breast cancer can relapse within months to  decades in bones, lung, liver and brain, as well as locally. Although the five-year disease free survival rate is  89% in patients with well-treated localized breast cancer, the appearance of metastatic disease is almost  always a harbinger of eventual cancer mortality. Under the auspices of this P01 grant, we uncovered important  roles the TGF? in in triple negative (TN) and HER2+ breast cancer, and unexpected roles of the PI3K pathway  and CXCR2 signaling in breast cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. Progress includes (i) generation of  mouse models of breast cancer metastasis, now used in labs worldwide; (ii) alteration of the TGF? pathway  from tumor suppressor to metastasis promoter; (iii) identification of breast cancer metastasis genes and  pathways; and (iv) discovery of the tumor self-seeding process, which views tumor dissemination as a  multidirectional process. Since the last competitive renewal our work has illuminated the intersection of the  TGF? and PI3K pathways in oncogenesis and metastasis, and heightened the interest on these mediators in  the survival and chemoresistance in disseminated breast cancer cells. Our Specific Aim 1 is to identify  mediators of TGF?-driven metastasis. The identification of TGF? target genes that mediate its pro-  metastatic action would help target metastasis downstream of TGF? and its receptors. We will use newly  developed TRAP technology to identify TGF? regulated genes in breast metastatic cancer cells in host tissues.  In Specific Aim 2 we will define the metastasis suppressive capacity of PI3K-AKT and CXCR2  inhibitors. Our recent work identified the PI3K pathway as a critical mediator of micrometastatic cancer cell  survival and a protector against reinstated TGF?-dependent tumor suppression, and CXCR2 signaling as an  important defense of breast cancer cells against chemotherapy. In collaboration with J. Baselga, S.  Chandarlapaty, L. Norton and N. Rosen, we will investigate farmacologic strategies targeting these effectors to  define their effectiveness against disseminated breast cancer. Our Specific Aim 3 is to identify metastasis  genes and functions in HER2+ breast cancer. HER2+ breast cancer is presently in a crisis of increased  incidence of brain metastasis, yet little is known about the molecular drivers. There is also extensive evidence  that TGF? enhances metastasis in this type of breast cancer. Based on new models of HER2+ breast cancer  metastasis that we have recently developed, we will identify genes that drive metastasis, in particular  metastasis to brain, in HER2+ breast cancer, and the impact of TGF? in this process. With S. Lowe we will use  innovative shRNA screening techniques to functionally characterize the candidate metastasis genes. Thus, the  continuation of the present P01 is focused on studies that directly emerged from our recent progress and rely  on collaborations with the other P01 participants for the progress against breast cancer metastasis."
"9396814","Project Abstract  Cancer is driven by a complex network of genes and pathways. Decades of research have discovered various oncogenes and tumor suppressors that can drive cell transformation and malignancy. However, there are many genes that are essential for cancer cell survival, but are not mutated themselves. These ?non- oncogenes? can be involved in various cell-survival pathways such as the stress response, and might explain some of the heterogeneity observed among tumor cells that have the same driver mutations. How can we identify and target these genes to offer alternative routes to disarm and sensitize cancer cells to therapeutic interventions?  One way to identify ?non-oncogene? pathways is to evaluate how proliferating cells adjust to variable and evolving environments. By examining heterogeneous transcriptional regulatory states of single cells in a 3D culture model of breast epithelial organization, our lab discovered an important regulatory pathway that had a common upstream regulator, NRF2. NRF2 is a known oncogene in lung cancer, but mutations in the transcription factor are uncommon in breast cancer. In this proposal, I am studying the role of the non- oncogene, NRF2, in an aggressive subtype of breast cancer, in the hopes of determining new strategies to disrupt this non-oncogene addiction. This project entails three interrelated aims: 1) to determine the functional importance of NRF2 for growth, organization, and survival of triple-negative breast cancer cells; 2) to quantify and model the broader network context of NRF2 dynamics; 3) to test the impact of NRF2 on breast tumorigenesis in vivo. These aims are focused on the non-oncogene NRF2, which is classically known as an antioxidant transcription factor. Most cancer-related studies of NRF2 have focused on mutations in the transcription factor and the pathway associated with it. Our hypothesis is that there is another layer of NRF2- driven tumorigenesis that occurs on the single-cell level without mutation. A detailed understanding of NRF2 regulation could enable new strategies to disrupt this non-oncogene addiction and re-sensitize cancer cells to their environment and to chemotherapy."
"9353180","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While tremendous progress has been made in genetic definition and biological treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there remains a lack of fundamental knowledge about the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of this disorder. Recent technological developments allow for precise molecular analysis of disease tissues down to the single cell level. We propose to interrogate circulating immune cells and synovial tissue cells to identify the molecular and cellular correlates between systemic immune cell diversity, synovial pathology and clinical phenotypes. In Specific aim 1 (phase 0), we will optimize processes for the preparation and storage of synovial tissue and peripheral blood leukocyte samples in order to support a variety of advanced analytic techniques. These include single cell RNA seq of synovial tissue cells, epigenetic studies (ATAC-Seq), CyTOF mass cytometry for high-dimensional analysis of cellular phenotypes, and RNA seq analysis of at least 12 peripheral blood leukoctye subsets. We will also support development and feasibility studies of novel technologies for in situ molecular and cellular analysis of histological sections of synovial tissu. In addition, we will develop synovial cell lines to enable detailed study of synovial cell biology.In Specific Aim 2 (phase 1), we will enroll 30 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis for study of blood and synovial tissue using the technologies developed and validated in phase 0. A systems level analysis of these data will drive the selection of specific assays to be utilized in a larger patiet cohort. In Specific Aim 3 (phase 2), we will carry out an observational cohort study of 250 early RA patients enrolled over a three year period with analysis of both synovial tissue and peripheral blood leukocytes. We will employ a set of focused assays that emerge from the studies in Phase 0 and 1. The disease course, therapy and response to therapy will be documented in all patients. We will address the following hypotheses: 1) multiparameter analysis of synovial tissue can define subsets of disease with distinct clinical features or outcomes; 2) analysis of peripheral blood cell subsets with high dimensional molecular and cellular data, can identify correlates for these disease subsets; 3) useful parameters can be developed that can identify, as well as predict, therapeutic response."

ADMINISTRATIVE CORE The ultimate goal of an Alzheimer?s Disease Core Center (ADC) is to promote innovative research on dementia and its treatments while ensuring that patients and caregivers become the beneficiaries of resultant advances. An effective Administrative Core is essential for transforming these goals into accomplishments. To this end, the Administrative Core of the Northwestern ADC will be guided by the following specific aims: 1) Lead the day-to-day running of the ADC and promote ?centerness? so that ADC components function cohesively and leverage dementia-related activities throughout Northwestern University. 3) Maximize the utilization of ADC resources to fit local and national priorities. 2) Facilitate interactions with the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC), national consortia such as ADNI and ADCS, the Alzheimer?s Association, and relevant agencies within the City of Chicago and State of Illinois. 3) Encourage innovative pilot projects, coordinate their review, and monitor the progress of those that receive ADC funding. To fulfill its specific aims, the Administrative Core will oversee the finances of the parent NIA P30 and of additional contracts related to multi-center collaborations and clinical trials. It will be responsible for timely progress reports related to these activities as well as the organization of the yearly Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) meeting. An equally important role will be to insure that the ADC as a whole meets all IRB and HIPAA requirements and that it is in compliance with NIH policies for human subjects, animal welfare, scientific integrity, data and sample sharing and financial policy. The Administrative Core is also responsible for coordinating the interactions of the ADC with NIA, other NIH components, other ADCs, and relevant agencies at the national, state and local levels. Within Northwestern University, the Administrative Core will advocate the allocation of additional faculty, space and financial resources to dementia research."

DiaComp provides an environment to foster communications and collaborations between investigator communities involved in diabetic complications research. Toward this goal, DiaComp sponsors annual meetings in complications-relevant scientific areas, solicits and funds pilot projects in high impact areas of complications research, and supports a website to serve the diabetic complications community. During the previous five year funding cycle, the CU was responsible for continuing support for DiaComp through the use of opportunity pools (funding), manage/maintain the website and phenotyping data and administratively organize the meetings and workshops sponsored by the DiaComp to engage the greater diabetic complications scientific community. Our laboratory has been the CU for DiaComp for the last 16 years. The CU is responsible for creating and maintaining the administrative, scientific and informatics infrastructure necessary to organize and facilitate consortial operations. The goal of this proposal is to provide that infrastructure. We will build upon the success of the current DiaComp CU infrastructure to provide DiaComp with a robust and comprehensive service oriented solution that supports the unique aspects of this consortium."
"9301632","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation are at high risk for morbidity and mortality. Although several recent advances have improved management of such patients, these therapies have been incompletely adopted and patient outcomes continue to vary across hospitals. One factor that may be associated with improved translation of evidence into practice is the experience of the physician provider. Previous studies indirectly provide evidence for this relationship; for example, higher annual hospital volume is associated with reduced mortality. However, there is little direct evidence, physician experience has not been defined, and the capacity of organizational solutions to modify the relationship is unknown. A better understanding of this complex relationship could reveal novel targets for interventions to improve uptake of evidence-based practices of mechanically ventilated patients and ultimately their outcomes. Therefore the overall goal of this proposal is to understand the relationship between physician experience and outcomes for mechanically ventilated patients. Specifically, we will determine (1) if there is an association of physician experience, defined as years since completing of training, with patient outcomes; (2) the relative contributions of physician experience and hospital volume to patient outcomes; and (3) if effects of physician experience are modified by the presence of organizational factors. For this project we will create an innovative database linking multiple publicly available administrative and clinical datasets of patients hospitalized in the state of Pennsylvania with data obtained from a state-wide hospital survey and will use state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques to advance our understanding of the role of the physician in patient outcomes. This database and career development award will be a foundation for the candidate's future work as an independent clinical researcher with a focus on developing and implementing organizational interventions to improve care of patients with acute respiratory failure. Dr. Meeta Prasad Kerlin has a clinical background in pulmonary and critical care medicine and a Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology from the University of Pennsylvania. She has demonstrated her interest and aptitude for clinical research through the successful completion of several research projects in the topics of critical care outcomes and education. She has had multiple publications in high-impact journals such as JAMA and Critical Care Medicine. In this proposal, she has developed a career development plan that includes a complementary approach of didactic learning, structured professional development, intensive mentorship, and direct research experience leading the project described above. She has the full support of her department, outstanding mentors who are already the leaders in critical care outcomes research, and access to the vast resources of the University of Pennsylvania. Together, these will ensure her successful development into a leader in her own right."
"9327441","Project Summary DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a post-replicative system of proteins that corrects rare mistakes in the genome of all organisms. In the human genome of 6 billion bases, there are ~ 600 errors per round of replication, per cell. If left uncorrected, errors accumulate as permanent mutations in a genome, and can lead to a disease state in the organism. MutS and MutL homologs are tasked with recognizing a mismatch in 107 correctly paired bases, discriminating between parent and daughter strand, then initiating repair. Single amino acid mutations in MutS and MutL proteins have been linked to hereditary and sporadic colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer worldwide. Although these mutations, mostly associated with MutL, have been identified in cancer cases, it is unclear how MMR deficiencies initiate and advance the disease. Failures in the mismatch repair pathway likely initiate tumorigenesis, but we lack a fundamental understanding of the MMR process. On the molecular level, we know that MutS initially recognizes a DNA mismatch, and undergoes ATP- dependent conformational changes to slide along the DNA. MutL is recruited to the site, and interacts with MutS on DNA to coordinate repair with PCNA, EXO1, DNA polymerase, RFC clamp loader, RPA single strand binding protein, and DNA ligase. We also know that MutL undergoes conformational changes upon ATP binding and hydrolysis, which likely functions to coordinate transient interactions with repair machinery. Previous studies show four distinct conformations of MutL that we believe must be regulated and functional in MMR. MutL is the central player in the middle of the pathway that directs multiple molecular interactions, but how it carries out its functions remains poorly understood. MutL mutations are associated with a spectrum of cancers, thus we need to understand its dynamic molecular interactions and MMR functions, which begin with the MutS-DNA recognition complex. Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is uniquely capable of investigating the molecular mechanism of MMR that involves multiple transient protein- protein and protein-DNA interactions. The molecular mechanism of mismatch repair is critical for further revealing how mutants fail to repair, and will provide a basis for identifying therapeutic strategies. We hypothesize that mutations in functional ATPase and interfacial regions of MutL are inadequate in their functional conformational changes and fail to advance repair. To explore these open questions, we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Characterize the nucleotide-dependent dynamics of MutL conformations in the absence of mismatch DNA in vitro using single molecule FRET. Specific Aim 2: Investigate the dynamics of wild-type and mutant MutL conformations in the context of mismatch repair initiation with nucleotides, MutS, and mismatch DNA in vitro with smFRET."
"9310346","G?s-Hedgehog signaling in intramembranous bone formation and expansion Summary The development of a functional skeletal system requires tight spatial and temporal control of osteoblast differentiation and maturation. How osteoblast cells are induced at the outset of bone development is a central question in understanding the organizational principles underpinning a functional skeletal system. Extraskeletal or heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs as a common complication of trauma or in rare genetic disorders and can be disabling and lethal. The precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HO are not clear. Research in our lab has provided insights into the molecular and cellular regulation of bone development and recently we have identified a novel G?s-Hedgehog (Hh) signaling axis that critically regulates ectopic osteoblast differentiation in progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH). POH is a rare human genetic disease in which HO occurs predominantly through an intramembranous process and progresses from subcutaneous tissue into skeletal muscle and deep connective tissues. POH is caused by inactivating mutations in GNAS that encodes G?s that transduces signals from G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). We have found that loss of G?s function in POH leads to ligand-independent activation of Hh signaling, which in turn induces osteoblast differentiation of mesenchyme cells in soft tissues, whereas activation of G?s signaling leads to Wnt/?-catenin signaling upregulation and reduced osteoblast differentiation in the human condition of fibrous dysplasia (FD). We have further observed in our preliminary studies that ectopic bone formation and expansion in POH bare cellular and molecular similarities to craniofacial bone development. Here we will build upon our unique perspectives and test our central hypothesis: Hh signaling activation by G?s inhibition induces osteoblast differentiation during intramembranous bone formation and recruits wild type cells into ectopic bone during progressive ossification in POH. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the role of G?s-regulated Hh signaling during formation and growth of intramembranous bone. In Specific Aim 2, we will extend findings in normal craniofacial bone growth to ectopic bone in POH. We will test our hypothesis that ectopic bone in POH expands by inducing a suture-like tissue where wild type osteogenic mesenchyme stem cells reside. Our proposed studies will provide an unprecedented level of insight in acquired HO and the regulation of osteoblast differentiation under both physiological and pathological conditions. Knowledge gained here from the mouse models of POH will be readily translatable to human diseases such as POH, acquired HO, FD, craniosynostosis and osteoporosis. We anticipate that our findings will have broad significance with respect to cell-fate specification and reprogramming processes during development, repair, and regeneration of many other organ systems where G?s-Hh and G?s-Wnt signaling plays a critical role and enhance our understanding of these signaling pathways in human diseases including cancer."
"9350383","ABSTRACT Whole genome sequencing has vast potential to improve the care of generally healthy adults by identifying predispositions for disease to facilitate targeted prevention and screening efforts, by informing treatment options when illnesses do develop, and more. It may also cause more harm than good through false-positive findings, through unnecessary monitoring because of incomplete genetic penetrance, and because the conditions identified by genomic sequencing may lack effective prevention options. Adding to the unease about genomic sequencing are concerns that its use among healthy adults will cause healthcare expenditures to surge not only due to the costs of sequencing, variant classification, and periodic re-analysis, but also by initiating a cascade of follow-up diagnostic testing and potentially-unnecessary screening. Uncertainties about the utility and costs of integrating genomic sequencing into clinical settings are hindering the development of genomic testing policies and discouraging payers from reimbursing for these services, particularly for testing of populations that are asymptomatic for disease. Reservations about embracing genomic testing may be warranted, but are currently based in speculation about the benefits, harms and costs of sequencing rather than evidence. For the field of genomics to achieve its potential now and in the future, research programs need to begin systematically assessing these outcomes with rigor. This career development grant addresses the dearth of cost-effectiveness researchers in genomics by proposing a research and training agenda that builds on the recognized skills of a young outcomes researcher in clinical genomics to help him launch an independent career investigating the cost-effectiveness of genomic sequencing. Already, the candidate is a high-profile researcher, having received an NIH-funded National Research Service Award and having published over two dozen peer-reviewed publications about psychological and behavioral responses to genomic information. Through this grant, this newly-appointed Instructor will gain additional skills in cost- effectiveness research alongside clinical trials by conducting a five-year follow-up of the healthcare costs and health outcomes from his proposed mentor's pioneering randomized trial of whole genome sequencing in the clinical care of healthy adults, the MedSeq Project. The candidate will also gain skills in decision modeling and working with ?big data? by creating a decision-analytic model that projects the costs and utility of genomic sequencing over patients' lifetimes. Lastly, the candidate will identify the areas of research that will provide the most value for cost-effectiveness research by conducting a value-of-information analysis about genomic sequencing among healthy adults. Findings from the proposed research will not only generate critically-needed insight about the value of genomic sequencing among healthy adults, but will also provide the candidate with foundational skills and pilot data for an R01 submission to understand the cost-effectiveness of genomic sequencing throughout patients' lives."
"9320666","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a syndrome that can result from mutations in several different genes, most of which encode proteins of the nuclear envelope. Skeletal muscle wasting and weakness, joint contractions and life-threatening cardiomyopathy are the classical clinical features. Autosomal EDMD results from mutations in LMNA, which encodes A-type lamins, intermediate filament proteins lining the inner nuclear membrane. Most cases of X-linked EDMD result from mutations in EMD, which encodes an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane called emerin. Emerging human genetic data demonstrate that mutations in the gene encoding LAP1, another integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane that interacts with A-type lamins and emerin, also cause muscular dystrophy. Based on our previous research, we have devised a hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of EDMD proposing that: 1) A-type lamins, emerin and LAP1 form a complex in the nuclear envelope that plays a critical role in striated muscle maintenance, 2) this complex regulates the MAP kinase ERK1/2 and its disruption activates this kinase and 3) the dual-specific phosphatase DUSP4 links activation of ERK1/2 to enhanced AKT-mTOR signaling, which impairs autophagy and induces metabolic defects that lead to heart and skeletal muscle pathology. Using novel murine and cellular models, we will test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will use mice with genetic depletions of A-type lamins, emerin and LAP1 to test to establish that these proteins function together in striated muscle cell maintenance in vivo. In Aim 2, we will use biochemical and biophysical methods to characterize the lamin-emerin-LAP1 complex and examine its interactions with ERK1/2 and DUSP4. We will also determine if disruption of the lamin-emerin-LAP1 complex activates ERK1/2. In Aim 3, we will test the third part of our hypothesis by crossing mice with alterations in the lamin-emerin-LAP1 complex to mice lacking DUSP4 and determining if this reduces AKT-mTOR activity, reverses defects in autophagy, normalizes cellular energy metabolism and ameliorates pathology. From a public health standpoint, this project will provide an understanding of how mutations in different genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins cause EDMD and related myopathies and identify novel targets for therapies that could change current treatment paradigms."
"9285824","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory hypersensitivity is commonly seen in FXS patients and the FXS mouse model - the Fmr1 knockout (KO). Recent data suggests that this abnormality stems from hyperexcitability in sensory circuits. We have established that cortical microcircuits are hyperexcitable in the Fmr1 KO mouse model, and that sensory responses are enhanced in Fmr1 KO mice and FXS patients. Thus, investigation of sensory sensitivities is clinically relevant, but perhaps more important is the promise of sensory system studies to advance understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of hyperexcitability in neocortical circuitry that could represent a primary pathophysiological factor impacting the development of a wide range of perceptual, cognitive, and language skills in FXS. Further, we have identified biochemical signaling mechanisms that may underlie hyperexcitability involving processes that we and others have uncovered that can be examined in detail in KO mouse models and tested in FXS patients to develop a foundation for novel therapeutic development. The striking consistency of findings across levels of investigation and species offers an unprecedented opportunity to investigate mechanisms of brain dysfunction in a mouse disease model and translate it directly to patients - a multidisciplinary mission that is ideal for a Center environment. Our Center is organized to pursue precisely this aim with a tightly integrated and highly novel scientific program of translational research. Project 1 (Huber/Gibson; UTSW; co-investigators) will determine the cellular, molecular and synaptic mechanisms of auditory neocortical dysfunction using in vitro brain slices in FXS mouse models. Project 2 (Razak/Etheii/Binder; UCR; co-investigators) will study auditory sensory processing deficits in vivo in FXS mouse models, test mechanisms, and examine developmental and structural correlates of these deficits. Project 3 (Sweeney/Byerly, UTSW, co-investigators) will investigate auditory cortical processing deficits using novel neurophysiological strategies in individuals with FXS. All Projects will examine candidate mechanisms of sensory hyperexcitability with an acute pharmacological probe strategy to test mechanisms of interest in parallel studies of mice and patients."
"9316597","Abstract  Although national measures of the quality of diabetes care delivery demonstrate improvement, progress has been slow. Throughout the United States, primary care presents a critical leverage point for improving diabetes outcomes, but improving support for diabetes care in primary care practices requires a new model of care delivery that increases coordination, emphasizes prevention, and enhances collaboration between multidisciplinary teams. Legislative initiatives focusing on health care reform have accelerated adoption of the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) as the preferred model for primary care redesign, with improvement in diabetes care being the most common initial focus. The organizing principles of the PCMH are well established, however operational definitions vary and important gaps exist in our understanding about which domains of change drive practice improvement, which services or resources are most likely to improve clinical outcomes, and the circumstances under which new services might succeed or fail when introduced by a practice. A better understanding of the impact of component services across organizational domains is essential for widespread adoption of incremental change in practice. Such an evaluation is critical for informing the adoption of new models of primary care and for determining whether new PCMH services provide consistent benefits across multiple settings and across diverse diabetes populations.  In 2008 the Minnesota legislature adopted pioneering legislative health care reform that established standardized criteria for PCMH certification including a comprehensive set of specific services and resources. Since that time, 384 (66%) of the 581 eligible practices in Minnesota supporting care for 3.64 million people have become PCMH certified. This `natural experiment' provides a unique opportunity to leverage the data collected as a result of this reform and prior policy collaboratives to intensively evaluate the impact of primary care practice redesign on diabetes care and outcomes. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the specific services and resources associated with primary care PCMH practice redesign that result in the greatest improvement in diabetes care. The study evaluates change across multiple organizational domains and its impact on diabetes care and health care utilization, adjusting for differences in practice and patient characteristics. Our analyses use difference-in-differences, propensity scoring in a Bayesian framework, and instrumental variable methods to draw causal conclusions under increasingly flexible assumptions about the non-random nature of PCMH certification. Overall, the proposal provides a unique opportunity to discover better ways of providing care for individuals with diabetes, and has the potential to stimulate national change in the delivery of diabetes care in primary care settings."
"9314586","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The input children receive is a critical factor in their language development, but much of the language they hear directed to themselves and others occurs in noisy or multi-talker environments. Yet children must rely on these degraded signals to attempt to learn their native language. The language learning systems of the brain evolved in what were presumably far quieter ambient environments than present-day settings, where noise from traffic, television, and electronic devices are ubiquitous. Recent work suggests that children are affected by background noise much more than are adults, potentially limiting the extent to which they can benefit from the language input they receive. Yet the underlying reason for these age-related differences remains unclear, as is the effect that such differences actually have on learning. Noise has a substantial public health impact, ranging from sleep disturbance and stress to decreased performance in school. Noise and other unwanted auditory signals can potentially affect speech processing in at least two ways: they can degrade the quality of the target signal (e.g., by making portions of it inaudible) and they can serve as a potential source o distraction or interference. We predict that the latter plays a larger role in young children's particular difficulty with noise, and that this is tied to children's developing attention abilitie in general. To examine this, the current proposal has three specific aims: i) to distinguish effects caused by the degradation of the signal from effects of distraction, and identify which factor plays the greater role in children's perceptual difficulties, and how this relates to other nonlinguistic attentional skills (specifically selective attention in the presence of distractors);ii) to investigate the range of stimuli for which young children show effects of distraction; and iii) to investigate the effects of noise on the learning of new words, not just recognition of already-known words. Distinguishing effects of signal degradation from effects of distraction has both theoretical and applied significance. Theoretically, understanding the nature of children's difficulties provides insight into the mechanisms involved in speech perception, as well as into the nature of speech processing development. Moreover, most theories of early language learning presume either that the child is hearing language input in ideal listening conditions or that the input has already been separated from background noise. The proposed studies will thus spur the development of more nuanced views of language acquisition, and provide critical information for evaluating and improving such models. On an applied level, understanding the limitations of children's ability to understand and learn from spoken language in the context of other speech will have vital implications for child-rearing practices, and for understanding potential causes for language delay. The results from these studies will also impact how we think about intervention and the effect of child care quality."
"9369684","The Cancer Epidemiology Program (CEP) is an interdisciplinary research program organized into three scientific areas, each related to a type of cancer risk factor: (1) Viral Risk Factors, (2) Hormonal, Obesity, and Inflammation- Related Risk Factors, and (3) Genetic and Epigenetic Risk Factors. Viral Risk Factor research in the CEP focuses extensively on human papillomavirus (HPV) and its role in anogenital and oral cancers. The CEP has long been a major contributor to HPV research. The goal of this research is to contribute new information important to the development of cancer screening practices, HPV vaccine strategies, and other new prevention and treatment methods. This includes studies of the viral and host factors associated with HPV persistence/progression; biomarkers of cervical and anal pre-cancer/cancer; the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in high risk populations; and the impact of microbicides on risk of HPV infection. In addition. Viral Risk Factor research in CEP addresses the effects of HIV/AIDS on cancer, including studies of the immunologic deficits that drive the relationship of HIV with HPV-related tumorigenesis and risk of other AIDS-associated cancers. Hormonal/Obesity/inflammation research in CEP focuses extensively on the role of the insulin/IGF-axis, sex hormones, adipocytokines, and related pathways in obesity-associated cancers (e.g., colon, breast, prostate, etc.). This includes prospective studies of tumor incidence/recurrence/progression and their relation with circulating and local tissue levels of proteins in these pathways and the expression of their receptors. Given the US obesity epidemic these studies are timely, and will contribute to ongoing efforts to identify biomarkers in these pathways that can be used for patient risk stratification, and/or as targets for chemoprevention and treatment. Genetic and Epigenetic research in CEP focuses extensively on germline and somatic mutations, genetic polymorphisms, DNA methylation, and microRNAs. These studies examine the signaling pathways related to oncogenesis, tumor biomarkers important for selecting and developing targeted therapies, and genetic/epigenetic risk factors that can be used for patient risk stratification. CEP investigators are also conducting methodologic studies to improve the laboratory and statistical tools available for conducting genetic and epigenetic research. The CEP currently has 26 members from 11 departments, of whom 11 are new members, supported by 15 NCI grants ($3.7M Direct), and 11 other peer-reviewed cancer-relevant grants ($2.7M Direct). Since the last CCSG review there have been 414 cancer-relevant research papers in the CEP of which 29% represent intraprogrammatic and 18% represent interprogrammatic publications."
"9293953","The USC Roybal Center for Health Policy Simulation develops and applies policy models and simulation  tools for translational aging research, with an emphasis centered on 'novel methods for analyzing programs  affecting older populations.' Our thematic emphasis is on 'Novel methods for analyzing programs affecting  older populations.' The Pilot Core is instrumental in this regard, as it supports efforts that meet one of three  objectives: (1) Research the determinants of health and health spending among older populations; (2)  Develop models to understand the consequences of social policy, social forces, and biomedicine for health,  health spending, and health care delivery; and (3) Translate these findings for policy makers who influence  aging policy. Work in the Pilot Core will be closely coordinated with Management Core activities to ensure  that novel findings and tools are disseminated widely, and that the research programs are developed in  directions, which ensure independent funding. Specifically, we aim to recruit and develop a diverse set of  senior and junior researchers to initiate and support pilot projects in our two focus areas to better understand  the consequences of population health trends, medical technology and public health interventions for health  care spending, health status, longevity, and geriatric care delivery. For this renewal, we propose to focus on  two areas which have the potential to improve the health and well-being of older Americans, but which have  been neglected by policy-makers: Theme 1: Policies to Mitigate the Social Consequences of Health  Disparities; and Theme 2: International Lessons for U.S. Aging Policy. The Pilot Core will select projects  leveraging the Center's existing research and the broad range of research being conducted among a large  network of collaborators. We will also continue to make our models and programming core available to  researchers from around the world."
"9336216","ABSTRACT:  Alcoholism is a chronically relapsing disorder that develops over time and is characterized by the transition from recreational alcohol use to abuse and dependence. Negative emotional states, such as post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or anxiety, influenced by genetic factors or determined by environmental conditions contribute to shaping this transition. On the other hand, chronic exposure to alcohol is a major determinant for the occurrence of mood disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, PTSD) and negative emotional states (i.e., dysphoria, irritability). The amygdalar nuclei [both the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA)] are considered a hub for negative emotional circuitry, and the role of the stress peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in this brain structure is critical for both development of alcohol dependence and mood disorders/negative affect. During the previous funding period we provided essential new insight into the relationship between innate overexpression of the CRF1 receptor system, stress hypersensitivity and excessive ethanol consumption in genetically selected Marchigian Sardinian (msP) rats. Our most recent results show that enhanced CRF signaling in msP rats is responsible for increased hydrolytic activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and blunted endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling in the CeA/BLA, leading to enhanced GABA and glutamate transmission in the amygdala. Our hypothesis is that such alterations contribute to enhance stress sensitivity and to exacerbate anxiety-like symptoms in the msP rats, which may increase drinking to alleviate these negative conditions. Understanding the mechanisms through with innate and environmental factors act/interact to dysregulate CRF/eCB transmission in the BLA and CeA will provide new insight into the etiopathology of alcoholism, aiding the development of new therapeutics for this still largely untreated medical condition.  The research plan for this competitive renewal is to investigate how alteration of eCB signaling in the amygdala triggered by innate (in msP rats) or EtOH-induced (post-dependent Wistars) upregulation of the CRF1 system contributes to excessive alcohol drinking and exacerbates maladaptive conditioned fear responses, similar to symptoms of PTSD in humans. The ability to restore normal eCB function by FAAH inhibition, and therefore to counteract excessive drinking and normalize fear responses, will be also studied. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying genotypic differences of the msP compared to outbred Wistar rats and of neuroadaptations following exposure to alcohol, will provide novel insight into the innate susceptibility to develop Alcohol Use Disorder and will be useful toward the development of new therapeutic agents to alleviate alcohol dependence. The key personnel involved in the present study possess all the necessary expertise needed to accomplish this multidisciplinary program. In particular, Dr. R. Ciccocioppo will supervise behavioral experiments, breeding programs and animal selections. Dr. M. Roberto will be dedicated to the electrophysiology experiments and the research program coordination. Dr. L. Parsons will perform the neurochemistry experiments, and will also perform behavioral tests at TSRI to ensure cross-lab reproducibility and provide the animals for electrophysiology. These three key personnel each have extensive publication histories in their respective areas of expertise, and have ongoing collaborative interactions, documented by common publications, that will be invaluable for the successful completion of the proposed experiments."
"9331742","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this consortium is to establish tools that can be used as biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective assays of social impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials. Specifically, we aim to accelerate the development of effective treatments for social impairment in ASD by validating outcome measures that will be sensitive and reliable assessments of response to treatment and EEG and eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used to reduce heterogeneity of samples via stratification, indicate early efficacy, and/or demonstrate target engagement. The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool (3-5 years) and school aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with IQ ranging from 50- 115. Children will be assessed across three time points (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks, T3: 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status. This battery measures key facets of social- communication in ASD using well-validated paradigms appropriate for this developmental and cognitive range. Five Collaborating Implementation Sites (?Sites?), all highly experienced in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the methodologies proposed here in both typical and atypical development, will contribute equally to recruitment, screening, diagnosis, testing, and longitudinal assessment. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (DAAC) will oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for standardized data collection, processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core will oversee the operations of the Sites, the Data Coordinating Core (DCC), and the DAAC and coordinate with federal and private partners to achieve the aims of this cooperative agreement. The will utilize informatics and technology to develop, maintain, and monitor a robust, secure, HIPAA-compliant data collection, coordination, and storage system to streamline communication and data flow throughout the consortium and ensure organized, secure data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National Database for Autism Research and NIH/NIMH Data Repositories. The DCC benefits from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation's quality assurance experience and the existing multi-site ASD research data systems developed by Prometheus Research. The DCC will: 1) Anticipate, respond to, and fulfill the informatics needs of the consortium in the design, harmonization, and implementation of data coordination and innovative data collection methods and tools across the Sites, DAAC, and Admin Core; 2) Provide state-of-the-art methods for: a) consortium communication; b) data management, site monitoring, privacy, and security within the consortium and across Sites; and c) dissemination of information to its stakeholders."

"9296122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Role of Circulating suPAR in FSGS Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a severe glomerular disease that is characterized by podocyte injury, proteinuria and progressive renal decline, the disease is likely to recur after transplantation in 30% of adults and even in higher number in children. Recently, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has been found to be elevated in the serum of the majority of patients with FSGS. Animal experiments suggested that suPAR caused podocyte injury and FSGS-type changes in rodents through activation of podocyte beta 3 integrin. As suPAR levels are increased due to variables, such as cancer or infection; and do not routinely present with proteinuria, this proposal seeks to define the precise form (s) of suPAR that is/are acting as a causative factor for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). We hypothesize that diverse effects of suPAR in different diseases are due to different forms of suPAR. Under this grant application we test hypothesis that only the specific form(s) of suPAR, i.e. hypoglycosylated form(s), is (are) responsible for FSGS. Aim 1 will identify pathological form(s) of suPAR in FSGS patients. Aim 2 will test pathological suPAR in mice. Aim 3 will be aimed to develop a more specific ELISA test and Aim 4 will assess the risk of a common genetic variant (P1A2) in the beta 3 gene that might allow integrin hyperactivation in podocytes. In sum, this research program will potentially unravel a major cause of FSGS and might lead to a refined treatment for patients with the disease."
"9295011","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate cellular energy balance. Here, we are focusing on energy regulation in adipose tissue with a weighted focus on brown fat. Interest in brown fat bioenergetics is rapidly gaining momentum because of the recent realization that adult humans possess a significant quantity of brown fat or brown fat-like cells that may exhibit metabolically favorable fat burning properties. It is speculated that therapeutically increasing brown fat energy expenditure could defend against obesity. Importantly however, very little is known about the molecular signals that control energy expenditure in adipose tissue, or brown fat differentiation and function. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is a critical regulator of metabolism and energy expenditure in brown fat. To test this, we are taking a multidisciplinary approach utilizing genetically engineered mice, primary cell lines, and pharmacological agents to study the mechanisms by which mTORC2 and its substrates regulate energy balance in adipose tissue. Our work is yielding very interesting and unexpected preliminary findings that suggest inhibiting mTORC2 reprograms cellular metabolism and may increase brown fat activity. In Specific Aim 1, we elucidate the mechanism by which mTORC2 reprograms metabolism. In Specific Aim 2, we test the in vivo relevance of our hypothesis and our preliminary findings using novel mouse models. In Specific Aim 3, we ask if pharmacologically inhibiting mTORC2 can treat pathological fat accumulation. Elucidating the metabolic regulatory circuits under mTORC2 control in brown fat will have important implications in advancing therapies targeting cellular bioenergetics."

"9323662","Project Summary This program project will add to understanding the pathogenesis of SIV/HIV viremia rebound with the long-term goal of innovating therapeutic strategies enabling sustained remission of HIV infection in a ?best-case? scenario. This scenario involves initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) soon after infection (?early ART?) and stopping it after a defined duration - along with short-term use of a new, adjunctive treatment strategy that will markedly increase the proportion of subjects with sustained remission after stopping early ART. This proposal will define the cells in mucosal and other tissues that SIV/HIV persistently infects early after infection; characterize T cell activation-triggered mechanisms hypothesized to both initiate virus production after early ART stops as well as to cause a cascade of target cell susceptibility and virus infectivity that leads to viremia rebound; and begin testing mechanism-informed, cell-based interventions to interrupt these ?vicious cycles.? Aims address the following 3 hypotheses about rebound after stopping early ART. 1. Persistent virus reservoirs are established in mucosal cells soon after infection, and initiate viremia rebound. We will identify the cell types/subtypes in which SIV initially establishes latency in colon and female reproductive tract mucosa in the first days after mucosal infection of macaques; determine if those ?virus reservoir? cells remain in the mucosa during suppressive ART in vivo; study virus production from those cells off-ART in cell / tissue models ex vivo, humanized DRAG mice, and macaques in vivo; and design/perform a pilot observational study of humans. 2. Temporarily inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) will decrease both virus production from cellular reservoirs and susceptibility of new target cells to infection. We will characterize cellular mechanisms downstream of mTOR activity that initiate virus production from reservoir cells, and increase target cell susceptibility to infection, via T cell receptor (TCR) activation, microbial product activation of myeloid cells, and T cell activation by myeloid cell-derived cytokines. Effects of catalytic mTOR inhibitors will be studied in macaques in vivo, established ex vivo cellular models of latency/reactivation, as well as new models using colon mucosal biopsies, excised tonsil tissue, and humanized DRAG mice. 3. Temporarily increasing virion APOBEC3G (A3G) will decrease virus infectivity. In the ex vivo models and humanized mice, we will test the hypotheses that T cell reservoirs have low A3G levels before Vif is expressed; that tool compounds (?A3G- boosters?) will increase A3G levels in Vif-positive virions produced from them; that boosted A3G-mediated decreased virus spread will add to mTOR inhibitor effects to diminish uninfected target T cell susceptibility to rebounding infection; and that mTOR inhibition will enhance A3G booster effects on virion A3G content."
"9316415","TRANSLATIONAL CORE - PROJECT SUMMARY The Translational Core of The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center (JAX NSC) develops and provides resources for the other NSCs and the aging community to aid in comparative and translational aging research. We are developing a pipeline that allows for efficient screening and prioritization of candidate genes identified in human studies, first in C.elegans then followed by mouse models. Preliminary studies for the different parts of the pipeline show their effectiveness and we have successfully tested a set of 149 genes in C.elegans, which were identified in human studies as being associated with aging. Knockdown showed a significant difference in lifespan for 65% of the genes. Novel mouse models were developed for two of these genes and are currently in lifespan studies. Preliminary data shows significant differences in these models compared to wildtype animals for several age-related traits. To enable this pipeline and make it available as a resource to the aging community, the specific aims of the Translational Core are to: Aim 1. Identify the most promising candidate genes associated with human aging and age-related phenotypes from the Framingham Heart Study and the CHARGE consortium to test in C. elegans and novel mouse models. Aim 2. Develop tools and resources to enable candidate gene testing and prioritization in C.elegans. Aim 3. Develop novel mouse models of aging that allow further study of candidate genes in the Animal and Phenotyping Core."
"9336239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This VA CSR&D Merit Review Award for a Clinical Trial proposal describes a 5-year program to support a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the effect of phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibition with tadalafil at 40 mg daily over 12 months on exercise capacity in patients with at least moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH) (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP] > 30 mm Hg, pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR]>3.0 Wood units, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP] <18 mm Hg) due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) GOLD stage II or higher, FEV1/FVC <70 and FEV1 <79% of predicted). PDE-5 inhibitors are recommended for World Health Organization (WHO) Group 1 PH but there is no evidence based recommendation supporting the use of these inhibitors in COPD-induced PH (WHO Group 3). In order to ensure maximum patient enrollment and to increase the clinical and demographic diversity of patients included in this study, the proposed research will be conducted at three VA sites: Boston VA Healthcare System, Providence VA Medical Center, and the Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare System. Within the veteran population, COPD ranks among the most common chronic diseases and inflicts a substantial clinical and economic burden on the VA Healthcare System. Importantly, the vast majority of COPD-associated mortality and morbidity, including hospital admissions, is derived from a relatively select subpopulation of patients. There is emerging evidence to suggest that clinically evident PH is a key determinate of risk in COPD for exacerbations and progression of disease. In the current proposal, we provide novel evidence pertinent to the VA Healthcare System to support this assertion: moderate or severe PH is associated with significantly increased rates of COPD-related hospital readmission as compared to similar veterans with COPD and only mild PH. Moreover, this trend was not influenced by differences in conventional measures of COPD disease severity (i.e., FEV1) and was irrespective of supplemental oxygen status. These observations are in support of previously established clinical observations from others demonstrating that traditional COPD therapies, including supplemental oxygen, are ineffective at modulating sustained improvements to cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in patients with COPD and PH. Under physiological conditions, the enzyme phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) functions to maintain pulmonary vascular tone by degrading cGMP, which is a key signaling intermediary involved in nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signaling. However, in PH due to lung disease, pulmonary vascular levels of NO are diminished while PDE-5 levels are increased. This raises the possibility that PDE-5 inhibition is a potential strategy by which to increase NO bioavailability and attenuate PH in patients with COPD. The central hypothesis of the current proposal is that pharmacological inhibition of PDE-5 will improve functional capacity in patients with COPD-induced moderate to severe PH as assessed by the 6 minute walk test. Our secondary outcome measures will assess whether this change in functional status are accompanied by an improvement in maximal oxygen uptake during cardio-pulmonary testing and/or changes in pulmonary vascular remodeling assessed by invasive cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Additional information that will be obtained includes non-invasive assessment by 2-dimensional echocardiography of pulmonary artery systolic pressure and right ventricular function, dyspnea severity, health related quality of life assessed by validated standardized questionnaires, and, the frequency of COPD exacerbations at 12 months. Results from this study are expected to define the potential use of PDE-5 inhibitors in COPD-induced PH. If successful, this treatment option may improve quality of life and outcomes for the large number of veterans afflicted with PH due to COPD."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Women's Reproductive Health Research (WRHR) Career Development Program is to promote health and prevent disease in women by expanding the pool of well-trained, imaginative, productive investigators in the field of women's reproductive health. The WRHR program was first funded in 1998 and subsequently refunded in 2004 and 2009 to recruit and prepare outstanding candidates to acquire new skills needed to reach this goal. Twelve superb WRHR Scholars have been recruited to the program with ten having graduated to successful independent research careers and two continuing in our current WRHR program. Over the next five years of this renewal application, we propose to continue and improve our UCSF WRHR program to recruit, mentor, and prepare two outstanding Junior Faculty WRHR Scholars at a time to acquire and refine skills needed to become independent investigators in women's reproductive health. We have robust existing infrastructure, curriculum, and Scholar mentoring systems to meet the challenge of training the next generation of academic Obstetrician-Gynecologists. We propose a structured program of sufficient duration (2-5 years), relevant didactic education; extensive team-based mentoring, and protected time with immersion in a vibrant research community to prepare our Scholars for academic independence. The education of our Scholars will be further enriched by collaboration with the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) that provides research infrastructure, resources, training and opportunities for campus-wide multidisciplinary research collaborations. We have learned that intensive scientific and academic mentoring is mandatory during the initial years of a junior faculty appointment for a rewarding, successful and productive academic career. Scholars will be recruited to pursue biomedical (laboratory-based), translational, and/or and clinical research in reproductive science. Two pathways have been established to guide less experienced (Track I) and more experienced (Track II) Scholars. Translational research, a major focus in our Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, will be gained through participation in studies bridging biomedical and clinically oriented projects. Our WRHR Program draws strength from and contributes to several campus-wide programs focused on innovation in clinical, translational, epidemiologic and basic research, patient care, and disease prevention in women's reproductive health, as well as a strong institutional commitment to mentoring in a rich research environment structured for success and well-being of trainees and mentors. We are committed to nurturing a cadre of UCSF WRHR Scholars who will improve the health status of women by conducting important discovery, expanding knowledge, and testing innovations for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of reproductive disorders. Through our proposed mentoring program, we anticipate that our Scholars will continue to develop into independent investigators and future leaders of women's reproductive health research nationally and globally."
"9282549","The mission of our Roybal Center continues to be accelerating the translation of basic behavioral and social  science research theories and methodologies into practical outcomes that improve the functioning and  quality of life of older adults. The goal of the Pilot Core is to identify talented investigators and provide  mentoring, support, and incentives that will enable them to conduct innovative research projects to advance  science in our three thematic focus areas: (a) mechanisms of behavior change, (b) novel interventions that  exploit the plasticity of biobehavioral risk mechanisms, and (c) novel programs that target features of social  networks and social engagement to increase well being. The specific aims of the Pilot Core are to: (1) use  input from our Executive and Advisory Committees, community partners, and others to identify innovative  priority areas for targeting pilot research; (2) solicit high quality proposals from a broad array of eligible  investigators that advance the science in our thematic focus areas; (3) review and fund proposals based on  rigorous scientific criteria; (4) support and monitor the progress of the pilots in achieving their objectives; and  (5) continuously evaluate the success of our Pilot Core using the RE-AIM model. Six exemplary pilots  selected by our Executive Committee based on relevance to our theme, scientific rigor, feasibility, and  likelihood of future funding are described in the Pilot Core. The pilots include investigators representing  diverse disciplines across the career development continuum. Four pilots focus on cognitive function in older  adults and two pilots test innovative interventions designed to improve modifiable risk factors. One tests the  impact of the BAILAMOS©dance program for older Latinos on physical activity and cognition. Another seeks  to improve the cognitive functioning of older adults by examining the short-term impact of transcranial direct  current stimulation on improved context memory. The third will examine the impact of exposure to web-based  Wii Fit games on balance and gait in older adult stroke survivors. The fourth will examine the impact  of social media on depression and cognitive function among older adults who have recently transitioned to  independent living housing from their own homes in the community. The two remaining pilots focus on risk  factors. One will test the feasibility of using tablet-based guided imagery videos to reduce stress that is a  trigger for pain among older African American adults who suffer from sickle cell disease. The final pilot  assesses the utility of an interactive tailored health game designed to enhance healthy eating and physical  activity among older African American adults at risk of diabetes.  RELEVANCE (See instructions): Pilots will advance knowledge in our thematic focus areas. Four pilots  address one of the most pressing issues in research on aging today, malleability of cognitive function in older  adults (Karbach & Schubert, 2013; Voss, Nagamatsu, Liu-Amrrose, & Kramer, 2011). The other two pilots  test innovative interventions designed to improve modifiable risk factors which together have been estimated  to contribute to 70% of physical activity decline that occurs with aging (National Center for Chronic Disease  Prevention and Health Promotion, 1999)."
"9398258","Effective evidence-based clinical practice in the communication sciences and other health professions requires several stages of development from basic science to clinical practice. First, clinical research that generates diagnostic and treatment approaches depends on a sound theoretical foundation. The rehabilitation methods that are generated in clinical research then need to be further translated to a form that facilitates effective implementation in clinical or school settings. The process of knowledge translation to clinical practice faces several challenges, the most obvious of which is the practical differences between laboratory settings where interventions are developed and clinical settings where they are implemented. This conference addresses two other challenges to achieving true evidence based practice: (1) education of clinical practitioners about advances in theoretically and empirically supported rehabilitation methods and (2) communication between researchers and clinical practitioners to better effect implementation of clinical research into practice. For eleven years, the Eleanor M. Saffran Conference on the Cognitive Neuroscience and Rehabilitation of Communication Disorders has provided a forum in which researchers in basic and applied patient-oriented research, clinical practitioners, academic faculty and students with a common interest in language and other cognitive disorders can share knowledge and skills on each side of the translational ?gap?. This annual two-day conference focuses on a single topic relating to a specific language disorder (e.g., sentence processing disorders) or to a more general topic in rehabilitation research (e.g., outcome measures). The first day includes platform papers on current theories and practices emerging from rehabilitation research. The day includes ample time for discussion between the presenters and the audience which includes speech/language pathologists, neuropsychologists, psychologists, neurologists, linguists and students from these various disciplines, who share a common interest in cognitive neuroscience of communication disorders and their rehabilitation. The second day is a workshop that provides a forum for clinicians and researchers to address the practical considerations involved in translating laboratory developed diagnostic and treatment protocols to clinical practice. This component of the conference is unique and provides a real opportunity for researchers and clinicians to participate together in the translation/implementation process. A third important challenge of this conference is to fulfill its mission to extend the educational opportunities that this conference provides to students. We address this challenge in two ways. First, students at all academic levels (undergraduate to post-doctoral) can attend the conference for free. Second, there are ten competitive student scholar travel awards given to students at the doctoral or post-doctoral level. The award includes travel, accommodations, hotel, and a chance to present their research in a poster session on the first day of the conference. This program has been proved to be enormously successful, with awardees coming from across the nation and worldwide."
"9309995","PROJECT SUMMARY  Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with incredibly low survival rates, especially for those who present with metastases at the time of diagnosis. Unfortunately, surgery and combination chemotherapies have not made significant advances in survival. As such, novel approaches to therapy are desperately needed. Since metastases, and specifically lymph node metastases, are often responsible for recurrence and poor prognosis, elucidating the mechanism behind metastasis can provide invaluable information and a new therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.  The process of metastasis involves the migration of tumor cells to new sites. Chemokines normally direct the migration of cells from one tissue to another. This process can be hijacked by tumor cells, allowing metastasis to lymph nodes and distant sites. The chemokine ligand-receptor pair, CCL21 and CCR7, direct the traffic of immune cells towards the lymph nodes. CCR7 has increased expression in many cancers and has been associated with lymph node metastasis and worse prognosis. Interestingly, CCL21 is structurally unique due to a long C-terminal tail that may be inhibiting its interaction with its receptor CCR7 in an autoinhibitory fashion. Furthermore, the post-translational modification polysialic acid, shown separately to correlate with metastasis, has been implicated as the agent that relieves CCL21's autoinhibition. Together, these three components, CCR7, CCL21, and polysialic acid, each separately implicated in cancer metastasis, are combined to form the basis of this proposal.  The goal of this fellowship is to test the hypothesis that polysialylated CCR7 binding to CCL21 mediates lymph node metastasis in pancreatic cancer. The pursuit of this goal will be accomplished through two aims. Aim 1 will employ NMR spectroscopy to delve into the mechanism of autoinhibition by examining the structural interactions between polysialic acid on CCR7 and the C-terminus of CCL21. Aim 2 will use a combination of signaling and migration assays, in addition to in vivo animal studies, to study the functional role of these players in lymph node metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Exploiting the complementary relationship between structure and function through completion of these two aims will provide details on a novel mechanism that can be targeted to develop therapeutics against this highly aggressive disease."
"9302520","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypothesis: Our previous studies using elastase-perfusion and angiotensin II models of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have shown that female rodents have a decreased incidence and size of aneurysm formation. We have also recently shown that human placental mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are protective in a mouse model of AAA. In the current proposal, we will investigate the role of dietary phytoestrogen as a preventive therapy, and its synergistic effects with MSCs as a treatment strategy to protect against AAA. Methods: We will use an elastase-perfusion and angiotensin II murine model of AAA using male and female wild-type, estrogen receptor knockout mice (ER-?--/- and ER-ß-/-) and ApoE-/- mice. Dietary phytoestrogen will be administered to male and female mice via estrogen-rich or estrogen-free chow. Various subsets of female MSCs (placenta-, bone marrow- or adipose-derived) primed with or without estrogen will be administered intravenously or by aortic implantation in mice models of AAA. Aortic diameter will be measured on day 3, 7 and 14 (elastase perfusion model) and day 28 (angiotensin II model). Aortic tissue will be harvested to analyze pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-17, TNF-?-, MCP-1, IL-1-ß-, KC and RANTES) and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1; a pro-inflammatory nuclear protein) production by ELISA, MMP2 and MMP9 activity by zymography, serine proteases (uPA, tPA and PAI-1) by western blots, paracrine factors (VEGF, HGF, PGE2) by ELISA, elastin and collagen degradation as well as aortic smooth muscle expression by histology, and immune cell (macrophages, CD4+ T cells, neutrophils) infiltration by flow cytometry. Results: Preliminary results demonstrate a significant upregulation of estrogen receptor (ER-?) expression in female mice on days 1, 3 and 14 after elastase-perfusion compared to males, as well as in aortic tissue from human females compared to males after AAA. Also, male mice fed a diet rich in estrogen display a significantly decreased aortic diameter, decreased cytokine production (IL-23, IL-1-ß-, IL-6 and IL-27), decreased MMP2 and 9 expression and decreased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration compared to male mice fed an estrogen free diet. Furthermore, treatment with human female MSCs attenuates aortic diameter, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and cell infiltration after AAA. Female MSCs inhibit HMGB1 and IL-17 production more significantly than male MSCs. Also, estradiol-priming of female MSCs offer significantly increased protection from vascular inflammation in aortic tissue from male AAA patients. Conclusions: Dietary estrogen therapy and mesenchymal stem cells can attenuate aneurysm formation and inflammation in the elastase-perfusion murine model of AAA and in human aortic tissue from AAA patients. We propose to delineate the phytoestrogen mediated anti-inflammatory effects, and its crosstalk with various subsets of gender-specific MSCs, on aortic aneurysm formation in the murine (elastase-perfusion and angiotensin II) models as well aortic tissue and cells from AAA patients."
"9335928","Project Summary and Abstract This proposal aims to develop targeted nanoparticles to express human factor VIII in liver hepatocytes of mice. A safe and efficient i.v. dosed nanoparticle delivery system to transfect liver hepatocytes to express secreted hFVIII would be transformative for treating hemophilia A. Compared to hydrodynamic dosing of plasmid DNA, all other nanoparticle delivery systems are currently too inefficient to achieve therapeutic levels of protein expression in liver primarily due to the inability of plasmid DNA to traverse the nuclear membrane of non-dividing hepatocytes. The preliminary data establishes that efficient expression can be achieved using double stranded mRNA. Nanoparticles are generated using a novel PEG-peptide containing Lys-Acr residues that binds to ds mRNA. The delivery of ds mRNA nanoparticles to the cytosol circumvents the major barrier that limits expression of plasmid DNA. The first aim of the proposal will advance ds mRNA nanoparticles by increasing circulatory stability and persistence of expression. Multivalent PEG-peptides will be developed that bind ds RNA with higher affinity to further increase ds mRNA nanoparticles stability following i.v. dosing. Persistent expression will be achieved by developing self-amplifying mRNA constructs designed to replicate mRNA in the cytosol and extend its expression. Efficient hepatocyte targeting will be attained using a high-affinity triantennary N-glycan attached to the PEG-peptide to mediate nanoparticle endocytosis into hepatocytes via the asialoglycoprotein receptor. The potent membrane lytic peptide melittin will be reversible attached to ds mRNA to afford triggered release of mRNA into the cytosol. The optimized ds mRNA nanoparticle delivery system will be used to express human factor VIII with a goal of achieving functional correction of hemophilia A in mice. The successful development of targeted ds mRNA nanoparticles for efficient transfection of liver hepatocytes will advance the field of nanomedicine by establishing a paradigm changing strategy to achieve expression in non-dividing cells following i.v. dosing."
"9338016","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major psychoses (SZ, SAD, BDP), when defined by clinical phenomenology alone, overlap extensively on neurobiological, biomarker, co-morbid, symptomatic, and genetic characteristics. Our field may benefit from transformational re-conceptualizations of disease seen in other areas of medicine when biological variables are considered in disease definitions and identification. This approach in psychiatry will depend on: (i) use of well- defined disease domains, (ii) large samples that capture clinical heterogeneity and support statistical approaches, and (iii) ability to acquire quantifiable laboratory measures t inform re-conceptualization of disease characteristics. The 5-site B-SNIP focus is psychosis, an ideal clinical phenotype for this purpose. B- SNIP1 recruited over 2500 volunteers and performed dense phenotyping across multiple levels of analysis (cognitive, psychophysiological, brain imaging, social and clinical). The overall data described a continuum of phenotypic alterations across the DSM psychosis diagnoses (BDP, SAD, SZ) with little evidence of diagnostic specificity. In an attempt to use these dense phenotypic characteristics to define biologically based subgroups, we re-grouped probands using biomarkers and a multistage multivariate analysis procedure. We identified 3 psychosis Biotypes based on core phenotypic features. Biotypes showed unique differences across external validators that were not used in the initial construction of the categories. B-SNIP2 will replicate and extend B- SNIP1 using enhanced proband number, biomarker panel, and sophistication of multivariate statistical approaches. We will accomplish our goals within the context of two specific aims. SA(1) Construct a 'Psychosis Biomarker Database' (PBD): Recruit 3000 new psychosis probands and 600 healthy volunteers and collect data including clinical, psychosocial, electrophysiological, ocular motor, imaging and blood biomarkers. Core biomarkers (used for Biotype definition) and external validators (used for verifying neurobiological distinctiveness of Biotypes) will be collected as specified. Genetic characteristics of the participants will be obtained in collaboratin with the Broad Institute. SA(2) Contrast and test taxometric approaches to categorizing psychosis: Evaluate the ability of different taxonomic structures to define psychosis subgroups, based on data in the PBD: (i) DSM, (ii) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on clinical variables, (iii) B-SNIP1 Biotypes, (iv) B-SNIP2-generated biotypes based on biomarkers, and (v) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on both clinical variables and biomarkers. Beginning with traditional DSM diagnostic criteria as the taxonomy and testing (i)-(v) we will use linear, quadratic and nonparametric discriminant function analysis applied to external biomarker validators to examine the association between the traditional diagnostic system and the biologically- derived classification (imaging, psychosocial and genetic external validators). We will be able to determine the strongest taxonomic approach based on biological characteristics. We seek a rational classification of psychotic disorders that will be successful in identifying novel disease targets and treatments approaches."
"9284446","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract, is a complex disease with heterogeneous underlying genetics and symptoms. Research in the last decade has identified over 100 genes linked to an increased risk for developing IBD. Genome wide association studies have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease, a subset of IBD, in a gene called autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1). This gene functions in a process called autophagy, a process by which cells recycle their intracellular components when nutrients are scarce. This proposal will address the effect of a small change, or polymorphism, in this gene (ATG16L1T300A) and will focus on a cell type crucial for immune system regulation, called regulatory T cells (Treg cells). Since IBD is a disease of the gastrointestinal tract, this proposa focuses on how this gene alteration affects the generation and function of gut Treg cells. To elucidate the role of the polymorphism ATG16L1T300A in gut Treg cells, we will employ a unique mouse model in which mice harbor the same genetic mutation as people with IBD. Special mouse models that harbor fluorescent Treg cells will also be used to aid in the identification and manipulation of gut Treg cells in vitro. With these mouse models, gut Treg cells will be studied using many techniques and methods to understand how ATG16L1T300A affects Treg cell function in Aim 1. Some of the methods utilized will include: flow cytometry, ELISA, RTqPCR, and mouse models of colitis. We will use additional mouse strains in Aim 2 that have very specific receptors on their T cells, e.g. the OT-II T cell transgenic system. This system will enable us to address how autophagy affects the ability of immune cells called antigen presenting cells, to process antigen for T cell recognition. These cells are very important as they guide the development and function of Treg cells. By using two mouse models of colitis, and looking specifically at Treg cells in the intestine, Aim 3 will develop a mechanistic understanding of how the IBD-risk associated gene change ATG16L1T300A contributes to the pathophysiology of IBD. Data generated from this proposal will provide novel insight into the function of Treg cells in Crohn's disease patients homozygous for ATG16L1T300A and will be clinically relevant to the advancement of IBD precision medicine and Treg cell-based therapies. The research training plan developed for this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award will develop my communication and writing skills and prepare me for a career as an independent researcher in the field of mucosal immunology."
"9268065","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aortic aneurysms and dissections (AAD) carry significantly high morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, no clinically proven medication is available to prevent disease progression. There is a critical need to develop effective pharmacological strategies to treat the disease. This project focuses on sporadic AAD which account for more than 80% of cases. One of the significant features of sporadic AAD is progressive smooth muscle cell (SMC) dysfunction and depletion, for which the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The aortic wall is constantly exposed to various insults such as hemodynamic disturbance, inflammatory factors and metabolic stress. These factors can interfere with normal cellular functions. Protein biosynthesis and folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is particularly vulnerable to stress. Disruption in this process causes protein misfolding and ER stress, which in turn can amplify stress and induce a cellular inflammatory response that leads to cell dysfunction, dedifferentiation, and even cell death. The overall objectives of this application are to determine the role of ER stress and ER stress sensor STING in aortic destruction, and the extent to which this mechanism represents a therapeutic target against AAD. We propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanisms by which the ER stress-STING pathway induces SMC dysfunction and depletion. Aim 1A, we will test the hypothesis that the ER stress-STING pathway, through IRF3, inhibits myocardin/SRF-mediated transcription of SMC genes, and induces SMC dedifferentiation and dysfunction. Aim 1B, we will test the hypothesis that the ER stress-STING pathway promotes RIP3/ MLKL phosphorylation/activation and induces SMC necroptosis. In Aim 2, we will define the role of the ER stress-STING pathway in biomechanical failure and AAD formation in vivo. Aim 2A, we will test the hypothesis that ER stress pro- motes SMC dedifferentiation and depletion, and thus renders the aortic wall vulnerable to hemodynamic stress and susceptible to AAD formation. Aim 2B, we will test the hypothesis that STING is critically involved in AAD development by inducing SMC dedifferentiation, necroptosis and depletion. In Aim 3, we will test the therapeutic potential of targeting the ER stress-STING pathway for AAD treatment. We will test the hypothesis that pharmacologically reducing ER stress (e.g. with phenylbutyrate) or preventing STING activation (e.g. with amlexanox) will prevent SMC aortic destruction and disease progression. The proposed research is significant because it will not only provide novel molecular insights into AAD development, but also test a new therapeutic approach to prevent disease progression by reducing ER stress and blocking its detrimental response. Our study is also significant because the novel mechanisms on SMC dedifferentiation and necroptosis have broad implications in many other cardiovascular diseases. This research is innovative because it investigates the ER stress-STING pathway in AAD development, which has not been examined before. This study is a novel mechanistic investigation of necroptosis that triggers significant tissue destruction and inflammation."
"9309056","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has drastically changed the epidemiology of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Indeed, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients treated with ART can expect to live for decades and chronic diseases, such as atherothrombosis, are replacing acute infections as important causes of morbidity and death. In the current proposal we unexpectedly demonstrate that megakaryocytes and platelets express endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, which is specifically blocked by nucleoside analog RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). We also show that inhibition of platelet RT activity leads to the loss of translational repression and the formation of stress platelets, which are hyperactive and prone to cause thrombosis. Our robust preliminary data will be leveraged to test the overall hypothesis that ART induces platelet malfunction by directly inhibiting endogenous RT activity in megakaryocytes and platelets, which contributes to the development of atherothrombosis in HIV patients. These aims will be executed by a research team with expertise in platelet biology, virology, thrombosis, and HIV that includes two early stage investigators with outstanding track records. Moreover, this team includes both basic scientists and clinician scientists, providing a strong, multidisciplinary group of investigators that has the experience and training to successfully complete these investigations. Questions proposed by our multi-investigator team are innovative because they explore a novel activity of megakaryocytes and platelets, reverse transcriptase, that may have previously-unrecognized functional consequences in health and disease. They also have immediate clinical significance because new information will be generated regarding the off-target effects of ART that contribute to HIV-related atherothrombosis. Dissecting the mechanisms by which ART regulates reverse transcriptase activity in megakaryocytes and platelets will shed light on how this molecular pathway operates and functions in eukaryotic cells and, in parallel, provide insight into how ART contributes to atherothrombotic events in patients with HIV."
"9310000","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of big data in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond."
"9330395","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Major depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in the United States, afflicting an estimated 20 million people in the United States in 2013. The statistics for anxiety disorders are even more staggering, with twice the prevalence of depression and an average onset estimated at 11 years of age. Though these disorders, characterized by a negativity bias, are both widespread and debilitating, their neurobiological bases and risk factors remain poorly understood. This project will address these gaps by examining the mechanisms underlying the extent of an individual's negativity bias and regulatory strategies that override this negativity.  Images of emotional facial expressions are a useful tool for examining negativity bias and its regulation. For instance, some expressions provide clear information about the emotions and intentions of others (e.g., happy or angry) whereas others are ambiguous (e.g., surprise) because they signal both positive (e.g., a surprise party) and negative outcomes (e.g., witnessing an accident). When experienced without a clarifying context, surprised expressions provide insight into an individual's disposition: they are stably interpreted as positive by some people and as negative by others. The PI's prior work demonstrated that the ?initial, automatic? interpretation is negative (i.e., even for people who eventually interpret the expression as positive). Positive interpretations may then require an additional regulatory process in the brain that overrides this initial negativity ? one that only some individuals adopt naturally. Interestingly, children show a stronger negativity bias than adults, which is likely attributable to weaker regulatory mechanisms in children.  The goal of the proposed research is to use state-of-the-art brain imaging and analysis techniques to advance the understanding of the biological mechanisms of the valence bias (i.e., the tendency for an individual to interpret surprise as positive or negative). By identifying the mechanisms underlying this bias, this project will support the broad, long-term objective of developing new approaches to predict, prevent, and treat the negativity bias associated with mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. The three aims are: 1) Determine extent to which resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in the amygdala and cingulo-  opercular network (CO) networks predicts positive valence bias in adults. fMRI data will be collected from  adults to determine if greater functional connectivity in regulatory networks is associated with positive bias. 2) Determine extent to which RSFC in the amygdala and CO networks is responsible for the developmental  transition from a negative valence bias in childhood to individual differences in adulthood. Similar data will  be collected in children/adolescents to characterize the transition away from the negative bias in childhood. 3) Identify the role of regional brain reactivity and explicit emotion regulation in valence bias. fMRI data will be  collected from participants of all ages while they passively view facial expressions of emotion and in a task  that requires regulating the natural emotional response in order to examine these effects on valence bias."
"9294112","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) has for decades served as a model for how we think about genetic testing, and its benefits and risks for tested individuals and their families. In 1983, the gene for HD was mapped to chromosome 4, allowing linkage tests to be developed for use in presymptomatic genetic testing for HD. In 1986, Johns Hopkins launched one of the first two such testing programs in the United States. This work influenced guidelines for the provision of HD genetic test results, which have subsequently influenced contemporary guidance for other adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. This early experience also arguably influenced our collective thinking about many issues related to genetic testing and the provision of genetic test results. Almost 30 years later, we are still in contact wth many members of this early cohort.  As increasing numbers of genetic tests are being used to predict adult-onset neurodegenerative disease, and as large-scale genetic testing is increasingly integrated into clinical care, it is critical that we understand not only the implicatons of presymptomatic testing for the at-risk individual over several years, but also for the at-risk individual and her/his family over the course of their lives. Here, we have a unique opportunity to take a retrospective look over decades at how at-risk individuals and their families communicate about and cope with test results not months or years following testing, but decades following testing. We will do this through in-depth interviews with a subset of those at-risk individuals who were tested between 1986 and 1996, focus groups with a subset of family members of tested individuals, and a survey sent to all at-risk individuals who were tested from 1986 to 1996 and their family members. The outcomes of this research will improve our understanding of how the results of genetic testing for serious, currently incurable disease are communicated in and through families, how this information influences choices (e.g., career, participation in research, having children) and trajectories of at-risk individuals and their families over decades, and will help inform policies and procedures for communicating such results.  Under Specific Aim 1, we will explore the impact of presymptomatic genetic testing for Huntington's disease (HD) on the lives and choices of at-risk individuals, 18-28 years after testing. Under Specific Aim 2, we will build on prior work with this cohort to determine longitudinal changes in individuals' feelings about and understanding of their testing experience as they have progressed through life's stages. Under Specific Aim 3, we will explore the impact of presymptomatic genetic testing for HD on family members (spouses, partners, children) of tested individuals, 18-28 years after testing. Under Specific Aim 4, we will build on the results of Aims 1-3 to explore how the views of individuals and their families comport with the current paradigms and policy for the conduct of clinical genetic and genomic testing."
"9490580","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biofilms are estimated to cause over 80% of bacterial infections, and persisters are thought to be responsible for their propensity to relapse. Persister are subpopulations of cells, which are largely non- replicating, that are able to tolerate high concentrations of antibiotics and resume growth upon removal of the antibiotic. Persisters are enriched in biofilms, and in this environment they not only tolerate antibiotic treatment but are also physically protected from the immune system. Anti-persister therapies are desperately needed to save lives and reduce the burden of infectious disease on the healthcare system. In order to identify potential targets for the development of novel therapeutic agents against these dangerous phenotypic variants, a greater understanding of persister physiology is needed. However, modern high-throughput technology, such as a transcriptome, cannot be used to characterize persisters because they cannot be isolated to any reasonable degree of purity. Therefore, the current state-of-the-art method to study persister gene expression is limited to investigating one promoter at a time using promoter-GFP transcriptional fusions, fluorescent- activated cell sorting (FACS), and antibiotic tolerance assays. This method is laborious and time-consuming, but has led to important insights into persister physiology. Here we propose to parallelize this technique to enable genome-scale investigations into persister gene expression. To accomplish this, we will utilize a promoter reporter library, FACS, antibiotic tolerance assays, DNA barcoding, sequencing, and statistical analysis. This technique will first be used in Escherichia coli, a common model organism for persistence research, then translated to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important clinical pathogen where persistence has been demonstrated to occur in vivo. The proposed study will result in several important scientific advancements. First, the first high-throughput method for the investigation of persister physiology at the genome scale will be developed and its translatability to clinical pathogens will be demonstrated. Second, the first persister transcription networks will be reconstructed, leading to a greater understanding of the mechanisms behind the establishment and maintenance of the persister phenotype. Third, a P. aeruginosa promoter reporter library will be created and available for use by the greater research community, facilitating the study of this important clinical pathogen. Collectively, successful completion of this research will develop tools for a deeper understanding of persistence, opening the door for the development of novel anti- persistence therapies, bringing about breakthroughs for the treatment of biofilm infections."
"9301037","ABSTRACT The cost and consequences of CNS disorders such as addiction, autism, anxiety, and depression place an enormous burden on American society. Despite significant progress, treatments for these disorders are limited and have many side effects. Thus safer, more specific drugs would have high clinical utility. One high level drug-able target is the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGlu5, which plays a critical role in all of these disorders. Indeed, several mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) are currently in clinical trials with varying degrees of efficacy. Besides the chemical scaffold, drug efficacy is also determined by cellular properties and receptor location. Because our previous work has shown that 60-90% of mGlu5 is located on intracellular membranes where it couples to distinct signaling systems, mGlu5 location may play a key role in its ability to be modulated. In fact our new data show that the intracellular receptor is necessary for establishing hippocampal and striatal LTD and sufficient in blocking chronic pain behaviors. Caveats exist, though, since many of these initial antagonists have off- target effects, variable efficacy, and rapid clearance. To overcome these issues we have obtained five new highly selective mGlu5 NAMs from Eli Lilly, Inc. Our initial data included in this application indicate that at least one of these NAMs only blocks cell surface mGlu5 whereas others are freely permeable. Using pharmacological, molecular and genetic tools as well our unique combination of permeable and impermeable agonists and antagonists, here we propose to test whether these novel NAMs block cell surface or intracellular mGlu5 in the striatum and the hippocampus, regions relevant to many CNS disorders. NAMs that differentially regulate mGlu5 will be further tested in ex vivo models of synaptic plasticity. As postsynaptic mGlu5 activation is required for hippocampal and striatal endocannabinoid-mediated LTD, the proposed studies will also determine which receptor pool contributes to presynaptic endocannabinoid-LTD. New regulators like the NAMs tested here will 1) further the concept that the cellular context of receptor modulation may alter its efficacy; 2) determine whether intracellular mGlu5 underlies fundamental aspects of synaptic activity; and 3) provide a critical tool (s) for future in vivo CNS applications. At the therapeutic level, the occurrence of a functional intracellular receptor opens the door to selectively tailoring agonists and/or antagonists to either receptor pool. Future studies targeting drugs to cell surface versus intracellular receptors might lead to new therapeutic tools for addiction, autism, anxiety, and other mGlu5-modulated disorders."
"9270030","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past several decades, dramatic breakthroughs in biomedical science have been witnessed within laboratory research. The ability to translate those discoveries as well as to make new discoveries within human investigations has been a challenge and has been often characterized as the bottleneck of clinical research. Added to this context has been the dramatic changes to healthcare organizational environments, constraints on delivery, efficiency, and reimbursements to include major structural changes to the investment in healthcare research, both federally, and industrially. Lastly, as a result of dramatic systemic changes in healthcare funding structure, the impact on higher educational graduates' careers, specifically doctoral graduates, has been quite profound. Within that changing dynamic landscape, we hypothesize that the fundamental bottlenecks associated with clinical translational research can be dramatically loosened with the training of engineers intimately familiar with human treatment and trained in the inception of novel technology-based platforms. We further hypothesize that continued scientific discoveries within the human environment as well as novel treatment approaches are highly dependent on these technology-based instrumentation platforms. The purpose of this training program is to create a new cadre of researchers capable of creating, developing, implementing, clinically evaluating, and translating methods, devices, algorithms, and systems designed with a clear focus at one particular application of medicine, namely, to facilitate surgical/interventional processes and their outcomes. Thematically, our trainees and training program will have a central focus - innovative platform technologies for treatment and discovery. While this training program addresses pressing problems in biomedical research, namely the translation and facilitation of human investigative systems, the program also speaks to improving higher education career trajectories by providing a novel professional development atmosphere. Briefly described, the training program is a year 2, 3 program with an initial year 1 requiring participation in a novel professional development and a broad therapeutic bioengineering course. With application and acceptance to trainee status, trainees experience an immersion in the clinical environment involving literature reviews, needs assessments, and novel proposals to clinical barriers towards treatment and discovery. Continued course work in areas associated with image-guided procedures, interventional imaging, interventional medical image processing and analysis, robotics and medical device design, modeling & simulation, and interventional therapeutics will provide trainees with almost limitless options for the creation of novel technologies. This all takes place within an environment that is highly promoting of technology transfer as well as scientific discovery. We believe Vanderbilt to be one of the most unique environments that includes incredible close proximity of surgical and interventional suites, robotic and medical device fabrication capabilities, guidance and analysis laboratories, extensive therapeutic investigations, imaging infrastructure, large animal surgical facilities, and a clinical cadre with a history of pioneering invention with our engineers. This is a Training Program for Innovative Engineering Research in Surgery and Intervention."
"9514336","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that fail the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months."
"9348676","Abstract Individuals who fall outside of the binary male/female classification of gender that matches the sex they were assigned at birth?termed transgender or simply trans?face innumerable challenges to their personal, interpersonal, and cultural identity that provoke significant health disparities. Although standards of care and other guidelines have been established for mental health services for trans individuals, these documents tend to be broad and aspirational and provide little specific information for front line providers or evidence-based practice. Furthermore, the history of stigmatization and discrimination, including in health care settings, has created many barriers to treatment seeking by trans individuals. This project seeks to reduce these health disparities and improve psychological services through two specific aims: #1 Develop culturally sensitive evidence-based principles of care for psychological services and assessment for the trans community in service impoverished areas. #2. Assess the needs and barriers for mental health services through an iterative development process in partnership with the Central Great Plains trans community that includes a deep understanding of stigma that can then inform the principles of care. Using a community-based participatory research model, the research team will partner with the Central Great Plains rural and urban trans community and local mental health providers through an iterative series of focus groups. Transcripts of the focus groups will be subjected to two analyses ? an inductive analysis based in grounded theory to identify themes and a critical, cultural, and rhetorical approach to link key topics in the transcripts to the cultural context to better understand trans stigma. The project will be guided by the already established local and national advisory boards. Deliverables include principles of care that can inform trans-affirmative adaptations of first-line psychological interventions for common disorders; a self- report instrument to inform process and outcomes for trans psychological services; and a publishable taxonomy of stigmatizing and destigmatizing discourse to provide critical information to clinicians about the way language is used to marginalize or heal trans people in the healthcare context. These deliverables and the establishment of a partnership with trans community will prepare the research team to apply the principles of care in a specific context (e.g., adapting a first-line treatment for anxiety) and, eventually, randomized controlled trials. This project will enhance public health services to a population subject to large health disparities, offering a pathway to improve best practices in mental health care for the trans population."
"9304376","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behaviors are sequences of actions that are executed in the proper order and correct setting to achieve a goal. Action sequences and their association with the specific environmental contexts in which they are beneficial can be hardwired, as in the case of innate behaviors, or learned and flexible, as in the case of adaptive responses to changing surroundings. The basal ganglia, a complex set of phylogenetically ancient subcortical nuclei, collect sensorimotor information from across the cortical mantle and project via output nuclei to thalamic structures that regulate action; this circuit organization suggests that the basal ganglia may play key roles in modulating ongoing patterns of action. Consistent with this possibility, neurological and psychiatric diseases that disrupt basal ganglia function also disrupt action selection, sequencing and execution. Furthermore, neural correlates have been identified within the basal ganglia that predict, accompany and lag different features of behavior. However, three key questions remain open about the relationship between basal ganglia activity and behavior. First, it is unclear whether the basal ganglia primarily encode behavioral sequences, the action components of behavioral sequences, or both. Second, because of the temporal diversity of task-related activity observed in the basal ganglia, it is not clear whether activity in specific populations of neurons is causal for behavior. Finally, because most research into basal ganglia function involves overtraining in operant tasks, it is not clear what the core principles of action encoding are that govern basal ganglia function during spontaneously generated patterns of behavior like exploration. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel 3D machine vision technology uses Baysean inference to classify spontaneous behavior on fast (e.g. neural) timescales to probe the causal relationships between neural activity in the basal ganglia and action. We will focus our analysis of the main output nucleus of the basal ganglia; the substantia nigra pars reticulate (SNpr). We will first seek to identify predictive neural correlates within the SNpr for action components and behavioral sequences by combining our behavioral analysis methods with dense electrical recordings, both during normal exploration and during the execution of innate approach and avoidance behaviors triggered by odor cues from foods, conspecifics and predators. We will then test the causal relationship between activity in these SPnr neurons and specific features of behavior by using closed- loop optogenetics to subtly alter global patterns of activity within SPnr neurons themselves. This work will shed light on the mechanisms used by the brain to create self-generated patterns of action, and yield important clues about how the links between neural activity and action are altered during disease."
"9316413","ANIMAL AND PHENOTYPING CORE - PROJECT SUMMARY The JAX NSC has a strong history in providing diverse animal resources to enhance research in the genetics of aging. These resources include >30 common inbred strains for which the JAX NSC freely provided lifespan and comprehensive healthspan data via the interactive Mouse Phenome Database, substantially increasing the value of these common laboratory strains in aging research; large-scale two- and four-way crosses to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) regulating lifespan and multiple healthspan parameters; and Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a high resolution genetic mapping population developed by JAX NSC PI Dr. Gary Churchill that promises to finally efficiently bridge the gap between QTL detection and identification of the underlying, causative quantitative trait gene. In the previous funding period, the JAX NSC included two cores, the Animal Core and the Healthspan Core. Both were highly successful and were utilized by many investigators. However, these cores are so closely intertwined by their very nature that we have now combined them into one core, The ?Animal and Phenotyping? Core. The Specific Aims of the Animal and Phenotyping Core are to: Aim 1. Develop unique animal resources to support aging research. Aim 2. Enable characterization of these animal resources by providing robust and novel phenotyping assays relevant to human lifespan and healthspan as well as relevant tissue samples. Aim 3. Coordinate with the Translational Core to obtain knockout (KO) models for lifespan studies. Aim 4. Coordinate with the Data and Statistical Core to analyze data and streamline dissemination efforts to the aging community.  "
"9398655","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (gSAD) are pervasive major public health problems. These disorders are characterized by emotion dysregulation, an inability or inefficiency to regulate negative and positive affect as reflected in common and disorder-specific symptoms (e.g., attentional bias to negative stimuli, excessive/inappropriate negative thoughts, hyperarousal, anhedonia, emotional blunting). Such dysregulation is believed to result from an imbalance between top-down ?emotion regulating? (ER) frontal nodes central in inhibitory control of bottom-up subcortical ?emotion-generating? (EG) nodes in a Fronto-Limbic Affect Regulation and Emotional Salience (FLARES) network. Therefore, successful treatment would be expected to ?normalize? neurofunctional disturbances in the FLARES network, which can be measured with fMRI and more distal units of brain function -- event-related potentials (ERPs) from electroencephalography, startle potentiation from electromyography (EMG), neurocognitive performance, and use of regulation strategies in daily life via self-report. The overarching objective of the proposed study is to understand how, when, and where CBT works and for whom to tailor treatment to improve clinical outcome. Without precisely identified ?targets? and ?predictors? of change, CBT response will continue to be unpredictably varied with few achieving meaningful clinical improvement placing them at risk for relapse and recurrence. Our proposal builds on published data from our lab and others and Preliminary Data which shows FLARES function, as assayed with fMRI, ERPs, EMG, and behaviors, is sensitive to change following CBT. Importantly, both baseline fMRI and non-fMRI units of brain-behavioral measures predict CBT response better than baseline clinical measures. Such knowledge can lead to more precise interventions aimed at capitalizing on ?strengths? or improving ?deficits? that may each exist before CBT and/or explain why CBT does not work for some patients. The dual development of fMRI (?mechanistic?) and non-fMRI (?pragmatic?) predictors and indices of therapeutic change is aimed at advancing precision medicine while increasing the clinical utility of ?biomarkers? in the outpatient setting. With this objective, we propose to employ well-validated paradigms to test ER and EG in the context of negative stimuli, reward processes, and fear systems in MDD and gSAD to delineate common and disorder-specific mechanisms of change and predictors of CBT outcome. We will enroll 200 patients: 100 MDD (without comorbid gSAD), 100 gSAD (without comorbid MDD) and randomize them to 12 weeks of manualized CBT or 12 weeks of ?placebo? psychotherapy (supportive therapy) (1:1 ratio). Multiple units of FLARES function will be collected in all patients before (Week 0), during (midway/Week 6) and after treatment (Week 12) to ascertain CBT ?dose? effects, and in 40 healthy controls for comparison. Pre-CBT predictors based on binary (responder/non-responder status) and continuous (extent of change) outcomes will be examined midway (Week 6), immediately after treatment (Week 12), and at 6-month follow-up."
"9382838","Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic alcohol toxicity can result in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). This can result in liver cirrhosis? extensive fibrosis which disrupts normal liver architecture?often leading to liver failure. The vast majority of liver cancer (i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma) cases arise in the setting of cirrhotic liver. Currently, no targeted therapies are available to halt or reverse the fibrosis-cirrhosis-cancer progression.  As fibrosis progresses, the liver becomes physically stiff. Recently, the importance of signaling pathways that cells use to interpret changes in mechanical cues has been recognized. Often disease processes arise due to misregulation of such signaling pathways. How the mechanical properties of the liver change as a result of alcohol toxicity and how this effects signaling is unknown. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing mechanical signaling in the liver, therefore, could yield novel therapeutic targets for treating ALD, reversing fibrosis, and preventing liver cancer.  I propose to answer two main questions: 1) How does alcohol influence the mechanical properties of the liver? And 2) How does increased liver stiffness influence ALD progression to fibrosis and cancer? My approach will take advantage of the unique properties of the zebrafish model system: external embryonic development, optical transparency, rapid transgenesis, high conservation of genes and organs with mammals, and the aquatic environment, which enables precise alcohol delivery.  Professionally, it is my ultimate goal to establish an academic research career with a focus on mechanical signal transduction in human pluripotent stem cells and in zebrafish disease models. I am most interested problems with a clear impact on human disease. My graduate work focused on understanding mechanisms of human pluripotent stem cell differentiation. To complement this skillset, I chose to pursue postdoctoral research in Prof. Wolfram Goessling?s group due to his status as a leader in the zebrafish disease modeling and his technical expertise dissecting mechanisms of liver development and regeneration.  This research career development plan will be mutually beneficial. I bring a strong background in mechanical signaling, and I will learn to apply this to zebrafish models of alcohol toxicity. In this way, I will learn new skills while maintaining high scientific productivity. Receiving this fellowship would facilitate my scientific training and expedite my progress toward becoming a fully independent biomedical researcher."
"9328818","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a life-threatening disease that leads to the death of over 10,000 people in the United States each year. AML is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the overproduction of cancerous blast cells in the bone marrow, which ultimately results in bone marrow failure. This disruption in normal hematopoiesis leads to life-threatening conditions, including anemia, immunosuppression, and bleeding. Approximately one-third of AMLs are associated with a gain of function mutation known as internal tandem duplication (ITD) in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), a cell surface receptor needed for cellular proliferation and survival in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment. Patients diagnosed with FLT3-ITD+ AML have a particularly poor prognosis. However, FLT3-ITD is not sufficient to cause AML. FLT3- ITD has been reported to cause a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in mice, and it is thought that additional mutations are needed to collaborate with FLT3-ITD in order to cause leukemic transformation. MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have been shown to play a variety of roles in the hematopoietic compartment and in hematopoietic malignancy. MicroRNAs repress their mRNA targets by binding to the 3'UTR of the mature transcript, preventing downstream translation. MiR-155, a particular microRNA, has recently been shown to be specifically overexpressed in FLT3-ITD+ AMLs, but the mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. Overexpression of miR-155 in the hematopoietic compartment has previously been reported to cause the development of MPD in mice. In this study, we aim to define the role of miR-155 in FLT3-ITD+ AML. Through loss of function studies in genetic mouse models, we will determine whether miR-155 and FLT3- ITD collaborate in order to lead to disease progression. We will utilize bone marrow reconstitution experiments in mice to determine if FLT3-ITD combined with miR-155 overexpression can cause leukemic transformation. We will also test whether miR-155 is needed for FLT3-ITD to collaborate with other oncogenic mutations to induce leukemic transformation. These model systems will also allow us to determine the downstream effects of miR-155 expression in FLT3-ITD. Hematopoietic progenitors are under constant guidance of exogenous cytokines in the bone marrow, and both type I and II interferon are known to have an anti-proliferative effect on hematopoietic cells. We believe that miR-155 could be promoting the growth of FLT3-ITD progenitors through inhibiting interferon responses in these cells. The results of this study could provide evidence to support targeting miR-155 to treat FLT3-ITD+ AML."
"9361856","PROJECT SUMMARY The Pilot Project Program (PPP) of the NNE-CTR is a critical pipeline for clinical and translational research, and for investigators who will develop translational research programs that foster the multidirectional and transdisciplinary interactions necessary for patient-oriented research. The PPP is designed to stimulate new collaborations and multidisciplinary partnerships between researchers and rural clinicians, in order to address the disease-specific needs of the population of Northern New England. The PPP will emphasize collaborations and maximize interactions between Maine Medical Center (MMC) and University of Vermont (UVM) researchers and community- and rural-based clinicians to conduct research that will prevent and improve treatment of diseases that are prevalent in Northern New England. We will engage laboratory scientists, physician investigators and rural practitioners to collaborate on the investigation of cancer, cardiovascular and related diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes) and substance abuse disorders, among others. This mission will be accomplished by the following specific aims: 1) Recruit investigators and facilitate the formation of interdisciplinary teams to conduct translational research addressing the health needs of the region. Research catalysts will provide guidance to rural practitioners and others new to the research endeavor. 2) Assure the success of the Pilot Project Program by providing investigators with the unique resources, skill sets and capabilities available through the NNE-CTR Cores, including ?Studio sessions? with Key Component Activity (KCA) Directors, research catalysts, content experts, and community members to optimize study design and maximize study impact; access the educational activities of the Professional Development Core to build skills; provide ?active surveillance? of ongoing pilot project studies to solve problems as they arise; and provide Scholar Awards for specific customized training opportunities in clinical and translational approaches to further enhance our investigators' success. 3) Continuously assess the ?value added? by the Pilot Projects to the NNE-CTR using traditional and innovative metrics. PPP Directors will work with the NNE-CTR Leadership to evaluate success and further optimize our approach. Mixed methods results from the Tracking and Evaluation KCA will provide critical information necessary to refine our approach and assure that the PPP is providing the highest value to our community of investigators, clinicians and importantly to the residents of rural New England. Innovative findings from NNE-CTR pilot studies could develop into larger clinical studies and attract independent funding that could impact treatment paradigms."
"9293355","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Personal genome sequences from next generation sequencing technologies are permeating clinical care via diagnostic testing. Clinical labs are under pressure to handle this data in unambiguous, reproducible ways, and provide interpretations that are comparable across testing sites, but face many difficulties to do so. Over the last several years the 'variant file', has emerged as the common currency for exchange and analyses of personal genome sequences for research, and now clinical purposes. These files describe every position in a personal genome that differs from the reference GenBank genome sequence. Given their widespread use, the variant file is a logical starting point for designing a format suitable for clinical applications. Currently variant file styles are widely divergent, ther is not uniformity in the way that complex variants are annotated and genomics has not embraced the use of medical data standards. The diagnostic genomics community, aware of these issues, has mobilized a working group to provide recommendations and requirements to unify variant annotation, to improve public health and clinical applications. For example, without clear standards for capturing variant sequence data, sharing data for the following applications is hindered: across laboratories for quality assurance, with databases for making an interpretation, with a patient record for future use. This proposal addresses the problems with polymorphic variant description by providing novel algorithms to define sequence variants and by developing file formats and software to communicate this information, using guidance from the clinical diagnostic community. The standardized format, VCFclin, and co-developed software tools will end information loss and ambiguity as genomics data flow from sequencing machines, through variant calling and analysis pipelines to interpretation and clinical use."
"9294172","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Touch sensation, which is essential for our daily life, social interactions and sexual behaviors, is mediated by mechanosensory neurons within the trigeminal (TG) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Despite its importance, touch sensation is poorly understood in mammals. The molecular basis of mechanosensitivity, the developmental mechanisms that generate different types of mechanosensory neurons and circuits, and their unique functions, are largely unknown. Our long-term goal is to understand, at the molecular, cellular and circuit levels, the developmental mechanisms and the function of different types of mammalian mechanosensory neurons, using mice as a model system. Previously, we discovered that a small population of mouse somatosensory neurons expressing the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase Ret develops into a classic type of mammalian mechanosensory neuron, the rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors. Moreover, we established a central role for Ret in controlling the development RA mechanoreceptors and found that peripheral end organs of one subtype of RA mechanoreceptors, the Pacinian corpuscles, are not formed in Ret knock-out mice. However, the signaling targets of Ret to specify different subtypes of RA mechanoreceptors remain elusive. Interestingly, our preliminary studies have identified the ETS transcription factor Er81 as an important target of Ret signaling in the specification of Pacinian corpuscle neurons. We propose to elucidate the roles of a Ret/Er81 signaling pathway in controlling the development of Pacinian corpuscle neurons. Aim I: Characterize the function of Er81 in Pacinian corpuscle and touch circuit formation. We will thoroughly characterize the expression of Er81 in RA mechanoreceptors using in situ hybridization and immunostaining at different developmental stages. We will also address the primary deficits of Er81 null Pacinian corpuscle neurons and use tissue specific knockout mice to determine if Er81 is required not only in neurons but also in accessory cells for Pacinian corpuscle formation. Lastly, we will address whether Er81 is required for maintenance of Pacinian corpuscles by ablating Er81 in adult mice. Aim II: Determine how Ret regulates Er81 to control the development of Pacinian corpuscle neurons. We will examine if Ret signaling is required and/or sufficient for regulating Er81 transcription, phosphorylation and nuclear localization in Pacinian corpuscle neurons. We will also determine if Er81 is necessary and/or sufficient for mediating the Ret signaling. Finally, we will address if Ret regulates Er81 through the mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.  In summary, the proposed research will determine (1) if Er81 is a novel target of Ret signaling to control the development of Pacinian corpuscle neurons and (2) how Ret signaling regulates Er81 in vivo. Results from this research will greatly improve our understanding of how mammalian mechanoreceptors develop and provide insight into axonal regeneration after injuries."

"9306711","Project Summary/Abstract ? Project 2 Pelvic organ prolapse (POP), descent of the pelvic organs (bowel, bladder, uterus) into the vagina, and pelvic floor symptoms such as urinary incontinence, are common and costly conditions that impact the health and well being of millions of women world-wide. For many women, the stage for future pelvic floor disorders is set with the first vaginal delivery, yet we know little about how to maximize recovery following this seminal event. The long-term goal of this research is to develop evidence-based interventions that mitigate the impact of vaginal delivery on key indices of pelvic floor health. In this project, we plan to study how physical activity, sedentary time, measures of muscular strength and body habitus impact two primary outcomes: pelvic floor support and pelvic floor symptoms. Young women demonstrate a range of vaginal support and pelvic symptomatology during the first postpartum year, but little is known about why they differ from each other. By drawing parallels between vaginal delivery and other acute soft tissue injuries, this project will explore biologically plausible factors known about muscle and connective tissue healing that may be related to postpartum recovery and thereby pelvic floor health: timing, dose and type of physical activities, muscular strength and body habitus. We hypothesize that the early postpartum period (first 8 weeks) reflects acute healing and early recovery when moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA, measured using accelerometry) may impair healing and result in worse pelvic floor support and greater symptoms one year postpartum. Conversely, the remaining first postpartum year reflects a period to strengthen and improve supporting structures; we hypothesize that greater MVPA and less sedentary time will improve pelvic floor support and reduce symptoms. The scope of this project is relevant to NICHD's described mission, to ensure that ?women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and?to ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation?, and specifically addresses pelvic floor disorders, as emphasized in the portfolio of the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch. This prospective cohort study will recruit 1530 nulliparous women in the third trimester of pregnancy and follow those that deliver vaginally for 1 year postpartum. The aims of this project are to study the effect of 1) physical activity and inactivity, 2) muscular strength, and 3) body habitus, all measured in the early and later postpartum periods, on pelvic floor support and symptoms one year postpartum. We will also explore whether the presence of a high-risk delivery variable (forceps, prolonged 2nd stage of labor, shoulder dystocia, anal sphincter laceration) modifies the association between MVPA in the early postpartum period on pelvic floor support and symptoms at 1 year."
"9263832","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background Platelet activation and recruitment are critical for thrombus formation and blood vessel occlusion in the vasculature, occurring in thrombotic emergencies including acute coronary syndromes (ACS), stroke, Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), and Pulmonary Embolus (PE). Thrombotic emergencies contribute greatly to morbidity and mortality in the U.S. There are well-characterized platelet surface receptors initiating intracellular signal transduction events which trigger platelet activation and thrombus formation. Some of these receptors are exploited clinically using anti-platelet medications for patients who experience a myocardial infarction (MI). Aspirin and clopidogrel are two anti-platelet agents used to treat MI yet one prospective study showed only a 20% reduction in adverse vascular events with the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin. During an acute MI, coronary arteries can be opened using stents. Recent data indicates that stenting a coronary artery-even with clopidogrel and aspirin therapy-leads to a `no reflow' phenomenon in around 50% of patients. No reflow, even after removing luminal obstruction, is thought to involve downstream microvascular obstruction-a region where platelets are most active. Failure of anti-platelet medications and observing no reflow sometimes leads clinicians to reflexively increase the existing drug dose, to combine anti-platelet medications, or to search for new medications against the same platelet receptors in the hope of seeing enhanced efficacy. Innovative Observation Another strategy may be to consider that platelet activity is somehow different (dysregulated) in disease conditions such as no reflow and diabetes where traditional anti-platelet medications can have unpredictable effects. In the ischemic microvasculature, platelets are exposed to enriched concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can activate platelets independent of surface receptors. We have, for the first time, identified a protein in platelets called ERK5. ERK5 is exquisitely sensitive to ROS, and appears to act as a platelet ischemic sensor, which triggers maladaptive platelet behavior. ERK5 is a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) family member usually found in proliferating cells because it drives cell cycle progression. In the anucleate platelet, we found that ERK5 is important for normal platelet activation as well as platelet activation in response to ROS. Using a mouse MI model in which ROS and platelet activators are greatly elevated, platelet specific ERK5-/- mice have reduced infarct size and improved heart function. In addition, the expression and ubiquitination of proteins important for platelet activation are dramatically altered, suggesting there may be a switch which transforms platelets into a dysregulated state in inflammatory, post-infarct environment. Importance of the Mentored Research Award I treat patients with cardiovascular disorders and so I am acutely aware of the limitations and needs of currently available therapeutics. Traditionally, hematologists have contributed to platelet research while cardiologists typically prescribe anti-platelet medications. I aim operate at the interface of basi thrombosis research and clinical cardiovascular care. There has been little advance in the development of platelet inhibiting drugs to use in patients with heart attack and I feel this is because dysregulated platelet function is not understood. I propose to mechanistically demonstrate a key role for platelet ERK5 as an `ischemia sensor', a mediator of dysregulated platelet activity following MI, and a potentially new drug target for thrombotic emergencies. The preliminary data for this study represents a significant technological advancement in terms of defining platelet function following MI as well as suggesting new relevant platelet targets for drug therapy. The aim to use the mentored career scientist award to focus and to develop independent lines of investigation needed to launch a career as a physician scientist. To achieve this goal I will aim to characterize the mechanism by which ERK5 regulates platelet activation in the body following an ischemic insult. This will allow me to learn animal models of disease previously inaccessible to me and to complement my previous training in biochemistry and cellular signaling in a cohesive and organized manner."
"9351509","It is known that sleep disturbances in healthy youth have negative effects on neurobehavioral functioning. Further, data support that individuals with diabetes have more sleep disturbances and compromised neurobehavioral functioning than individuals without diabetes. Unfortunately, sleep is not routinely addressed in standard clinical care for youth with diabetes. An experimental study is needed to verify the direct impact of sleep duration on glycemic control and neurobehavioral functioning in youth with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, our primary study aims are to (1) Test if lengthening sleep improves glycemic control and in youth with T1DM; (2) Assess if ?booster? sessions can contribute to sustained sleep length; and (3) Assess if ?booster? sessions can lead to statistically and clinically meaningful changes in HbA1c, the gold standard of glucose control. In the proposed randomized study, up to 175 youth (ages 10 through 16) with T1DM will be assigned to a Sleep Extension or a Control condition. The Sleep Extension lengthens youth's time in bed to allow for a healthy sleep duration, whereas the control condition does not impose a prescribed sleep schedule; it controls for time and attention. We will test the impact of sleep extension on key indices of glycemic control (average glucose levels and % time in range) and secondary benefits (e.g., quality of life, diabetes-related distress, and social-emotional functioning); examine the mediating role of adherence, and explore physiological pathways of effect (e.g., heart rate variability (HRV), cortisol levels) Once our aims are achieved and a causal link is established, the proposed Sleep Extension intervention will advance knowledge about the role of sleep in diabetes management and provide a beneficial intervention to help youth with T1DM."
"9302857","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application will develop new genetic tools and advance current procedures for precise and rapid mapping of behavior specific memory engrams. The proposed studies also will provide unique insight into the role of cholinergic signaling in the integrated networks that underlie anxiety behaviors. Modulatory transmitters that fine tune circuit activity are essential, albeit somewhat cryptic, components of neural coding. Perhaps the least understood- and yet most broadly distributed- neuromodulator in the CNS is acetylcholine (ACh). We propose to advance two aspects of genetic activity-mapping to track the extent to which cholinergic signaling is engaged by recall of anxiety-provoking experience in the mouse. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that display suprathreshold activation during recall of anxiety-induced behaviors are defined as enrolled in the memory engram (Eng+). Eng+ neurons will be mapped by genetically tagging activated cholinergic neurons and their projections from the basal forebrain to cingulate and prefrontal cortices as well as to hippocampal and amygdala regions that are implicated in anxiety related behavior."
"9301026","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a two-part approach to understanding developmental aspects of the RDoC positive and negative valence systems. The project focuses on objective behavioral assessment and multimodal neuroimaging. Study 1 takes advantage of 1404 children (702 twin pairs) previously objectively assessed as 7 year-olds on positive and negative affect with a battery of videotaped behavioral measures that map onto RDoC dimensions. These children had also been assessed as toddlers and were later assessed at mean age 14 years, which allows for longitudinal tests of construct validity of the RDoC systems as applied to children. Study 1 includes completion of the age 14 data collection. Study 2 proposes to follow-up, at mean age 18 years, 640 of these participants (320 same-sex twin pairs) with comprehensive neuroimaging and concurrent psychophysiological and neuropsychological measures that assess selected RDoC constructs from the positive and negative valence systems. We will determine whether standing on the childhood RDoC measures (from Study 1) predicts adolescent neuroimaging measures of reactivity and recovery of positive and negative affect (from Study 2). We will test predictions concerning correlates of standing on RDoC constructs using structural and functional connectivity and dynamic features (reactivity and recovery) of responses to affective stimuli in an automatic emotion regulation task. We use the twin design to discern whether individual differences are genetically conditioned and whether the covariance across time (stability of RDoC) and the covariance between behavioral and neural measures (neural underpinnings of RDoC) have genetic bases. We investigate environmental bases of RDoC constructs by predicting monozygotic intrapair differences in neuroimaging parameters from earlier intrapair behavioral RDoC differences and from earlier measures of adversity and stress."
"9306894","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improvements in sequencing technology have spurred a tremendous increase in the use of sequencing to answer a wide range of questions in biology and medicine. Numerous DNA sequencing projects are being launched for species whose genomes have not yet been sequenced. Sequencing of messenger RNA has led to an explosion of RNA-seq projects to characterize gene expression in multiple cell types and conditions, and simultaneously to discover new genes and new splice variants of known genes. These sequencing-based studies generate enormous amounts of data, which in turn require sophisticated, efficient, and innovative new algorithms to assemble these genomes and identify their gene content. We propose to develop new computational methods for three specific problems: first, we will develop new assembly algorithms, building on existing methods wherever possible, to assemble genomes from reads generated by the latest sequencing technologies including emerging single molecule technology. In parallel, we will continue to improve our existing assemblers, extending them to handle new and diverse data types, and to evaluate multiple other assembly systems to determine what methods work best for different WGS projects. We will also continue to collaborate with outside groups to help them assemble particularly challenging genomes. Second, we will develop new methods for discovering sequence variants, using a combination of alignment and assembly-based algorithms. These include a new method that finds variants without using alignment to the reference genome, dramatically reducing false positive rates. The method uses very fast alignment algorithms to achieve significant gains in computational speed. We propose another method that uses localized assembly to detect insertions and deletions, one of the weaknesses of most current methods. Third, one of the most exciting recent technology developments in genome analysis of the past five years is RNA-seq, a protocol for sequencing the RNA in a cell. Our group has previously developed two widely used alignment algorithms, TopHat and Cufflinks, for RNA-seq analysis, which were the first to be able to discover previously unknown splice sites and isoforms. Here we propose a novel transcript assembly algorithm, StringTie, which uses a novel network flow algorithm, a method imported from mathematical optimization theory, combined with de novo assembly to assemble and quantitate transcripts. StringTie is the first transcript assembler to use both assembly and reference-based alignment together. One key advantage of StringTie's algorithm is that it assembles and quantifies gene transcripts simultaneously. As compared to Cufflinks and all other competing methods, StringTie produces more complete reconstructions of genes and splice variants, and more accurate estimates of expression levels on both real and simulated data."
"9480928","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The androgen receptor (AR) is even more widely expressed in breast cancer (BC) than estrogen receptor alpha (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR), yet we still understand relatively little about its role or its potential as a therapeutic taget in the main subtypes of BC (ER+, Her2+ and triple negative). Thus, the long-term goal of this proposal is to determine how AR interacts with other pathways in BC subtypes, particularly in tumors that exhibit de novo or acquired resistance to current therapies. The objective is to utiliz old and new generation anti-androgens with different modes of action to elucidate the unique roles of AR and identify cooperating pathways to target in combination with AR. The central hypothesis is that AR plays subtype-specific roles and cooperates in different ways with proteins/pathways that drive these three main subtypes. Preliminary data demonstrate that AR plays crucial, subtype-specific roles in BC. The following specific aims will test the central hypothesis: Aim 1. Elucidate the mechanism of action by which AR affects ER activity. Our working hypothesis is that nuclear AR is essential for E2/ER-driven proliferation in ER+/AR+ BC. Aim 2. Identify mechanisms by which AR affects Her2+ BC. Liganded AR upregulates Her3 in some Her2+ BC lines; however, in many others Her3 is not affected, yet anti-androgens still inhibit proliferation. Thus, our working hypothesis is that there are novel mechanisms of action whereby AR impacts Her2+BC. Aim 3. Determine the mechanisms by which AR supports survival and maintains a tumor initiating population to facilitate metastasis of AR+ TNBC. Determining how AR functions in BC subtypes and identification of previously unknown targetable pathways with which AR interacts, will lead to novel therapeutic strategies. Our studies challenge the dogma that AR and androgens are protective in breast cancer. We propose that like ER, AR is an indicator of a more well-differentiated type of tumor; however, it can most certainly drive BC growth and progression, and therefore represents a logical therapeutic target. ."
"9295054","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common and severe interstitial lung disease (ILD), is minimally responsive to current medical therapies, and has a mortality rate comparable to that of many end-stage malignancies. There is increasing awareness that IPF may transition through an asymptomatic stage where the primary detectable abnormalities are radiologic. It is our belief that risk factor modification and medical therapies, when instituted at an early stage, will lead to improved care for patients at risk to develop IPF. However, for this field to progress it will be imperative to develop comprehensive clinical, radiologic, physiologic, and molecular profiles to determine which subjects are at greatest risk to develop pulmonary fibrosis. Recently we demonstrated that smokers with interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) on chest computed tomography (CT), who had not been previously diagnosed with ILD, had reduced total lung capacity, exercise capacity, and emphysema compared to smokers without ILA. We hypothesize that some of these subjects with ILA are at increased risk to develop IPF. To pursue our hypothesis we will capitalize on existing chest CTs, histopathologic, and genotypic data from large well-phenotyped cohorts. This proposal has the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) We will identify the clinical predictors of ILA and ILA progression utilizing both the COPDGene and Framingham Heart Study cohorts; Aim 2) Using a Brigham and Women's Hospital cohort of subjects with both preoperative chest CTs and lung tissue specimens we will determine the correlation between ILA and histopathologic evidence of interstitial pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis and; Aim 3) we will evaluate the genetics and epigenetic correlations between ILA and IPF utilizing the above cohorts."

"9350382","Project Summary We propose to systematically investigate and characterize sequence elements that are necessary for genome function in their native context in contrast to existing high- throughput assays of genome function that detect sequence elements that are sufficient for function. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop a novel Multiplexed Editing Regulatory Assay (MERA) to test the effect of thousands of targeted mutations in native regulatory regions in a single experiment (Aim 1). We will use MERA to characterize the regulation of key developmental genes, the function of selected regulatory elements, and the gene expression effects of SNPs that are discovered in GWAS studies (Aim 2). Using these data we will build a model that will allow us to predict the bases that comprise the necessary genome and estimate the effect of non-coding genotype on gene expression (Aim 3). Through our new experimental and computational method we will help lay the groundwork for a novel paradigm in revealing the effect of human variation at base pair resolution.  "
"9307899","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to understand the mechanism of co-translational translocation of nascent secretory and membrane proteins in molecular detail. This process occurs at the plasma membrane in bacteria and at the ER membrane in eukaryotes. Translocation is mediated by the SecY or Sec61 channel bound to its cognate ribosome. In eukaryotes, complementary studies of the translocon associated protein complex (TRAP) will be continued and the role of the ribosome-Bag6 complex in the insertion pathway for tail-anchored membrane proteins will be investigated.  In Aim 1, four structures will be determined of E. coli ribosome-SecY complexes at various stages of translocation of a secretory protein. We will use state-of-the-art cryo-EM images taken on a direct electron detector to provide high resolution 3D maps of the complexes. This will include a ground state structure without a nascent chain and structures of secretory complexes with nascent chains at early and late stages of translocation. In these studies, active 70S-SecY complexes are formed in cells and stalled nascent chains are crosslinked within the channel to trap the translocation intermediates. This Aim will reveal conformational changes of the SecY complex and the disposition of the nascent chain, as the lateral gate opens to allow a signal sequence helix to move into the surrounding bilayer and be processed by signal sequence peptidase. This cleavage step leaves a SecY channel with a single strand of the translocating nascent chain threaded across the pore.  In Aim 2, the goal is to obtain a crystal structure of the alpha/beta lumenal domain of TRAP to test our hypothesis that the alpha subunit may act like a chaperone that transiently binds to extended nascent chains as they exit from the Sec61 channel. This may bias translocation in the forward direction.  In Aim 3, the structure of a human Bag6-TRC35-Ubl4A complex will be determined, as it interacts with 80S ribosomes that contain a transmembrane (TM) domain in the exit tunnel. This is the first step of the insertion pathway for tail anchored membrane proteins, in which the TM helix is protected from aggregation by the Bag6 complex. The TM helix is subsequently delivered to the TRC40 ATPase dimer, which transfers its substrate to the Get1-Get2 complex for insertion into the ER membrane."

"9310076","ABSTRACT The Obstetric-Fetal Pharmacology Research Centers (OPRC) are poised to provide a mechanism to further the investigation of safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in therapies for common pregnancy-related conditions and outcomes (e.g., preterm labor, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes) as well as prevalent conditions that are not necessarily associated with pregnancy (e.g., depression). Potential OPRC studies include basic research in animal, cell, tissue and organ-based systems and clinical research, such as PK, PD and pharmacogenetic (PGx) studies of FDA-approved drugs, identification of reliable biomarkers and assays to aid detection and monitoring of anomalies, and development of novel therapeutic agents. All are critically needed to better understand the effect of drugs during pregnancy and postpartum and subsequently develop tools to improve timely detection, on-going monitoring and disease management. Networks with interdisciplinary investigation require tools to optimize interoperability, speed and quality of their collaborative endeavors. A Logistic Coordinating Center (LCC) will be established as part of the OPRC recomplete to address these challenges and is vital to the success of the OPRC program's overarching mission. DM-STAT, Inc. is well-positioned to successfully fulfill this role and will effectively serve as the LCC of the OPRC by accomplishing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To develop systems and processes to support multi-disciplinary collaboration, communication and information exchange to ensure that the research priorities are transparent and subsequently the goals of the OPRC program are met. Specific Aim 2: To ensure all studies and trials of the program are executed ethically and in accordance with applicable local, state and federal regulations, institutional requirements and industry best practices. If awarded, DM-STAT will play a pivotal role in ensuring success of the OPRC program, utilizing tools developed and knowledge acquired over the past 18 years serving network projects of similar size and scope. DM-STAT recognizes the importance of understanding the scientific content of multidisciplinary investigations in order to serve as active and informed contributors. DM-STAT has built a solid foundation in maternal and child health research, particularly in obstetrics, and keeps abreast of developments in the field, such as the investigation of changes in the PK/PD, microbiome, (epi)genetics, placental function and other factors affecting maternal health, fetal development and pregnancy outcomes. In the role of the LCC in the OPRC, DM-STAT will be instrumental in the effective institution and management of the program's infrastructure and ensuring regulatory compliance, enabling timely dissemination and translation of research findings, to ultimately protect the health of pregnant women, while improving birth outcomes and reducing infant morbidity and mortality.  "
"9294861","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Panic disorder is a common psychiatric illness with a lifetime prevalence of about 4.5%. The hallmark of the disorder is recurring panic attacks, which can appear suddenly and unexpectedly, consisting of pronounced fear, as well as cardiovascular and respiratory responses. The initial pathology in these patients appears to be an alteration somewhere in the central neural pathways regulating normal panic responses, thus rendering the patients susceptible to unprovoked panic symptoms when exposed to ordinarily mild interoceptive stressors. Understanding the neuronal underpinnings of panic attacks would significantly improve the outcomes and treatment. The neurotransmitter hypocretin (Hcrt), also known as orexin, has been recently linked to hyperarousal, anxiety and panic, but the specific effector circuits are unknown. Anatomical and functional evidence suggests that one of the possible Hcrt/orexin targets are norepinephrine (NE)-containing neurons in the brainstem. Here, we will test the overall hypothesis that Hcrt/orexin acts through ventral norepinephrine A2 neurons and their efferents to produce different components of the anxiety and panic responses. We will use anatomical tracing and optogenetic tools to obtain a functional map of the neuronal circuitry connecting A2 neurons with several of its anatomical targets, namely the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We will also determine the connectivity between these circuits and the arousal promoting Hcrt/orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Our experiments will increase our understanding of the circuitry associated with anxiety with cellular specificity and may lead to potentially more selective treatments for anxiety and panic disorders."
"9320730","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UC San Diego Department of Radiology is resubmitting a competitive renewal of its postdoctoral training grant for medical residents, Training Clinical Scientists in Radiological Imaging. Following its first five-year funding cycle the department's innovative training program has met with great success. The group of trainees has begun joining academic departments to embark on their own academic careers, with excellent publication records in high impact journals, awards for their work-one for being the most cited article in Neuroimage in 2011-and having already been awarded grants to support their work and 2 NIH R01 grants to support mentor. The growing role of imaging in clinical care and biomedical research has resulted in an acute need for clinician- scientists skilled in cutting-edge imaging science. At present, there exists a talented pool of medical student applicants to academic radiology residency programs across the U.S.A. with >20 MD/PhDs and a >50 MDs that have spent >1 year of dedicate research time during medical school per year. Only a small fraction is enticed to stay in academic radiology and pursue research. The training program described in this proposal builds on the department's proven 4-year clinical training program by adding a full research year at the beginning of residency that is then built upon throughout the clinical training by spending 6 weeks of dedicated research time per year for the balance of the 4 years. Three one-year slots will be made available to applicants to the department's five-year radiology residency program. The goal is to tailor the training program to the individual needs of each applicant and to maximize trainees' research experience at UCSD. Clinical training will focus on areas of specific interest to the trainee in addition to meeting requirements for board certification. The clinical years will be consecutive to maximize trainees' learning; however, trainees will maintain contact with their research mentors throughout their stay at UCSD. The mentorship provided by each laboratory leader during trainees' research year and by the clinical scientist throughout the five-year residency will link their research and clinical experiences and provide them a model for future careers as clinical scientists. In addition to research opportunities and career mentorship, the program includes specialized lectures tailored to the needs of each trainee and workshop specific to academic radiologists. A Match Program-offered integrated training program focusing on the career of clinical scientists ensures equal access to all applicants and allows us to engage residents early in their training, resulting in committed, well-trained clinical scientists. UCSD is well suited to train the next generation of imaging scientists. For this proposal, we have assembled 16 Radiology and 8 non-radiology mentors that together have trained over 300 trainees in the past 10 years, have over 110 active grants and $70M in grant support and their trainees have published nearly 700 papers most of which is in high impact journals."
"9321101","PROJECT SUMMARY ? DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL CORE The Data Management and Statistics Core serves a critical purpose that encompasses all activities of the Northwestern ADC, ranging from the acquisition of the data to their storage, sharing and analysis. The Data Management and Statistics Core has undergone a profound transformation over the last five years in response to the evolving needs of the Northwestern ADC, NIA, NACC, and our many research collaborators. In collaboration with the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS), the Core established a state of the art database with a robust set of tools that assist in the capture, curation, storage, searching, sharing, transferring and analysis of data sets generated by all components of the ADC. The new database allows all subject information, (e.g., demographic, clinical, imaging, neuropathologic, biomarker-related, longitudinal) to be integrated through a unique identifier that encompasses all research- related activities of the subject. During the upcoming cycle, the Data Management and Statistics Core will maintain this relational and secure database so that it provides user-friendly and efficient access to data for approved research projects and for transmission to NACC. The Core will also provide biostatistics expertise in research design and data analysis for all Center investigators, including fellows, graduate students and Pilot Grant recipients. Another major goal will be to apply and develop innovative biostatistical approaches designed to address new developments within the Northwestern ADC. To this end, Core biostatisticians will work with all ADC investigators to analyze and summarize data for research presentations and grant proposals. Without a strong Data Management and Statistics Core the information generated through ADC activities could not be stored, integrated or shared in any systematic fashion, studies could not be designed properly, and research results could not be analyzed and presented optimally. The Northwestern ADC will therefore continue to devote all appropriate resources to the Data Management and Statistics Core, both through the NIA P30 and, if necessary, though additional discretionary funds."
"9306969","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inhibition of Neural Electrode-mediated Inflammation and Neuronal Cell Death A growing number of implantable neural electrode devices are being developed to map brain circuit or restore function and treat diseases.  The performance of these devices hinges on the quality and stability of the electrode-neural tissue interface.  Undesirable brain tissue responses, including persistent microglia activation and blood brain barrier breach, glial scarring, neuronal loss and degeneration, have been consistently reported in animal studies.  For electrode devices that require intimate contact with host neurons, their performance functionality may be compromised by these responses.  As an example, single unit neural recording via microelectrode arrays experiences deterioration in yield and quality over time, which is a major barrier to applications of this technology in long-term neuroscience research and clinical translation.  There are many molecules and pathways involved in inflammation and neuronal death.  We began our study by focusing on caspase-1, as caspase-1 is a key mediator of both inflammation and programmed cell death.  Activation of caspase-1 is the earliest detectable event in neuronal apoptosis in vitro and in brains with ischemic, injury and neurodegenerative conditions.  Furthermore, caspase-1 activates interleukin-1 ß (IL-1ß), a pro-inflammatory cytokine highly expressed in the tissue surrounding implanted electrodes, especially those that showed poor electrophysiological outcome.  IL-1ß triggers inflammatory gliosis and exacerbates BBB breach; both are hypothesized causes of chronic recording failure.  Therefore, we hypothesize that caspase-1 mediates the neuronal death and inflammation around neural implants and inhibiting caspase-1 may improve neuronal survival, reduce inflammation and lead to improved electrode performance.  We have performed a preliminary study comparing the neural recording performance of microelectrode arrays implanted in caspase- 1 knockout (KO) vs.  wild-type (WT) mice.  The single unit yield and signal quality are significantly greater in the knockout animals over the 6 month time period, strongly supporting the critical role for caspase-1 in maintaining the quality of the electrode-tissue interface.  However, closer examination of the recording over time revealed dynamic changes that cannot be interpreted with end-point histology.  To better understand the mechanism(s) by which caspase-1-mediated pathways affect recording, we propose to use 2-photon live animal imaging to characterize the cellular and vascular responses to implanted neural probes in conjunction with neural recording and comprehensive tissue and biochemical analyses.  Therapeutics targeting caspase-1 or the inflammation/cell death in general will be evaluated in an effort to improve the chronic neural interface.  The drugs to be tested are caspase 1 specific inhibitor VX765, melatonin and minocycline.  This proposal uses a multidisciplinary approach to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanism contributing to neural recording performance.  The findings will increase our scientific understanding of neural implant pathology, and guide the development of therapeutic and/or biomaterial strategy for stable and reliable neural interface.  Data and technology developed in this project may also contribute to the study of neuronal degeneration and inflammation in traumatic brain injury, stroke and neural degenerative diseases."

"9302817","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reversible chemical modifications on DNA and histones play critical roles in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. Prior to our work, no example of reversible chemical modifications on RNA that could affect gene expression had been shown. In 2011, we discovered the first RNA demethylase, FTO, a protein belonging to the AlkB family iron- and 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG)-dependent dioxygenases and which is associated with human fat mass obesity. FTO catalyzes oxidative demethylation of the most prevalent internal modifications of mammalian messenger RNA (mRNA) and other nuclear RNA, N6-methyladenosine (m6A). This result, taken together with subsequent transcriptome-wide mapping of m6A, has revived research interest in the investigation of mRNA modifications. We have also characterized the methyltransferase core complex as well as proteins that can selectively recognize m6A-modified mRNA; the binding of m6A-containing mRNA by a family of the reader proteins affects the translation status and lifetime of the target mRNA. While research is ongoing to investigate the functional roles of m6A in various biological processes in laboratories around the world, we have yet to overcome a significant technology hurdle for the study of m6A in RNA: at present no high-throughput sequencing method exists that can detect the exact locations of m6A and reveal the modification percentage of m6A at each site. In the current application, we propose two new methods for the transcriptome-wide, base-resolution sequencing of m6A: i) ADAR-mediated adenosine deamination that differentiates unmodified A from m6A; ii) methyltransferase-assisted chemical labeling of adenosine to identify unmodified A from m6A. Both methods convert unmodified A in RNA into a different base during reverse transcription (RT) and subsequent amplification. The presence of the methyl group on m6A hinders the conversion, thereby allowing us to differentiate A from m6A in sequencing. These methods will be validated in selected biological systems and will be used to investigate potential roles of m6A that may differentiate maternal from zygotic mRNA during maternal to zygotic transition using zebrafish as a model. We believe the availability of these methods will provide enabling tools to future research of m6A in RNA."

"9283606","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent successes in achieving a functional cure for HIV infection are redirecting the field to examine therapeutic regimens to eliminate latent virus reservoirs. Cocktails of antiretroviral (ART) drugs have been successful in reducing viremia to undetectable levels in HIV+ adult subjects that have access to the therapy.  Yet, the drugs are unable to eliminate latent virus in certain cellular and tissue compartments. While ART is the standard of care for HIV+ mothers and their infants who are exposed to infection risk before, during, and after birth, the field has not addressed an extension of ART therapy that could abate virus expansion and eliminate established latent viral reservoirs. A proven nonhuman primate model for perinatal infection that examines new therapeutic regimens that can be instituted at or immediately following infection is needed to address whether it is possible to eradicate HIV.  The objective of the proposed project is to adapt an established model of persistent pathogenic SHIV infection in newborn rhesus macaques to study the effects of very early therapies with or without ART. Understanding the full contribution of antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), in HIV-1 infection remains one of the highest research priorities. Passively transferred NAbs can provide sterilizing immunity in nonhuman primate models and when present early in infection can change the course of SIV or SHIV infection stabilizing the adaptive immune response to prevent viral divergence.  Studies designed to define how well antibodies can affect the viral reservoir are the next steps in the field. The central hypothesis of this research proposal is that therapeutic treatment with potent neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs) will result in highly controlled or undetectable viral reservoirs in babies born to HIV-infected mothers.  Newborn rhesus macaques when infected orally with SHIV-SF162P3 develop widely dispersed and rapidly diverging viral quasispecies in blood and tissues within the first few days to weeks of infection resulting in high and persistent viremia. However, in newborn macaques that receive passive treatment with neutralizing IgG, disease and death is prevented demonstrating that NAbs present during acute infection can alter the dynamics of infection and reduce viral spread and establishment of the reservoir. Once the timing and characterization of latent viral pools are characterized, the project will define the roles that NmAbs play in (i) controlling virus load, (ii) affecting the size of the integrated viral reservoir, and (iii) influecing the development of effective adaptive immune responses. The project will also examine whether NmAb cocktails that are effective when used alone can further augment the ability of ART resulting in more potent and durable reduction in latency. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to define the advantage of passively transferred neutralizing antibodies as therapeutics in a perinatal setting either alone or in concert with ART."
"9294850","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which in turn has serious complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade.  We previously successfully argued in our application for the R01 HD056465 award that distillation of the genetic component in this complex phenotype should thus be easier to determine in children, where environmental exposure and impact has been for a relatively short period of their lifetime; indeed the resulting work did pan out to be successful in this regard. We carried out a non-hypothesis-driven study that was directed at uncovering genes and genetic variants that predispose to childhood obesity by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high density tag-SNP array. Employing a powered two-stage study design in a consortium setting, where cases were defined as being in the e95th percentile of BMI, we identified novel association signals which we subsequently replicated. This NICHD funded study was ultimately published in Nature Genetics (with the PI as senior author) and received widespread press attention, including with CNN, Time and the front page of USA Today.  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is now poised to determine additional genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity through the leveraging of new ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology, and also allow for fine-mapping of the already uncovered loci to determine the actual causal mechanism of action. Combining our accurately phenotyped cohort, which represents the largest pediatric obesity DNA collection in the world, with access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide singl nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal application of R01 HD056465 proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait in order to get further insights in to the genetic etiology of common pediatric obesity.  We are well positioned to extend our knowledge of the genetic etiology of childhood obesity. It is unclear if these additional variants are common in the population, a set o private mutations in families or a mixture of both. Irrespective of the nature of the variant(s) we are well positioned to look for both types of event, with common variants detectable through leveraging the GWAS dataset of well powered cohorts and private mutations detectable through whole exome sequencing of many multi-case pedigrees. This represents a major follow-up to the Principal Investigator's original grant application and this renewal will allow for adding extr value to the already substantial findings made funded by the original grant."
"9321979","Abstract - Core B - BioCore Core B provides the resources and expertise to process specimens for the hematological, neuroendocrine, glucoregulatory, metabolic and cytokine indices needed for the research projects. The Core has the requisite infrastructure and oversight capabilities to ensure reliable and high quality data are generated in a high throughput manner with centralized testing at single sites. Specifically, the Core works with the 3 clinician- researchers who supervise nursing staff acquiring blood, urine and saliva specimens at the 3 regional Clinical Research Units. The BioCore then coordinates many tests at two CAP and CLIA-certified clinical laboratories for evaluating glucoregulation and lipid metabolism, as well as neuroendocrine assays, including catecholamines via LC/MS at the Endocrine Services unit of the UW-CTR. Some analytes are determined at labs that specialize in specific methods, such as dried blood spots (DBS) for the Retention-Early Warning project, run at the CLIA-CAP accredited Clinical Laboratories of the University of Washington School of Medicine. Core B also conducts assays, including multi-cytokine arrays using an electrochemiluminescence platform. Core B receives the saliva specimens for the Daily Stress project, monitors shipment integrity of the specimens upon receipt, and oversees the assay of salivary cortisol. To fulfill these functions, the Core is the primary liaison with project investigators and with medical directors at the testing labs, including Meriter Labs in Madison, WI and ARUP in Salt Lake City, UT. It has its own biochemical facilities for safe processing, including certified biosafety cabinets and fume hoods, follows Biosafety Level-2 protocols, and has the requisite number of ultracold freezers for long-term storage of archival aliquots. The scientific expertise of the Core staff positions MIDUS to be able to add innovative indices, such as ones employed in the Gene Expression project. It has enabled us to refine and validate more sensitive assays with Lower Limits of Detection (e.g., reducing the LLOD for urinary epinephrine by 1000-fold). In addition to assays and diagnostic testing, the Core is responsible for creating the data files of initial test results, which employ a distinct study code to protect participant confidentiality. In keeping with this record-keeping role, the Core serves as the repository for all original paper records of test results. It is responsible for all aspects of quality assurance, including monitoring the integrity of shipped specimens, quality control testing of assay reliability over time, and determines the need for any retesting of specimens, as well as oversees the 24/7 surveillance of our archival specimen repository in ultracold freezers. Finally, the Core has a pedagogical role. It generates norms for MIDUS test results to serve as a reference for investigators. In this educational capacity, the Core Director also provides instruction, giving workshops on specific biomarkers at the MIDUS meetings and consults with investigators on interpreting the meaning of biomarkers. The effectiveness and past success of the Core are evinced by 122 publications using MIDUS biomarker data, 47% of which were published in the last two years."
"9307957","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  In cystic fibrosis (CF), a defect in mucosal defenses leads to airway colonization with bacteria, inflammation, remodeling, and tissue destruction. The disease is progressive and life limiting. Recent studies indicate that loss of CFTR function reduces bicarbonate permeability across the airway epithelium and lowers the pH of airway surface liquid (ASL), impairing the function of secreted host defense factors. This may be among the earliest events favoring colonization. Respiratory viral infections may also contribute to development of lung disease in infants and children with CF. Epidemiologic data indicate that respiratory virus infections cause prolonged symptoms in children with CF, induce exacerbations, and enhance bacterial colonization. While clinical studies and limited in vitro data suggest the possibility of altered responses to viruses in CF, this is an  experimentally difficult problem to study in humans. Our central hypothesis is that virus infections contribute to disease onset and progression in CF. The CF pig model manifests a respiratory tract host defect at birth and spontaneously develops lung disease with many similarities to human infants with CF. The objective of. our studies is to use this model to investigate the contribution of virus infections to early CF lung disease. We will test our central hypothesis, using model virus infections and by pursuing the following three specific aims:  Aim 1. Do CFTR dependent changes in ASL environment allow respiratory viruses to infect airway epitheliamore readily? ?  Aim 2. Do changes in interferon induction and responsiveness enhance respiratory virus infections in CF?  Aim 3. Does CF alter the resolution phase ofthe response to respiratory virus infections?  Leveraging the porcine CF model to study CF and non-CF responses to viral infections in vitro and in vivo is a novel approach to investigate human disease mechanisms. These complementary strategies should provide new insights into the early steps in CF lung disease pathogenesis that will inform future therapeutic strategies."

The goal of the CMBP is to create opportunities for student training not available through other programs on campus by providing: (1) a broader range of rotation choices, (2) interdisciplinary monthly meeting seminars and symposia, (3) coursework that includes an emphasis on the responsible conduct of research and training in quantitative skills, and (4) career-advancing components including writing and career workshops specifically developed for this program, internship opportunities, and Individual Development Plans. CMBP is a rigorous and demanding program designed to attract top students to OSU, and the breadth and depth of the training provided will position CMBP graduates to make significant contributions to biomedical research in academia, government, and industry. In the past few years, significant institutional support, together with a new Arts and Sciences College structure, has facilitated interdisciplinary research and graduate training at OSU. The unique combination of opportunities offered through the CMBP has already increased recruitment and retention of the very best graduate students, in particular from underrepresented minorities (URM) and students with disabilities. Strong matching institutional support has allowed us to exceed our initial goal of having one quarter of fellowships awarded to URM/disability/disadvantaged students, as 40% of the trainees supported during the initial funding period are in one of these categories. The resources requested in this proposal would allow us to build on initiatives developed during the initial funding period and continue to develop a graduate training experience that spans a broad range of topics and activities in the cellular, molecular and biochemical sciences."
"9285826","Sensory hypersensitivity and abnormal sensory processing contribute significantly to behavioral problems  associated with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Sensory hypersensitivity and audiogenic seizures in the FXS  mouse model, Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, suggest a hyperexcitability of sensory circuits. We have discovered  a robust hyperexcitability, as well as changes in specific excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, in  neocortical circuits in the Fmr1 KO mice. Our work has also revealed a novel molecular mechanism  underlying hyperexcitability - impaired scaffolding among Homer proteins and resulting enhanced  metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) signaling. We hypothesize that, in addition to enhancing mGluR5  function, impaired Homer scaffolding causes a displacement of the endocannabinoid (eCB) synaptic  signaling resulting in differentially altered eCB-dependent plasticity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in  the Fmr1 KO. Evidence also indicates that ERK activity is involved in this altered plasticity. New data find  that increased CamKlla phosphorylation of Homer causes the loss of scaffolding. As part of the FXS center,  we propose to examine the role that these biochemical mechanisms and 3 synaptic pathways play in  hyperexcitability of the auditory cortex in the Fmr1 KO mouse. Coordination of experiments are planned to  link the alterations we find in the auditory neocortex with deficits in auditory sensory processing in Fmr1 KO  mice (P2) and FXS patients (P3). In, Aim 1, we examine the developmental and circuit mechanisms  underlying circuit hyperexcitability. Based on existing candidate targets for potential FXS treatment, we also  examine the acute effects of clinically-approved, potential therapeutics on neocortical hyperexcitability. In  Aim 2, we determine if mGluR5-eCB synaptic plasticity is dysregulated at 3 different neocortical synaptic  pathways with known changes in the Fmr1 KO that could underlie hyperexcitability. In Aim 3, we determine  if enhanced CaMKlla phosphorylation of Homer causes circuit hyperexcitibility and dysregulated mGluR5-eCB plasticity of specific synaptic circuits. In Aim 4, and in collaboration with P2, we examine the role of altered matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP9) signaling in hyperexcitability and disrupted Homer scaffolds"
"9306048","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) reside at the base of the crypt, within a niche that contains supportive Paneth cells and pericryptal myofibroblasts. The extracellular matrix (ECM), an understudied component of the niche, is also intimately associated with ISCs and may be influential on ISC behavior, as it is in other tissues. Although key mechanisms that intrinsically control ISC maintenance are starting to be identified, little information exists on how extrinsic factors, such as the ECM, impact ISCs. The transcription factor Sox9 differentially marks ISCs within the small intestinal crypt, is required for proper ISC function, and has been shown to be essential for proper epithelial proliferation. Sox9 has also been associated with regulation of ECM, with Collagen XVIII Type A (Col18a1) down-regulated in intestinal epithelium lacking Sox9 (Sox9-KO). Interestingly, Col18a1 has the ability to bind Wnt, a known regulator of Sox9 and ISC proliferation. Association between Sox9, Col18a1 and Wnt signaling suggests that Sox9 may be a driver of dynamic reciprocity within the ISC niche, allowing ISCs to interact with the surrounding ECM. Therefore, the central hypothesis for this proposal is that Sox9 drives the production of Col18a1 to maintain ISC identity by creating a Wnt gradient in the small intestinal crypt. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine the cellular origin of Col18a1 within the ISC niche by single-cell RNA sequencing of wild type intestinal crypt epithelium and supportive pericryptal myofibroblasts. Data collected will provide information about the cellular origin of Col18a1 as well as any other differentially expressed genes for future studies. We will then determine the effect of Sox9 on Col18a1 proteins within the niche ECM by mass spectrometry of acellular wild type and Sox9-KO ECM. Western blots and immunohistochemistry will identify abundance and location of Col18a1 and any aberrant expression patterns in Sox9-KO ECM. Finally, we will determine the influence of Col18a1 on ISC function by silencing Col18a1 expression by lentiviral transduction of Col18a1 siRNA in cultured ISCs. Identifying the relationship between Sox9 and Col18a1 is critical for understating ISC/ECM dynamics during homeostasis, regeneration following injury, and disease, as well as developing novel intestinal tissue engineering strategies."
"9293183","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are the 3rd leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. and are associated with significant economic burden and health-related negative consequences. While women may be less likely to develop AUDs, they experience more significant negative health consequences of alcohol use than men. Due to stigma, shame, and child care issues; women are less likely to receive specialty addiction treatment. The comorbidity of depression and AUDs is much higher in women, and compared to men, women depression often has a temporal onset prior to an AUD. Relapse rates are very high in both men and women but significant gender differences emerge in the predictors of relapse. Women are more likely to relapse in unpleasant, negative emotional states and depressive symptoms and negative affect mediate the relationship between these stressors and drinking outcomes. More so than men, women with AUDs report drinking to cope with negative emotions. Therefore, intervention approaches that help women develop alternate coping strategies can have an important role in decreasing alcohol relapse among depressed women with AUDs. Given the demonstrated benefits of exercise for decreasing depression, negative affect, and urges to drink, helping women engage in a flexible and acceptable lifestyle physical activity (LPA) intervention may provide them a tool they can utilizing in the moment to cope with negative emotional states and alcohol craving during early recovery when relapse risk is highest. Exciting new digital fitness technologies (e.g., Fitbit activity monitor with web and mobile applications) have emerged in recent years that include features able to further enhance critical components for increasing physical activity - goal setting and self-monitoring. We propose to develop a 12-week LPA+Fitbit intervention for depressed women in alcohol treatment. This will include: 1) an in-person physical activity (PA) counseling orientation session 2) 4 brief, phone-based PA counseling sessions focused on increasing PA and strategically using bouts of PA to cope with affect and alcohol cravings; 3) use of the Fitbit fitness tracker fo physical activity goal-setting and daily self-monitoring; and 4) weekly supportive messages delivered by email. The overall objective of this application is to develop this LPA+Fitbit intervention, modify it based on a initial open pilot (n=20) and feedback to ensure its feasibility and acceptability for depressed women with AUDs in early recovery, propose potential mechanisms, and to obtain preliminary data on its efficacy in a small randomized clinical trial (n=50). The LPA+Fitbit intervention proposed in this application is simple, low-cost, and easily transportable to the varied clinical settings women with AUDs receive treatment. If women with AUDs find the LPA+Fitbit intervention feasible, acceptable, and helpful during early recovery, they could be afforded with a much needed alternate coping strategy that would reduce relapse risk and decrease the overall negative impact of alcohol use on their health and well-being."

"9305164","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a generally devastating neuropsychiatric illness with considerable morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal cost. Genetic factors have been strongly implicated via family and twin data, and more recently directly through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and sequencing studies. Epigenetic modifications play a well-accepted role in a variety of medical and neurological illnesses, and are also implicated in SCZ. Somatic mosaicism is an underexplored, but potentially very important contributor to SCZ. There have been some intriguing hints that somatic mosaicism may play a role in SCZ, but assessment of this possibility awaits rigorous experiments, and that is the overarching goal of this proposal. The primary objective of our project is to identify and characterize the extent of somatic variation in post-mortem human brain samples from individuals with SCZ and controls. Following on work of members of our team, we will rigorously assess the somatic mosaicism in a large cohort of post-mortem human brains from the Common Mind Consortium, which members of our group are already analyzing for genotype, mRNA-seq and epigenome mapping. These brains are from individuals with SCZ (250) and controls (50+). We will look for retrotransposition events, copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). All data will be made available to the research community through the Sage Bionetworks Synapse Platform. We have assembled the critical personnel, sample resources, technological know-how, and analytic strategies to be able to assess the role of somatic variation in the brain as well as begin to unravel SCZ biology."
"9318556","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. PET is a molecular imaging modality that is capable of imaging physiological and biochemical processes directly in humans and animals by labeling biomolecules of interests with positron emitters. It has wide applications in clinical diagnosis and biological research, includin oncology, cardiology, neuroscience, and studies of various human diseases using animal models. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. Therefore, improving the quality of PET images will have a profound impact on modern medicine. This proposal builds upon our previous work on patient-adaptive penalized maximum likelihood image reconstruction and dynamic PET imaging. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the promising image reconstruction methods that we have developed using patient data with histology-verified ground truth and to enhance the robustness and performance of these methods through task- specific optimization and adding motion compensation ability. The four specific aims are (i) Evaluation of patient-adaptive PML reconstruction using breast cancer patients with histologically verified ground truth, (ii) Development of patient-adaptive dynamic PET image reconstruction, (iii) Development of a motion-compensated dynamic PET image reconstruction method, and (iv) Validation of the motion-compensated reconstruction using biopsy-proven lung cancer patient data. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the clinical application of PET imaging."
"9361849","PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research (NNE-CTR) Network is to develop and sustain a clinical and translational research infrastructure that supports improvement in rural and community health for inhabitants in the IDeA states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. This goal will be accomplished through complementary and synergistic collaborations of investigators in two lead institutions, Maine Medical Center (a member of the MaineHealth System) and the University of Vermont ( with the University of Vermont Health Network ), one participating institution, the University of Southern Maine, and two collaborating organizations, the Dartmouth SYNERGY Clinical and Translational Science Institute and the Dartmouth Primary Care Cooperative Research Network (Dartmouth CO-OP). The Northeast has the largest percentage of residents over 65 years of age, and while NNE-CTR will support clinical and translational studies of all types, our efforts will emphasize health problems endemic in the rural populations of northern New England, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and substance abuse, as well as the barriers that compromise rural health care delivery. The members of our proposed network have a long history of collaboration, providing a solid platform for the proposed network. To accomplish these goals, NNE-CTR proposes four specific aims: 1) improve the infrastructure and support for clinical and translational research in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont; 2) increase translational and clinical research capacity and efficacy by establishing collaborative and synergistic transdisciplinary research partnerships among the NNE-CTR institutions, aided by a vigorous Pilot Projects program; 3) establish innovative training, mentoring and professional development programs to develop clinical and translational scientists at the NNE-CTR institutions; and 4) provide the infrastructure to support community practices and practice-based primary care research networks, particularly in rural areas, to engage clinical, community, public health and other stakeholders in the development and conduct of research relevant to the clinical and population health needs of northern New England. To achieve these aims, NNE-CTR will establish the following Key Component Activities: Administrative Core; Pilot Projects Program; Professional Development Core; Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Core; Rural Health Research and Delivery Core; Translational Research Technologies Core; and the Tracking and Evaluation Core. In summary, by developing the capabilities and resources required for research spanning the broad spectrum of clinical and translational science, the NNE- CTR will provide the platform for enhancing clinical research and health care delivery to support the unique needs of rural northern New England."
"9385794","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the United States, which in many cases can lead to speech impairment that creates barriers to participation in professional, social, and family settings. Aphasia is the most common type of post-stroke speech impairment that has profound consequences for the patients and results in diminished ability to comprehend, produce and control speech. While recovery can be promoted with speech treatment, improvement remains modest and typically requires a large amount of therapy which contributes to rising health care costs. A major shortcoming of currently existing treatment approaches is that they have focused on enhancing the outcome measures associated speech production, without taking into account that targeting deficits in sensory feedback processing of speech may significantly increase treatment efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, a key step toward refining treatment strategies is to develop objective biomarkers that can probe the integrity of sensorimotor mechanisms of speech and identify their impaired function in patients with post-stroke aphasia. This proposed project is significant because it takes the first step toward exploring the behavioral and neuroanatomical biomarkers of impaired sensorimotor processing, with focus on understanding the critical role of auditory feedback mechanisms for speech production in aphasia. The career development plan combines the candidate's former research training with expertise of the mentoring team to meet the goals of the proposed project. The research and training plans provide an empirical foundation for the proposed project and will allow the candidate to establish a translational line of research as an independent investigator to study the behavioral and neural bases of speech sensorimotor impairment in stroke patients with aphasia. This project aims to use the behavioral biomarkers of altered auditory feedback (AAF) combined with neuroimaging data to identify the patterns of brain damage and diminished structural connectivity within the auditory-motor areas of the left hemisphere that predict impaired sensorimotor processing of speech in aphasia. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a model that relates patterns of brain damage to sensorimotor deficits causing speech impairment. The main objective of this proposal is to identify behavioral and neuroanatomical biomarkers that characterize deficits in sensorimotor mechanisms of speech. The central hypothesis is that damages to auditory-motor network will impair speakers' ability to detect and/or correct for AAF-induced speech errors. We also hypothesize that the patterns of damage will predict the degree of diminished speech error processing, as indexed by the AAF biomarkers. The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying the source of sensorimotor deficit will improve diagnosis and targeted treatment of speech disorders in aphasia. The proposed research is relevant to that part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will potentially help to reduce the burdens of human disability."
"9312801","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This R01 application, over its funded cycles, articulated and substantiated the thesis that the inducible heme- degrading enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), protects against AKI induced by ischemia-reperfusion (IR), heme proteins, and inflammation; this R01 also demonstrated that HO-1 and its products protect against hypertensive and vascular injury. Evidence is emerging that 1) intracellular and extracellular levels of heme, a nephrotoxin, are increased in AKI, thereby providing one of the final common pathways for AKI; and 2) the paradigm exemplified by HO-1 applies to other heme-related proteins: namely, HO-1 is the forerunner for a family of proteins that are not only of pathophysiologic significance beyond heme metabolism, but may provide new therapeutic strategies for AKI. This renewal focuses on 3 such heme-related proteins: hemopexin (HPX), the high-affinity, heme-binding protein; HO-2, the constitutive heme-degrading protein; and haptoglobin (Hp), the high-affinity, hemoglobin-binding protein. Aim #1 tests the hypothesis that HPX is an inducible, heme- binding protectant against AKI. The effects of HPX protein and genetic deficiency of HPX, singly and in combination, will be examined in: 1) cisplatin-induced and IR-induced AKI; 2) heme-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation, and cisplatin-induced apoptosis; and 3) heme-induced inflammation, the latter involving TLR4 signaling. Aim #2 hypothesizes that constitutive HO-2 is an unrecognized protectant against AKI. Using HO-2-/- mice, this aim will examine whether the absence of the restraining effect of HO-2 exaggerates heme/NF-kB-dependent, inflammatory responses, and the extent to which TLR4 is involved. The role of HO-2 in suppressing heme-driven discharge of the inflammatory and vasoactive constituents of the Weibel-Palade Bodies (WPBs) will be examined. This aim will also determine whether HO-2 deficiency exacerbates vascular behavior in AKI, and whether a product of HO, namely CO, attenuates such effects. Aim #3 hypothesizes that haptoglobin (Hp) is an inducible protectant against AKI. Hp is now known to possess antioxidant effects, besides its binding of hemoglobin. Aim #3 will examine whether Hp-/- mice exhibit increased sensitivity to IR-induced AKI and the capacity of Hp protein to reduce such sensitivity, focusing on the antioxidant actions of Hp; the efficacy of Hp in interrupting the prooxidant effects of heme in vitro will also be testd. Finally, this aim will examine whether mutant Hp 2-2 mice, expressing a disease-prone human genotype, exhibit increased sensitivity to IR-induced AKI due to impaired antioxidant actions of Hp 2-2. In summary, this application explores 3 novel, renal protective pathways and elucidates the importance of: heme as a common pathway for AKI and the role of heme-binding as a protective strategy; constitutive heme- degrading mechanisms in protecting against AKI; heme, by activating TLR4, as a novel damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP); heme as a agonist for release of WPBs in AKI; and Hp, a protein in use or considered for use in human disease, as a novel, broadly applicable, but as yet untested therapy for AKI."

"9291473","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The intestinal epithelium exhibits a remarkable ability to self-renew owing to the continuous proliferation and differentiation of two postulated intestina stem cell (ISC) populations. Crypt base columnar cells (CBCs) are thought to actively cycle and express the surface cell marker LGR5, whereas the +4 cells are a quiescent population that expresses transcription factors such as BMI1 and HOPX. Much of the current knowledge about ISC regulation and response comes from studies of radiation-injury models in mice where ISCs themselves are damaged. It remains unknown how ISCs respond to damage at other sites within the intestinal epithelium such as might occur following exposure to rotavirus (RV) infection, which damages epithelial cells at the villus tip. Understanding the role of proliferatin ISCs in response to RV infection is significant for advancing scientific knowledge on stem cell regulation as well as promoting future application of this knowledge to treat epithelial injury through regeneration. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to identify how ISC populations respond to RV-mediated damage to the human intestinal epithelium. I hypothesize that RV-infected cells mediate a crosstalk to the proliferative compartment, inducing the plasticity of ISCs and the activation of a subpopulation of +4 cells, which ultimately leads to the restoration of the intestinal epithelium. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data demonstrating that RV infection can affect ISC function in vivo and in vitro. Using the novel, human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) as a model, I propose [1] to identify the signaling pathways that link RV infection to ISC proliferation, and [2] to examine the ISC plasticity that is induced y RV infection. The results from the proposed project are expected to significantly advance our current understanding of ISC response to damage and deliver new insights on the pathways regulating intestinal epithelial homeostasis."

This will be achieved by providing congruent mentored learning experience to an additional cadre of URM faculty pursuing careers aiming at cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction through implementation of translational behavioral models. The Institute commences with a 2-week didactic program (Summer I), followed by on-going consultation with a Mentoring Team, monthly webinars, a mid-year meeting to present work in progress and scientific findings, and ending with a 1- week follow-up program (Summer II). The initial 2-week didactic sessions focus on methodology, biostatistics, ethical conduct in research, behavioral medicine and sleep disorders topics, and intensive grant writing workshops. The 1-week follow-up program provides URM mentees with opportunities for one-on-one interactions with NHLBI staff; participation in NIH Mock Study Section; and proposal critiques by peers. In partnership with distinguished investigators at NYU School of Medicine and NHLBI staff, we will implement and evaluate the Institute throughout the 4-year plan. Together with the Coordination Core, we will implement proven methods to evaluate the Institute and to track mentees' progress for 5 years post program completion. Outcomes will include: 1) number of professional presentations and peer-reviewed publications; 2) academic leadership positions; 3) career awards; and 4) federal and non-federal grants. Mentees' characteristics (self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, resilience, stereotype threat, and social/family support) predicting academic success will be measured pre and post enrollment. The specific aims are: 1) to select qualified junior URM faculty with great potential to contribute to current knowledge of translational behavioral models utilized to reduce risk of CV-related diseases; 2) to increase mentees' knowledge, skills, and motivation to pursue a career in translational behavioral sciences through intensive research training; 3) to provide continuous congruent mentorship to mentees and to facilitate their transition into independent investigators; 4) to provide mentees with intensive individualized training and guidance in grant writing and to acquaint them with the NIH review process; and 5) to evaluate effectiveness of the Institute ensuring milestones are achieved in timely manner. The Co-Directors will work directly with the Coordination Core to execute institute's programmatic activities, implement program evaluation plan, monitoring mentees' progress during enrollment, and tracking mentees' academic achievements. The BSM PRIDE Institute will address a critical deficiency in the academic workforce by training and mentoring junior URM faculty to develop independent academic careers in translational behavioral medicine. Successful completion of this Institute will establish a network of 36 well- trained URM faculty, applying proven methods to improve health equity in disparity communities."

A central component of the Core is the development of ten semi-annual workshops, involving invited experts, project investigators, and public users of the data, to examine integrative pathways using complex methods and shared measures, targeted toward fully exploiting the multiwave, multi-cohort MIDUS data. Specifically, the core will: (1) promote maximal use of complex multi-faceted MIDUS longitudinal data. We will take advantage of new scientific opportunities afforded by the expanded panel data, while simultaneously attending to the temporal flow of data collected across MIDUS projects, including comprehensive survey and cognitive assessments, and daily diary, in-depth biomarker, neuroimaging, gene expression, and cytokine array data; (2) facilitate cross-project, interdisciplinary investigations. Working with the project leaders, invited experts and public users, the Core will conduct workshops to explore promising analytic strategies for quantifying profiles of reactivity and recovery, using data from the biomarker (e.g., heart rate variability, salivary cortisol), neuroscience (e.g., neural activity assessed with fMRI), and daily diary (e.g., daily stress) projects. and (3) integrate and coordinate analyses with other major longitudinal studies. We will focus on studies capturing a broad range of birth cohorts, enabling comparisons of health processes and outcomes across a range of sociohistorical contexts. We will exploit MIDUS investigators' and External Advisor Board Members' deep knowledge of other studies with which they are associated, including the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), Health and Retirement Study (HRS), Integrated Analysis of Longitudinal Studies of Aging (IALSA), National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), and other seminal data resources on aging. Taken together, the Core will provide investigators with state-of-the-art tools and methods to fulfill the specific aims of the research projects and achieve the highest scientific standards."
"9296183","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Project Summary/Abstract Although there is a cadre of experienced investigators in Puerto Rico who have made significant contributions to the field of HIV/AIDS, the research workforce needs to be sustained, diversified and further prepared to respond to the challenges faced by people living with HIV. The University of Puerto Rico Mentoring Institute for HIV and Mental Health Research is mainly concerned with providing adequate support to the research workforce, from a developmental perspective. It provides mentees with the adequate context and resources for their development into successful researchers, by offering group and individually tailored support and mentoring. It is also responsible for guaranteeing that there is a well-trained, diverse and interested group of researchers in the pipeline in order to sustain and advance knowledge to respond to the complexities of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In the new cycle, we propose to: a) mentor at least six minority junior investigators/mentees (per year), affiliated to health professions' institutions in the Island, to participate in HIV and mental health/behavioral research; b) increase the research skills, self-efficacy and interest among a new cadre of junior investigators/mentees by offering a comprehensive research competency-based education program geared to increase their competiveness, research productivity and ability to network with the HIV research community; c) place the mentees as research collaborators in ongoing research ventures and projects according to their level of skills and area of interest; and d) facilitate and monitor the involvement of the mentees in existing research networks of national and international scope according to their area of interest. The fulfillment of these four aims should increase the number and quality of junior investigators engaged in HIV and mental health research. The mentees will be able to manage existing data, conceptualize and carry out sub-studies with retrospective and prospective research designs, develop and assess implementations based on research evidence. They will also understand the intricacies of networking to enhance, disseminate and increase the impact of their research as they transition to a successful research career. We believe that these components are key for the comprehensive development of an investigator. They complement each other in facilitating core and cross-cutting skills and competences needed to pursue and sustain a successful research career. Each component will be evaluated to assess performance, outcomes and effectiveness."
"9307881","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will use structural biology tools to investigate DNA-processing enzymes from human pathogens, and those relevant to genome integrity or disease process. An area of particular interest is the mechanism of retrovirus integration by the viral integrase (IN), which forms a multimeric complex with both ends of the linear viral DNA genome and captures a cellular target DNA for concerted insertions of the viral DNA termini. The IN-viral DNA complex formed by HIV-1 IN is the target of a class of antiviral drugs called IN strand-transfer inhibitors. Therefore, a better understanding of the IN-DNA interactions is important for improving the clinically used IN inhibitors as well as designing next-generation inhibitors. We are pursuing crystal structures of IN-DNA complexes from HIV-1 and closely related retroviruses, and structure of those in complex with the host co- factor LEDGF/p75. Our preliminary data suggest that the architectures of the multimeric IN complex containing viral and target DNA molecules are distinct between the extensively characterized prototype foamy virus and other retroviruses with smaller 3-domain INs, including Rous sarcoma virus and HIV-1. Besides retrovirus INs, we are interested in the bacterial and pox viral enzymes responsible for regenerating the hairpin telomeres of linear chromosomes by resolving concatemeric replication intermediates. We also study enzymes involved in cleaning damaged DNA ends for error-free repair by end-joining. Through studies of these systems, we intend to learn novel principles in DNA-protein interactions and obtain structural information that can aid in inhibitor development or design of useful engineered enzymes."
"9309218","Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Thrombus The goal of this renewal proposal is to translate a recently developed fibrin-specific positron emission tomography (PET) probe, termed 64Cu-FBP8, for direct imaging of thrombus in patients. Thrombus plays a central role in a range of pathologies including ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis. The detection of thrombus with modern imaging techniques generally relies on the presence of filling defects, which are highly non-specific. Here we hypothesize that targeted molecular imaging of thrombus can be successfully performed in humans with a PET-detectable radiolabeled peptide. We further hypothesize that the accuracy of the probe will allow the presence/absence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage (LAA) to be imaged noninvasively. The current gold standard for the detection of LAA thrombus in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is transesophageal echo (TEE). While the experience with TEE is extensive, it is semi-invasive, requires sedation and prolonged monitoring, and does not prospectively identify patients with LAA thrombus before presentation to the hospital. A noninvasive alternative to TEE could improve patient comfort, streamline care, facilitate risk assessment in patients with AF and guide anti-coagulant management. This application, seeks to address this need through the clinical translation of 64Cu-FBP8for the detection of LAA thrombus in AF. In Aim 1 we will assess the pharmacokinetics, distribution, and elimination of 64Cu-FBP8 in healthy volunteers to establish safety, radiochemical dose, and to estimate an optimal time for thrombus imaging. In Aim 2 we will determine the accuracy of 64Cu-FBP8 PET to detect LAA thrombus in patients with AF, using recent TEE scans as the gold standard. In Aim 3 we will prospectively image AF patients to establish the negative predicative value of 64Cu-FBP8 PET and its potential as a noninvasive alternative to TEE. To further the utility of 64Cu-FBP8 and to enable its use at other sites, in Aim 4 we will develop a sterile kit formulation that will make the widespread production of 64Cu-FBP8 feasible. The proposed research will translate a new molecular imaging agent into humans and lay the foundation for subsequent multicenter trials. The burden of AF is increasing rapidly and the noninvasive detection of LAA thrombosis is a large and unmet need. The proposed research is thus of major relevance to both clinical medicine and general population health."
"9506097","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Delineation of the signaling mechanisms that guide the differentiation and selection of germinal center B cells remains a challenging topic. From a genetic approach, the ability to selectively modify genes in germinal center B cells has only recently been achieved. Moreover, germinal center B cells represent a small and transient subset of B cells that are difficult to maintain or expand in vitro. Nonetheless, it is imperative o develop new approaches to study this subset as it is becoming clear that activation and differentiation characteristics of more abundant naïve recirculating B cells are not representativ of the heterogeneous germinal center B cell compartment. Herein we will focus on the NIK/IKK1 axis, which we have found to be required for germinal center formation, but the downstream functional targets are unidentified. Here we will utilize cutting edge mass cytometry, imaging cytometry, specialized in vitro cultures and conditional gene targeting to dissect the individual and combined roles of NIK and IKK1 in germinal center B cell differentiation. These studies will provide novel insights into the signal transduction pathways accounting for the generation of high-affinity memory B cells and plasma cells, as well as a better understanding of how dysregulation of NIK/IKK1 signaling promotes multiple myeloma and lymphomagenesis"
"9369690","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Imaging plays a vital role in the research programs of many AECC members. The Analytical Imaging Facility (AIF) makes routine and complex imaging technologies available to the entire AECC community. Microscope technology ranges from traditional brightfield, to epi-fluorescence, to laser scanning confocal, to high resolution transmission and scanning electron microscopy including cryoEM of macromolecules in this truly comprehensive shared resource. This wide range of imaging modalities allows for the study of animal models of disease. Cells expressing or labeled with fluorescent reporter molecules may be imaged in the whole animal, whole organ, single cell or cell compartments. Live cells may be imaged in real time to monitor physiological processes. Photo-activatable fluorescence molecules may be manipulated by light for dynamic in vivo studies. Confocal microscopes and epi-fluorescence paired with deconvolution enables 3D imaging of fixed material or 4D imaging of live cells. Traditional ultrastructure analysis by transmission electron microscopy is expanded to 3D by electron tomography. The recent installation of a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) has expanded the facility's SEM capabilities to include automated large area mapping, 3D image reconstruction, x-ray microanalysis, correlative fluorescence and SEM imaging and imaging frozen hydrated samples. AIF staff assist users in experimental design, data collection, quantitative image analysis and presentation. New users are taught imaging techniques required for their specific research objective, while experienced users may customize any imaging station, utilizing the facility's large inventory of optics and accessories. The facility offers customized full service sample preparation for electron microscopy, to ensure quality control and to offer the widest range of techniques. The AIF staff has the expertise to prepare samples by methods that include chemical fixation, embedding in resin, ultrathin sectioning, immunogold labeling and negative staining. The facility offers a full range of low temperature techniques for electron microscopy including quick freezing by plunge, metal mirror or high pressure freezing. Frozen samples can undergo freeze-substitution, freeze fracture, rotary shadow or cryosectioning and are then imaged in the TEM or SEM at ambient or low temperature. The AIF provides support for the microscopy requirements of the Molecular Cytogenetics and Histopathology Shared Resources. Since the last CCSG review, important new additions of equipment, personnel and services have been made, which have substantially enhanced the imaging capabilities at AECC."
"9391802","Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) can include growth deficiency that is not attributable to parental height, gestational age, or poor nutrition. Recent studies on the gut microbiome indicate that perturbations in the population dynamics of the gut bacteria early in life can have deleterious consequences on the host including failure to thrive and other sequelae typically associated with poor nutrition throughout life. The impact of an altered microbiota can negate efforts to overcome these deficiencies with improved nutrition. Alcohol consumption has been demonstrated to alter the ratios of defined bacterial genera in adults. Since newborn babies adopt the flora of the birth mother, it is likely that neonates at high risk for a FASD have an altered gut microbiome that ultimately translates to poor nutrition given the importance of gut bacteria in processing certain food products and generating dietary needs. Gut bacteria also play a crucial role in promoting immunologic homeostasis. Alterations in bacterial populations may result in less down-regulatory IL-25 production by epithelial cells and increased proinflammatory T cells. The role of the gut microbiome in FASD associated immunological based diseases and failure to thrive has been understudied. We hypothesize newborn rats exposed to alcohol in utero will develop altered gut microbiota upon delivery compared to control rat pups and that this altered microbiota will contribute to delayed growth and immune dysregulation. To test this hypothesis we propose to 1) Compare the gut microbiota of female rats before and after chronic consumption of alcohol, and analyze the gut microbiota of their pups over time to determine if they adopt the flora of the mother. Additionally, we will determine if the flora is distinct from that of pups born to control dams not receiving alcohol. 2) Compare the intestinal immune features from pups exposed to alcohol in utero to control pups to determine if alcohol exposure results in reduced regulatory immune system elements and an increase in proinflammatory markers and T cells. 3) Identify bacterial profiles in the gut microbiota associated with failure to thrive and/or immune dysregulation and determine if these conditions can be treated by therapeutic application of probiotics designed to match the colonic flora of pups born to control dams. Future studies could readily be applied to human subjects if these studies in animals provide a sound premise for clinical investigation."
"9211586","Project Summary/Abstract  Bullying, or more broadly peer victimization, is a wide-spread epidemic impacting the health of our youth today. Although there has been significant work focused on studying peer victimization and its impact on mental health outcomes including feelings of depression and suicidal ideation, few studies have examined these processes among rural and American Indian (AI) youth ? populations that have evident disparities both in risk for peer victimization as well as poor mental health outcomes. Even more, the studies that have examined peer victimization trajectories and associated outcomes have primarily taken a deficits-based focus, identifying cumulative risk and informing intervention efforts of the need to decrease negative behaviors. Critical to driving this field forward is working to understand the variations in peer victimization risk given the presence of protective factors occurring parallel with these trajectories. In light of this need, the goal of the proposed project is to identify distinct trajectories of peer victimization and relevant protective factors present for rural and AI youth and to examine the impact these early trajectories have on mental health outcomes from late childhood to early adolescence.  The proposed project will utilize advanced person-centered modeling to identify distinct classes of rural and AI youth who may be at higher or lower risk for adverse outcomes based on their co-occurring levels of peer victimization and relevant protective factors. Importantly, the second focus of the proposed project will be to examine the association between these subgroups of youth at varying levels or risk or resilience and the impact it has on feelings of depression, loneliness, and suicidal ideation. Fourth and fifth grade students will be recruited from four highly rural school districts with student populations of nearly 40% American Indian. Data will be collected over three time points to provide longitudinal information on the developmental trajectories of student's peer relationships and potential protective factors.  This work is highly significant given its specific focus on early trajectories of protective and risk factors consistently associated with later suicidal ideations and behaviors. It is novel in its longitudinal, person- centered approach to examining parallel (simultaneously, within the same model) risk and protective trajectories specifically among rural and AI youth. Our project outcomes will help define critical aspects needed for the creation of new intervention efforts specific to these communities and cultures."
"9320725","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I system is critical for all phases of human development, growth, and maturation. While it is well established that IGF-1 production is highly dependent on growth hormone (GH) during postnatal life, mechanisms of regulation are still poorly understood, as reflected by the 1-2% children who drop below the normal growth curves, many of whom respond poorly to GH (including therapeutic GH) and are IGF-1 deficient. GH regulates the production of IGF-1 primarily through activation of the GH receptor (GHR) signaling cascades. The identification of rare mutations of STAT5B (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B) in children who resembled patients carrying GHR defects, with severe postnatal growth failure, GH insensitivity (GHI) and severe IGF deficiency (IGFD), confirmed the critical importance of STAT5b, over that of the STAT1, 3 and 5a signaling pathways, in IGF-1 production and human growth. Patients with STAT5b deficiency, moreover, also presented with histories of immune dysregulation, indicating the importance of STAT5b in many cytokine systems. These clinical presentations of a STAT5b deficiency state are unique to humans. Of note, the presence of the closely related STAT5a (which shares >90% similarity with STAT5b at the protein level) could not compensate for human loss of STAT5b functions, thereby providing the first compelling in vivo evidence for human STAT5b and STAT5a as having distinct and non-redundant functions despite their high degree of identity.  The hypothesis of this proposal, based on clinical observations, is that GH regulation of IGF-1 production in humans is mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, through STAT5b. This proposal will address how STAT5b transduces GH signals to regulate IGF-1 production by investigating molecular mechanisms of STAT5b actions, from structure/function to cell signaling, and their relationship to clinical endocrinology and immunology, using identified mutations as human functional knockouts. The Specific Aims will (1) decipher the specificity of human GHR-STAT5b structural interactions, the critical first step in regulating IGF-1 production; (2) delineate STAT5b properties necessary for IGF-1 production from those necessary for immune functions; (3) determine whether cross talk with other cytokine signaling pathways modulate STAT5b- dependent activation IGF-1 production. Humanized mouse model can then be generated to recapitulate the human STAT5b deficiency condition. Exome sequence analysis of unresolved clinical cases of severe IGFD with immune deficiencies has revealed potential new mechanisms of modulating STAT5b actions. At the conclusion of these studies, this proposal will have identified and confirmed the mechanism(s) for specificity of GHR-STAT5b interactions, identified new mechanism(s) for modulating STAT5b activation and regulation of IGF-1 production, and identified new targets for analyzing GHI and IGFD syndromes. In the long term, these results will provide the basis for improved diagnosis and therapy management of affected children."

"9302563","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many survivors of brain injury have persistent impairment of hand function despite receiving conventional therapy.  The long-term goal of this research project is to augment and direct the brain's inherent plasticity to improve motor function for survivors of traumatic or ischemic brain injury.  Functional improvement after brain injury correlates with an enlarged area of cerebral cortex corresponding to the improved movement (motor map), but it is unclear if the enlarged map causes improved function.  This question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of recovery from brain injuries.  Brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which enable subjects to use their brain signals to directly control external devices, can induce plastic changes in the brain's activity.  Thus, a BMI could provide a powerful tool to drive plasticity in injured brains and also test the effects of map enlargement on function.  However, important gaps in our knowledge remain about what aspects of BMI training are critical to enhancing cortical plasticity, including 1) the types and features of neural signals used to control the BMI, 2) the temporal precision with which somatosensory (haptic) feedback must be synchronized with motor intent, and 3) the spatial precision of movement intent (e.g., individual finger vs.  whole hand) used to control the BMI.  The objectives of this proposal are to determine the aspects of BMIs most important to changing motor maps, and the extent to which motor map expansion driven by BMIs improves function.  By expanding the map, the control of muscles that have by paralyzed by brain injury can be moved to areas of cortex that still retain intact descending connections, thus restoring function.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that optimally driving plasticity and motor map changes is critically dependent on simultaneously activating motor intent and haptic feedback.  We propose that high-frequency signals will enable much greater spatiotemporal precision than the low frequencies used in BMIs for rehabilitation to date.  We will test this hypothesis in subjects who have had hemicraniectomies for traumatic brain injury via these specific aims:  1) Determine the extent to which high-frequency based BMI training drives motor map enlargement and improves hand function, and 2) Determine the role of synchrony between motor intent and haptic feedback in driving changes in map size and hand function.  This proposal's innovative use of scalp signals over the hemicraniectomy will enable us to record high-resolution, high-bandwidth signals non-invasively and test our hypothesis.  Achieving our objectives will be significant because it will improve the design of BMI training paradigms by identifying spectral, temporal, and spatial features that are critical to plasticity enhancement.  We expect this proposal to define the ability of BMIs to create changes in motor maps.  We also expect it to help define the relationship between motor map changes and functional recovery.  Finally, it will demonstrate the potential for functional improvement in future studies using minimally-invasive, epidural-based BMIs after brain injury."
"9353440","Project Summary Structural Basis of APOBEC Functions and Interactions with HIV-Vif The APOBEC (Apolioprotein B mRNA-editing Enzyme Catalytic polypeptide) family of cytidine deaminases deaminate are found only in vertebrates and all APOBEC3 subfamily proteins are found only in primates. By deaminating the cytidine to cause mutation to uridine on DNA/RNA, APOBEC enzymes achieve remarkably diverse cellular functions through specific targeting to the intented ssDNA or RNA through a combination of regulations including spatial and temporal and substrate specificity. For example, APOBEC1 (A1) specifically modigy the mRNA of a protein that play a role in cholestoral metabolism; AID, another member of APOBEC family, is required for antibody maturation process including somatic hypermutation and recombination class switch; APOBEC2 (A2) is involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle development; and A3 proteins, a subfamily contains seven members (AA-H), can restrict foreign and internal nucleic acids that poses danger to the genome integrity, which include internal retroelements and transposons as well as external retroviruses and otherinfectious viral pathogens, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) . For retroviruses like HIV viruses to overcome the anti-HIV activity of APOBEC enyzmes, they encode a protein called Vif (virus virulent factor) that specifically bind to and inactivate APOBEC enzymes through unbuquitination degradation parthway. Even though their deamination activity is the key to excercute their biological functions, APOBEC enzymes can accidental mutations when proper regulations are not in place, which could lead to human deseases such as immune difficiency and cancer. Our long- term goals are to understand the structural/functional relationship for APOBEC cellular function and their anti-viral activity. Our specific aims are to understand the structural basis of APOBEC's functions and and the mechanisms that underlie substrate specificity and anti-HIV and anti-viral activities, with particular focuses on the APOBEC3 subfamily members that have strong anti- retroelements and anti-HIV activities. The outcome of this proposed research will provide valuable information for understanding the molecular details of the APOBEC enzyme family and the mechanisms of substrate specificity, which can be used for the potential drug development to provide therapy for HIV/AIDS, immune disorders, and other diseases such as cancer."

Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden). These Programs are supported by fifteen Cores, one developing Core (described in Developmental Funds) and a dedicated leadership team."
"9356587","New tools to selectively regulate neurons have revolutionized causal experimentation. Optogenetics provides an array of elements for specific biophysical control, while designer chemogenetic receptors provide a minimally invasive method to control circuits in vivo by peripheral injection. We have developed a strategy for selective regulation of activity in specific cells that integrates opto- and chemo-genetic approaches, and thus allows manipulation of neuronal activity over a range of spatial and temporal scales in the same experimental animal. Light-sensing molecules (opsins) are activated by biologically produced light through luciferases upon peripheral injection of a small molecule, which crosses the blood-brain barrier. Such BioLuminescence-driven OptoGenetics (?BL-OG?) is a minimally invasive method like chemogenetics, but one that leverages the full array of bioluminescent and optogenetic options. Importantly, BL-OG allows conventional fiber optic activation while at the same time providing chemogenetic access to the same sensors. This opens, in principle, the entire optogenetic toolbox for complementation by a chemogenetic dimension. Further, because different forms of luciferases use non-cross reactive luciferins, multiple distinct effects can be independently and conjointly controlled in the same animal. We demonstrated proof of concept for this technology by using fusion proteins that directly link Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) to opsins, creating luminescent opsins (luminopsin, LMO). Here, we describe our next steps to increase the benefit of this technology for the field. We will expand the range of BL-OG options, increase their potency, and systematically quantify BL-OG impact in vitro and in vivo. In Aim I, we will generate new luciferases with increased light emission and luciferase/luciferin pairs with non- overlapping substrates to allow multiplexing. In Aim II, we will develop an extended toolkit of luciferase-opsin combinations and test their efficacy in vitro. In Aim III, we will validate and quantify the efficacy of bioluminescence activation of neural circuits in vivo by and directly compare stimulation of LMOs versus fiber optics versus DREADDs. Reflecting the basic science and clinical importance of BL-OG and the expertise of the investigators, we will use defined networks in neocortex and thalamus targeted with viral vectors expressing activating and silencing LMOs and DREADDs. The overall outcome of our work will be the optimization and validation of a novel, highly flexible tool set for bimodal optogenetic and chemogenetic interrogation of neuronal circuits in living animals. The proposed work will give the neuroscience community new molecules and comparative data to aid in making an informed decision when choosing among the various tools that may meet their specific experimental needs."

"9354257","Abstract Protein aggregation is a hallmark of diverse neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer, Huntington and Parkinson Diseases (AD, HD and PD) which will be studied in this Program Project, but little is known about the role of aggregates in neurotoxicity or clinical manifestations. Different brain regions are affected in each disease, underlying their distinctive pathologies, and different diagnostic proteins are detected immunologically for each (presumably reflecting distinct proteins that initiate or feed aggregates due to their high abundance or post-synthetic modifications in the vulnerable tissue). Increasingly, however, proteins ?characteristic? of one neuropathy have been detected in other disease aggregates, leading us to the hypothesis that a common aggregation mechanism is involved. To learn what features cause proteins to coalesce with the ?seed proteins? (i. e., the mutated and/or misfolded protein that initiates aggregation), we propose a systematic proteomic comparison of aggregates purified from affected tissue of each disease, using unaffected tissue from patients and corresponding areas of normal brain as controls. Our preliminary proteomic analyses show that immuno- affinity for tau or A? allows isolation of two distinctive types of aggregates, which nevertheless share many proteins in common. Aggregates derived from AD vs. age-matched-control (AMC) hippocampus differ strikingly in protein composition, whether they bind tau or A? antibodies. These results are supported by images showing co-localization of proteins by immunohistochemical and proximity-ligation methods, and by C. elegans models of AD in which orthologs of identified AD-aggregate proteins contribute functionally to aggregation and associated traits. In Aim 1, proteomic analyses of proteins (and their most common modifications) from AD, PD, HD and AMC tissues will enable us to seek features common to two or three diseases or unique to each. We will also seek ?leading indicators? of AD, in individuals at highest risk (based on ApoE4 alleles, age or Down Syndrome) and in 3xTg-AD mice prior to overt AD pathology. We will then analyze aggregates from various cell and worm models, to prioritize these based on their similarity to the disease aggregates they mimic. In Aim 2, we will identify cross-linked peptides from aggregates, defining protein:protein contacts that Project 1 will attempt to confirm by immuno-stain colocalization, and by proximity-ligation PCR. These results will guide molecular-dynamic modeling of aggregate formation, in which we can assess the energies (??E and ??G) driving and stabilizing protein accretion, and test the effects of mutating putative contact residues. Key aggregate proteins seen in multiple diseases (Aim 1) will be tested for functional roles and pathways employed, using RNAi in neuroblastoma cells (SY5Y-APP) and worm models. NSAID-derived compounds from Core D will be screened in Aim 3 for protection of SY5Y-APP cells from aggregation and associated neurotoxicity, with secondary testing in nematode models. Moreover, drugs rationally designed by Core D to disrupt protein:protein interactions, as defined in Aim 2, will be tested for efficacy in the same model systems."
"9298374","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the current application is to understand the neurobiological mechanisms that help confer pathological behaviors like enhanced negative affect following ethanol physical dependence. Recent studies suggest that intrinsic lateral/basolateral amygdala (BLA) GABAergic neurons tightly control the expression of negative emotions including those expressed during withdrawal following chronic ethanol exposure. Dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmentum/substantia nigra pars compacta have been shown to regulate this GABAergic system and disinhibit BLA principal neurons which drive the expression of anxiety-like behaviors. Based on strong preliminary evidence, our proposed experiments will test the central hypothesis that ethanol dependence dis-inhibits BLA output by dysregulating dopaminergic modulation of these GABAergic neurons. We will test our central hypothesis and accomplish our overall goal by utilizing a well- established rat model of chronic ethanol exposure and by integrating optogenetic, pre- and post-synaptic dopamine neurophysiology, and behavioral experimental approaches. The BLA has been extensively implicated as an important regulatory component of the neural circuitry controlling both anxiety-like behavior during withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure as well as reward-seeking in drug-naïve and -exposed animals. Specific Aim 1 will test our central hypothesis hypothesis by examining presynaptic dopamine function during withdrawal from ethanol dependence. We will directly measure DA release and reuptake in vitro by integrating in vitro fast-scan cyclic voltammetry with optogenetic control of DA release and chronic ethanol exposure. We hypothesize that, based on our previous publications, chronic ethanol exposure will differentially modulate basal or `tonic' DA levels and phasic DA release to ultimately enhance DA signaling. Specific Aim 2 will examine how postsynaptic DA receptor function is altered in the BLA using in vitro whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology with innovative optogenetic approaches to measure postsynaptic DA receptor signaling. Our working hypothesis is that ethanol physical dependence will increase postsynaptic D1- and D2-like DA receptor signaling such that DA-mediated inhibition of GABAergic function is up-regulated. Specific Aim 3 will place the detailed cellular effects of dependence on DA signaling within a whole-animal context by integrating optogenetic control of DA release with in vivo measures of BLA-dependent behaviors. Our working hypothesis is that dependence-related changes in dopamine neurotransmission and signaling ultimately control withdrawal-dependent anxiety-like behavior. The proposed work employs a unique and highly integrated experimental approach to provide unparalleled insight into the neurobiological mechanisms governing the negative reinforcing effects of chronic ethanol exposure. Ultimately, these studies will provide insight into potential cellular mechanisms governing abuse and relapse in human alcoholics."
"9310070","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall UTMB plans to establish a nationally and internationally recognized center with the theme of Development of Medications and Biologics for Treatment of the Pregnant Patient and the Fetus. The overarching Center goal is to accelerate FDA approval of medications, biologics, and therapeutic modalities for treatment of the pregnant patient and/or her fetus. This goal will be achieved by 2 major objectives: (A) support, expand, and diversify the teams of investigators by recruitment, education, and training of junior faculty in the field of obstetric-fetal pharmacology and (B) augment the existing environment, tools, and infrastructure for clinical and translational projects. Our success is due,  in part, to the clinical infrastructure present at UTMB, which includes access to a wide, diverse patient population via UTMB's Regional Maternal and Child Health Program as well as the cadre of trained research nurses in Ob/Gyn's Perinatal Research Division. Our translational infrastructure includes the Maternal-Fetal Pharmacology and Biodevelopment Laboratories, with a state-of-the-art analytical center. Clinical studies are supported by translational projects whic are focused on basic science investigations that will improve clinical outcomes. Our strategy is to leverage and expand our existing resources in order to translate knowledge from basic sciences to new treatments and to translate findings from clinical studies into clinical practice. This strategy will be accomplished by the following specific aims: (1) develop an intellectual, procedural, and physical infrastructure that will accelerate the conduct of clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety of medications and other therapies as well as support translational projects to determine molecular mechanisms underlying maternal and fetal exposure to medications and biologics; (2) expand the scope of investigation by recruiting new faculty whose expertise will augment the existing multidisciplinary team and by increasing collaboration with UTMB's Maternal Fetal Medicine Units network, Institute for Translational Sciences, and Center for Biomedical Engineering; and (3) increase the number and quality of researchers in the field of maternal-fetal pharmacology by providing training options for postdoctoral and clinical fellows as well as junior faculty via various tracks of hands-on training 1-on-1 mentoring, formal career development programs, didactic multidisciplinary courses, and postgraduate degrees in basic and clinical sciences. We anticipate that collaborations among and beyond the Center's investigative teams will lead to continued opportunities to synergistically translate new hypotheses, research findings, and clinical studies to improve maternal-fetal outcomes."
"9301597","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, and major advances in clinical care, major health challenges remain that negatively impact public health. Addressing these challenges requires that the biomedical field draw from the broadest talent pool available. Yet, analysis of the trends in the biomedical sciences workforce and trainee pool consistently demonstrate that specific racial and ethnic groups remain underrepresented in this arena relative to their representation within the population of the United States. Therefore, programs that address the discrepancy in participation rates between different racial, ethnic, gender and/or socioeconomic groups, and promote the engagement of the maximum number of talented individuals are needed. In this application, we propose the development of a research education program to alleviate this discrepancy at our institution, the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts. The goals of the proposed program are: to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups, to enhance the retention and progression to candidacy of students from traditionally underrepresented groups, and to enhance the career development of participating students so that they successfully transition to their desired role within the biomedical sciences workforce. To achieve the desired goals, we will employ a multi-faceted approach that includes: 1) Increased involvement of UMMS at national conferences targeted towards trainees from traditionally underrepresented groups as well as the development and enhancement of relationships with undergraduate institutions and training programs that promote the training of students in STEM fields; 2) The implementation of onboarding courses that provide preparation and guidance for the first-year graduate school curriculum; the implementation of a series of workshops that equip students with the tools to successfully navigate the path to PhD candidacy; as well as the establishment of an enhanced advising program that provides one-on-one advising interactions between students and faculty; and 3) The implementation of a series of career development and networking events, including the development and annual revision of an Individual Development Plan, that promote clarity surrounding career goals, the development of a career path, and the acquisition of the scientific communication skills and professional network that facilitate the successful transition to the next phase of the chosen career. The proposed approaches are expected to increase the number of underrepresented students attaining PhD degrees in the biomedical sciences from the University of Massachusetts Medical School. If successful, the proposed approaches may serve as models that can be implemented broadly at institutions around the country."
"9278883","Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) requests continued NIH/NIGMS support for its successful Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (RISE) Program which is about to enter the final year of its second cycle of funding. The overall goal of the PHSU RISE Program is to increase the competitiveness of underrepresented Hispanic students graduating from the Biomedical Sciences Ph.D. program at PHSU in Puerto Rico, and to increase the number of underrepresented students who advance to postdoctoral positions and research-related careers. The PHSU RISE program (12 trainees) had a positive impact on the training of our PhD students and on the entire PSM community during the previous cycles. Since the initiation of the PHSU RISE Program the Ph.D. completion rate has increased from 73% to 83%, the average time to graduation has decreased from 6.2 to 5.7 years, and 89% of RISE trainees have continued with postdoctoral training after graduating. Of the 37 RISE trainees supported 12 have obtained independent fellowships, 19 have graduated with a Ph.D. and 4 have secured faculty positions. Our program tangibly improved and achieved the benchmarks established in our previous cycles of funding. We anticipate that this renewal application will build upon those successes and adapt to several important lessons learned, thus continuing our evolution from an ?excellent? to an ?outstanding? training program. The program proposes to accomplish these goals through enhancement of the academic, research, personal, and professional competence of our underrepresented minority students to better prepare them for careers in the biomedical sciences. The specific measurable objectives of the PHSU RISE program are to provide: (1) professional development and research skills training for PHSU RISE trainees; (2) communication skills training for PHSU RISE trainees; and (3) team building/networking opportunities for PHSU RISE trainees. Each of these objectives will be pursued with a balance of continuing activities that were highly effective as well as a strategic set of new training components that were developed to address the emerging needs of our students. The PHSU RISE program will work in concert with the existing Ponce School of Medicine-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership and RCMI programs to significantly impact the overall research program by providing a better trained student workforce to conduct the funded research projects and provide the momentum to create new research initiatives."
"9288098","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research fulfills the NIAAA's mission to address health disparities by reducing alcohol use and improving academic outcomes in a high-risk population of American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Tribal College and University (TCU) students through implementation and evaluation of a low cost screening and brief intervention (SBI). The Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS), an SBI pioneered and tested by UW investigators on this study, represents a cost effective means to reduce alcohol use. A college- level intervention for policy and systems change will also be tested aimed at: (1) instituting a harm reduction policy that supports a shift from zero tolerance alcohol policies, (2) integrating behavioral health resources for the benefit of high-risk TCU students, and, (3) ensuring TCU SBI implementation fidelity. BASICS has reduced alcohol consumption and consequences in mainstream colleges and this proposal would, using a Community- based Participatory Research approach, provide a cultural contextualization of BASICS and test this intervention for the first time in AIAN TCU students. The specific aims are to adapt, manualize and implement a culturally contextualized version of BASICS: (a) To test whether a culturally appropriate BASICS intervention will surpass a wait list control condition by significantly reducing indices of hazardous or harmful drinking and alcohol-related negative consequences; (b) To test the effect of the intervention in significantly improving retention and academic performance among TCU students; and, (2) Implement a system-level policy intervention moving from zero-tolerance to harm reduction policies at the college-level and providing capacity to integrate services for improved referral and treatment for high risk TCU students to test whether an environmental approach will positively impact the SBI intervention and its outcomes. This study's primary hypothesis is that a culturally contextualized adaptation of SBI, as identified by the TCU/AIHEC/UW partnership, will surpass a wait list control condition in reducing hazardous or harmful drinking and alcohol- related negative consequences and improve academic outcomes, with a significantly greater effect in TCU with the policy intervention."
"9304188","ABSTRACT Amyloids are a class of proteins that spontaneously self-assemble into cross ?-sheet aggregates which have been associated with amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. However, recently, amyloids that are non-toxic and rather play a functional role in a mammalian biosynthetic pathway have been discovered challenging our current views on the sole role of amyloids in mammals to be cytotoxic. Here we propose that amelogenin, the main protein of the developing enamel matrix, adapts cross-? sheet configuration and develops into fibrillar amyloids to achieve structural support to guide mineralization in vivo and in vitro. Enamel, the hardest and most mineralized tissue in the human body, is comprised of a unique organization of apatite nanofibers of about 50 nm in diameter and several hundreds of micrometers in length. There is agreement that the unique crystal morphology and organization into rod and interrod enamel is the result of a protein-guided uniaxial growth process of apatite, but it is unclear by which molecular mechanisms this unique micro- and nanostructure develops. While the role of self-assembly of enamel matrix proteins, in particular amelogenin, has widely been recognized as a crucial factor in controlling the structural development of enamel, a convincing relationship between organic supramolecular aggregates and enamel structure has only recently been observed, when we discovered that the recombinant human full-length amelogenin protein (rH174) forms ribbons of 17 nm in width, which grow to several micrometers in length. Such ribbons have the ability to self- align and form bundles resembling the appearance of aligned apatite crystallites in an enamel rod. Analysis of the primary structure of amelogenin revealed several domains with high propensity to form ?-sheets, including the possibilty to form amyloids, and produced a 14 residue N-terminal peptide (14P2) that readily assembled into nanoribbons (6.7nm wide), with possible amyloid structure. Amyloid stains were positive in enamel from mice lacking the enamel-specific enzyme kallikrein 4 (KLK4). Both enamel tissue and recombinant amelogenin nanoribbons showed x-ray diffraction spacings at 4.7Å characteristic of ? sheets and amyloids. Enzymatic processing of self-assembled amelogenin promoted precise cleavage into the 23 kDa and 20 kDa fragments which resisted further degradation by MMP-20, thus possibly providing a stable organic template for mineralization during secretory stage amelogenesis, whereas the second enamel protease is able to disassemble and to degrade amelogenin amyloids. Herein we will further investigate the presence of amyloids in enamel and propose that amyloids play a key role in the development and organization of the organic matrix of enamel and that an exploration of such structures is essential to our understanding of enamel formation, its diseases and repair."
"9277347","ABSTACT ? RESEARCH CAREER DEVELOPMENT CORE (RCDC)  Basic aging research has begun identifying molecular targets ? and pharmacological modulators of those targets ? that enhance and extend the health of and delay multiple diseases in experimental animals. These exciting discoveries elicit the very real prospect of discovering ways to dramatically improve and extend human health and independence. These advances are particularly timely as demographers agree that the 21st century will see an unprecedented aging of the U.S. population. Given the promise and societal benefits attendant on treatments for basic aging processes, there is now a critical need to train gerontologists and geriatricians who can translate this molecular research into studies that evaluate the extent to which these interventions may improve the quality of later human life.  To address the need, the Research Career Development Core?s (RCDC) primary goal is to train the next generation of geriatrically-oriented translational scientists by weaving together the robust and unique aging research resources and research education programs in South Texas into an integrated enhanced career development environment. This goal directly supports the San Antonio OAIC 3rd overall specific aim.  We plan to support cohorts of three OAIC KL2 Scholars for up to two years at a time. Our RCDC program will enhance the clinical and translational research knowledge and experience of basic scientists, develop mechanistic research skills of clinical investigators, and facilitate collaborations among basic and clinical researchers. To accomplish these ends, we propose 3 specific aims: AIM 1: Oversee the recruitment, selection, monitoring, and evaluation of a diverse multilevel group of OAIC  KL2 scholars, including under-represented minorities, focused on age-modulating drug development  processes, spanning target identification, pre-clinical testing in animals, and human investigations. AIM 2: Provide active multi-disciplinary supervising (mentoring) teams that regularly monitor, evaluate, and  guide the progress of each KL2 Scholar through their research and career development programs.  OAIC KL2 Scholars and their mentors will develop individualized structured research education plans  (with a compact and milestones) based on their investigative needs and focused on cross-training in  translational sciences. AIM 3: Promote cross-fertilization and assure integration of the KL2 Scholars? career development and  RCDC activities with (a) all San Antonio OAIC programs and (b) the national OAIC network. Overall, the aim of the RCDC is to foster development of early-stage investigators with expertise in the basic biology of aging, clinical gerontology, drug development, and drug clinical trial design and management ? who will then have a comprehensive skill set to test aging-modulating interventions in older adults."
"9519199","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Indiana University Diabetes and Obesity Training Program began in 1999 and has been funded for ten years by NIDDK, currently at the level of two pre-doctoral and two post-doctoral trainees. The goal of the program is to provide training to young researchers at an early career stage of their careers, in research that is relevant to diabetes, metabolism, and obesity, an ever growing problem for the health of the nation. The Indiana University School of Medicine is an outstanding forum for such an initiative. Twenty four faculty from six departments will participate as mentors in the program. This group of faculty has a strong training record and has just short of $10M of external funding as PIs, with $3.7M from NIDDK and JDRF. For the upcoming cycle, support for three pre- and two post-doctoral trainees is requested. Pre-doctoral students will take a Minor in Diabetes and Obesity which includes a 3 credit Diabetes and Obesity course that has been recently developed. Post-doctoral fellows will also take the course. Both students and post-doctoral fellows will attend Center for Diabetes Research seminars, will present their results in the same series, and will be encouraged to present their work at national meetings such as the American Diabetes Association scientific sessions. Additionally, they will take a Research Ethics course and a Grant Writing Workshop. The program is sensitive to the issue of diversity and in the past funding cycle has recruited a hispanic and an African American trainee. By training in an environment and culture that gives strong multi-disciplinary support for diabetes research, there is a significant probability that th trainees will sustain an interest in diabetes, even as their specific research interests evolve ove their careers."
"9310075","ABSTRACT?Translational Project  Currently there are no clinically available agents for the prevention of preeclampsia (PE). The beneficial in vivo and in vitro effects of pravastatin (PRA) in reversing several pathophysiologic pathways associated with PE provided the basis for its use in the prevention of PE. The goal of the proposed investigation is to identify and determine the activity of trophoblast transporters and metabolic enzymes that are involved in the placental biodisposition of PRA and define the extent of fetal exposure to PRA.  Recent ex vivo data from our laboratory revealed higher PRA transfer across the placenta than expected from its hydrophilic properties, which suggests the involvement of uptake transporters. Furthermore, transfer of PRA across the dually perfused placental lobule is significantly higher in the Fetal-to-Maternal direction than in the opposite direction, suggesting the involvement of placental efflux transporters. Therefore, it is apparent that the amount of PRA reaching the fetal circulation and, consequently, the extent of fetal exposure to the drug depend on the activity of the uptake and efflux transporters in human placentas. In addition, data from our pilot investigation of PRA pharmacokinetics in pregnant patients revealed that a few patients formed high amounts of its metabolite 3??-isopravastatin (3??-IsoPRA), while others formed low amounts. These data could be explained by patients being fast or slow metabolizers of PRA. Previously, it was suggested that the metabolite is formed by a nonenzymatic, acid-catalyzed transformation of PRA in the stomach, but recent data suggest the involvement of sulfotransferases (SULTs) in the biotransformation of PRA. Since several SULT isoforms are expressed and active in human placentas, it is possible that human placental SULTs are also involved in the metabolism of PRA. Furthermore, the expression and activity of several drug transporters in rat livers were altered by experimentally-induced inflammation. Since pathological changes associated with PE induce an inflammatory cascade, it is possible that PE may also affect the expression and function of placental transporters and metabolic enzymes involved in the biodisposition of PRA.  Therefore, we hypothesize that (1) several placental uptake and efflux transporters as well as SULT enzymes are involved in the biodisposition of PRA and consequently affect the extent of fetal exposure and (2) the expression and activities of these transporters and enzymes in the placenta are affected by the pathological changes/ inflammation associated with preeclampsia. Therefore, Specific aim 1 is to identify and determine the activities of the uptake and efflux transporters involved in the biodisposition of PRA in placentas obtained from uncomplicated pregnancies, Specific aim 2 is to identify and determine the activities of SULT enzymes involved in the biotransformation of PRA in placentas obtained from uncomplicated pregnancies, and Specific aim 3 is to determine the effect of preeclampsia on the activities and mRNA and protein expression of placental transporters and enzymes involved in the transfer and biotransformation of PRA, respectively."
"9316356","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is an experiment of nature that examines the profound effect of contrasting environment on neuroplasticity. Most current views of reading posit that the development, involvement and interaction of ortho-phonological and ortho-semantic systems depend on the statistical properties of languages. The overarching goal of this study is to take advantage of these differences, and perform a comprehensive neurocognitive investigation of how the complex process of learning to read in English (Eng.) is shaped online during the critical period of reading acquisition. This will be achieved by prolonged and intensive exposure to contrasting languages (Spanish, SP; Cantonese, Cn) that differentially stress these ortho-phonological and ortho-semantic systems. Sp has the same Roman alphabet as Eng., but with a different and more regular spelling-to-sound mapping that emphasizes phonological recoding. Cn uses the Chinese morphosyllabic writing system that is opaque and has weak character-to-sound mapping, presumably leading to greater reliance on ortho-semantic processes. Specifically, we will launch a prospective, longitudinal, and bidirectional examination of reading acquisition from kindergarten (K) to end of 2nd grade in 5 groups that is manipulated based on Eng. being their first or second language (L1 vs. L2) and the immersed language (Sp vs. Cn vs. none): native Eng. (L1) emerging readers in the U.S. starting Sp and Cn immersion programs initially learning primarily their L2 (L1Eng/L2Sp, L1Eng/L2Cn), L1 Sp and Cn speakers in the U.S. starting the same two-way immersion programs initially learning primarily their L1 (L1Sp/L2Eng, L1Cn/L2Eng), and Eng. monolinguals attending the same schools but not in the immersion programs (L1Eng). The main aims of the study are to investigate: 1) individual differences in the development of reading-related processes and brain circuitries in Eng., 2) how learning to read in Sp and Cn influence Eng. reading development given variant linguistic properties, 3) factors that affect interlinguistic/interliteracy influence (or transfer) , and 4) how these processes are shaped by early linguistic environment (e.g. early exposure to Eng., Cn versus Sp as their L1) and neurocognitive capacities (e.g. phonological awareness and related brain circuits, a significant risk factor of future reading impairment). The findings from this last exploratory aim will provide important initial insight into the influence of second language learning on children at-risk for developing reading disabilities, a population that is often discouraged from learning a foreign language. Children will be recruited from a local school district with which we have a collaborative relationship. The district is well-known for its extensive two-way immersion programs. This large-scale effort will advance theories of the neurocognitive processes underlying literacy development in Eng. by perturbing the system with languages of variant linguistic properties, advance understanding of the neurocognitive processes underlying multilingualism, and how minority students learn to read Eng. in the U.S."
"9312311","This project is the ROO phase of a K99/ROO Award to be conducted in the Department of Biological Sciences at the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture at the University of New Hampshire. Here the main goal for the next 3 years is to study the role of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) in regulating neurotransmission in amygdala. Dysfunction of amygdala is linked to anxiety disorders . Various anxiolytics modulate the amygdala by activating Gi/o protein coupled receptors, including cannabinoid receptors CB1. Presynaptic CaV2.2 channels are major targets of CB1. Inhibition of CaV2.2 channels by CB1 is well documented in excitatory and inhibitory synapses of hippocampus. But very little is known in synapses of the amygdala. The excitability of projection-like neurons (P-cells) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) directly correlates with anxiety-like behavior. BLA receives glutamatergic inputs from brain areas including cortex, and inhibitory inputs from local interneurons. Endocannabinoids activate CB1 to inhibit transmitter release at excitatory and inhibitory inputs of P-cells. Recent evidence shows that anxiogenic stimuli disrupt endocannabinoid metabolism and CB1 activity. However, less is known regarding the effects of anxiogenic stimuli on CB 1 signaling effectors, like presynaptic CaV2.2 channels. In this project, I hypothesize that during anxiety states, CB1 inhibition of CaV2.2-dependent transmitter release is altered in glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses of the BLA. To test this hypothesis, I will combine synaptic electrophysiology , optogenetics, and behavior. I propose the following specific aims: a) To determine if CB1 inhibition of CaV2.2-dependent glutamatergic  release is reduced in the BLA during anxiety states. I hypothesize that anxiogenic stimuli impair CB1 inhibition of CaV2.2 channels in cortico-BLA synapses, thereby allowing glutamate transmitter release and enhancing excitability of P-cells. b) To determine if CB1 inhibition of CaV2.2-dependent GABAergic release in the BLA is elevated during anxiety states. I hypothesize that, during anxiety states, CB1 inhibition of CaV2.2 channels is enhanced in GABAergic inputs of P-cells, reducing GABAergic tone and enhancing excitability of the BLA."
"9310433","ABSTRACT  The central focus of this competitive renewal application is to firmly examine a specific causal role of endothelial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) deficiency in abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm formation using new lines of genetic mice (>12, out of which 9 are produced in house), and to identify novel therapeutic strategies based on recent discoveries of mechanistic details of DHFR regulation. An innovative biomarker to monitor aneurysm growth and response to treatment will also be characterized. During the previous funding cycle we have been very productive in completing all of the proposed aims, demonstrating a novel causal role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. We have also extended our studies to examination of an essential regulatory role of endothelial DHFR gene in vascular homeostasis and aneurismal development employing several new mouse lines, development of novel strategies to restore eNOS function to prevent AAA by approaches of gene therapy and pharmacological interventions targeting endothelial DHFR, identification of a clinically relevant biomarker role of circulating tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) in mice and humans to monitor aneurysms, as well as investigation of applicability to thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) of the novel molecular mechanisms identified for AAA, so that some newly established therapeutic options for AAA can be extended to management of TAA. These studies are considered highly significant and translational, as there has not been any oral medicine for aneurysm treatment, besides surgical correction of large aneurysms that is also associated with considerable risk. Novel strategies for early diagnosis, monitor and treatment of aneurysms would benefit a large population of patients that accounts for 9% of the population over than 65 year old. The following four specific aims will be addressed in depth for these important missions: Aim 1, to examine a specific and essential role of endothelial DHFR deficiency in aneurysm formation using global and endothelium-specific DHFR knockout mice, and endothelium-specific DHFR transgenic mice crossed with hph-1. Effects on AAA formation of novel DHFR upregulators will also be examined. Aim 2, to determine whether pathways attenuating Ang II/oxidative stress inhibition of DHFR are of preventive and therapeutic value in aneurysm formation. Pathways mediating H2O2 regulation of DHFR or BP lowering drugs will be targeted for these studies. Aim 3, to evaluate a biomarker role of circulating tetrahydrobiopterin in aneurysm formation and treatment using Ang II infused hph-1 and apoE null mice, and two patient populations. Aim 4, to examine whether uncoupling of eNOS also mediates TAA formation downstream of TGF? pathway, hence the newly identified AAA treatment strategies in Aims 1-3 are effective in treating TAAs as well. Accomplishments of these aims will uniquely provide novel mechanistic and therapeutic insights into development and management of aortic aneurysms."
"9381773","SUMMARY In this application we propose to investigate the biological features of innate CD8? cells (or iCD8? cells), a novel lymphoid population present in the intestinal epithelium discovered by our group. A hallmark of this population is the expression of CD8??, lack of T and B cell receptors, and the production of cytokines/chemokines that indicate an innate immune phenotype. iCD8? cells are a main source of osteoponin in the intestinal epithelium, a cytokine known for its role in tissue remodeling but also for its capacity to stimulate Th1 and Th17 immune responses. Interestingly, using a strain of mice lacking iCD8? cells (E8I mice; E8I is an essential enhancer for CD8?? expression in IEL) we found that the levels of -/- osteopontin in the intestinal epithelium are decreased in comparison to wild type mice, and that E8I-/- mice have a deficiency in NKp46+NK1.1+ IEL. These and other preliminary results have led to the hypothesis that iCD8? cells, through production of factors such as osteopontin, promote the survival and maintenance of IEL. In order to pursue this hypothesis, we propose the following complementary, yet independent aims: Aim1. To determine the contribution of iCD8? cells and osteopontin to IEL maintenance and survival. In this aim we will determine: a) the impact of iCD8? cells and osteopontin in the survival and proliferation of different IEL subsets; b) the impact of iCD8? cells and osteopontin in the immune environment of the intestines; and c) the role of osteopontin ligands in IEL homeostasis. Aim 2. To define the role of iCD8? cells and osteopontin during intestinal inflammation. In this section we will determine the role of iCD8? cells and osteopontin in three different disease models: a) intestinal inflammation by anti-CD40 antibody treatment, b) Citrobacter rodentium infection, and c) inflammation caused by adoptive transfer of effector T cells into immunodeficient mice. Aim 3. To determine the mechanisms controlling IEL homeostasis by iCD8? cells. Our previous publication indicates that IL-12 provides stimulus for activation of iCD8? cells. In this section we will determine a) the impact of IL-12 in activation of iCD8? cells, with implications on OPN secretion and IEL survival, and b) we will determine the gene expression signature of IEL responding to iCD8? cell/OPN stimulation."
"9304965","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Current anti-tuberculosis (TB) strategies require months of treatment, and the development of multi-drug re- sistant mutants of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) has increased both the complexity and cost of treatment. As such, the NIAID recently proposed targeting infected individuals? responses to infection as a means to enhance anti-TB defenses. These ?host-directed therapies? could be combined with proven antibiotic strategies against TB, providing an overall enhancement of treatment and patient care. Amino acids are integral to immune function, yet there is a fundamental gap in understanding the therapeutic potential of targeting amino acid metabolism during disease. The long-term goal is to define the interplay between amino acid metabolism and immune re- sponses, providing new therapeutic avenues to manipulate immune activity. The objective of this study is to identify the role of L-citrulline metabolism on macrophage (M?)-mediated immune responses to Mtb. The ap- plicant will use Mtb H37Rv infection in human and mouse M?s, as well as in vivo infection in mice, to examine L-citrulline metabolism during Mtb infection. The central hypothesis is that L-citrulline metabolism is required for anti-TB M? activity and can be harnessed to assist host defense to TB in vivo. The hypothesis is support- ed as a) L-citrulline enhances M? NO production and anti-Mtb activity in vitro, b) L-citrulline metabolism by myeloid cells is necessary for mycobacterial defenses in vivo, c) L-citrulline supplementation decreases lung mycobacterial burden, and d) lung M?s are the predominant L-citrulline utilizing cells during infection. The ra- tionale for the proposed research is that uncovering mechanics of immune-mediated infection control will likely lead to novel methods for treating those infected with Mtb ? which kills well over 1 million annually. The appli- cant will test the central hypothesis by investigating three specific aims: 1) to examine how L-citrulline is uti- lized in Mtb-infected M?s, 2) to define the metabolism of L-citrulline in human M?s infected with Mtb, and 3) to identify how harnessing L-citrulline metabolism enhances anti-mycobacterial host defenses. Under the first and second aims, the applicant will utilize a combination of innovative cell culture and mass spectrometry ap- proaches with titrating amino acid concentrations to determine the benefit(s) of L-citrulline metabolism in hu- man and mouse M?s. These experiments will define the mechanistic consequences of this pathway that will complement in vivo experiments under the third aim, where the applicant will use an original approach to en- hance Mtb clearance in the lungs by supplementing mice with L-citrulline. The proposed research is significant as we anticipate harnessing L-citrulline metabolism will augment M?-mediated control of TB, and in combina- tion with anti-mycobacterial antibiotic therapy will result in efficient treatment strategies for patients suffering with TB. This research is also expected to have broad implications on host defense mechanisms ? enhancing pathogen control and individual components of the immune system by altering amino acid metabolism."

The proposed project will provide researchers with flexible access to integrated and well-documented longitudinal data across six decades of CPS surveys, including all basic monthly surveys from 1976 through 2020, Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) files from 1962 through 2020, and all other surviving topical supplements from 1967 through 2020. IPUMS- CPS serves the scientific enterprise by reducing wasteful duplication of effort (e.g., in linking files and harmonizing variables), eliminating common technical errors (e.g., in variance estimation), making findings easier to replicate, and encouraging and facilitating sophisticated and powerful new longitudinal analyses in many research domains. To accomplish these goals, we propose six specific tasks: (1) Clean, verify, and de-identify recovered CPS files from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s in preparation for disclosure review and integrate them into the public- use IPUMS collection; (2) Expand the database by integrating data from nearly 78 new files that will be released between 2015 and 2020, including all CPS monthly and supplement data as well as data we recover in collaboration with the Census Bureau; (3) Collaborate with the Census Bureau to add IPUMS-CPS linking keys to restricted CPS files for use in the Census Bureau's Research Data Center network; (4) Develop additional new keys for linking CPS observations over time, systematically compare the linkages resulting from different approaches, and provide users with documentation about the keys and differences between them; (5) Create new tools for data access and data processing; (6) Provide user support and perform outreach at conferences, expand online data analysis capabilities, host in-depth training workshops, and implement a new plan for long-run preservation of the microdata and metadata. The proposed work will be carried out by a team of highly-skilled researchers with unparalleled expertise in data integration, record linkage, and the CPS. Collaborators include leading researchers from the Minnesota Population Center, the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Unicon Research Corporation, and NORC. The project will employ cutting-edge software innovations, extensive usability testing, and established metadata standards."
"9391423","ABSTRACT  While prenatal alcohol exposure is required for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) it is clear that there is substantial variation in the clinical and physical manifestations of this teratogenic exposure. Even children with similar prenatal alcohol exposure can have quite different outcomes. It is hypothesized that other factors, some of which may be genetic, contribute to this variation.  One of the significant challenges in studies of FASD is the ability to recruit large numbers of individuals in order to evaluate broad hypotheses and obtain results that are generalizable to the overall population. This clinical research project is designed to address this challenge by implementing innovative online approaches to recruit and consent a large cohort of individuals suspected to have been exposed to alcohol prenatally. These individuals will have the opportunity to participate in multiple assessments (saliva for DNA, 2D facial images, neurobehavioral assessments) that will generate data used in several Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Disorders (CIFASD) projects. In addition, the individuals recruited into this online cohort can be recruited to participate in other clinical research projects, including interventional studies proposed as part of CIFASD.  Data obtained online from this new cohort will also be used to identify a subset of individuals with the most extreme phenotypes resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. DNA from a targeted subset of study subjects will be used to obtain whole exome sequencing to efficiently identify novel risk and resilience factors related to the phenotypic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Results will be shared and compared with CIFASD basic research projects utilizing animal models to identify risk factors.  This clinical research project is highly integrated within CIFASD and interacts closely with all four resources as well as multiple clinical and basic research projects."

"9306891","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Programs to promptly diagnose and treat pediatric HIV infection play a critical role in reducing childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinical leaders and policymakers need to understand the long-term benefits and costs of these programs, which may differ in settings with different types of HIV epidemics. South Africa is a middle-income country with a very high HIV prevalence (30%: a generalized HIV epidemic) and excellent access to health services for HIV-infected women and their infants. C?te d'Ivoire is a low-income country with a lower HIV prevalence (3%: a mixed HIV epidemic) and more limited access to HIV-related health services. These two countries represent two of the key types of HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.  The long-term outcomes of pediatric HIV treatment reflect a continuum of events over decades, and thus cannot be fully investigated using traditional methodologies, such as clinical trials or cohort studies. Computer models can add great value to shorter-term clinical studies by projecting survival and healthcare resource utilization over both short and long time horizons; this can assist clinicians and policymakers in prioritizing among many competing demands for limited resources. In addition, computer models can identify factors that will have the greatest influence on survival and costs, and thus outline critical priorities for future research.  Through K01 AI078754 and the IMPAACT network, NICHD, NIAID, and NIMH have supported a preliminary model of pediatric HIV disease, the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC)-Pediatric model. We have assembled an international research team with expertise in pediatric HIV, simulation modeling, and epidemiology, and we have used the CEPAC-Pediatric model to conduct analyses of strategies to prevent pediatric HIV infection that have informed WHO guidelines. We now propose a major expansion of the CEPAC-Pediatric model and the use of our model to evaluate novel strategies to diagnose and treat pediatric HIV in South Africa and C?te d'Ivoire. Our three specific aims are: 1) to determine the most effective and efficient strategies for early infant HIV diagnosis; 2) to investigate the clinical outcomes and cost- effectiveness of HIV treatment initiation strategies for children; and 3) to project the clinical and economic outcomes of strategies for monitoring 1st-line therapy and switching to 2nd-line therapy for HIV-infected children.  By reflecting key comparisons between South Africa and C?te d'Ivoire, these analyses will represent many of the clinical and economic conditions that characterize the HIV epidemic in Africa. The project's goals to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality align with the mission of NICHD: to ensure that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability. The project further meets key goals of the Office of AIDS Research, the PEPFAR Roadmap for Saving Lives, and Millennium Development Goals 6 and 4: to prioritize research for women and vulnerable children, to ensure universal access to HIV treatment for children, and to reduce under-five mortality worldwide."
"9319426","Primary developmental language impairment (LI) affects over 3 million children in the U.S., many of whom are disadvantaged socially and academically by small and shallow vocabularies. Currently, little is known about how the word learning processes of people with LI changes over development. This critical gap in the knowledge base prevents the design of vocabulary interventions that are developmentally appropriate. The design of such interventions is the long-term goal. The current objective is to discover how the word learning of children with LI changes over developmental time. The central hypothesis is that the challenge of word learning at different ages varies with the word-learning situation, the component of the word to be learned, and the development of underlying cognitive mechanisms. The project designed to test this hypothesis compares children with LI to age-mates with normal language development as they learn and retain new words over the course of one week during each of four years beginning at age six. This approach is innovative because it departs from the status quo by examining learning longitudinally. The project involves two specific aims: 1) to establish a developmental trajectory of word learning associated with LI that determines a) how learning and development vary with the learning situation and b) how learning and development vary with the component of the word to be learned; and 2) to specify the cognitive mechanisms underlying this developmental trajectory. The expected contribution is a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the word learning challenges associated with LI and how these challenges change during a crucial period, the first years of formal schooling. This contribution is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of the dynamic interaction between word learning and cognitive development. Vocabulary interventions are not currently tailored to focus on the most critical aspects of the problem at the given developmental level of the client with LI because of ignorance about what is critical and when. By addressing this issue, this project will offer new possibilities for tailoring preventive and therapeutic interventions in light of the child's developmental needs."

"9355717","The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an optical-genetic toolbox for reading and writing neural population codes in functional maps of awake, higher mammals. Such tools could ultimately be used to restore perceptual capabilities in patients with damage to peripheral sensory pathways by direct stimulation of early sensory cortex. Advanced optical methods for reading and writing neural codes using genetically-encoded reporters and actuators have become powerful tools for studying neural circuits in rodents. However, rodents are a suboptimal model for human perception because of their vastly different sensory representations and perceptual capabilities. For example, rodents' primary visual cortex (V1) lacks the functional columnar organization which is a hallmark of primate vision. In contrast to rodents, the macaque monkeys' sensory representations and perceptual capabilities are highly similar to those of humans. Furthermore, the behaving macaque provides a unique opportunity to develop and test tools for reading and writing neural codes at the level of functional domains such as the orientation columns in V1. However, multiple technical hurdles remain before the optical-genetic methods currently available in rodents could be readily applied in larger, non- transgenic mammals.  Here we propose to take advantage of the unique expertise of our team members to develop optical techniques that utilize virally delivered transgenes for monitoring and manipulating neural population codes in behaving macaques. Specifically, we will address three technical goals. First, we will develop and test new genetic methods that will provide long-term expression of transgenes in primates with cell-type and activity- dependent specificity. Second, we will develop a two-photon microscope for behaving monkeys that will allow one to monitor these signals with cellular resolution and complement current imaging techniques with larger coverage but coarser resolution. Finally, we will develop methods for writing neural population codes in functional maps by combining patterned light stimulation that target specific functional domains and selective expression of actuators. We will validate and optimize these techniques by linking V1 responses (elicited by both visual and direct patterned optogenetic stimulation) and monkeys' behavior in visual discrimination tasks. The tools that we will develop will enable a deeper understanding of the neural code and a better characterization of the capabilities and limitations of methods for reading and writing neural population codes in functional maps in humans."
"9302265","Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STD) with ~108 million annual cases worldwide and ~1.44 million U.S. cases in 2014. Most female and male infections are asymptomatic, facilitating unchecked transmission that can result in pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and life-threatening ectopic pregnancy. Ct is also a risk factor for invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the cervix and a complicating factor in HIV-1 infection. Patients are often treated without a definitive diagnosis, which can lead to inappropriate antibiotic use and possibly drug resistance. The main obstacle to stemming Ct infections is the lack of a point-of-care (POC) diagnostic to increase early detection to reduce infection rates and sequelae. Current Ct diagnostics rely on commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) that vary in sensitivity and specificity with a general lack of concordant results for the same sample type. NAATs are expensive, require equipment and highly trained operators, take a day to days for results, and can result in loss to follow up and delay in treatment. Thus, current NAATs are not suitable POC diagnostics. Our team of Dr. Deborah Dean, an expert on Ct STDs and POC development, and Diassess, a startup company with proprietary technology for POC diagnostics, showed in Phase I that we: 1) can extract Ct nucleic acids from endocervical swabs in 5 min with no instruments in a prototype Sample Preparation Module; 2) have an instrument-free multiplexed Detection Module for 30 min colorimetric detection of Ct nucleic acids; 3) have validated assays to detect all Ct reference strains, differentiate lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) from non-LGV strains and detect human DNA; and 4) have demonstrated assay results consistent with standard NAAT results on 200 remnant endocervical patient samples. In Phase II, we will advance on Phase I results. Aim 1: Using the expanding aggregate of reference and clinical Ct genome sequences, refine our primers, replacing failed primers as needed and ensure that our refined Ct primer amplification assays detect Ct reference and diverse Ct clinical strains without cross-reactivity with sexually transmitted pathogens and common vaginal/cervical species; Aim 2: Optimize sample preparation chemistry, amplification assay design and colorimetric chemistry for vaginal, urethral and endocervical swabs, and interfering substances; Aim 3: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of our fully-integrated system (the combined Sample Preparation Module with Detection Module) compared to commercial NAATs. By the end of Phase II, we will be poised to manufacture and use our rapid (<35 min), inexpensive, user-friendly, instrument-free, sensitive and specific Ct POC test for clinical trials in the U.S. to obtain FDA regulatory clearance via the 510(k) pathway. Our overall goal is to deploy our Ct POC diagnostic for use in doctor's offices, small to large city and rural clinics, teen and STD clinics, emergency rooms, other testing sites and resource-constrained settings around the world."
"9294024","Project Summary/Abstract Developing therapies for rare genetic diseases is as important as for more common disorders because many of these patients are suffering from lifelong debilitating and life-threatening symptoms with treatment being limited or non-existent. The key for developing therapeutic interventions is to understand the cellular and molecular consequences of genomic abnormalities identified in these diseases. This proposal aims to identify pathogenic mechanisms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD), characterized by thickened craniofacial bones and widened metaphyses of long bones. The onset of CMD begins early in infancy and cranifacial bones progressively thicken throughout life, which can result in life-threatening consequences for patients. The obstruction of nerves by narrowing cranial foramina often leads to blindness, deafness, facial paralysis and severe headache even in young children. To date, there is no treatment for CMD other than repetitive and risky surgeries. We have generated a mouse model carrying a CMD mutation and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from CMD patients and healthy donors. Cell-autonomous defects in osteoblasts and osteoclasts (OCs) in a mouse model for CMD have been reported. OCs are significantly smaller and functioanlly deficient in CMD mice and CMD patients. We use OCs to study unique mutational effects because OCs show the most notable differences between CMD mice and mice that have no ANK protein. To gain insight into how mutations in the progressive ankylosis gene ANKH (human) and ANK (mouse orthologue) cause CMD, three Specific Aims are proposed to test the central hypothesis that mutations in ANKH cause CMD by reducing levels of functional ANKH and by decreasing Ca2+/CaM signaling, which results in defective actomyosin complexes. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms regulating expression and localization of CMD mutant ANK/ANKH. Aim 2 will determine the role of CMD mutant ANK on calcium signaling in osteoclasts. Aim 3 will identify the mechanisms leading to defective actomyosin complexes in CMD osteoclasts. Findings from this project will be the basis for a future translational study to focus on developing therapeutic interventions for CMD. This project is expected to have a high impact on investigations of similar rare genetic bone disorders as well as on a better understanding of unrecognized roles of ANK/ANKH in normal bone development and beyond."
"9509611","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death and disease worldwide for women in their reproductive years, highlighting the importance of understanding the effects of contraceptives on HIV-1 risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently recommended that more research be done on the effects of exogenous hormones and contraceptives, including intrauterine devices (IUDs), on the female reproductive tract (FRT). In 2007, more than 160 million women were using IUDs globally, yet the WHO has concluded that data regarding IUD use and risk of HIV-1 infection are limited. The upper FRT has been minimally studied in the context of HIV transmission. We have demonstrated that the levonorgestrel (LNG) intrauterine system (LNG-IUD or Mirena) has pro-inflammatory effects on the upper FRT; an injectable hormonal contraceptive, depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) had similar but less pronounced effects on the same parameters. Given these findings, we hypothesize that the presence of the IUD foreign body results in changes in the upper FRT that can increase risk of HIV-1 infection. We will test this hypothesis by recruiting four groups o reproductive aged healthy women [Group A-LNG-IUD users; Group B-copper (non-hormonal) IUD users; Group C-users of LNG-containing oral contraceptives (OC); Group D-non-users of IUDs, OCs or injectable hormones]. We will collect a comprehensive set of FRT specimens synchronized to the mid-secretory phase from participants for the following Specific Aims: 1. To determine the effects of IUDs and LNG on the immune microenvironment of the FRT 2. To determine whether IUDs and LNG alter susceptibility of FRT immune cells to HIV-1 infection 3. To determine whether IUDs and LNG modulate the pyroptotic susceptibility of T cells from the FRT. Results from these aims will provide a comprehensive assessment of biological effects of IUDs and LNG on the upper FRT, and will directly address the knowledge gap surrounding effects of IUDs on parameters relevant to HIV-1 susceptibility."

"9315915","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this project is to study, using human induced-nociceptor neurons, the cellular mechanisms contributing to peripheral sensory diseases that cause pain and small fiber neuropathy. The induced-nociceptors (i-nociceptors) will be generated by directly converting (transdifferentiating) a somatic cell (in this case fibroblasts) into a cell with a different and distinct lineage (in this case, nociceptor neurons). e have established a protocol for efficiently transdifferentiating mouse and human fibroblasts into nociceptors by expression of a small set of defined transcription factors. These i-nociceptors have the morphology and marker expression patterns expected of adult nociceptors. The cells also respond with a robust calcium influx to capsaicin a TRPV1 agonist, mustard oil, a TRPA1 agonist and a ?-methylene ATP, a P2X3 agonist. The neurons have, moreover, the broad action potentials typical of nociceptors, which are contributed to by a tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium current and express transcripts for quintessential nocicepter markers Nav1.7, Nav1.8, TRPV1, and P2X3. The induced neurons have, therefore, sufficient features of native mature nociceptors to enable us to model key aspects of nociceptive transduction, membrane excitability and neuropathy. We now plan to characterize the function and expression profiles of human i-nociceptors. We will also use newly developed gene-targeting techniques to introduce gain- and loss-of-function mutations of Nav1.7 known from human genetic studies to produce pain or congenital analgesia into mouse and human i-nociceptors. These nociceptors will be compared with i-nociceptors derived from patients with inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) due to Nav1.7 mutations. Furthermore, we will compare i-nociceptors that are isogenic except for a defined Nav1.7 mutation, by correcting the mutation in a patient-derived iPSC line. We anticipate measuring a clear hyperexcitability phenotype in nociceptors with natural or engineered Nav1.7 gain-of-function mutations, and a loss of this phenotype when the mutation is corrected. Finally, we will use human i-nociceptors to study how a cancer chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin may cause pain and neuropathy. The proposal will enable exploitation of human nociceptors to study human disease conditions and screen for novel treatment strategies."
"9316500","The maintenance of normal mitochondrial function varies between organisms as does their oxygen metabolism and response to pathophysiological stress. Although bioenergetic metrics have been surveyed in a broad range of aging models these parameters have yet to be integrated with measures of the control of mitochondrial quality and mitochondrial genetics. We have introduced the concept of Bioenergetic health in translational research and now plan to extend this to models of aging. In the Comparative Mitochondrial Health Assessment core both state of the art and established techniques in bioenergetics, mitochondrial genetics, autophagy and redox biology will be offered. The mechanisms controlling mitochondrial health involve mitochondrial genetics, mitochondrial-nuclear interaction and mitophagy. The novel models offered to the aging community will be the mitochondrial nuclear exchange (MNX) mice which have been pioneered at UAB. This allows the contribution of specific mitochondrial DNA sequences to the process of aging to be assessed independent of the nuclear contribution. State of the art experimental design, and protocols for assessing cellular bioenergetics in response to oxidative and metabolic stress will also be used. As autophagy and mitophagy have been shown to be essential for healthy lifespan, and insufficient autophagy contributes to accumulation of protein aggregates and dysfunctional mitochondria, indices of autophagic flux can be measured. An important aspect of the Core is extending these techniques to a variety of traditional species from yeast to mice, including both cryopreserved ?cell zoo? of fibroblasts from about 60 species of mammals and birds, a lot of these from species of ?exceptional biogerontological interest?, as well as live species that are either exceptionally long-lived or short-lived for their body size, such as the short-lived fish, Nothobranchius furzeri. Specifically, services will be provided to NIA Regular and Supported Members and pilot & feasibility grant awardees in: 1. Molecular energetics analysis including cellular, organelle and tissue measurements, including approaches we have pioneered in spheroid like cell structures and complex multi-cellular structures such as pancreatic islets, vessel segments and adipose tissue, and complementing approaches with targeted metabolomics and oxygen electrodes. 2. Quantitative oxidative stress parameters to assess indices of redox changes including oxidized lipids, thiols and modified proteins. 3. Mitochondrial nuclear exchange (MNX) models, mtDNA damage and haplotyping to test the unique contribution of mtDNA sequences to bioenergetics and the resistance to metabolic and oxidative stress, with approaches available for both the traditional murine models and comparative models of aging used throughout the Center. 4. Autophagy and mitophagy assessments in the context of the pathobiology of oxidative stress and neurodegeneration will be extended to the models of aging. 5. Virtual and wet lab workshop educational programs."
"9314611","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Throughout the world, young MSM are disproportionately burdened by HIV infection. Young MSM in low- and middle-income countries often do not seek out HIV testing, are unaware of their HIV-positive status, and do not receive early medical care, compromising their health and contributing to downstream disease incidence. This situation is of great concern in post-socialist countries of Eastern Europe, where stigma about HIV/AIDS and same-sex behavior are great, HIV epidemics are still increasing, and the health needs of young MSM are rarely acknowledged or addressed. The planned research will be conducted in Sofia, Bulgaria where MSM account for nearly half of HIV infections, MSM communities are very young, and a high proportion of persons living with HIV (PLH) are undiagnosed. This mixed-methods study will be conducted in two phases. In an initial qualitative phase, we will conduct in-depth interviews with young MSM ages 16 to 20 and other key informants to gain an understanding of factors related to HIV testing, as well as barriers and facilitators of testing and medical care. Results of the qualitative study will be shared with HIV test and care providers, and we will gain further input from a community advisory panel. The project's second phase is a trial of a network intervention to increase regular HIV testing and care linkage among young MSM. Our prior studies in Bulgaria have shown that young MSM are clustered with other young MSM in their social or friendship networks. The intervention trial will recruit 54 small social networks of MSM, each consisting of a young MSM seed between age 16 and 20 and also all close MSM friends surrounding the seed (expected n=54 networks x 5 members/network=270 participants). All participants will complete baseline measures assessing recent HIV testing practices and testing history; attitudes, intentions, perceived norms, barriers, and understanding about HIV testing and medical care; sexual risk practices; and substance use. All participants will receive HIV risk reduction counseling. Networks will then be randomized in equal numbers to comparison and intervention conditions. The influence leader of each experimental condition network will be empirically identified, and network leaders will together attend a 5-session intervention. Sessions will train, guide, and engage the cadre of leaders to deliver theory-based, personally-tailored advice and counseling to their network members to correct misconceptions about HIV testing and care; strengthen friends' norms, attitudes, intentions, and perceived benefits of regular testing; and address barriers to testing. All members of intervention and comparison condition networks will be re-assessed at 6- and 12-month followup to determine the intervention's effects on HIV testing, regular testing, and testing- and care-related scale measures. Data obtained from Sofia VCT providers will be used to corroborate testing uptake. Participants diagnosed with HIV infection at any point will be linked to medical care. If successful, this research will identify a new strategy for reaching and encouraging regular HIV testing in world regions where young MSM are often hidden in the community."

"9369680","PROJECT SUIVIMARY (See instructions): Since the last CCSG review, AECC has undertaken an intensive and ongoing process of planning and evaluation. Intrinsic to this process vi/as: (i) the AECC Steering Committees consisting of all program leaders, Executive Committee members, leaders of the major clinical oncology services, and other key College and AECC faculty and (ii) The External Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) which consists of eleven members with expertise relevant to AECC research programs and their administration. In addition, ad hoc members were included at ESAC meetings to provide special expertise in guiding the implementation of a developing Cancer Prevention and Control program. In June 2008, there was a major planning retreat that culminated in the formulation of a Strategic Plan. The overarching strategic objectives that emerged at this retreat were to improve AECC's structure to optimally harness the strong basic science elements in AECC programs in order to enhance clinical/translational research, to strengthen the clinical research enterprise, and to expand population research which, collectively, would enhance the comprehensive nature of this center ultimately leading to comprehensive designation. Major programmatic goals that emerged from the June 2008 retreat were: (i) to strengthen the clinical oncology services at MMC with the recruitment of a cadre of committed clinician/researchers, (ii) to create the position of Associate Director for Clinical Services at MMC in order to establish a multidisciplinary clinical structure at MMC that encompasses all the oncology and support services, (iii) to review the AECC programmatic structure in order to identify ways to enhance its disease focus and translational capabilities, and to (iv) build behavioral sciences with the objective of ultimately establishing a Cancer Prevention and Control Program. Intrinsic to the plan was strengthening and broadening the scope of basic research at the Center leveraging College and AECC resources. Another important element in the Planning and Evaluation process was the annual off-campus Advances meeting  when the scientific thrust and collaborations among working groups and individual investigators, and their  integration into the programmatic structure of the Center, could be evaluated and new needed research  areas and technologies identified. Developments Funds were targeted based upon needs identified within  the context of the Planning and Evaluation process. Support is requested for travel and consultation fees for  external advisors and for the annual Advances off-campus retreat of the entire AECC membership and for  planning retreats of the AECC leadership."
"9304055","Core B Abstract: Pharmacokinetic analyses are required throughout preclinical and clinical studies to support the efficacy and safety studies as well as to provide basis for the design of subsequent clinical studies in humans. In addition, valid bioanalytical methods are required to quantify the drugs of interest, which allow the generation of accurate data to be used in the pharmacokinetics analysis. Therefore, we have created a core (Core B) to provide bioanalytical and pharmacokinetic (PK) support throughout the preclinical studies proposed in Projects 1, 2 and 3. Core B serves dual purposes: (i) provide bioanalytical and PK support to the preclinical development of nanoART, and (ii) characterize the kinetics and the mechanisms of the extent of drug transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and lymphatics. Throughout the project, mice will receive single and multiple dosing regimens of individual or combinational nanoART drugs to characterize reference PK parameters. Starting doses in mice will be scaled from the dose recommended in humans based on body- surface area (shape factor) normalization. PK, tissue distribution, BBB penetration, and toxicity will be compared between the nanoART and free drug. Next, nanoART, control nanodrugs other than ART and free ART will be administered to infected humanized mice as a part of a dose efficacy study. Plasma and target tissue concentrations will be determined. PK studies similar to that in mice will be performed in uninfected monkeys. Starting doses in monkeys will also be scaled from the dose recommended in humans based on body-surface area (shape factor) normalizations. PK parameters and linearities will be assessed. The multiple dosing efficacy studies will aim to achieve and maintain systemic exposure levels similar to that recommended in humans without exceeding peak exposure levels. The multiple dosing regimens will be designed from the single dose PK. Hematology and chemistry panels will be monitored, and plasma drug concentrations measured for up to 14 weeks following multiple drug administration (with Projects 1 and 2). The long-term goal is to develop injectable nanoART for human use. If successful the work could lead to novel formulations that improve medication adherence, and thereby therapeutic outcomes. Novel treatment applications will include enhanced penetration into viral reservoirs such as the central nervous and lymphatic systems."
"9317359","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of Personalized Medicine is to implement advances in biomarker pharmacology, molecular diagnostics and genomics to improve public health. For the full benefits of this science to be realized, it is critical that scientific advancs made in experimental settings and on a small scale be extended to community practice and that a business case can be made to support such dissemination. It is important that key innovations be extended beyond individual hospital settings to large health care systems, especially those that include underserved populations. Many scientific advances bypass underserved populations, and as a result inequalities of care and cost inefficiencies result. In 2011, the Indiana Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM) was created to serve as an academic home for basic and clinical researchers committed to research in personalized medicine. A specific goal of the IPM is to move this science towards clinical practice. To that end, the purpose of this proposal is to pilot a genomic platform in a large safety-net health care system, and to measure the economic costs and clinical outcomes of doing so. Eskenazi Health handles over 1.2 million outpatient visits per year and > 15,000 admissions annually, with a payer mix that include 45% uninsured, 26% Medicaid and 18% Medicare patients. In this proposal, the IPM will partner with Eskenazi Health and the Regenstrief Institute to recruit a new Eskenazi cohort of genotyped patients. A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and information scientists will pilot an innovatie approach to the implementation of pharmacogenomic science. The Regenstrief Institute has a proven track record of innovation in medical informatics, and has created an ideal environment in which to assess real clinical outcomes. The specific aims of this proposal will be: 1) To test the hypothesis that a CLIA certified genotyping test targeted at 24 widely used drugs is associated with significant reductions in hospital and outpatient economic costs incurred over 1 year; and 2) To test whether such pharmacogenetic testing is associated with significant improvements in clinical outcomes over 1 year. Patients will be randomized either to an intervention arm, involving pharmacogenotyping, insertion of results in the medical record and dissemination of relevant results and decision algorithms to providers (n=2000 patients), or to usual care (n=4000 patients). This trial will be implemented in Eskenazi primary care clinics and 6 specialty clinics. Economic costs and clinical outcomes including clinic visits, hospital admissions, length of stay, adverse drug reactions, morbidity and mortality, will be followed prospectively and compared between the two groups. To sustain this effort, we will extend access to this testing to IU Health, and the affiliated NCI Simon Cancer Center and Riley Hospital for Children. Data from this study will allow for the first time the development of an objective business case for pharmacogenomic personalization based on real world costs and outcomes."
"9327684","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will evaluate relative cardiovascular toxicities of diverse, inhaled tobacco products, using an innovative physiological assay developed in the Principal Investigator's laboratory, in response to FOA PAR-12-267, Tobacco Control Regulatory Research. The results of this unique and innovative approach will inform the FDA about how different types of cigarettes and related smoked tobacco products vary in their harmful effects on the endothelial lining of blood vessels, an important contributor o cardio-vascular disease. The research will also yield valuable pre-market toxicity screens for new and emerging tobacco products. This proposal uses a recently-developed micro-ultrasound-based approach to measure endothelial function in living rats in the form of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), which is impaired in humans by both active smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. This approach has enabled detection of acute cardiovascular toxicity resulting from brief exposure to tobacco smoke at real-world levels. Rats have advantages over humans including minimal inter-subject variability and the ability to harvest and analyze tissue, and the FMD measurement approach is more physiologically relevant than classic ex vivo studies of isolated segments of aorta. Therefore, this approach can assess relative toxicity of exposure to different tobacco products under physiological conditions without the confounding variables of genetics and lifestyle that are inherent to human studies. Rats can also be exposed to purified constituents of smoke that are suspected mediators of endothelial dysfunction, and to antagonists of those constituents, enabling determination of whether these constituents exert deleterious cardiovascular effects and thus can be used to evaluate toxicity of emerging products. The project will determine extent of impairment of FMD, as well as dose response and short-term recovery, and will illuminate differences in effects of post-exposure plasma on endothelial cells ex vivo and in vivo. Aim 1 is to measure differences in vascular toxicity between different types of smoked tobacco products (consumer and reference cigarettes with varying amounts of nicotine and menthol, cigarillos, and little cigars). This provides information about relative extents and causes of toxicity from different smoked tobacco products, and establishes a solid scientific basis to inform whether cigarillos and little cigars should be regulated like cigarettes. Aim 2 is to determine involvement of specific smoke components in acute endothelial toxicity. This establishes whether specific smoke constituents are involved in smoke-induced endothelial dysfunction and can be used to evaluate toxicity of emerging tobacco products. Aim 3 is to evaluate and understand cardiovascular toxicity of vapors from e-cigarette of varying nicotine levels and vehicle chemical composition. This provides crucial cardiovascular toxicity assessment of these inhaled nicotine-delivery vapors relative to tobacco smoke inhalation, and establishes a solid scientific basis for regulatory decisions regarding e-cigarettes."
"9320734","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests five years of continued support for our postdoctoral training program in research relevant to the kidney. The overall goal of this program is to develop skilled investigators trained to conduct research in clinical science translational science or bench science, and capable of academic careers as independent researchers. This program represents collaboration between Penn's adult and pediatric renal divisions, and its many biomedical research programs intended to develop future academic leaders in nephrology. Our program is designed to support two years of salary and tuition costs for six MD, MD-PhD, (or rarely PhD) post-doctoral fellows per year, who typically have completed training in either adult or pediatric clinical nephrology. Our training program has evolved to meet current scientific challenges facing the wider renal community. We recognize that this requires a program that brings together multiple disciplines and mentors. We have adapted to meet this challenge through recruitment of outstanding faculty mentors from multiple disciplines; by providing access to master's degree programs in three areas of clinical or translational research; by engagement of experienced scientists in related disciplines to interact with our faculty and supervise our trainees, and through the provision of the framework, environment and means to accomplish these goals."
"9300828","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This translational proposal uses a rapid desensitization approach to develop a safe, effective and rapid way to suppress human IgE-mediated disease. We can already safely, rapidly desensitize mice to all antigens (Ags) by injecting them hourly with doubling doses of an anti-Fc?RI? monoclonal antibody (mAb), starting with a dose too small to elicit a clinical reaction. Using this protocol to treat mice with an anti-Fc?RI? mAb that only binds Fc?RI that is not occupied by IgE: (1) rapidly induces short-lived suppression of IgE/F?RI signaling; and (2) slowly removes all mast cell membrane Fc?RI and IgE, even in mice that have high serum IgE levels. In mice, our approach is safer than rapid desensitization with Ag and can safely be maintained indefinitely by repeated injection of anti-Fc?RI? mAb. We will now adapt this approach to humans, make it more rapid, and make it even safer. Aim 1 uses an anti-human (hu) Fc?RI? mAb that has characteristics similar to our anti-mouse Fc?RI? mAb to desensitize: (1) huIgE-treated transgenic mice that express huFc?RI? instead of mouse Fc?RI?; and (2) immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice that lack the cytokine receptor    common ? chain, express transgenic huSCF, huIL-3, and huGM-CSF and have been reconstituted with    human cord blood cells (these mice secrete human IgE and generate human mast cells and basophils). We also modify our desensitization protocol to make it more compatible with potential human use by injecting anti-huFc?RI? mAb subcutaneously instead of intraperitoneally. Aim 2 accelerates desensitization with antihuFc?RI? mAb by using a commercially available mAb that removes all mast cell huFc?RI, regardless of its IgE occupancy. We also generate our own mAb that has this property so that we can modify its structure in Aim 3. Aim 3 increases the safety of rapid desensitization with anti-huFc?RI? mAb. We further suppress any clinical reactions that might occur during rapid desensitization by: (1) inhibiting H1 and H2 receptors; (2) inhibiting the tyrosine kinase syk; and (3) engineering anti-Fc?RI? mAb to bind more avidly to the inhibitory receptor, Fc?RIIb. Successful completion of these aims could provide a way to safely and rapidly protect against all Fc?RI-mediated disease."
"9302830","Abstract Improving diets through increased food and vegetable (F&V) consumption significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Programs increasing the accessibility and affordability of F&Vs among low-income Americans have been hindered by the food consumption cycle associated with poverty: the tendency to over-consume calories shortly after receiving funds at the beginning of each month, draining the budget for F&V purchases, or for all food purchases, by month's end. Increasing food assistance funding alone does not resolve this problem, but an emerging theory about dietary behavior suggests that providing funds for food in smaller installments distributed throughout the month will smooth the consumption cycle and improve healthy eating?counteracting the tendency to respond to lump sum, once-monthly funding installments by purchasing calorie-dense foods immediately after funds are received. The theory also suggests that funds targeted toward specific healthy foods (e.g., F&Vs) will improve diets more than untargeted funds, despite the in- convenience of utilizing targeted funds. Our preliminary data support both hypotheses, which we will rigorously test in a real-world setting by comparing alternative approaches for delivering food purchasing vouchers. We have established and tested the infrastructure to provide vouchers accepted by all major food stores (e.g., supermarkets, corner shops) in two low-income neighborhoods. Leveraging this innovative infrastructure, in Aim 1 we propose a randomized trial with a two-by-two factorial design, comparing $20 of vouchers valid for one month to four $5 vouchers each valid for a sequential week of the month (lump sum versus distributed funding), and comparing vouchers restricted to F&V purchases to vouchers redeemable for any food (targeted versus untargeted funding). Low-income adults (N=288) recruited through our community partners will be randomized to one of four 6-month interventions: monthly targeted, monthly untargeted, weekly targeted, or weekly untargeted vouchers. Participants will be assessed through efficient verbal 24-hour dietary recalls validated among low-literacy populations, to determine daily consumption of F&Vs and metrics of overall dietary quality at months 0, 6 and 12 (6 months after vouchers end). Additional surveys will identify moderators and mediators of dietary improvement. In Aim 2, we will calculate the cost-effectiveness of the voucher programs. Vouchers and other interventions that support healthy diets reduce population-level CVD disparities over the course of decades. Hence, the full costs and benefits of such interventions are not possible to directly observe through time-limited trials. Following recent NIH policy statements, we will overcome this problem by applying an innovative, validated microsimulation modeling approach?a systems science method that integrates trial results with comprehensive data on the effect of dietary changes on CVD risks and costs over the life course. We will identify which voucher delivery strategies cost-effectively reduce CVD disparities?addressing a key scientific uncertainty in healthy eating intervention research."
"9312006","Medulloblastoma (MB) is a cancer arising within the cerebellum, and is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Current care which relies on radiotherapy and chemotherapy, only cures 60% of patients, and has serious long-term neurocognitive sequelae in survivors, hence the unmet medical need to develop more efficacious, less toxic therapies for this disease. Malignant brain tumors including the sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup of MB are driven by tumor propagating cells (cancer stem cells; CSCs) expressing the cell surface glycoprotein CD15. A knowledge gap exist in that the molecular mechanisms controlling CSC and non CSC phenotypes are poorly delineated. The central hypothesis for this proposal is that the PI3K/PTEN signaling axis exerts control over the CSC phenotype in SHH MB and hence represents a target for therapeutic exploitation with PI3K inhibitors. Importantly, work from our laboratory has demonstrated that PTEN expression is suppressed in the CSC compartment of the Smo transgenic (SHH pathway) mouse model of MB. The clinical relevance of the PTEN deficient Smo transgene mouse model is highlighted by our finding that PTEN expression is lost in human MB, and the observation that PTEN loss correlates with poor survival in MB patients. Our grant proposal, guided by our preliminary data proposes 3 specific aims: 1) Determine if genetic alterations in PTEN or specific isoforms of PI3K are necessary and/or sufficient for SHH driven CSC phenotype and tumorigenesis 2) Utilize high throughput kinome library screens and genomic profiling of mouse and human MB CSCs and non CSCs to identify a molecular signature and synthetic lethality effects which will predict sensitivity or resistance to a PI-3K inhibitor. 3) Elucidate the epigenetic mechanism by which PTEN is regulated in the CSC compartment in human SHH PDX models and the SmoTg GEMM model; Focused on PTEN specific miRNA regulatory networks. We will use the Math1creER recombinase to generate the conditional deletion of PTEN, p110? and/or p110? in normal cerebellar granule neuronal precursor cells (GNPs) or in the CSC compartment and determine the effects on the development of MB and CSC phenotype. In Aim 2, we will expand upon our recent report demonstrating the activity of the PI3K inhibitor, BKM120 against CSCs to include synthetic lethality screens with other targeted agents and conventional chemotherapeutics. An innovative component of our application is the recent discovery of a novel miRNA network which epigenetically regulates PTEN in the CSC compartment which is associated with the CSC phenotype. This observation will be explored in our GEMMs , MB PDX models and in human MB tumor samples to determine the role of these miRNAs in the regulation of PTEN, PI3K and the CSC phenotypes including tumor initiating activity. The proposed work is significant in that it will: 1) establish a role for PTEN, p110? and p110? in CSC biology in MB 2) identify novel synthetic lethalities in combination with PI3K inhibition in MB CSCs and 3) elucidate a role for miRNA networks in the control of PTEN and CSC phenotypes."
"9308680","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rotating shield brachytherapy (RSBT) is a novel form of high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) delivered through shielded, rotating, catheters, which provide unprecedented control over radiation dose distributions. RSBT is expected to provide superior sub-volume boosting and toxicity relative to any existing radiotherapy modality, resulting in a paradigm shift in HDR-BT for many cancer sites. Although RSBT was conceptualized more than ten years ago, its clinical implementation poses tremendous challenges, demanding fundamentally advanced innovative technologies. With recent development of radiation sources, an effective and efficient RSBT treatment planning system has become a limiting factor for clinical development of RSBT. To this end, this project will develop fundamentally novel technology and algorithms to break the formidable computational barriers to bring RSBT into clinic.  We hypothesize that rotating shield brachytherapy, powered with advanced treatment planning techniques and software, will provide significant dosimetric improvements in tumor coverage and critical structure avoidance relative to conventional HDR-BT, with a clinically acceptable delivery time. We propose to: 1) Develop an efficient compressed sensing based RSBT inverse dose optimization method, enabling  sparse intensity modulation and optimized homogeneity of dose distributions with smooth fluence  maps in the resulting treatment plan. 2) Develop efficient shield sequencing methods to optimize the delivery of RSBT treatment plans, striving to achieve the best tradeoff between plan quality and treatment time, and to facilitate clinicians' decision making on selecting the best patient-specifi treatment plan. 3) Dosimetrically validate the RSBT treatment planning system retrospectively with clinical cases of cervical cancers and prostate cancers previously treated with HDR-BT. As a result, our project will pave the road to make RSBT clinically available, triggering a new era in brachytherapy delivery."
"9327125","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS: Ribosomopathies are caused by disruptions in making ribosomes, the intricate molecular machines responsible for synthesizing all cellular proteins. While one might expect defects in such an essential process to result in an inviable organism, such disorders instead manifest in tissue-specific signs and symptoms. In the ribosomopathy Treacher Collins syndrome, this tissue specificity manifests in craniofacial defects arising from the nucleolar stress response in stress-sensitive neural crest cells. Mutations in the Paired box 9 (PAX9) gene result in the loss of more than six permanent teeth, or oligodontia, as well as craniofacial dysmorphology and hair loss. These symptoms are similar to those of the ribosomopathy, Treacher Collins syndrome. A genome-wide siRNA screen in human MCF10A cells for proteins required for the production of ribosomes revealed an unexpected role for the RNA Polymerase II (POL II) transcription factor, PAX9, in human ribosome biogenesis. Preliminary results have shown that PAX9 depletion results in defects in pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing as well as in decreased transcription of a subset of genes that encode nucleolar proteins. I hypothesize that PAX9 alters mammalian ribosome biogenesis indirectly by promoting the transcription of one or more of these genes required for making ribosomes in the cell nucleolus. I propose that the craniofacial dysmorphology and oligodontia seen in humans with PAX9 mutations is connected to PAX9?s crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. SPECIFIC AIMS: Specific Aim 1 will confirm that the PAX9 protein is required for the transcription of candidate genes encoding nucleolar proteins. I will confirm that the northern blot phenotype is directly related to PAX9?s transcription of the candidates. I will also demonstrate that PAX9 binds directly to and regulates the transcription of the candidate genes. Specific Aim 2 will test the extent to which PAX9 depletion or mutation in a developing embryo connects craniofacial dysmorphology to ribosome biogenesis. First, I will establish Xenopus tropicalis as a model system for studying the effects of PAX9 on both craniofacial development and ribosome biogenesis. I will then test the extent to which the candidate genes from Specific Aim 1 recapitulate the defects seen upon PAX9 depletion."
"9310010","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomaterials significantly impact the quality of life of thousands of people as evident from their role in contact lenses to deep brain stimulators. In this competitive renewal application, we propose the continuation of a program that is anchored by excellent training faculty, outstanding, productive students, and a collaborative and nurturing environment. Over the past five years, the GTBioMAT training program has focused on integrating three important skill sets that are critical to training the future leaders in Biomaterals science and engineering: 1) the ability to synthesize and characterize new materials whose design is driven by an understanding of the underlying clinical and basic science issues; 2) the ability to functionalize and apply these materials such that they integrate appropriately into livig systems; and 3) develop leadership skills in the trainees such that they lead the next generation of Biomaterials Science and Engineering research through their innovation and research. We have attracted a strong and diverse set of trainees to the program who are making excellent progress as evident from their publications, presentations and the leadership roles they are assuming on campus. The critical strengths of our training program are: 1) An superlative group of training faculty, with an excellent diversity by research interest, expertise, age, rank, gender and race that spans multiple departments at Georgia Tech and Emory; 2) An outstanding and diverse student pool interested in Biomaterials research drawn from the best institutions across the United States; 3) A unique core course sequence designed to provide contextually-relevant, skills for the rational design and synthesis of polymeric materials; 4) Integration of clinical faclty at multiple levels of student training (from thesis committees to mentor luncheons); 5) A unique, innovative and successful graduate leadership program for trainees whose impact extends to the campus more broadly. We believe that our training program is on target to leverage the unique strengths and environment extant at Georgia Tech and Emory School of Medicine to train the next generation of Biomaterials scientists who lead and contribute with unique skills that range from synthesizing new materials to being self-aware and influencing the world in a positive manner."
"9304800","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genomic Sciences Training Program (GSTP) is training the new generation of genomic scientists with strengths spanning across multiple disciplines. The training opportunities and environment we propose will enable our trainees to develop and apply new tools, derived from technological advances that are informed by cutting-edge statistical and computational approaches that functionalize diverse and large datasets. The new genomic approaches to biological and medical investigation demand scientists who are knowledgeable and skilled across several fields in effective ways that potentate new insights or inventions. Accordingly, the emergence of new tools allowing for the creation and interpretation of large-scale experimental efforts is what GSTP has focused on by the didactical interweaving of investigative approaches drawn from multiple fields (biology, genetics, physical sciences, engineering, computer science, and statistics) that were individually contoured for complementing a trainee's core disciplinary focus, yet built upon achievement and knowledge within the genomic sciences. Given the incredibly rich scientific and engineering breadth of the University of Wisconsin, GSTP was able to recruit outstanding trainees who greatly advanced mass spectroscopy, microarray technologies, computation, and bio-devices, while exploring new applications leveraging these advantages for cutting-edge investigation into proteomics, transcription, metabolomics, and genome biology. Such achievement has spawned the establishment of a significant genomics community on our campus through networking of trainees and trainers to become central hubs for groundbreaking collaborations reaching across departments, centers, and other training programs. We propose for the renewal of this program that we continue this focus with added emphasis on programmatic evaluation of GSTP, increased training in developing methods for analyzing and interpreting large datasets, and fostering of clinical applications. We request funding for training on a yearly basis: 10 predoctoral (1-3 yrs), 4 postdoctoral (1-3 yrs), and 2 short-term (0.25 yr) trainees; we will seek trainees with recent undergraduate and graduate degrees."
"9304353","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to identify cellular defects that are caused by mutations in genes linked to Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), using the C. elegans neuromuscular junction as a model. In particular, we will test two prominent models for pathophysiological mechanisms in ASD. First, we test the idea that ASD linked genes play a direct role in regulating activity induced gene expression. Second, we will determine if ASD linked genes alter the synaptic targeting of GABAA receptors, thereby altering inhibitory synaptic strength. A critical feature of the genetics of ASD is that mutations conferring risk are nearly always heterozygous in affected individuals, implying that the majority of ASD linked genes are dose sensitive. Thus, we will ask if activity-induced gene expression and synaptic targeting of GABAA receptors are sensitive to copy number variations in ASD linked genes. In addition to testing their potential importance in the pathophysiology of ASD, our Aims address basic mechanisms controlling nervous system development and function."
"9243913","The National Research Action Plan (NRAP) (2013) called attention to the alarmingly high rates of combat-related PTSD observed among service members and veterans deployed in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result, the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD (CAP) was formed to a) significantly advance treatment strategies for PTSD including interventions for early, chronic, and latent onset cases, and b) to identify and confirm clinically relevant biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of PTSD and co-occurring disorders. This project aims to fill gaps identified in the NRAP by examining the validity of genetic-based biomarkers to identify PTSD, PTSD course, and response to PTSD treatment. We plan to leverage extensive existing resources in the STRONG STAR Repository to examine a comprehensive set of genetic and epigenetic markers associated with PTSD. These resources include: (1) a collection of human postmortem tissue of PTSD (n=30) and matched control (n=60) brains; (2) a cohort of service members treated for PTSD with blood collected prior to treatment and at 6 months post-treatment (n=600); and (3) an epidemiologic cohort of Soldiers assessed prior to and after deployment in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn that included blood collection and PTSD assessment at each assessment (n=4,112). Using a combination of whole-genome microarray and sequencing approaches, we will: (1) identify genetic (SNP, mRNA) or epigenetic (DNA methylation, microRNA) alterations in PTSD; (2) characterize the neuronal morphology of selected brain regions in PTSD and matched controls through Golgi impregnation; (3) identify top gene regulatory networks among the identified set of genes across the samples to guide biomarker analyses; and (4) systematically identify, validate, and test biomarkers based on the mRNA, SNPs, DNA methylation, and microRNA markers of identified genes. We have assembled a collaborative team of scientists consisting of a genetic epidemiologist (Dr. Williamson), a psychiatric geneticist (Dr. Gelernter), a geneticist (Dr. Carless), a neuroanatomist (Dr. Selemon), human postmortem experts (Drs. Young, Kleinman, Hyde, Thompson, & Cruz), biostatisticians (Drs. Mintz, Gelfond, Michelek, & Jaffe), and a clinical psychologist (Dr. Litz). In addition, we propose to collaborate with the DoD Integrated Systems Biology group (Drs. Jett & Hammamieh) to leverage SysBioCube in order to gain a systems level perspective of our ?-omics? data that will in turn guide our biomarker discovery work. It is expected that this project will be an important first step in filling the genomic and biomarker gaps in PTSD identified by the NRAP and facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panels to aid in the detection, treatment, and prevention of PTSD."
"9396954","Inflammatory peripheral neuropathies constitute one of the largest and least understood spectrums of neurologic disorders. Among these disorders is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), a disabling inflammatory autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Inflammatory peripheral neuropathies collectively represent a major socioeconomic strain to our Veteran patient population and to the Veterans Health Administration. Despite overwhelming prevalence and socioeconomic impact, the treatment options available for Veterans suffering from inflammatory peripheral neuropathies, including AIDP, remain palliative, nonspecific, and ineffective.  Immunization of susceptible strains of laboratory animals with peripheral nerve myelin P2 peptide and adjuvant induces experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), which closely models the pathogenicity of AIDP. Statins, a group of established cholesterol lowering agents, therapeutically attenuate EAN by inhibiting the transendothelial migration of autoreactive leukocytes into peripheral nerves. The effect of statins on the immune system is now known to be pleiotropic. Our lab has demonstrated that statins specifically attenuate TNF-? mediated release of the chemokine CCL2 from the peripheral nerve microvascular endoneurial endothelial cells (PNMECs) that form the blood-nerve barrier (BNB).  Poor bioavailability necessitates high systemic doses to achieve the pleiotropic effects of statins, and rare but serious side effects preclude clinical translation. Biomaterials-based drug delivery represents a novel means by which to administer drugs that exhibit low bioavailability and high systemic toxicity. Poly(lactic-co- glycolic)acid (PLGA) can be used to form biodegradable nanoparticles that encapsulate hydrophobic compounds, including statins, for controlled release. In addition, PLGA can be modified to express moieties that direct circulating particles to sites of inflammation, allowing for targeted systemic administration.  In this CDA-2 application, our objective is to determine the therapeutic potential of a novel, targeted drug delivery system to modulate endothelial GTPase signaling at the inflamed peripheral nerve. To accomplish this, we will utilize PLGA nanoparticles that encapsulate lovastatin and are surface-functionalized with purified macrophage plasma membranes. We hypothesize that targeted disruption of endothelial GTPase signaling with functionalized, lovastatin-encapsulating nanoparticles will therapeutically limit CCL2-dependent trafficking of autoreactive leukocytes in EAN. This will be tested using in vitro and in vivo approaches. First, we will assess the ability of surface-functionalized, PLGA nanoparticles to adhere to, migrate across, and deliver a payload within the activated BNB in vitro. Second, we will determine the therapeutic potential of targeting the inflamed BNB with systemically-administered, surface-functionalized, lovastatin-encapsulating nanoparticles in EAN. Third, we will elucidate the roles of Cdc42 and RalA GTPases in activation of the BNB in vitro under flow conditions.  The immediate goals of this VA RR&D CDA-2 program are evaluating the therapeutic potential of targeted disruption of GTPase signaling in EAN while continuing to elucidate the mechanisms governing chemokine expression and pathological transendothelial migration at the blood-nerve barrier. Thus, this program will significantly advance the development of novel, selective immune-modulating strategies for the management and rehabilitation of Veterans with debilitating inflammatory peripheral neuropathies."
"9314640","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which distinct subtypes of excitatory projection neurons of the neocortex govern the laminar distribution of their interneuron partners, and to define whether acquisition of projection neuron subtype-specific identity is necessary for proper connectivity with local interneurons. The work aims at understanding the contribution of different classes of projection neurons to the establishment of balanced cortical microcircuitry. High-level neocortical function including cognition, sensory perception and motor function relies on the coordinated assembly of a local microcircuitry among an astonishing diversity of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Indeed, disgenesis and/or disfunction of the local microcircuitry is associated with epilepsy, psychiatric disease and neurodevelopmental disorders [1-3]. The developmental events governing the integration of projection neurons and interneurons into balanced circuitry are poorly understood. We have reported on the central role played by projection neurons in governing this process and the precision by which different subtypes of projection neurons uniquely and differentially determine the laminar distribution of distinct classes of cortical interneurons [4]. We found that absence of subcerebral projection neurons from the neocortex of Fezf2 null-mutant mice and their replacement by commissural projection neurons cause abnormal lamination of interneurons and altered GABAergic inhibition. In agreement, experimental generation of either subcerebral projection neurons or callosal neurons in proximity to the cortex is sufficient to recruit cortical interneurons to these ectopic locations, with class-specificity. The data demonstrate that individual populations of projection neurons cell-extrinsically control the laminar fate of specific interneuron classes with striking precision. This suggests the existence of a molecular code that governs the specific interaction between projection neuron and interneuron partners during assembly of the local circuitry. Here, we build on this published work, as well as our recent demonstration that the identity of postmitotic projection neurons can be reprogrammed from one subtype into another in vivo [5] to answer the following questions: 1) Is there a molecular code enabling subtype-specific interactions among classes of projection neurons and interneurons to guide interneuron lamination? What are the molecules involved? (Aim 1) 2) Are codes of cadherin family members involved in establishing proper interneuron lamination? (Aim 2) 3) Is the acquisition of projection neuron subtype-specific identity necessary for the establishment of balanced circuitry/connectivity with interneuron partners? Does the inhibitory input by specific classes of interneurons change upon a change in projection neuron class-specific identity? (Aim 3) We present substantial published and pilot data supporting the significance and feasibility of this work."

"9306921","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are over five million Americans living with heart failure (HF), and another 670,000 new cases being diagnosed each year. HF is a characteristically unstable condition that is the most costly diagnosis in the Medicare population and is the most common cause for hospitalization. The instability of HF disease is reflected in short-term fluctuations of the HF disease biomarker, B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). Patient self-management behaviors are important for minimizing HF disease instability. Depression is often comorbid with HF, and elevated depressive symptoms are associated with a marked increase in adverse clinical outcomes. For both depressed and non-depressed HF patients, worsening depressive symptoms mark a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular hospitalization or death. Despite the risk associated with depressive symptoms, the nature of their association with a worsening HF disease trajectory and adverse clinical outcomes is poorly understood. Converging evidence suggests that the association between depressive symptoms and accelerated HF disease progression may involve multiple behavioral and pathophysiological pathways. This application proposes an innovative, prospective bio-behavioral monitoring study of 220 HF patients with systolic dysfunction that is designed to address the issue of how depressive symptoms and their bio-behavioral manifestations are implicated in worsening HF disease. Using newly developed home-monitoring biotechnology, we propose to track fluctuations in HF disease severity using weekly assessments of BNP over a 16-week period. Symptoms of depression and HF-related health behaviors also will be assessed weekly via concurrent monitoring. This weekly bio-behavioral monitoring will be framed by comprehensive baseline and 4-month assessments of depression, HF disease severity, and pathophysiological mechanisms that have been related to the presence of depressive symptoms and implicated in the progression of HF disease. Clinical outcomes also will be assessed over a subsequent 2- year follow-up period. The proposed study will create a unique data structure that will allow us to use contemporary statistical methods that will serve to elucidate causal associations between depressive symptoms, self-management health behaviors, pathophysiological processes, and HF disease progression and clinical outcomes. The study findings are expected to yield important advances in our understanding of why depressive symptoms may be particularly detrimental in the presence of HF and will help to inform the design of future clinical trials."
"9305152","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses a matter of key importance for drug discovery: development of biomarkers that monitor drug effects in vivo. We focus on myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica) type 1 (DM1), the most common muscular dystrophy in adults. DM1 is a dominantly inherited disorder caused by expression of DM protein kinase (DMPK) transcripts that contain an expanded CUG repeat (CUGexp). A well-understood consequence of CUGexp RNA expression includes mis-regulation of alternative splicing (RNA toxicity). In DM1 mouse models, therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides induce correction of alternative splicing patterns through modulation of CUGexp RNA toxicity. We, and others, are screening for endogenous biomarkers of disease activity and drug effect. In this proposal, we adopt an alternative approach by engineering novel biomarkers that enable non-invasive or minimally invasive detection, within minutes, of whether new treatments are having their intended effect. Our overall strategy involves the use of non-invasive fluorescence measurements to identify in vivo correction of alternative splicing in live DM1 mouse models. Efforts will include development of a high throughput in vivo screening assay to identify candidate drugs. The ultimate goal is to develop novel biomarkers that enable rapid identification of drug effects, demonstrate minimal toxicity, speed throughput of drug discovery, and, with modification, will translate to patients. Our approach will have broad application for genetic disorders beyond DM1 that are candidates for RNA modulation therapies."
"9369682","PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instructions):  The Biology of Colon Cancer Program (BCCP) encompasses an organ-systems and translational approach to understanding genetic and environmental factors that establish and maintain normal intestinal mucosal homeostasis and the perturbations that increase the probability for, and drive the development of, intestinal cancer. There are four overlapping themes, with many of the members investigating multiple themes: (I) the tumor microenvironment (inflammation, heterotypic cell interactions, and the intestinal microbiome), and its impact on genome integrity; (ii) maintenance of genomic integrity and the impact of nutrition and aging as major, interacting risk factors for sporadic colon cancer; (iii) intestinal cell maturation and stem cell biology; and (iv) altered metabolism as a marker of risk and driver of tumor development. The broad scientific goals of this program are to: first, understand how normal intestinal maturation and mucosal homeostasis are regulated by the integration of many different inter- and intracellular, and environmental, signals; and second, determine how failure in the integration of these systems compromises genomic integrity and mucosal homeostasis, thus elevating the probability of tumor development and progression. During the last funding period, the BCCP expanded from 11 to 18 members, recruiting both senior and junior faculty many already collaborating with members of the BCCP. Noteworthy additions to the previously existing work in the BCCP are new, interactive investigations on physiological, metabolic and molecular alterations in the intestinal mucosa with age and diet, major risk factors in the development of sporadic colon cancer. Furthermore, the membership of the BCCP will be now be consolidated on the Einstein campus to foster greater interaction with existing AECC programs, the Diabetes Center, the Nathan Shock Center for Aging, and the Stem Cell Institute, and to facilitate extension of the organ-systems approach of this program to other members of the Einstein research community. There are currently 19 members from 9 departments, of whom 15 are new to the program, supported by 12 NCI grants ($2.5M Direct) and 17 other peer reviewed cancer-relevant grants ($6.6M Direct). Since the last CCSG review there have been 339 cancer-relevant research papers by members of this program of which 19% represent intraprogrammatic, and 25% represent interprogrammatic publications."
"9320003","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Advanced ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecologic malignancy, with a 5-year survival of less than 50% in advanced stages. The low survival can be greatly attributed to an absence of screening methods due to an inadequate understanding of the initial tumor initiating events leading to ovarian cancers. Recent clinical studies have identified ovarian carcinomas originating in the fimbriated ends of fallopian tubes. The epithelial cells in this environment are regularly exposed to the follicular fluid (FF) originating from cyclic ovulations throughout a woman?s lifespan. Interestingly, ovulation is highly associated with an increased ovarian cancer risk, and methods inhibiting ovulation decrease ovarian cancer incidence. FF can recapitulate some of the early markings of cancer progression when examined in vitro, however the factors within the FF responsible for this effect are unknown. Preliminary data from our laboratory has identified extracellular membrane vesicles, known as exosomes, as a major component of FF. These exosomes are able to increase proliferation of epithelial granulosa cells, and are taken up in vitro by human oviduct epithelial cells. In this proposal, we hypothesize that FF exosomes may have a physiological function on the oviduct epithelium, but may also be proliferative and mutagenic and contribute to the malignant transformation of oviductal epithelium. Furthermore, we will assess the role of FF in inducing gene expression and activity of a family of cytidine deaminases (APOBECs), which may play a role in the DNA damage effects of FF exposure. We will test this hypothesis using human and murine FF and their respective oviductal epithelial cells in vitro, and via in vivo analyses in an ovarian/oviductal cancer mouse model."
"9441146","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a highly disabling illness that impacts 0.5-1% of Americans. The disability of the illness is more strongly associated with cognitive deficits and negative symptoms than it is with the positive symptoms of the illness including hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms are generally defined as the absence of normal function, but the actual mechanisms involved in generating this absence have remained unknown, thereby stifling rational treatment development. The overarching goal of this application is to fundamentally alter the understanding of negative symptoms by rigorously testing a highly specific hypothesis about the origins of avolition/anhedonia in people with schizophrenia. This hypothesis has been formalized in a computational model that suggests that people with schizophrenia have a deficit in the ability to represent the positive expected value of stimuli and response alternatives, coupled with an intact ability to learn from aversive outcomes. This deficit in representing value is also thought to lead to reduced exploration of behavioral alternatives when uncertain about the likely payoffs of different choices. The project uses a program of behavioral experiments to test this hypothesis in the areas of learning from outcomes and decision making. In addition, we will explore the relationship between this deficit and current cognitive psychological models of the causes of negative symptoms, as well as the importance of this deficit for the prediction of successful outcome from a behavioral treatment approach that uses reinforcement to shape behavior. This computational approach also leads to a highly specific hypothesis about the neural mechanisms that are implicated in a deficit in representing expected value. To address this hypothesis, we will take advantage of the temporal resolution of EEG to test whether abnormalities in neural activity occur at the time of decision, as predicted, or instead occur at the time of feedback delivery, as would be expected if patients were unable to use the dopamine system to signal positive prediction errors when outcomes are better than expected. The goal of both the behavioral and neurophysiological studies is to provide an explicit, mechanistic understanding of negative symptoms and evaluate the application of this approach to current treatment approaches. Because reward circuitry is highly conserved across mammalian species, it should be possible to back translate to the animal models needed to guide drug development research."
"9521779","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is a common disease with significant heritability. For the past two decades a steady stream of gene discovery revealed some human epilepsy variants, and additional seizure-causing genes have been identified in animal models, but together these account for only a fraction of all human disease. In the past few years, rapid improvements in genome sequencing, along with a sophisticated understanding of how to use sequencing to mine variants in human populations, have begun to transform many medical research fields. Very recent individual and community-based sequencing efforts, including the NIH-funded Epi4k consortium, provide a first glimpse into what a discovery boom for epilepsy looks like. These efforts have mostly focused on a subset of disease - childhood epileptic encephalopathy (EE) - defined by intractable, seizures accompanied by cognitive decline, usually very severe. EE is not as common as idiopathic disease, but because of the severity and effect on children, it is a very motivating. Dominant EE variants are not usually heritable in the classical parent-to-child sense, but they can be detected as de novo or somatic mutations.  The first wave of Epi4K results was very encouraging. Our conservative estimate suggests that more than 80 EE genes are now on the map from just these first efforts. Some genes were previously known in epilepsy, including ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, but many are new. Standing between this unqualified success and successful therapies are several key questions, including: How do we know for sure which variants are causal and which are bystanders? Does this group of 80 (or more) genes imply that there are 80 (or more) ways to get disease, or do they instead converge onto a smaller number of pathological mechanisms? What is the relationship between seizures and cognitive decline - is co-dependence the rule or the exception? What neuron types/circuits are rate limiting for disease? Do milder alleles of EE genes also cause the genetically elusive, but more common, IGE?  Mutant mice provide powerful models for human disease, and the field of mouse genetics which had also evolved linearly over the years, acquiring sophisticated tools such as conditional gene targeting and strain diversity panels, has also exploded due to both genomic technologies and much more efficient and rapid gene targeting. We think the time has come to aggressively model precise human epilepsy mutations in mice and use them to address key questions. In the next few years we will employ the latest gene targeting approaches along with the diverse toolkit of mouse genetics to make new models, study the etiology seizures and behaviors in these mice, and explore relationships between genes to identify convergent pathological mechanisms."
"9303453","?    DESCRIPTION: The Center for Learning and Memory (CLM) at the University of Texas at Austin is an organized research unit that brings together researchers whose goal is to identify the neural mechanisms of learning and memory. The CLM has grown to include fifteen faculty, all hired since its inception in 2005. Given this growth, the highly interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the CLM faculty, and the major University commitment to this research field, we believe all key elements are in place to implement an innovative and active training program in learning and memory. The CLM faculty represent a broad range of approaches to the mechanisms of learning and memory - from the molecules of neural information processing and synaptic plasticity to cellular and systems level studies to functional neuroimaging in humans. We will leverage the strengths of this collaborative faculty along with innovative and comprehensive training activities to implement a program that prepares graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to become innovative leaders in the future of learning and memory research. The proposed training has four important components. First, we will provide our trainees with hands-on instruction in the implementation of interdisciplinary approaches to the study of learning and memory that cross levels of analysis. Second, we will provide extensive training in computational neuroscience methods that are increasingly necessary to understanding the neural mechanisms that support learning and memory. Third, the proposed activities will provide our trainees with the ability to place their research in a biomedical contet, with a particular emphasis on the role of learning and memory processes in disorders of mental health. Finally, the proposed activities and resources provide our trainees with many opportunities for career development including the skills necessary to obtain a tenure track position (e.g., presentation and grant writing skills) as well as exposure to research-related careers outside of academia. These components will prepare our trainees to be the next generation of leading edge researchers dedicated to uncovering the neural mechanisms that support our ability to acquire new information and remember past experiences."

"9324275","Abstract/Project Summary Title: Mechanistic details of key integral-membrane enzymes for antimicrobial discovery The increasing number of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria represents a significant threat to human health making the development of novel therapeutic strategies critical. The major component of the bacterial cell wall is the peptidoglycan layer that is a unique meshwork providing essential structural support; therefore, identifying ways to weaken this layer is an ideal antibiotic strategy. Currently, numerous therapeutics target the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway and their use has been extremely successful in medicine. The enzymes involved in the pathway have been extensively characterized except in the case of the membrane components. Most notable is MraY, an essential protein that catalyzes the first membrane step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. MraY is an integral membrane protein that has resisted mechanistic understanding. There are a few known inhibitors of MraY, such as nucleoside antibiotics, demonstrating its potential as an antibiotic target; however, none has been advanced into clinical development programs. Our group has developed efficient total synthesis schemes for two of the most promising natural products, capuramycin and muraymycin, allowing for the identification of improved compounds (e.g. UT-324). In this proposal we describe purified samples of MraY suitable for structural studies with inhibitor molecules, enzymatic substrate mimics, the viral protein E, or MurG. Purified MraY enzymes are used in in vitro activity assays for characterizing homologs and various inhibitors. We expand our synthetic strategy to generate broadly targeted chemical libraries and then test these for enzyme and bacterial growth inhibitory activities. Combining these efforts in one program creates a feedback loop that strengthens structural and medicinal chemistry aspects of the projects. Excitingly, our current efforts toward MraY structural characterization have yielded a promising co-crystal that demonstrates a model of an inhibited complex at low resolution. This application describes our goal of developing a thorough mechanistic picture of MraY that will allow us to design and identify novel inhibitors as lead compounds for drug discovery. The aims are to 1) expand on targeted small molecule libraries to identify new MraY inhibitors and 2) develop a full mechanistic understanding using structural and biochemical studies of MraY in a variety of functionally relevant states. Our combined team of structural biologists and synthetic chemists provides an innovative approach to achieve these important goals."
"9300915","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevention of Type 2 diabetes in an obese person with pre-diabetes requires developing a healthier lifestyle. The rational approach for someone with pre-diabetes would be to eat healthier, be more active, lose weight, and manage their comorbidities. However, preliminary research suggests that individuals with Type 2 diabetes discount the future and engage in behaviors that maximize current pleasure and short-term gain; thus, daily choices needed to improve future health are rare in this population. Delay discounting (DD) describes the choice of smaller immediate versus larger delayed rewards. This behavioral process is related to a wide variety of health choices, ranging from preventive health to behavioral and medical regimen adherence, including regimens used for Type 2 diabetes. We believe that DD provides a target for one type of self- regulation that can improve a wide variety of health behaviors and medical adherence.  Research from our laboratories has shown that episodic future thinking (EFT), a form of prospection which reduces the bias towards immediate gratification, activates brain regions involved in planning and prospection such that future rewards have increased value and the extent of delay discounting is reduced. Cueing individuals to think about future events during inter-temporal decision-making reduces the rate of DD, eating in and outside of the laboratory, and smoking behavior. The overarching goal of this grant is to use an experimental medicine approach to translate basic research on DD and EFT into clinical interventions to prevent the transition from pre-diabetes to a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. We are using the grant mechanism RFA-RM-14-020, Science of Behavior Change: Assay Development and Validation for Self-Regulation Targets (UH2/UH3) as this provides for the opportunity to integrate observational, laboratory and field studies to assess relationships between DD and disease self-management, understand mechanisms of these relationships across multiple levels of analysis, and refine interventions in preparation for a clinical trial.  e propose a series of observational, laboratory and field studies to identify DD as a behavioral target to improve behavioral and medical adherence and metabolic control in adults with pre-diabetes who are at high risk for development of Type 2 diabetes. Specific Aim 1 will examine the cross sectional relationship between DD, executive function, and fMRI-measured brain activation to predict adherence and metabolic control in persons diagnosed with pre-diabetes. Specific Aim 2 will assess the effects of EFT on DD, fMRI measured brain activation and energy intake in participants with pre-diabetes in the laboratory. Specific Aim 3 will assess the effects f EFT on DD and fMRI measured brain activation under simulations of poverty that increase discounting of the future. Specific Aim 4 extends the study of the effects of EFT on DD, executive function, health behavior change, medication adherence for comorbid conditions and glycemic control after a 6-month target engagement with EFT versus control in a field study for the UH3 component of this application."
"9315676","Summary/Abstract Ethanol is the most common teratogen and the leading cause of mental retardation. Fetal alcohol exposure can cause numerous birth defects, most commonly effecting the craniofacial skeleton and nervous system. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder describes the full range of potential ethanol-induced birth defects and has been estimated to have a prevalence of 10 in 1000 births. The timing and concentration of fetal alcohol exposure are important determinants of FASD phenotypes. There also appears to be genetic and epigenetic factors underlying FASD, yet we know almost nothing about the interaction between these factors. The zebrafish embryo is particularly useful for these types of analyses. In Aim 1, we identify and characterize ethanol-sensitive gene modules and the ethanol-sensitive miRNAs that target them. In Aim 2, we develop tools to determine how miRNA activity alters cell behaviors. Because of the conservation of gene function between zebrafish and humans, the results from our studies will provide key insights into the interaction between genetic and epigenetic factors underlying FASD. !"
"9307956","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease begins during infancy. With the advent of universal newborn CF screening, there is an opportunity to intervene early to prevent the airway disease that ultimately destroys the lungs. However, to forestall CF airway disease, we must understand its initiation and progression. It is known that CF patients manifest a defect in airway host defense. One important component of host defense is mucociliary transport (MCT), the removal of particulates and pathogens from airways. It is widely assumed that impaired MCT causes CF lung disease. That assumption derives primarily from the fact that MCT is defective when disease is advanced. However by that time, bronchiectasis could be responsible. Unfortunately, current tests of MCT have limited sensitivity and often fail to detect defects, even in CF adults. Lack of a model has prevented elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms. Our long-term goal is to understand the causes of CF airway disease and use that knowledge to prevent and treat disease. The objective of this proposal is to learn how CF alters MCT and discover the responsible mechanisms. To achieve that objective, we will study a novel porcine model of CF that closely parallels the human disease, and we will answer three general questions. Aim 1. Does loss of CFTR alter MCT in newborn pigs? We will focus on MCT in vivo at the genesis of disease. We have exciting preliminary data using a new in vivo MCT assay and interrogation of discrete particles. We predict that stimulating mucus secretion will reveal striking MCT heterogeneity in CF pigs, with some particles moving fast, some slow and some not moving at all. Aim 2. Does the development of CF airway disease impair MCT in vivo? CF is not a static disease. Once it begins in neonates, inflammation, viral and bacterial infections, and airway wall remodeling accelerate disease. We will be able to learn for the first time how MCT changes with time and how those factors alter MCT in vivo. Aim 3. What factors alter MCT in CF? To identify factors that disrupt MCT, we developed a novel ex vivo approach using freshly excised airways. Our intriguing preliminary data reveal that CF disrupts release of mucus from the airway surface. Our working hypothesis is that a reduced pH and/or HCO3 concentration in airway surface liquid impair the normal behavior of airway mucus."

"9303464","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cuneate nucleus (CN) of the brainstem receives ascending input from somatosensory afferents that innervate the skin, joints, and muscles as well as descending input from sensorimotor cortex. While the tactile and proprioceptive response properties of primary afferents and of neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) have been extensively characterized, virtually nothing is known of the response properties of CN neurons. Multiple types of cutaneous afferents innervate the glabrous skin of the hand and play different albeit overlapping roles in tactile perception. Tactile afferents exhibit highly patterned, repeatable responses when their receptive fields are touched. Likewise, receptors in muscles and tendons provide signals related to muscle length, length change, and force. Within S1, the properties of neurons have been extensively characterized and are very different from their peripheral counterparts. First, S1 neurons receive convergent input from multiple somatosensory submodalities. Second, neurons in S1 convey high-level, processed information about stimulus features (edge orientation, surface texture, direction of limb movement). Third, S1 responses can be strongly modulated by the behavioral state of the animals. We propose to characterize, for the first time, the response properties of CN neurons in awake primates and assess (1) the degree to which signals from different somatosensory submodalities converge onto single CN neurons; (2) the extent to which the feature selectivity observed in S1 begins to emerge in CN; (3) the degree to which the state-dependence of S1 responses stems from CN. We anticipate that the present study will have important implications for our understanding of somatosensory processing and may inform the development of subcortical interfaces for brain-machine interfaces used to restore somatosensation in patients with spinal cord injury or who have lost a limb."
"9344668","Project Summary Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies revolutionized the fields of genetics and genomics by allowing rapid and inexpensive sequencing of billions of bases. Although basic analysis tools for each individual data type are abundant, statistical methods that can integrate different sources of data for addressing key, challenging questions are lacking. We propose to develop integrative methods for critical, widely used, applications urgently requiring reliable statistical integration tools. At the core of our methods is effective integration of multiple appropriate data types with novel statistical methods. First, although, to date, large numbers of protein-DNA interactions and histone modifications are mapped, systematic methods that allow users to query these data and generate testable hypotheses are lacking. Second, in parallel to generation of (epi)genomic profiles, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful at identifying disease and trait-associated genetic variants (GVs). However, our ability to identify causal variants and elucidate the mechanisms by which genotypes influence phenotypes is hampered by significant obstacles. Third, although the utility of reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads) has been well established for some NGS applications such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, all the analysis methods for the emerging data type CLIP-seq that interrogates RNA binding proteins rely on using only reads that map uniquely to reference genome (uni-reads) leading to unreliable inference. We plan to address these critical challenges by developing (1) Fast and scalable integrative statistical methods for joint analysis of multiple ChIP-seq datasets to enable both individual data level inference and identification of joint effects; (2) A statistical analysis framework for integrating GWAS results with the increasing numbers of genome-wide maps of functional annotations; (3) An integrative multi-read mapping framework for studying RNA-protein interactions through CLIP-seq experiments. The projects will be accomplished through a combination of methodological development, simulation, computational analysis, and experimental validation. Methods will be developed and evaluated using datasets from the ENCODE and REMC as well as novel datasets from collaborators. Statistical resources generated from the project will be disseminated in publicly available software. Collectively, these aims will significantly improve the utility of genome-wide data types that are available to researchers."

"9312741","Summary  Filoviruses, which include the Ebola viruses (EBOV) and Marburg viruses (MARV) are non-segmented,  negative-sense RNA viruses (NNSVs) that cause severe disease. Fundamental to filovirus replication is the  viral RNA synthesis machinery. Viral proteins, in concert with cis- and trans-acting factors, regulate the viral  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). However, we lack a comprehensive understanding as to how such  factors works together to regulate viral RNA synthesis. This project (Project 1) will build upon several novel  observations by the Basler lab and upon data generated in Projects 2 and 3 of this program to determine the  mechanisms by which specific cis-acting sequences and trans-acting proteins modulate filovirus replication. It  will also define the functional consequences of these mechanisms for replication. One observation was the  identification of short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5' UTRs of the EBOV VP35, VP30, VP24  and L mRNAs as cis-acting regulators of protein expression. The L uORF was further demonstrated to  modulate L protein translation in response to cell stress and eIF-2? phosphorylation levels. We hypothesize  that this provides a mechanism by which the virus regulates expression of its RDRP machinery in response to  the innate immune status of the host cell. We will use reporter gene-based approaches and ribosomal  footprinting methods to determine how filoviral UTRs and uORFs modulate mRNA translation and design  mutant recombinant EBOVs to assess these functions in the context of infection. A second finding was the  identification of several previously unrecognized sites in both EBOV and MARV where substantial mRNA  editing occurs. This is similar to the previously recognized editing of the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) mRNA,  where the viral RDRP adds non-template encoded ?As? at a site that corresponds to a specific polyU stretch on  the template genomic RNA. Because the determinants of editing frequency by the filoviral RDRP remain  incompletely defined and because the biological significance of the edited mRNAs' translation products is  unclear, we will use a reconstituted viral RDRP complex and deep sequencing approaches to define cis-acting  elements that regulate editing events. Finally, we and others have identified trans-acting factors such as the  cellular proteins LC8, PACT and, DRBP76 as modulators of EBOV RNA synthesis. These observations  support the hypothesis that host factors will modulate viral RDRP function in significant ways. Studies  performed in Project 2 of this application will define interactions among the viral proteins that comprise the  EBOV RDRP complex. Project 3 will comprehensively evaluate host factors for modulation of virus replication.  Project 1 will use established transfection-based assays of viral RNA synthesis to evaluate the impact of LC8,  PACT and, DRBP76 and newly identified interactions on the viral RDRP and define mechanisms of action. In  total, these studies will provide substantial new insights into mechanisms regulating filovirus RNA synthesis  that may be exploited for therapeutic development."
"9251905","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is highest in developed nations, and the reasons may include high psychological stress and insufficient sleep, each of which increases systemic inflammation and impairs vascular health. Arterial stiffness (AS), a vascular property that worsens with chronic inflammation, has emerged as an early, independent predictor of CVD risk, providing prognostic information beyond standard models that include blood pressure. Our preliminary data suggest that a) objectively assessed sleep is inversely associated with AS; b) ecological momentary assessed (EMA) stress dynamically increases AS; and, c) those with a greater AS response to laboratory stress have higher 24hr average AS. These pilot data are evidence that high real world AS may be due to both repeated instances of ?arterial stiffening? during stress and to overall insufficient sleep. We propose to utilize both field and controlled laboratory methods to determine, 1) the effect of EMA psychological stress on momentary AS; 2) the effect of actigraphy-assessed sleep duration on AS; and 3) the acute effects of partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on next day AS, and on the AS response to psychological stress under controlled conditions. Field: 300 healthy adults will complete 7- days of actigraphy-assessed sleep that will include a single night assessment of sleep disordered breathing. For the 6th day/night and 7th day of assessment (36hrs), ambulatory AS with concurrent EMA of psychological stress, physical activity, and related factors will be accomplished every 60 minutes. Lab: 132 of these individuals who demonstrate 6.5-8.9 hrs actigraphy-assessed sleep/night for at least 5-7 nights will spend 2 ½ days in the CRC (acclimation night, baseline sleep night, PSD night). On the morning after baseline and PSD nights, they will complete a psychological stress protocol under controlled laboratory conditions. Field Study - Hypothesis 1a: EMA assessed psychological stress will predict momentary AS; and Hypothesis 1b: actigraphy-assessed sleep duration will predict both, i) the average daytime AS and, ii) the AS response to EMA assessed psychological stress. We will explore the effect of average psychological stress and average sleep duration on average daytime and nocturnal AS, and AS dipping. Laboratory Study - Hypothesis 2: Compared to baseline sleep, PSD will be associated with a) higher next day AS, and b) a greater AS response to laboratory psychological stress. We will explore the relationship of inflammation to both resting AS and laboratory stress-related changes in AS, as a possible mechanism through which stress and sleep affect AS. Significance: Increasing stress and decreasing sleep are two modifiable factors endemic to developed nations where CVD risk is highest. AS has emerged as an early, independent predictor of CVD risk. The proposed study will provide a strong test of hypothesized effects on AS due to stress and sleep, thereby providing powerful targets for interventions such as stress management, sleep hygiene, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, to delay AS onset, and improve CV outcomes."
"9468933","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term career goal is to establish an independent research career addressing the hypothesis that bacterial biofilms mediate specific pathological effects against host innate immune cells within the wound environment which result in deviations from the normal wound healing process and lead to wound chronicity. My background in innate immunology and medical biofilms provides me with unique expertise enabling me to ask innovative and fundamental questions regarding immune cell-bacteria biofilm interactions. My research training as a graduate student in molecular methods and cell biology has also given me technical skills that will enable me to apply such tools for systems biology analysis of the chronic wound models; at present, I aim to complete my training by gaining expertise in NMR and MS metabolomic analysis, an essential approach to solving systems biology problems such as host- pathogen interactions. My goal with this career development plan is to develop the expertise and master the analytical tools necessary to integrate comprehensive metabolomics analyses into a global systems biology study of immune cell responses to bacterial biofilm exposure.  To address my objectives for this career development award, I have assembled a mentorship team with both the expertise to train me in the technical skils of interest and the experience to be effective mentors. Dr. Dratz has nearly 45 years of experience as a NIH supported researcher making him an excellent choice as Senior Mentor of my team. In the course of this award, my objective is to acquire expertise in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), in silico metabolic modeling, and chemometric analysis working closely with Drs. Copi?, Bothner, and Carlson all experts in their respective scientific disciplines. In adition to acquiring technical skils necessary to undertake te proposed metabolomics studies, I will seek out professional development. To that end, my career development plan includes participation in educational opportunities such as guest lecturing and the mentorship of a graduate student, participation in training for the Responsible Conduct of Research, and engagement in the larger scientific community through participation in conferences, publication, and the peer-review process of grants and manuscripts. Montana State University (MSU) provides an excellent environment for this training with facilities and equipment that has been acquired within the last few years to develop a state-of-the-art Metabolomics/Systems Biology Research Center, including access to the expertise of core facility managers in NMR, MS, and bioinformatics. In addition, opportunities for intellectual stimulation abound including the Systems Biology Journal Club and cross-disciplinary research.  The immediate objective of this career development plan is not only to acquire the technical expertise outlined above, but also to apply that training to the establishment of my own research program. My preliminary work led me to the hypothesis that the interface between innate immune cells and bacterial biofilms result in distinct metabolic profiles that can be manipulated for therapeutic treatment and perhaps can also be used for diagnostics. To assess the validity of this hypothesis, I propose to establish that the biofilm mode of growth of the opportunistic chronic wound pathogen P. aeruginosa results in distinct metabolic patterns and that the biofilms are especially sensitive to iron deprivation by the immune molecule lactoferrin, document that exposure to P. aeruginosa biofilms in vitro results in a metabolic deviation in innate immune cells as part of a phenotypic shift towards inflammation, and establish that introduction of lactoferrin to the in vitro host-pathogen chronic wound model results in metabolic starvation of the pathogen while shifting the innate immune cells toward a resident macrophage phenotype that more efectively resolves inflammation allowing the wound to progress to resolution. The studies proposed here have the potential to uncover mechanisms at the root of deviations from the normal healing process that result in the development of chronic wounds, and will provide molecular knowledge that may be used in the long term to develop novel therapeutic paths by the manipulation of metabolic pathways that control immune cell phenotype."
"9384400","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public."
"9501315","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common killer in both whites and blacks. However, blacks have a 2- fold increase in the incidence of CHD as well as a lower long-term survival compared to whites. These differences cannot be fully explained by demographic, clinical, or economic confounders between these groups. As myocardial infarction and stroke typically result from an occlusive platelet thrombus formed at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, understanding differences in the mechanisms by which platelets are activated in blacks and whites is expected to aid in our ability to optimally treat these populations following myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Our preliminary data demonstrates, for the first time, 1) racial differences in PAR4-mediated platelet aggregation, and 2) platelet mRNAs and microRNAs that are differentially expressed (DE) between blacks and whites and regulate PRA4 activation. The goals of this application are to characterize 1) the critical pathways and proteins responsible for these racial differences in platelet function, and 2 the molecular genetic basis for differences in gene expression. These goals will be addressed with physiology, biochemistry, genomic and cell biology approaches in human platelets and megakaryocytes. Aim 1 will dissect racial differences in platelet function using physiological and biochemical endpoints to assess PAR4 activation kinetics and absolute level of activity. By integrating the information attained in Aim 1, Aim 2 will evaluate novel candidate platelet genes DE expressed between blacks and whites. These genes will be characterized for their potential role in regulating the racial difference in PAR4-mediated reactivity of platelets. In particular, w find phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP), is significantly higher in platelets from blacks compared to platelets from whites. PC-TP regulates lipid movement in the cell, a critical process in platelet activation. Several other strong candidate platelet genes - also DE by race - will also be characterized. Aim 3 will focus on novel mechanisms of gene expression that account for racial differences in platelet aggregation. We have identified the first example of miRNAs that are DE by race and by PAR4-mediated platelet aggregation. We will genetically manipulate candidate miRNAs in cultured human megakaryocytes to assess their effects on regulating PAR4-mediated platelet/megakaryocyte reactivity. We will also assess the molecular basis for the differential expression of miRNAs. This study will be the first to characterize racial differences in platelet activation at the signaling, protein and genetic levels. Understanding the racial difference in platelet activity will fill a significant gap in our understanding of why blacs suffer a higher morbidity and mortality than whites following MI and stroke."

"9323666","Project Summary This project addresses the following hypotheses: 1. Virus will be spontaneously produced after stopping early ART from the earliest-established ?reservoir cells? in mucosal tissues (which Project 1 aims to identify). Candidates for the earliest-established reservoir cells in mucosal tissues (follicular helper T (Tfh), central memory T (Tcm), and Th17 cells) will each be studied ex vivo. T cell latency/reactivation models already described in the literature will be adapted and new models developed that use explanted human and macaque colon mucosa, as well as human tonsils. The former aims to study Th17, and the latter Tfh, cells as potential early reservoirs that may initiate rebound after ART. We will also pilot humanized DRAG mice as a model of female reproductive tract (FRT) mucosal Tfh reservoirs, and determine whether the tonsil explants or humanized mice are preferable for further study of Tfh cell-related mechanisms and interventions (in aims 2 and 3). Macaques with ART-suppression starting at day 3 after mucosal SIV infection, and continuing for 6 months before stopping, will also be studied in close collaboration with project 1. An observational study of HIV-infected subjects before and after pausing >1 year-long suppressive ART will be designed and performed (?Clinical Observation of Rebound after pausing ART?, CORA). 2. mTOR-mediated metabolic reprogramming triggered by T cell activation contributes to viremia rebound off-ART. Cellular mechanisms downstream of mTOR activity will be studied using catalytic mTOR inhibitors in ex vivo tissue and animal models, including in SIV-infected macaques suppressed by ART for 6 months before stopping it. Effects on both virus production from reservoir cells after early ART stops, and target cell susceptibility to virus, will be characterized. 3. Limited or absent virion A3G in virions initially-produced after stopping early ART contribute to the pathogenic cascade to viremia rebound. Model systems (ex vivo and/or humanized DRAG mice) will be used to test whether virus reservoir T cells have low A3G levels even before Vif is expressed (contributing to virus infectivity), and if A3G- boosting tool compounds decrease infectivity of virions produced from T cell reservoirs. We will assess if A3G- mediated decreased virus spread adds to mTOR inhibitor-mediated decreases in uninfected target T cell susceptibility to infection, and if changes in A3G's cytoplasmic distribution caused by mTOR inhibition enhance A3G booster-mediated increases in A3G virion packaging."
"9281780","A major challenge for the development of mechanism-based therapeutic strategies to treat FXS is the  diversity of FMRP target mRNAs, which encode proteins with a large variety of different functions in the  neuron. Our recent work suggests that FMRP directly regulates intracellular signaling and protein synthesis through the PI3K/mT0R pathway, which is downstream of mGlu1/5 and other receptors, by limiting the translation and synaptic localization of pi 10p, a catalytic subunit of PI3K. The overall goal of this project is to provide experimental support for our hypothesis that dysregulated activity of the PI3K catalytic subunit p110 beta is a promising therapeutic target in FXS. These studies motivate aim 1 to investigate whether the selective genetic reduction or pharmacologic inhibition of p110 beta can rescue FX-associated phenotypes, as a novel therapeutic strategy acting at a key signaling molecule downstream of cell surface receptors. To reduce p110 beta activity, we, will (1) cross Fm1l knockout mice with mice heterozygous for p110 beta, and (2) use p110 beta selective antagonists. Since p110 beta selective inhibitors are in current clinical trials for cancers resulting from overactive PI3K, the proposed research may repurpose these available drugs for FXS. We will analyze the effect of p110 beta inhibition on FXS-associated molecular and cellular dysfunctions, and, in collaboration with Eric Klann (EAB Core), on impaired synaptic plasticity and behavior. To test the applicability of a p110 beta-based strategy in patients, we will analyze the effect of p110 beta selective inhibitors on PI3K activity and protein synthesis in induced pluripotent stem cells from FXS patients (aim 3). By integration with projects and rescue strategies from the Klann and Richter labs, and associated cores, we will employ genome wide ribosome profiling and bioinformatic analysis to test the hypothesis that inhibition/reduction of P110 beta (Bassell), S6K1 (Klann) and CPEB (Richter) reduces excess mRNA translation by correction of ribosome occupancy defects in Fmr1 KO mice (aim 2) and human iPSC-derived neurons from FXS patients (aim 3). This integrated and multidisciplinary approach will provide new insight into converging mechanisms of FMRP biology to reveal novel strategies to rescue FXS-associated phenotypes and lead to new therapeutic approaches."
"9376831","The extent of genetic disparities between donor and recipients constitutes the main driver that determines the strength of alloimmunity and subsequent kinetics of graft rejection. In recent years, a role for environmental factors has emerged. Our preliminary results have identified 2 inter-related environmental factors that can modulate the strength of the alloimmune response. The first is the microbiota, represented by the communities of microbes that inhabit the body. Here, we reported that the elimination of microbiota through the use of germ- free (GF) mice, or a decrease of microbial diversity induced by broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx) in both donor and recipient mice prior to transplantation resulted in a reduction of alloreactivity and prolonged graft survival. Mechanistically, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from GF and Abx-pre-treated mice had a reduced capacity to prime donor-reactive T cells. The second environmental factor is high fat diet (HFD). We showed that obese mice mounted an augmented alloimmunity and rejected transplants faster than lean mice. Mechanistically, APCs from obese mice had a greater capacity to present alloantigen to T cells compared with APCs from lean mice, a mirror image of the phenotype observed in GF and Abx-treated mice. Based on established links between obesity and the gut microbiota, we propose that obesity-dependent dysbiosis super-activates APCs, which, in turn, induces a more potent priming of alloreactive T cells leading to accelerated kinetics of transplant rejection. Using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, we have identified increased proportions of Firmicutes and decreased proportions of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Interestingly, these changes were reversed in mice treated with bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomies, SGx), and in mice treated with TDCA/valine, co-metabolites that we found to be reduced in the serum of obese mice and restored by SGx. Of clinical relevance, we detected high levels of B. vulgatus, a commensal species that can metabolize TDCA, in the stool of an obese patient. Based on these preliminary data, we propose that shaping of microbial communities by diet modulates alloimmunity. Specifically, we hypothesize that obesity, via its alteration of the microbiota and through changes of co-metabolites in host/microbiota, enhances DC poising that results in increased priming of alloreactive T cells and accelerated graft rejection; those effects are reverted by bariatric surgery or through the restoration of metabolite levels. This hypothesis will be tested in the context of the following Specific Aims.  Specific Aim 1. To determine if the microbiota shaped by HFD before and after bariatric surgery differentially modulates alloimmunity and the kinetics of graft rejection. Specific Aim 2. To investigate the mechanisms by which the microbiota-dependent metabolites TDCA and valine that are decreased in obesity and restored by SGx, modulate alloimmunity and graft rejection. Specific Aim 3. To determine the effects of bariatric surgery on the microbiota, TDCA/valine serum levels, and APC tuning in a pilot human study."
"9369677","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Gene Targeting and Transgenic facility was founded over 20 years ago to assist AECC researchers in the generation of genetically modified mouse models of human disease. Until recently, the Gene Targeting and Transgenic components operated as independent Shared Resources, each being rated outstanding at the last CCSG review. Following relocation to new state-of-the-art laboratory space in the Price Center, the facilities were merged into one Gene Targeting and Transgenic Shared Resource. The Transgenic component of the facility continues to generate, with high efficiency (-100% success rate), transgenic mouse strains through the introduction of DNA sequences, such as regular plasmid vectors or BAC clones into the germ line by pronuclear injection or by lentivirus infection of fertilized oocytes. For each project, the facility supervisor consults with individual investigators and advises on transgene construct design, as well as making plasmids and sequence cassettes available to ensure suitable for expression in the mouse. Typically 20-25 investigators use this service with approximately 100 constructs injected per year. The Gene Targeting component continues to provide services for modification of the mouse genome through the use of gene targeting methods in embryonic stem (ES) cells and introduction of these changes into the mouse germline. Gene Targeting services include the generation of conventional knockout mouse lines, knock-in mouse lines and mouse lines with conditional alleles for the temporal and spatial ablation of genes. The facility has a high success rate (>95%) for obtaining gene targeted mouse. Finally, a new Gene Modification Service was implemented by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to provide a complete service for the rapid and cost efficient generation of genetically modified mouse lines to all AECC investigators. Services include the design and generation of simple and complex gene targeting vectors, electroporation and screening of embryonic stem cell lines of various genetic backgrounds (129, B6 and 129/06) and the generation of chimeric mice by blastocyst injection (performed by the Gene Targeting facility). The Gene Modification Service has also developed new technologies and procedures for high-throughput generation of targeting vectors and screening procedures and began full operation in early 2012."

"9512278","PROJECT DESCRIPTION Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranks second among the most common human pathogens isolated from surgical sites, chronic infections, and burn wounds. Once established, growth of P. aeruginosa in biofilms makes it very difficult to eradicate the organisms by antimicrobial treatment. In order to eradicate P. aeruginosa biofilm infections, efforts should be focused on the developmental process leading to the formation of persistent and inherently resistant biofilms. We have evidence that autogenously produced pyruvate contributes to the formation and stability of established biofilms by P. aeruginosa. In turn, enzymatic depletion of pyruvate impaired biofilm formation and correlated with the disaggregation of established P. aeruginosa biofilms, with thus treated biofilm cells being rendered more susceptible to the aminoglycoside tobramycin and phagocytic monocytes. Preliminary data furthermore suggest enzymatic depletion of pyruvate to reduce the bacterial load in wounds. The goal of the proposed research project is to develop a nanodevice-based anti-biofilm therapy, based on pyruvate depletion, to reduce the biofilm burden, and enhance the efficacy of conventional antimicrobial treatment strategies of biofilm-related infections. The project is founded on the hypothesis that pyruvate depletion can be used as an anti-biofilm strategy to reduce the bacterial burden and enhance wound healing. As pyruvate depletion is accomplished using pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which is unstable under in vivo conditions, we hypothesize that encapsulation of PDH into biodegradable nanoparticles will enhance/prolong PDH activity and stability, with in vitro selected optimal formulations being more efficient than free PDH in reducing the bacterial burden while enhancing killing of biofilm cells and wound healing in vivo. Experimentally, we will first assess in Aim 1 the applicability of pyruvate management in reducing the bacterial burden and enhancing wound healing in a porcine burn wound model and will determine the optimal PDH concentration required to so do. In Aim 2, we will develop biodegradable, biocompatible nanoparticles capable of encapsulating, maintaining and stabilizing PDH activity at concentrations required for the highest possible impact on biofilms in vivo while requiring the least amount of particles. Aim 3 is designed to select formulations that require the least number of nanoparticles to obtain the optimal PDH concentrations (high particle loading) while demonstrating comparable biofilm control capabilities at PDH activity levels that are equal to or lower than the optimal PDH. The two most promising nanoparticle formulations will be subsequently tested in Aim 4 for their efficacy in reducing the bacterial burden, enhancing the susceptibility of conventional antimicrobial agents in killing biofilm cells, and promoting wound healing in a porcine burn wound model. This proposed research brings together Drs. Karin Sauer (biofilm expert), Amber Doiron (expert in the fabrication of nanodevices), and Stephen Davis (expert on burn wounds) and is anticipated to result in innovative and effective therapeutic strategies, based on pyruvate depletion, to prevent, control and treat biofilm infections."

"9354259","Summary ? Project 2 Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing health-related concern, in part because of increases in its incidence. However, T2DM is also significant because of emerging evidence regarding the breadth of its effects on various body systems. It is now recognized that T2DM is associated with CNS deficits such as dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. We have found several ways in which a gene related to Alzheimer's influences diabetic tendencies in mice. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) serves as the source of amyloid ?-peptide (A?), and its mutation is capable of causing Alzheimer's. Our preliminary studies indicate that APP exerts a powerful impact on insulin/glucose metabolism, so to test the role of A? itself, we have turned to mice that over-produce this peptide alone in the CNS. These mice develop a prediabetic state (insulin resistance) by default. We propose to determine the effects of A? on CNS elements that control peripheral energy metabolism, placing particular emphasis on inflammatory processes. We also will test whether any effects of A? on insulin/glucose regulation can be modulated by expression of human apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This protein's gene (APOE) contributes the largest demographic risk to Alzheimer's disease, and ApoE both impacts inflammation and binds A? in genotype-specific manners. Thus, we expect ApoE to modify the effects that A? has on insulin/glucose metabolism. Finally, we will test whether the effects of A? on insulin/glucose metabolism can be similarly modified by interrupting inflammation or protein aggregation; this will be accomplished in part through cooperative strategies for drug development throughout the parent Program. Together, these experiments will characterize the interactions between T2DM-related syndromes and proteins of critical importance to Alzheimer's disease. The project will ultimately test pharmacological agents that directly impact these interactions and may thus provide novel therapeutic opportunities for Alzheimer's and T2DM."

"9304940","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal accumulation of amyloid-ß peptide (Aß), which is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) through two sequential proteolytic cleavages by BACE1 and ?-secretase, is widely regarded as having a causal role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with Down syndrome (DS), due to an extra copy of chromosome 21 in which APP is located at 21q21, develop age-related cognitive decline and AD dementia by 30-40 years earlier than in the general population, and their brains invariantly develop amyloid plaques. Since cleavage of APP by BACE1 initiates the production of Aß, inhibition of BACE1 activity should decrease the formation of Aß and is therefore a therapeutic target for AD. For the safe use of BACE1 inhibitors in humans, it is very important to fully understand the biological functions of BACE1 in the adult. Notably, neonatal BACE1-null mice have reduced body sizes and survival rates when compared to their age-matched wild-type littermates. However, the death rate is significantly decreased if BACE1-null mice can survive beyond postnatal day 10 and the differences in body weight become much smaller between BACE1-null and wild-type mice over time. In the adult, BACE1-null mice are fertile but do develop multiple mild to moderate phenotypes such as increases in the incidence of epileptic seizures, schizophrenia-like behaviors, retinal pathology, deficits in activity-dependent CA3 synaptic transmission, defects in axonal guidance and impaired myelination in BACE1-null mice. One potential explanation for these phenotypes in BACE1-null mice is the carryover effect from early developmental defects. To determine whether BACE1 is required for normal functions in adult mice, we have generated conditional BACE1 knockout mice and will delete BACE1 in the adult mouse. This new mouse model will allow us to answer questions such as whether inhibition of BACE1 activity in adult is safe and whether BACE1 inhibition at late ages will still e effective in removing preexisting amyloid plaques. This model will also be practical to answer the question of whether BACE1 inhibition in the adult will ameliorate tau pathology. Our central hypothesis in this proposal is that controlled inhibition of BACE1 activity will have optimal effecs on reducing or reversing AD pathologies. By testing our hypothesis, we will perform experiments in three specific aims. Aim 1: To characterize BACE1 conditional KO mice and to determine whether induced BACE1 deficiency will lead to phenotypic changes similar to those observed in BACE1-null mice. Aim 2: To determine whether induced BACE1 deficiency can reverse pre-formed amyloid plaques in AD transgenic mouse brains. Aim 3: to examine whether BACE1 inhibition will impact cognitive function in the Ts65Dn Down syndrome mouse model. The knowledge gained from this study will allow us to answer many unmet questions such as whether a significant reduction of BACE1 in the adult would have beneficial effects for reducing or eliminating AD and DS pathologies."
"9391121","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary rationale for the Duke Aging Center Postdoctoral Research Training Program (RTP) proposed here is to continue to train highly skilled research scientists who have strong backgrounds in substantive areas related to aging and who also have the potential for leadership in gerontological research. Each fellow is assigned a mentor or mentors and works within that person's research program; we also have an interdisciplinary seminar which all fellows must attend. Fellows typically spend two years in the RTP. Our approach is to consider aging research from a biopsychosocial perspective. Consistent with this theme, the RTP faculty and their facilities enable outstanding research training in the following areas related to aging: Biomedical Sciences; Social Sciences, Health services Research and Biostatistics; and Behavioral and Neurosciences. Fellows spend a significant portion of their time on research. They are integrated into their mentors' research programs and mentored through collaborative and independent research projects. All fellows and some faculty attend our weekly RTP seminar on research in aging. This seminar follows a structured curriculum on the biopsychosocial aspects of aging and the interdisciplinary nature of aging research, as well as professional development, research design and analysis, and research ethics. Potential fellows' applications include a detailed NIH-format research application (with input from their mentors), a curriculum vita, graduate transcripts, career and training plans, and letters of recommendation. Ultimately, most fellows either join university faculties or research organizations after completing the RTP. We request support for 6 postdoctoral fellows. The Duke Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development is the primary research training facility for fellows supported by this grant. Associated faculty are located throughout the University and Medical Center."
"9314267","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability for children aged 1-19 in the United States. More than 60,000 children and adolescents are hospitalized annually in the U.S. after sustaining moderate-severe brain injuries from motor vehicle crashes, falls, sports, and physical abuse; more than 600,000 are seen in hospital emergency rooms and released. TBI often results in significant and permanent alterations in social, behavioral, physical, and cognitive functioning. Understanding these changes and developing skills to manage the challenges associated with them are essential for long-term positive outcomes for children with TBI and their families.  The goal of this project is o produce the Traumatic Brain Injury Positive Strategies (TIPS) program, a comprehensive educational and training resource to help families improve their knowledge and skills in supporting a child with TBI experiencing cognitive, behavioral, and social challenges. The online product will include: (a) the TBI Resource Center, an extensive library of educational materials, information, and resources about childhood TBI, and (b) the Training Center, which will provide training in a range of evidence-based strategies within a problem-solving framework. Phase I of this project produced and evaluated prototype content, for the Training Center, including two Supporting Cognition modules and a Problem-Solving Basics module. The prototype was evaluated with 47 parents of children ages 5-18 with TBI. Significant results from the within-subject evaluation demonstrated gains in parents' self-efficacy, general TBI knowledge, and knowledge application.  In Phase II, we will develop (a) an assessment module to identify key areas of parent concern, (b) additional training modules addressing cognitive, behavioral, and social domains, (c) the TBI Resource Center, and (d) functionality for hospital website integration. To promote knowledge and skill acquisition, the program will integrate evidence-based instructional design elements with video-based modeling, taking full advantage of the web's interactive capabilities. The program will be developed using an iterative process with an advisory board of rehabilitation professionals from three collaborating children's hospitals.  We will determine the efficacy of the TIPS program in a randomized controlled trial with 216 parents of children with TBI. Program feasibility will be demonstrated by the achievement of significant program effects, a high level of program usage, and a high degree of user satisfaction."
"9308035","PILOT/DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS  The primary purpose of the CREATE RDCRC pilot/demonstration research program is to promote biomarker discovery and validation for ALS and related disorders through a small research grant program that funds studies of potential biomarkers during their early stages of development. Priority is given to projects with the most promising clinical research potential. The activities of the CREATE Consortium - longitudinal evaluation of patients with familial and sporadic disease, collection of deep phenotypic data, and the establishment of a repository of biological samples (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid) that has been annotated clinically in a detailed manner - are all expected to enhance and facilitate biomarker discovery through the pilot/ demonstration research program. The first pilot/demonstration project will focus on early development of a cerebrospinal fluid biomarker for ALS. Potential projects in subsequent years include development of a urinary biomarker of disease progression and a neuroimaging marker of the imbalance between cortical inhibition and excitability. The CREATE RDCRC will utilize a request for applications on an annual basis, to solicit applications and to select the most promising project for funding."
"9300718","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Of the greater than 6 million fractures occurring yearly in the US, up to 20% will result in nonunion or delayed union, thereby requiring intervention for bone regeneration. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell source for cell-based therapies of bone healing because of their osteogenic potential and robust secretion of proangiogenic trophic factors. Culture dimensionality has a profound impact on a myriad of cell functions. Compared to dissociated MSCs, our recent data demonstrate that MSC spheroids secrete 100- fold higher levels of angiogenic factors and better resist apoptosis while maintaining osteogenic potential. Spheroid formation is a competition between cohesion and adhesion, and optimizing this balance through the entrapment in engineered biomaterials provides an exciting opportunity to instruct the regenerative potential of MSCs after transplantation. Hydrogel properties such as adhesivity, stiffness, and degradation influence the function of entrapped cells and resulting tissue formation. Alginate is a highly cytocompatible natural polymer that is amenable to control of initial mechanical properties through composition and crosslinking, as well as adhesivity by covalently coupling peptide sequences such as Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) to the polymer backbone that bind cellular receptors. Thus, alginate hydrogels represent an ideal tool to probe the role of substrate properties on spheroid function. Our central hypothesis is that the therapeutic potential of MSC spheroids for bone regeneration can be enhanced using alginate hydrogels with engineered biophysical properties. Aim 1. Does adhesion ligand density within alginate hydrogels affect the survival, proangiogenic, and osteogenic potential of entrapped MSC spheroids? We will synthesize alginate hydrogels with varying densities of RGD. The influence of increased adhesion versus cohesion on spheroid function will be determined. Aim 2. Do hydrogel biomechanical properties influence the functional response of entrapped MSC spheroids? Using composite hydrogels with distinct biophysical properties, we will examine the role of substrate stiffness and degradation on survival, proangiogenic and osteogenic potential of entrapped MSC spheroids. Aim 3. Can MSC spheroids transplanted in RGD-modified hydrogels with optimized biophysical properties accelerate bone formation in a critical-sized calvarial bone defect? We will characterize the capacity of MSC spheroids transplanted in RGD-modified alginate hydrogels to accelerate bone repair in an orthotopic defect compared to dissociated MSCs. The role of implanted cells, as well as quality of bone formation will be assessed using noninvasive imaging modalities. The proposed research is innovative because it exploits the balance of cellular aggregation versus adhesion to drive cell fate using an injectable, biodegradable hydrogel to potentiate the reparative potential of MSCs. This research will provide a new approach to drive bone formation in nonhealing or slow healing bone fractures, and the strategies have potential in enhancing the efficacy of materials-based therapies for tissue repair."

"9313939","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polymorphic CAG repeat in the HTT gene that triggers cell death with a specificity towards neurons in the striatum and cortex. Although the underlying genetic mutation was discovered over 20 years ago, there is still no cure or effective treatment despite extensive efforts. The HTT CAG repeat mutation is highly unstable both in transmissions to subsequent generations and somatically. Notably the repeat undergoes dramatic tissue-specific somatic expansion, particularly in the brain regions affected in the disorder, strongly suggesting that somatic HTT CAG length increases in target tissues contribute to HD pathogenesis. We have shown in accurate genetic HD knock-in mouse models that genes in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway (Msh2, Msh3, Mlh1, Mlh3) are critical for CAG expansion and enhance the pathogenic process. The relevance of these findings to HD patients is indicated by a recent genome-wide association study in which MLH1 SNPs were associated with motor onset, and more generally, in which DNA repair pathways were highlighted as a source of disease modification. In this study we will: 1) perform genetic experiments in HD knock-in mice that will provide insight into mechanism(s) of MMR-dependent instability and pathogenesis; 2) test the impact of MLH1 SNPs in HD patients on gene expression, cellular phenotypes and on somatic and intergenerational repeat instability; 3) Use gene knockdown and gene editing approaches to test the impact of additional DNA repair genes, implicated as disease modifiers in patients, as modifiers of instability and striatal pathogenesis in HD knock-in mice. Together, these experiments will provide critical insight into pathways and mechanisms by which MMR/DNA repair genes modify pathogenesis, which will directly impact on the development of therapeutics that promise to target mechanism(s) that occur very early in the disease process."
"9334298","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Certain pregnancy complications sound an early warning for future cardiometabolic disease, often before traditional risk factors manifest. Since about 30% of US women will have at least one of these pregnancy complications, nearly one-third of postpartum women have a risk factor demonstrating elevated risk for cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Postpartum women at elevated cardiometabolic risk are difficult to reach by traditional means, yet preventive interventions can have wide-reaching impact. Mobile health (mHealth) provides an unprecedented opportunity to reach postpartum women, collect detailed behavioral data, allow for tracking of behavior, and intervene in ecologic moments, when real-life decisions are being made. The use of technology in postpartum women at elevated cardiometabolic risk is a novel, scalable approach to a difficult problem. There are currently no evidence-based programs clinically available for this population. CANDIDATE: The candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a K12 Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health Research (BIRCWH) Scholar. She received her MD from Harvard Medical School, completed her residency in Internal Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, completed her MPH at the Harvard School of Public Health, and completed a T32 clinical research fellowship at Harvard Medical School. During Dr. Nicklas' BIRCWH K12 award, she has been developing a novel mHealth intervention program called Fit After Baby. She now requires additional training and mentoring in order to iteratively improve, and then pilot test her intervention in order to transition to research independence. Her immediate goals are to acquire critical training in: 1) the analysis of qualitative and quantitative user data, 2) formal training in behavioral theory and user- centered design, 3) mentored training in the conduct of mHealth clinical trials, and 4) training in dissemination and implementation science. Her long term goal career goal is to become a national leader in women's cardiometabolic health and the application of technological interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in women. ENVIRONMENT: The environment for this project is outstanding, and draws on the research mentors' expertise in: 1) cardiometabolic disease among women of childbearing age (Dr. Linda Barbour); 2) mHealth research and health promotion clinical trials (Dr. Sheana Bull); 3) cardiovascular risk factors in women and technology based RCTs (Dr. Ellen Seely); and 4) pragmatic trials and implementation science (Dr. Allison Kempe). The candidate has also assembled an interdisciplinary team of consultants to aid in critical areas of research and career development, including an expert in: 1) biostatistics, and design and analysis of clinical trials (Dr. John Kittleson); 2) health behavioral theory (Dr. Jennifer Leiferman), and 3) bioinformatics and user- centered design (Dr. Lisa Schilling). A key consultant on this project is the candidate's technology partner, Digifit. The Center for Research in Implementation Science and Prevention located at the University of Colorado and run by mentor Dr. Allison Kempe is also a major strength of the proposed training program. RESEARCH: During her K12 award the applicant has been developing Fit After Baby, an mHealth program designed for postpartum women whose pregnancy complications revealed elevated risk for cardiometabolic disease. Fit After Baby is an interactive program delivered by a mobile app and a lifestyle coach, designed to increase postpartum weight loss and prevent the development of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The overarching goal of this K23 is to iteratively improve and then pilot test the Fit After Baby program. The proposed research program will advance scientific knowledge by: 1) Rapidly and inexpensively developing and testing an innovative, practical, and scalable mHealth intervention program grounded in behavioral theory tailored for postpartum women at elevated risk for cardiometabolic disease; 2) Developing and refining a model to improve engagement and satisfaction for mHealth intervention programs using an iterative process; and 3) Collecting preliminary efficacy data from a pilot RCT to inform the design of a pragmatic trial for a future R01 application."
"9323664","Summary - Core B: Non-human Primate and Imaging Core A major barrier to HIV cure is the persistence of HIV-1 infected cells that constitute the viral reservoir. While current antiretroviral combination therapies are able to inhibit viral replication to below detectable levels (50 copies) in the plasma of patient, ART cessation almost invariably leads to viral resurgence even in patients for which ART was initiated early post infection. This has led to the formulation of Shock and Kill approaches to activate and reduce the reservoirs using latency reversing agents under the umbrella of ART, though such approach in the absence of immunotherapy has not had any clinical benefit thus far. However, these results clearly indicate that long-term persistent HIV reservoirs are seeded rapidly post infection as confirmed it the nonhuman primate model of HIV. In addition, data from several groups and ours strongly suggest that residual viral replication is actually ongoing in various lymphoid tissues in spite of highly active ART, be it due to poor drug penetration, conversion or sanctuaries with limited antiviral immune contribution. In this application, we propose to quantify and map the early reservoir formation after vaginal infection and early ART intervention, using a series of state of the art imaging techniques as well detailed cellular analyses of the reservoirs obtained at various times of ART initiation. Next we propose to address the functional reservoir following prolonged ART and ART interruption, monitoring residual viral replication in tissues, sites of early viral rebound, the cellular origin of the active reservoir and immune interventions designed to bolster antiviral responses leading to antiviral control."
"9365800","Summary Animals have an intrinsic ability to respond to threats in their environments, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. A complete understanding of these complex stress-induced behaviors requires the characterization of all participating neurons, their connections, and their interactions with other tissues (including sympathetic connections in the gut, the circulation system, muscles, etc.). However, this level of analysis is difficult to achieve in complex vertebrate organisms. One rational approach is to analyze these processes in simpler invertebrate models. This proposal aims to understand the neural mechanisms that encode threat responses (both behavioral and physiological) in an invertebrate model system. The nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, provides a unique opportunity to analyze the genes, cells, and circuits that regulate complex behaviors. The Chalasani lab has developed a novel model of threat behaviors that involves interactions between C. elegans and a second predatory nematode species, Pristionchus pacificus. A starving P. pacificus will attack and devour a C. elegans in 30 minutes. C. elegans in turn, seeks to avoid P. pacificus and its secretions. The Chalasani lab has characterized a novel, redundant neural circuit that detects the P. pacificus predator and drives rapid avoidance behavior, which entails a reversal in locomotion followed by a wide-angle turn. In addition to this rapid avoidance, the lab also discovered that C. elegans exposed to predator secretions for a long period of time (30 minutes) exhibit slowed locomotion (freezing), reduced egg- laying behavior, and the induction of mitochondrial stress in multiple tissues. These responses last up to one hour after the predator cue is removed, and are reminiscent of defensive behaviors observed in other predator- prey models. A pilot genetic screen identified seb-3 (the C. elegans homolog of corticotrophin releasing factor receptor 1 (crfr1)) as required for these long-term behavioral and physiological changes. This is the first evidence that CRF signaling affects behavior and physiology in response to an external threat in an invertebrate. Additionally, a cell culture assay system was used to identify a cognate ligand, NLP-49, that activates the SEB-3 receptor. Here, genetic methods will be used to characterize the role played by CRF signaling in coordinating behavioral and physiological changes in response to an external threat. Aim 1 will probe the role of CRF signaling components (the SEB-3 receptor, the NLP-49 ligand, and other potential ligands) in driving predator-mediated behavioral changes. The underlying neural circuits will be mapped. In Aim 2, the mechanism by which CRF signaling in neurons is relayed to other tissues, resulting in the induction of mitochondrial stress, will be determined. In Aim 3, a focused genetic screen will be performed to identify additional components of the CRF signaling pathway that are responsible for stress-induced behavioral and physiological changes. These studies will reveal how neural circuits and the CRF signaling pathway process information about environmental threats to generate adaptive stress responses."
"9316496","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a devastating global impact causing more than 30 million HIV-1 infections and over 25 million deaths worldwide. In addition, it is estimated that annually over 450,000 infants are infected through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective to save lives and reduce MTCT, the coverage of ART in treatment-eligible patients in developing countries is only approximately 67% due to the lack of simple, inexpensive and rapid near-patient treatment monitoring tools. To address the unmet need, we propose to develop an HIV-1 viral load monitoring microfluidic platform technology development of a sensitive photonic crystal sensing technology. This technology detects and quantifies the binding of biotargets (e.g., HIV-1 virus particles) to an optical sensing surface due to the change of bulk index of refraction. The resulted shift in the peak wavelength value correlates with the concentration of biotargets in a biological sample. This technology- driven proposal addresses a significant global clinical need and aims to deliver a portable photonic crystal device that can (i) selectively capture HIV-1 from whole blood, (ii) be sensitive within the clinical cut-off (with ±10% error range), inexpensive (<$1), rapid (within 30 minutes), and (iii) handle fingerprick whole blood (up to 100 µL) to aid i HIV patient care and treatment in resource-constrained settings. The delivery of this photonic crystal-based HIV-1 viral load monitoring microchips can significantly facilitate the expansion of ART in developing countries, achieving universal access to ART to control the AIDS pandemic."
"9254592","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will result in the creation of a clinical-grade product called the CoolStat that will be able to quickly and safely cool the brain and body after cardiac arrest. The CoolStat is designed to be initiated by EMS personnel to start early cooling post arrest, which has been shown to improve survival rates and neurological outcomes. As part of this overall project, we will (1) create the clinical-grade CoolStat product for use in  human trial; (2) obtain FDA approval to use the product in a pilot cardiac arrest study (via an IDE); and (3) complete the pilot study in cardiac arrest victims to measure safety and cooling efficacy. Current techniques to provide early cooling to patients are not effective, relying on some form of active cooling, whether by ice packs, cold saline or evaporative fluids. Our approach is novel in that we are harnessing a physiologic process that triggers the body to cool itself. There are no active cooling systems or evaporative chemicals. Our cooling method uses only dry, ambient air that we blow into the nasal track and then extract the moisturized air from the mouth. This sets up an evaporating cooling heat exchange, which effectively pulls energy and heat out of the body, cooling the brain at a rate of about 1 C in 10 minutes. This project will be an extension of previous grant work we have completed, including pre-clinical and feasibility testing in humans. We will complete this proposed project in three sequential stages. In Year 1, we will transition from a bench-top prototype of the product to making about 50 clinical-grade devices. We will also obtain an IDE from the FDA to run the human study. In Year 2, we will implement the human study by working with our strategic partner, Zoll Medical, a leading commercial company in the field of patient temperature management. Zoll has agreed to partner with us to allow them to better assess the benefit of our cooling technology. Tentatively, the human study will be conducted at 5 sites that have been pre-approved by Zoll. In Year 3, we will finish the human study, analyze and publish the results, and hopefully transition into a pivotal study with Zoll. This work will validate a new method for inducing hypothermia that can be easily deployed during treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as well as other ischemic injuries to the brain and the heart. It will prove the clinical value of early cooling and hopefully become a standard of care. Ultimately, we plan to leverage this grant program into the creation of a family of cooling products that can be used for cardiac arrest, ST elevated myocardial infarction, stroke and other potential indications."
"9300991","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caregiver smoking is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in both adult smokers and their children who are involuntarily exposed to secondhand smoke (SHSe). Our research has found that caregivers who visit the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) with their children have a high prevalence of smoking (up to 48%), their children have high levels of SHSe equivalent to that of active smokers, and they regularly use the PED for nonurgent, SHSe-related complaints. These smokers are motivated to quit and eager to receive cessation counseling in this setting. Annually, more than 3 million PED visits involve treatment of children with SHSe- related illnesses. These visits provide a unique teachable moment to motivate caregiver quitting, given the relationship between quitting and improvements in their child's health. Because of the long, unavoidable wait times and the frequent use of the PED for non-urgent care, this is an ideal venue for intervening with this population. Moreover, we and others have demonstrated the feasibility of conducting complex randomized trials in PEDs without disrupting clinical flow. Building on our prior research, we propose to conduct the first randomized trial to test whether a cessation intervention in the PED setting can reduce caregiver smoking and decrease children's SHSe. This study will test the efficacy of a cessation intervention for caregivers in a large, inner-city PED that is a major noda site for the federally funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). The proposed Screening, Brief Intervention, and Assisted Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) will highlight the effects of SHSe on their child's health. We will randomize 750 caregivers who smoke who present to our PED with their child who has a SHSe-related illness to either one of two conditions: 1) SBIRT; or 2) Healthy Habits Control (HHC). The SBIRT condition will use components shown to be effective in the out- patient setting but not yet tested in the PED setting. It will include a brief form of the Clinical Practice Guideline: Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, motivational interviewing, engaging and personalized materials on the effects of smoking and SHSe, immediate access to caregivers' choice of cessation resources (e.g., Quitline, smokefree.gov, or txt2quit), a 12-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy and weekly booster materials for 12 weeks. The HHC program has been previously developed and used in the out-patient setting, and will be used as an attention control in which caregivers will receive instruction on healthy lifestyle choices to improve their child's health. Cessation assistance will be offered at the study's conclusion. If effective, the SBIRT model could be routinely used in the PED setting, which could reach at least one million smokers a year, and could result in significant reductions in caregivers' tobacco use, SHSe-related pediatric illness, and costs in this population. In addition, our results will inform the conduct of public health research efforts aimed at adults via the PED. If successful, we will create a comprehensive package of materials for disseminating the implementation of the intervention throughout PECARN and non-PECARN PEDs, and EDs nationwide."

Second, it will create a collaborative research environment within the UTHSCSA that will attract new investigators to aging research. Third, it will foster collaborative efforts with other Nathan Shock Aging Centers and help support aging research at institutions that have fewer resources for research on the biology of aging."
"9302797","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Funds are requested for partial support of the Society for Developmental Biology's (SDB) annual meetings for the next five years (2014-2018). The Society has organized the major meeting in developmental biology for the past 75 years (missing two during World War II). Since the annual meeting changed its format from a single theme symposium to an open, inclusive meeting in 1993, the meeting size has grown three-fold (from 263 in 1994 to an average of 760 in the last 10 years). By allowing presentations by students and postdoctoral fellows, we have increased the number of abstract submissions from less than 100 to an average of 600's in the last few years. The expansion to include cutting edge themes in developmental biology and related areas such as stem cell and regenerative biology, together with the fast technical advances that allowed investigators to find explanations to questions unanswered before also contributed to this growth in attendance, as well as its standing today in biomedical research and public interest. SDB was founded in 1939 and is today the major society devoted to this field, with over 2200 members worldwide, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior and established investigators, many of whom hold NIH grants and fellowships. The proposed meetings will continue the tradition of mixing poster presentations, plenary sessions, concurrent symposia, the Hilde Mangold Postdoctoral Symposium, the awards lectures, an education symposium and workshops on new technologies, education and current issues. In all sessions, a special effort is made to have a diversity of invited speakers in terms of: model organisms, experimental approaches, career stages, gender and racial/ethnic background. For the concurrent symposia at least four short talk slots are reserved per session for abstracts selected from submissions, with preference given to qualified junior investigators. The education symposium and workshop focus on topics such as effective teaching and mentoring strategies at university and pre-college levels, outreach to the lay public, as well as career-related issues. They also address bioethics of research, which is highly relevant to establishing national policies for research on stem cells and cloning, as well as public understanding of science, including evolution. Additional activities that enrich the annual meetings include: On alternating years we hold a Boot Camp for New Faculty or a Reboot Camp for Mid-career Faculty the day preceding and on the first day of the meeting for professional development of untenured and mid-career faculty, respectively. SDB's Professional Development and Education Committee is responsible for these workshops. Call for up to two SDB member organized Satellite Symposia are made and will continue to be made yearly to SDB members. These Symposia complement the offerings of the annual meeting and are held on the opening day of the meeting. These pre-meeting events have been well-attended throughout the last ten years and will continue during this proposal period. The next meeting, to be held at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA is a return to our previous tradition of meetings on university campuses, a practice no longer possible because only a few campuses have facilities large enough for our growing meeting needs. It will also celebrate the 75th anniversary of founding of the Society and as such, sessions highlighting history and breakthroughs will be included in the program. The opening Presidential Symposium will address What have genetic model organisms taught us, where experts will give us an overview of what each organism has contributed to advancing our understanding of developmental processes. The two plenary and nine concurrent sessions will bring reports on the latest discoveries in developmental mechanisms, such as gene regulation, genomics, cell polarity, migration and differentiation, invasion and cancer, mechanical influences, tissue engineering, morphogenesis, organogenesis, evo-devo, organismal interactions, neural development. This meeting will be followed by meetings in Snowbird, Utah, Central region, West and East coast, as rotation throughout the various regions eases the travel burden for participants in the different zones of the country. Efforts will be continually made to find venues of easy access and as economical as possible, including keeping the tradition of university campuses as venue for their collegial atmosphere so cherished by our members."
"9312721","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects ~12% of the world population, contributing to more than 2.5 million deaths each year in the United States alone and costing the United States $220 billion annually. Traumatic stress disorders (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder; PTSD) are debilitating disorders currently affecting 7.7 million Americans, are observed in ~30% of U.S. combat veterans, and cost the U.S. billions of dollars annually. AUD and PTSD both increase mortality rates and shorten life spans in humans, increasing the incidence of chronic disease states. AUD is the most commonly occurring mental health disorder in humans affected by PTSD, with 22-43% of individuals with PTSD meeting criteria for AUD (compared to 8% of the general population). The high rate of co-morbidity suggests an overlapping neurobiological mechanism between PTSD and AUD, but the biological basis for the high rate of co-morbidity between PTSD and AUD is not known. An important aspect of this proposal is the a priori identification of individual differences in stres reactivity (vulnerability vs. resilience), which models the development of traumatic stress disorders in only a subpopulation of stress- exposed humans. Here, we propose to use a rodent model to examine the neurobiological basis for co-morbid PTSD and AUD. Preliminary and published data from our lab suggest that traumatic stress escalates alcohol drinking and produces hyperalgesia in rats via effects on corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF; a pro-stress peptide) signaling, and also alters extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation (pERK) in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a brain region important for coordinating responses to the environment via top-down control of sub-cortical structures. The proposed work seeks to extend these findings by exploring the role of CRF-ERK interactions in the vmPFC in mediating traumatic stress-induced escalation of alcohol drinking and hyperalgesia. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that vmPFC CRF-CRF1R signaling via ERK pathways mediates escalated alcohol drinking and hyperalgesia in rats that exhibit high stress reactivity. This proposal will provide a promising M.D./Ph.D. student with vital research training through studies that use an integrative approach to test the predictions that: 1) traumatic stress upregulates CRF- CRF1-ERK signaling pathways in the vmPFC, and 2) this pathway mediates escalation of alcohol drinking in high-stress reactive animals. These experiments will train a future physician-scientist in animal models of psychiatric disorders, and the results of these studies will inform the development of effective treatment strategies for co-morbid PTSD and AUD, leading to improvements in quality of life and health of affected individuals, decreasing morbidity associated with these disorders, and potentially saving the U.S. millions of dollars in health care costs."
"9523028","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve cancer therapy, it is increasingly critical that advances in basic cancer research be translated to the clinic. In the Training Program in Cancer Therapeutics, the goal is to provide training to cancer researchers in the action of therapeutic agents used in the treatment of cancer. This Training Program will be multi-disciplinary and expose the trainees to both basic research involving cancer therapeutic agents and the clinical utilization of therapeutics. A particular emphasis will be placed on the mechanisms through which basic scientific discovery is brought into the clinic through clinical trials. To facilitate this training, a team of mentoring faculty and ancillary clinical faculty hasbeen recruited into the Training Program from the University of Cincinnati and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Mentors on this training program are independently funded, have experience in mentoring, and work on projects related to cancer therapy.

The program will be evaluated regularly through both internal and external review to ensure that the trainees are receiving the best possible training."
"9322422","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains a devastating fibrotic parenchymal lung disease with high morbidity and mortality, for which there are no effective therapies. Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to identify molecular pathways that are targetable for therapeutic intervention. This proposal seeks to address this unmet need by investigating the role of TNF- in the resolution of pulmonary fibrosis using the well- characterized bleomycin model in mice. In preliminary studies we have shown that the intratracheal administration of TNF- at the peak of the bleomycin-induced fibrotic response accelerates resolution and that mice with a genetic TNF- deficiency have impaired resolution of fibrosis. These and other considerations have led us to hypothesize that TNF- plays an integral role in the resolution of pulmonary fibrosis through effects on macrophages and myofibroblasts. We hypothesize that TNF- alters the phenotype of both of these cell populations reducing their pro-fibrogenic phenotype and allowing them to aid in the resolution process. Specific aim 1 will address the hypothesis that TNF- induces a switch in macrophage programming from alternative to classical, reducing the production of pro-fibrotic mediators including TGF- and IGF-I, increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-) and enhancing matrix metalloproteinase production to initiate tissue remodeling and the restoration of normal pulmonary architecture. The goal of specific aim 2 is to address the hypothesis that TNF- promotes myofibroblast apoptosis in a two-step process, first by directing myofibroblasts de-differentiation to fibroblasts, and second by sensitizing these fibroblasts to undergo Fas- mediated apoptosis. Finally, specific aim 3 will translate our work into human disease using IPF-derived myofibroblasts and a humanized mouse model of fibrosis. Our proposed studies represent the first time TNF- has been investigated as a key player in the resolution process of pulmonary fibrosis. It also represents a novel opportunity to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of IPF. Thus, a long-term goal of this proposal is to translate our anticipated findings into the development of therapies for patients diagnosed with fibrotic lung diseases, including IPF."

"9352226","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under normal circumstances, the liver is able to regenerate itself following damage; however, this ability is lost following ethanol consumption. The liver's regenerative ability depends on the coordinated signaling interactions between parenchymal (hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal (hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells) cell types. MicroRNAs, a class of small (~22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs, play many important roles in maintaining proper cellular function. Therefore, it is likely that ethanol-induced disrupton of normal microRNA regulation of cell signaling will affect the liver's ability to undergo regeneration. My research will focus on the role of microRNAs specifically in hepatic stellate cells, which produce a number of cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins important for normal liver regenerative function. In order to study this system, I have developed a computational model of hepatic stellate cell activation which includes a process for introducing negative regulation of target genes by two microRNAs of interest-miR-21 and miR-146a. The model is able to describe certain changes that occur in transcription factor and microRNA levels during hepatic stellate cell activation, but expansion of this model with the introduction of furthr microRNA regulatory networks would provide additional information on the dynamics of expression during activation and re-normalization upon cessation of stimulating signals. Therefore, the goal of this project is to characterize the regulatory microRNA-gene networks involved in hepatic stellate cell activation and understand how their dysregulation by alcohol adaptation contributes to impaired liver regeneration by testing three hypotheses: (1) microRNA balances are altered in a hepatic stellate cell-specific manner, (2) hepatic stellate cell activatin and quiescence is controlled by a shift in distributions of microRNA networks, and (3) inhibition of miR-21 results in a shift from an anti- to pro- regenerative phenotype as the result of altered cellular signaling. These hypotheses will be tested using a variety of in vivo and in vitro approaches, including rat models of alcohol adaptation, cell culture, single-cell capture and analysis, and microarray studies. In addition, the existing model of hepatic stellate cell activatin will be expanded, and in silico studies will be used to predict changes in microRNA and target gene expression in response to stimulating factors. Experimental validation will help tease out the mechanisms of stellate cell activation and its role in regeneration, as well as further refine the model. We expect to identify which microRNAs play a key role in stellate cell activation, what cellular processes they regulate, and how their dysregulation in response to ethanol can lead to an impaired regenerative ability."
"9390704","Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging ?biomarkers? to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD ?connectome? using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary ?normative? comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems."
"9358349","Neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a key role in motor learning, and neurological diseases that affect VTA neurons or their targets in the basal ganglia (BG) severely disrupt behavior. Notably, much of our understanding of how the VTA functions in motor learning has relied on paradigms that employ external reward or punishment and involve relatively slow and simple behaviors, such as lever pressing or licking. In contrast, many of our most complex and valued behaviors, such as speech and musical expression, can be learned without external reinforcement, suggesting that their learning is internally reinforced. Further, internally reinforced behaviors such as speech or musicianship require highly complex and rapid motor sequences and are more readily acquired during juvenile sensitive periods. How the VTA interacts with the BG to mediate complex forms of internally and externally reinforced auditory-motor learning remains unknown. Here we propose to identify how the VTA and BG interact to mediate different forms of auditory-motor learning using a novel combination of intersectional genetic methods to selectively ablate VTA neurons, microdialysis, calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation of VTA terminals and BG neurons combined with rapid and temporally precise behavioral manipulations. These approaches will be used to test the hypothesis that the VTA functions as a ?critic? that evaluates auditory feedback and instructively modifies BG premotor activity, which in turn drives internally and externally reinforced auditory- motor learning. Resolving how VTA-BG circuits mediate these forms of learning are critical issues for understanding motor plasticity in health and disease. In fact, speech pathologies typify various diseases that affect VTA-BG circuitry, while mutations that disrupt dopamine-mediated signaling in the BG also impair vocal learning. Therefore, the proposed research can shed light on the neural circuit mechanisms that enable complex internally and externally reinforced behavioral learning while also revealing how dysfunction in these circuits interferes with the learning and execution of communicative behaviors."
"9338279","PROJECT 2 PROJECT SUMMARY: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an inherited DNA repair disorder characterized by congenital abnormalities, cancer predisposition, and progressive bone marrow failure. FA is caused by biallelic mutations in one of sixteen FANC genes, the products of which cooperate in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Although the precise biochemical functions of the FA/BRCA pathway remain unclear, the pathway promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair. Due to the underlying DNA repair defect, FA cells are hypersensitive to genotoxic DNA crosslinking agents. The mechanism of the bone marrow failure (BMF) in FA remains elusive. Our recent studies suggest that BMF results, at least in part, from increased p53 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCPs), leading to progressive cell cycle delay and apoptosis. BMF may also result from the accumulation of DNA damage from the endogenous crosslinking agent, acetaldehyde, and the selective toxicity of this agent to hematopoietic stem cells. Recently, we identified hyperactive TGF? signaling as a mechanism of bone marrow suppression in FA. Disruption of TGF? signaling, through the use of shRNAs, sgRNAs, and small molecule inhibitors confirmed the suppressive role of the pathway on FA cell growth. We hypothesize that an upstream inhibitor of the TGF? pathway (i.e., a monoclonal antibody to TGF? itself) will inhibit this pathway and rescue the function of the HSPCs, resulting in an increased probability of rescuing bone marrow function in FA patients. It is possible that TGF? inhibitors may also promote the clonal evolution of premalignant or malignant hematopoietic stem cell. The specific aims of Project 2 are: 1) determine the mechanism by which TGF-? inhibitors promote FA cellular growth and regulate DNA repair, 2) to determine whether inhibition of TGF-? pathway rescues hematopoietic defects in FA mouse models, and 3) to determine whether inhibition of TGF-? pathway rescues hematopoietic defects in primary bone marrow cells from FA patients. Project 2 will interact extensively with Project 1 (Grompe), which will analyze other small molecules capable of improving FA cell growth and Project 3 (Shimamura), which will analyze the effect of these small molecules on primary human FA cells and will provide additional preclinical data for an FA clinical trial. The projects will utilize four Core programs, as described in the accompanying Core components."
"9392368","Project Summary The worker response to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks was unprecedented in scope, involving tens of thousands of traditional (e.g., police) and non-traditional (e.g., construction workers) responders. While posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) arising in response to the WTC attacks is prevalent and chronic in 14% of WTC responders, a substantial proportion of this population has remained psychologically resilient to WTC-related PTSD and related symptoms, even more than 15 years after 9/11. Psychological resilience is defined as the ability of an individual to adapt successfully to severe stress, trauma or adversity. The proposed study aims to fill a major gap in our understanding of the neurobiology of psychological resilience by using state-of-the-art functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods to characterize between-group functional differences in neural circuits underlying three of the most widely replicated psychological domains ?and potentially modifiable protective factors? associated with resilience: (1) emotion regulation (emotion processing neural circuits), (2) positive emotions (reward processing neural circuits), and (3) the ability to establish and nurture a supportive social network (social cognition neural circuits) in a diverse sample of 105 WTC responders. Characterization of the function of these neural circuits in resilient individuals is critical to understanding the etiology of psychological resilience, as well as to informing resilience-promoting prevention and treatment efforts. WTC responders will be recruited into three groups: highly resilient WTC responders, who have remained psychologically resilient despite enduring severe WTC-related exposures (n=35), and two comparison groups of WTC responders: (1) a symptomatic group with chronic, clinically significant PTSD symptoms (n=35), and (2) a low WTC-exposed control group without psychiatric disorder, who experienced significantly lower levels of WTC-related exposures (n=35). WTC responders will be recruited from a large responder cohort followed prospectively at the WTC Health Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and who have participated in an ongoing study of genomic and neuroendocrine biomarkers of psychological risk and resilience (#3U01OH010407-01S1). The ultimate goal of this study is to develop an integrative, data-driven model to examine how patterns of brain activation across functional domains give rise to distinct mechanisms underlying resilience, and how these neural mechanisms interrelate with behavioral (e.g., emotion regulation, reward responses, social cognition) and psychosocial (e.g., coping self-efficacy, positive emotions, social connectedness) factors implicated in resilience. Results of this study will be used to inform personalized and targeted prevention and treatment approaches that bolster function of specific neural circuits and help promote psychological resilience in WTC and other disaster responders, as well as other populations of trauma survivors."
"9379794","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has become one of the most widely used procedures for restoring knee function and relieving pain in the advanced stages of knee osteoarthritis; yet early TKA failure (<10 years post-surgery) remains a large-scale problem. Although knee instability is known to be a major cause of early failures, current methods for measuring knee balance are largely subjective and user-dependent. Ultrasound elastography (UE) is an innovative technology that enables the noninvasive quantification of soft tissue displacements and strains, which are important indicators of balance. We have recently developed such a technique for the evaluation of Achilles tendon deformation, and believe that this approach could provide important insight into knee soft tissue mechanics. The premise of this study is to use this noninvasive UE approach to measure knee balance in situ and then in patient populations to better understand the effects of TKA on altered knee balance, with the overall goal to pave the way toward intra-operative integration of this approach. In Aim 1, ultrasound data will be collected from cadaveric knee soft tissues (medial and lateral collateral ligament, patellar tendon) while functionally loaded in a kinematic knee rig. Tissue displacements and strains will then be computed using our UE approach. Results from UE will be compared with the current gold standard approach (digital image correlation; DIC) to enable calibration and then accuracy assessment. TKAs will then be performed on the specimens by an orthopedic surgeon, and altered knee balance will be imposed by overstuffing the medial or lateral components of the knee. The sensitivity of UE measurements to these altered balance conditions will be assessed. An important outcome of this aim will also be the public sharing of the validation dataset (ultrasound data, DIC and kinematics). In Aim 2, soft tissue mechanics will be evaluated in healthy adults (n=20), and adults with a prior TKA demonstrating acceptable (n=20) and unacceptable (n=20) stability. Comparison of UE- computed displacements and strains will provide insight into the effects of TKA on knee stability. Finally, in Aim 3, these results will be compiled and discriminant function analysis will be used to determine which tasks and measures provide the best discriminating power for clinical assessment. These data will be paired with clinical insight to provide recommendations for clinical integration of UE for the assessment of soft tissue knee balance. Successful completion of these aims will contribute to improving the outcomes of TKA for the more than 600,000 Americans who annually undergo this procedure, and will point to specific intra-operative techniques that can improve TKA outcomes."
"9303469","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How brain activity can lead to complex and ?exible behavioral outputs has fascinated neuroscientists and philosophers alike. There is mounting evidence that complex behaviors result from the activity of a multitude of simpler (sometimes competing) circuits. Yet, our understanding of even the simplest circuits remains spotty, in part because available technology has limited researchers to studying only one or a few aspects of a circuit at a time. We stand at the cusp of a revolution in recording and imaging technology that will ultimately allow us to investigate comprehensively how the fundamental biological building blocks of the human brain are constructed and ?t together. Even now, the limitations mentioned no longer apply to certain less complex, more experimentally approachable brains. These provide attractive stepping stones for understanding our own complex brain. The relatively simple nervous system of the European medicinal leech will be used to develop insights about how the activity of all the cells in a nervous system together produce individual behaviors from overlapping functional networks, a phenomenon that - at a much larger scale and undoubtedly with many complexities added - is also crucial to human brain function. Three types of experiments will be performed: Record the activity of all the neurons in a ganglion - the unit of activity in this animal's brain - using high-resolution voltage-sensitive dye imaging, as it perfors four different behaviors - swimming, crawling, local bending, and shortening. Use electron microscopy to reconstruct the full connectivity pattern - the connectome - of the same ganglion that was imaged. Use electrophysiology to add functional signi?cance to the anatomical connectome. Obtaining a simultaneous activity record of all the individual neurons in a ganglion as it generates several behaviors will be a ?rst. Combining this record with the reconstructed connectome of that very same ganglion will establish a data set with unprecedented potential for advancing our understanding of the link between neuronal connectivity and behavior. A particular focus will be on neurons and synaptic connections that span multiple behavioral circuits, to determine their roles in selecting behaviors. This project will generate huge amounts of data on circuit anatomy and neuronal activity. These data will be made generally available, so that other laboratories can generate and test hypotheses of their own on function and connectivity of leech neural circuits. Many aspects of the dynamics that the leech nervous system uses to select and perform behaviors appear to be similar to the mechanisms used by more complex brains. Accordingly, the value of the hypotheses that we and other users of our data will generate may extend far beyond the leech to distant branches of the taxonomic tree including our own."

"9308948","Defects in the catabolism of branched chain amino acids cause 13 metabolic disorders Yet essentially nothing is known about the physical parameters defining the BCAA metabolon, or the relationship of its disruption to human disease. My lab has defined many of the genes encoding these proteins, and characterized their enzymatic function and the disorders associated with their deficiency. Recently, variants in the ACAD10 gene have been shown to be associated with a risk for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Pima Indians, but the mechanism of this risk has not been elucidated. To examine the role of ACAD10 in the development of T2DM, we generated a knock out mouse model. Strikingly, deficient animals gained excessive weight and became insulin resistant. The long-range goal of this project is to characterize the metabolism of branched chain acyl-CoAs and to identify the consequences of its failure in humans. This renewal application has three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to examine the mitochondrial architecture of branched chain amino acid metabolism. I hypothesize that the proteins responsible for branched chain amino acid metabolism form a functional complex within mitochondria. Specific Aim 1a is to use immuno- and cryo-electronmicroscopy to visualize the BCAA metabolic complex. Specific Aim 1b will employ co-immunoprecipitation with and without chemical crosslinking to identify binding partners in the BCAA metabolic complex. I predict that the branched chain specific ACADs will interact tightly with the branched chain keto-acid dehydrogenase to form the core of the BCAA metabolic complex. Specific Aim 1c is to examine disruption of the BCAA complex in genetic disorders of of the ACADs. I hypothesize that differential effects caused by the mutations in the various genes are responsible for the broad array of clinical symptoms seen in these disease. Specific Aim 2 is to demonstrate metabolic channeling of branched chain amino acid substrates in normal cells and those deficient in the branched chain specific ACADs. Specific Aim 2a is to use of metabolic flux studies to further characterize BCAA metabolism. I predict that propionyl-CoA generated from a labeled odd chain fatty acid will readily enter the TCA cycle while that derived from labeled BCAA will not. Specific Aim 2b is to characterize the flux through BCAA in cells deficient in one of the branched chain ACADs. I predict that flux of ILE and VAL metabolites through intact pathways in SBCAD and IBDH deficient cell lines will exceed that of leucine metabolites in IVDH cell lines. Specific Aim 3 is to characterize the mechanisms for the development of T2DM in ACAD10 deficient mice. Specific Aim 3a is to characterize the enzymatic function of ACAD10. I propose to perform expanded directed metabolomics studies on various tissues from ACAD10 mice to identify candidate substrates for the enzyme. Specific Aim 3b is to characterize the glucose insulin axis in ACAD10 deficient mice. These experiments will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms that define clinical risk in defects of these enzymes."
"9321984","Abstract ? Project 4 ? Gene Expression Project Twin research has shown that aggregate genetic effects on health are systematically modified by factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) and social relationships. In this new MIDUS project, we will begin identifying the specific pathways that integrate the effects of genes and psychosocial environments to jointly influence targeted biological risk factors for aging-related diseases. Specifically, we aim to harness new methods for genome-wide transcriptional profiling and related bioinformatic interpretive strategies to study how the expression profiles of genes central to the body's immune-inflammatory response are affected by socioeconomic standing and social relational experience. Preliminary studies show how adverse psychosocial conditions such as low SES and social isolation affect the expression of several specific sets of genes relevant to health outcomes. These studies have identified a ?Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity? (CTRA) marked by up-regulation of pro- inflammatory genes and down-regulation of genes involved in Type I interferon responses and production of specific antibody isotypes. Although provocative, this research has yet to be conducted in nationally representative samples and needs to be expanded to a broader range of potentially relevant psychosocial risk factors. Of particular importance is the need to examine whether psychosocial advantages might ameliorate the impact of adverse life experience. The overarching aim of this new project is to integrate gene expression profiling and related bioinformatic assessment of CTRA transcriptome profiles into the rich knowledge of psychosocial aging afforded by MIDUS. The specific aims are the following: (1) Obtain genome-wide transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for participants in the MIDUS Biomarker Project; (2) Examine how cumulative socioeconomic and social relational profiles impact gene expression in this group of participants; (3) Determine if psychosocial advantage or disadvantage directly impacts gene expression, net of genetic endowment, by conducting an identical co-twin control study within this group."
"9323477","Project Summary A differentiated, mature oocyte is ?activated? to become totipotent and to begin embryo development through an increase in its cytoplasmic free Ca2+ levels. In mammals, this increase is initially induced by the fertilizing sperm, which stimulates release of Ca2+ from internal stores. However, recent studies have shown that subsequent Ca2+ oscillations that are essential for mammalian egg activation require influx of external Ca2+ from the environment into the oocyte, through as yet unknown channels and mechanisms. Although Drosophila had not been considered a good model for these processes because its eggs activate prior to fertilization, our recent work has shown that Drosophila egg activation also involves a local Ca2+ influx. This influx is followed by a wave of increased Ca2+ that sweeps through the egg cytoplasm, using mechanisms like those used by mammalian oocytes. We showed that the initial Ca2+ influx in Drosophila occurs at the oocyte poles, through mechanosensitive channels ? most likely conserved channels in the TRP family. We propose to establish Drosophila as a new model for the Ca2+-based phase of egg activation. We will use this model to identify the channels that mediate sperm-independent Ca2+ influx and the conditions that cause Ca2+ channels to be open only at the egg poles. We will also determine whether the increased Ca2+ mediates the changes to the oocyte phosphoproteome that normally accompany egg activation, and whether the Ca2+ signal transducer calcineurin is required for these phosphoproteome changes. We expect the results of our studies to be generalizable to mechanisms in mammalian egg activation. Moreover, conserved proteins with Ca2+- dependent phosphomodifications will be candidates for future testing as markers for assessing human ART conditions, oocyte quality and aiding the diagnosis of infertilities that cannot respond to current ART methods."
"9302769","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of available organs is severely limited by a shortage of donors. A new field of science, regenerative medicine, has emerged that brings the potential of designing and creating artificial organs, or parts of organs, closer to reality. T develop functional tissue requires applying concepts in developmental biology, quantitative science and tissue engineering approaches in a novel way. This requires a new type of scientist who has been well-trained in the concepts and methods at the interfaces of engineering and other disciplines. Successfully integrating these approaches could dramatically catalyze the formation of a new interdisciplinary approach to organ building. This would have a profound impact on the treatment of many diseases.  The ODET (Organ Design and Engineering postdoctoral Training) Program continues to provide scientifically rigorous, multidisciplinary research training to postdoctoral fellows at Harvard and MIT. Individuals accepted into the Program are cross-trained in an area of expertise outside of their primary research field. This is a continuation of an ARRA-funded training program, reduced in size. Working at the intersection of engineering and developmental/regenerative biology, trainees learn a new language and ultimately develop a common dialect that effectively bridges disciplines. This new generation of scholars is prepared to address the complexity of organ design and engineering from an interdisciplinary approach. The program is enriched with outstanding dual-mentor interactions, regularly scheduled program mentoring and a required course.  Since its inception in 2007, the program has formalized the evaluation of trainees' development as well as provided increased opportunities for research presentations and feedback. We successfully changed the standard postdoctoral mode of training from the one postdoctoral fellow - one mentor - one laboratory approach to a true [dual-mentor model where fellows spend time in the laboratories of two mentors and are able to facilitate active communication across laboratories, institutions and geographic boundaries.] This program continues to provide trainees with tools necessary to become independent investigators facile with an interdisciplinary approach to science. Trainees who have received support from this grant over the past 5 years have high quality publications, have moved to academic faculty, international research lab and industry leadership positions. We look forward to continuing to train leaders in multidisciplinary research with exposure to clinical challenges, while critically assessing and improving the fellowship experience by optimizing research and mentoring opportunities for the next generation of engineer-investigators in regenerative medicine."
"9296152","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a cell-cell communication system that plays important roles in development, regeneration and cancer. Hh signaling is orchestrated in vertebrates at primary cilia, antenna-like organelles that project fro the surfaces of most cells in our bodies and serve as signaling centers in development. Mutations in cilia genes cause a number of inherited human diseases called ciliopathies, many of which are characterized by birth defects and other phenotypes attributable to aberrant Hh signaling. Despite its importance as a target in cancer and regenerative medicine, many of the steps in Hh signaling remain poorly understood at the biochemical and cell biological level. My research program is focused on the major unsolved mechanistic questions in the vertebrate Hh pathway, with a particular emphasis on ciliary mechanisms that mediate signal propagation and transcriptional activation. The Hh signal is transmitted across the membrane by the 7-pass transmembrane protein Smo, the target for all anti-Hh drugs in clinical use. However, we do not understand the mechanism by which Smo is activated in response to Hh ligands, nor do we know how activated Smo in turn signals to the Glioblastoma (Gli) family of transcription factors. Primary cilia play an important role in both steps- Hh ligands promote the accumulation of Smo in the ciliary membrane, a critical step in signaling that eventually leads to the activation of Gl proteins as they traffic through the ciliary compartment. Delineating this mechanism will provide a valuable paradigm for how TM receptors relay signals from the ciliary membrane to the nucleus. Three major questions under investigation are (1) how Smo is activated by the main Hh receptor Patched 1 through endogenous small molecule ligands, (2) how activated Smo in the ciliary membrane transmits signals to the Gli proteins and (3) how Gli proteins are converted into transcriptional activators. We have made progress in each of these areas. Using new chemical tools to probe the interaction between Smo and oxysterols, endogenous lipids that can activate Hh signaling, we identified and structurally characterized a previously unknown ligand-binding site with regulatory potential in Smo. Using comparative proteomics, we identified a ciliary membrane protein complex that engages Smo at cilia in response to Hh signals and is required for Smo signaling. Finally, we have characterized both dynamic phosphorylation and protein association events that play critical role in Gli activation. Our work is supported by productive collaborations with investigators who have expertise in synthetic chemistry, structural biology, mass spectrometry and embryology. The successful completion of this project will provide (1) an answer to the question of Smo regulation, perhaps the longest-standing mystery in the Hh pathway, (2) an understanding of how ciliary protein trafficking drives signaling and how these processes are corrupted in ciliopathies, and (3) new strategies to monitor and modulate the pathway in Hh-related diseases."

Current methods, however, continue to be non-inclusive of students of color and those marginalized by socioeconomic status. Environmental issues are some of the highest priority global concerns, including climate change, food security, and water shortages, and adequately addressing these issues will require people with a high level of skill across STEM. We here propose the use of education as an intervention into student health, their environment and community, an idea we call Prescription Education. We aim to integrate the concept of prescription education into STEM education reform with a focus on Environmental Science. Our specific aims include: 1) establishment of an Environmental Science hub for our program, Integrated Science Education Outreach (InSciEd Out) with a focus on toxicology; and 2) the creation of a transgenic and mutant zebrafish resource for use in environmental toxicology by all STEM researchers. The successful completion of the InSciEd Out Prescription Education work in Environmental Sciences described herein will result in: Vetted K-12 classroom curriculum in Environmental Toxicity; A framework for scaling STEM interventions; and a molecular toolbox for improving STEM education through the use of the highly accessible zebrafish model system."

"9320931","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My dedication to spinal cord injury (SCI) comes from both my clinical and academic experiences. As a clinician, I specialized in improving the overall function of persons with SCI and teaching other clinicians specialized treatments for SCI. As an academic, I have had extensive and broad research experiences in SCI. I started working in human SCI research first examining bone mineral density changes post injury at the University of Iowa and then studying the spinal circuitry changes occurring post SCI that contribute to spams at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. My experience with human SCI research and my experiences in the clinic prompted my return to academia full-time to use research to improve the lives of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) as my main focus. During my PhD with Jack Kessler, MD, my emphasis was toward interventions. I used developmental neurobiological approaches to attenuating or solving SCI including neural and oligodendritic replacement with embryonic stem cells and axon regeneration with growth factors and development-inspired nanotechnology materials. In performing these studies with my experience as a physical therapist, I saw a great need to develop specific quantitative behavioral tests so we can prove not only that our interventions work, but how exactly they contribute to function. My postdoctoral fellowship with Matt Tresch, PhD, aimed at developing such tests. At present, we have pioneered several new techniques for looking at in vivo mouse behaviors including chronic multi-muscle EMG recordings and single motor unit recordings in the mouse. The spectrum of neuroscientific areas and techniques in which I have experience is quite broad, however, the one piece that is missing is the ability to examine neuronal function using cellular electrophysiology. My short-term career goal is to fill this gap. This proposal provides the expertise and protected time for this learning to occur. Once I am able to perform the techniques listed in my proposal and combine these with my previous experimental knowledge and clinical experience, I will be uniquely qualified for my long-term goal of producing a comprehensive, translatable spinal cord injury research program that is based on novel therapeutics and a basic science understanding of how recovery can be improved, not only on a cellular basis, but on a systems basis as well.  Mentorship for this award and for the beginning of my career is found here at Northwestern as well as at outside institutions. I began my position as an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences Physiology at Northwestern University in 2013. The PTHMS and Physiology departments are very supportive of my research, as my position requires at most 20% teaching and research space within the Physiology Department. I have shared space and equipment with my consultant, Matt Tresch, PhD for my proposed in vivo behavioral experiments as well as for space and equipment for the proposed in vitro cellular electrophysiology experiments from my mentor, CJ Heckman, PhD. Again, my goal is always to design my experiments to be as clinically relevant as possible and my clinical experience supports this goal, but my chairperson and consultant Jules Dewald, PT, PhD, will also be evaluating my work for translatability as this is clearly a strength for him. Finally, two outstandng researchers, Ron Harris-Warrick, PhD at Cornell University and Claire Meehan, PhD at the University of Copenhagen will provide mentoring outside of Northwestern. They have both graciously invited me to their laboratories to learn their novel and unique in vitro cellular electrophysiology techniques to answer the questions posed in my proposal.  The inception of this proposal started at the beginning of my professional journey when working in human SCI with Brian Schmit, PhD and in the clinic with SCI patients and aims to understand the cellular changes underlying spams after SCI so as to provide better treatments. Spasms are caused by hyperexcitability in both interneurons and motoneurons. Normally, descending neuromodulatory pathways, especially the serotonergic raphespinal system, control excitability of both types of spinal neurons. The loss of this serotonergic input to the spinal cord has several consequences, all of which potentially contribute to spasms following SCI. First, following complete transection, the loss of this serotonergic input to the ventral spinal cord causes motoneurons to increase expression of constitutively active serotonin receptors. This adaptation causes motoneurons to become intrinsically hyperexcitable and to become supersensitive to any residual serotonin. In addition to these effects on ventrally located motoneurons, the loss of raphespinal inputs to the dorsal spinal cord releases interneurons from serotonergic inhibition, increasing interneuron excitability and supersensitivity. Each of these alterations can contribute to the expression of spasms following SCI. However, their specific contributions will depend on the nature of the spinal injury. For example, the supersensitivity of neurons to serotonin might play a smaller role following complete SCI than following incomplete SCI where some residual raphespinal systems remain intact. Similarly, injuries that preferentially affect dorsal or ventral raphespinal systems might differentially involve hyperexcitability in motoneurons or disinhibition of interneurons. Our proposal uses an unparalleled range of unique mouse preparations and novel therapeutics to test how these cellular alterations underlie the variability seen in spasms post SCI and provide directions for therapeutic intervention."
"9323665","The Hope laboratory has recently published the identification and characterization of the earliest cells infected by SIV in the mucosa 48 hours after vaginal and rectal inoculation. In developing this system, the Hope laboratory has developed critical methods and expertise allowing the study of SIV and immune target cell populations within the mucosal barriers. These capabilities will be leveraged along with a strategy to specifically seed infection in tissue so that the latent reservoir will be generated within a discrete area at these mucosal sites (and other body sites). The specific seeding of the reservoir can be validated and complemented by the unique PET/CT imaging expertise/infrastructure pioneered by Francois Villinger to detect foci of active virus infection. With the knowledge of mucosal reservoir localization, we will also track SIV rebound from latency in the early reservoir cells as it cascades to viremia when early, suppressive ART is withdrawn. Identification of these early events will be aided by bioluminescent reporter viruses and whole animal PET/CT. These approaches will provide critical new insights into latently infected cells and facilitate the development of a cure to HIV infection. The proposed studies will achieve the following specific aims: (1) Define and characterize the mucosal virus reservoir cells (cells harboring SIV that remain persistent/latent during suppressive ART). This will specifically characterize the cells with persistent virus that are established during the earliest aspects of acute SIV infection of macaques. This aim will determine the phenotypes, locations, viral production status, and persistence within the mucosa of these reservoirs established with the first days of infection before starting suppressive ART. (2) Define and characterize the spread of virus within and beyond the mucosal foci of SIV infected cells, and from which rebound viremia originates, after stopping early, suppressive ART. This aim uses using both PET/CT and reporter viruses, and will also evaluate host responses and biomarkers. (3) Determine the stability of the mucosal reservoir over time and evaluate the effects of catalytic mTOR inhibitors (given before and temporarily after stopping ART) on the SIV viremia rebound from mucosa, following 24 weeks of viral suppression by ART that started in the first days after mucosal inoculation of SIV. We will utilize recently developed methods and expertise to observe the formation of the mucosal reservoir formed in the first few days after virus acquisition. By seeding the reservoir in specific areas we should be able to observe the rebound from latency. A better understanding of the localization and cell type of the reservoir cells will facilitate the development of a cure for HIV."
"9225462","Abstract  Lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration is a cascade of cellular, structural and mechanical changes that is strongly implicated as a cause of low back pain. The central nucleus pulposus (NP) is implicated in the initiation of this degenerative cascade, where decreasing proteoglycan content and an associated reduction in hydrostatic pressure impair the ability of the NP to effectively engage the surrounding annulus fibrosus and to evenly distribute and transfer compressive loads between the vertebrae. There is a critical need for therapies for disc degeneration that restore disc structure and mechanical function by directly addressing the underlying biological causes. A key challenge to developing effective biological treatments for disc degeneration is the need to recapitulate the structural complexity and specialized extracellular matrix of the component tissues, which comprise cells of multiple developmental lineages. Here we propose to address this challenge by directly applying developmental paradigms to establish an optimized biological disc regeneration strategy. Embryonic and postnatal disc formation is regulated by cells derived from the notochord. These cells secrete an array of growth factors that regulate cell migration, proliferation, differentiation and extracellular matrix deposition, and ultimately, directly give rise to the NP itself. There is therefore intense interest in identifying notochordal cell-secreted factors and applying them to develop improved therapeutic strategies for disc regeneration. The ideal stage to investigate the regenerative potential of notochordal cells is when they are most actively contributing to embryonic and early postnatal disc development. Therefore the overall objective of this proposal is to establish the regenerative potential of embryonic, notochord-derived nucleus pulposus progenitor cells (NDCs). Specifically, we will define the growth factor expression profile of NDCs at key stages of embryonic and postnatal disc development using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), and directly establish the regenerative potential of NDCs as a function of developmental stage using an in vivo mouse model of disc degeneration. The results of this work will provide a roadmap for optimizing cell and growth factor-based therapeutics for disc regeneration."

"9336727","Project Abstract Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, genetic neurodegenerative disease that shares many features with other common neurological disorders. HD is caused by expansion of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene, which leads to expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein with an extended polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. mHTT induces neuronal dysfunction, prominent striatal atrophy, and ultimately, cell death. A disease-modifying treatment for HD does not currently exist despite decades of study and numerous clinical trials, motivating the need for discovery of new therapeutic targets. One potential target is the RNA binding motif protein 3 (RBM3), a stress-response protein that enhances synaptogenesis, protein translation, and cell survival. RBM3 is reduced in neuronal cell models of HD, and my preliminary data suggest that RBM3 mRNA levels are reduced in human HD brain. In cell models, RBM3 overexpression protects against polyQ-induced cell death. This suggests that RBM3 plays a role both in HD pathogenesis and neuroprotection. In addition, RBM3 overexpression plays a neuroprotective role in murine models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and prion disease, supporting a broad beneficial role for RBM3. Based on this data, I hypothesize that RBM3 dysregulation plays a role in the HD pathological cascade and that RBM3 overexpression will alleviate HD pathogenesis. My first aim is to examine the mechanism of RBM3 dysregulation and dysfunction in the setting of the mHTT allele in vitro. I will characterize RBM3 localization, distribution and co-localization with mHTT to determine whether RBM3 is sequestered by mHTT or improperly trafficked in HD cells. Because mHTT can directly repress transcription, I will determine whether mHTT represses RBM3 expression using in vitro assays. I will also assess RBM3's function in regulating post- transcriptional gene expression. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity is reduced in the striatum of HD patient brain and in an HD murine model. Therefore, my second aim is to investigate the disease-modifying effects of RBM3 overexpression in the striatum of HD mice and whether the positive effects of RBM3 require mTORC1 activity. To elucidate the interaction between RBM3 and mTORC1, I will overexpress RBM3 in the striatum of HD mice via AAV transduction and examine the progression of mTORC1- regulated transcriptional changes and striatal atrophy. To determine if RBM3-mediated protection depends on mTORC1 activity I will also overexpress RBM3 while inhibiting mTORC1, and assess correction of neurological phenotypes. Together, these studies will provide insight into the mechanism of pathogenesis in HD, which will be crucial for the development of therapeutic targets. Furthermore, RBM3 may emerge as a therapeutic target for conditions that broadly induce cellular stress including other common neurodegenerative diseases, as well as stroke and traumatic brain injury."
"9336342","ABSTRACT Physical inactivity is a physical inactivity than risk factor for many important chronic diseases. Latino men report higher rates of non-Latinos, are less likely to meet PA guidelines and are disproportionately affected by PA-related health conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. Most Latino PA interventions have focused on women; the vast majority excluded men and none specifically targeted men. Moreover interventions that included men focused mostly on Mexican American only. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective PA interventions with diverse populations of Latino men. NIH has specifically called for research studies to focus on the development and testing of culturally appropriate health-promoting interventions to reduce health disparities among racially and ethnically diverse men. Our research team has 25 years of experience developing, implementing and evaluating individually tailored, theory-based, computer-driven PA interventions including `Seamos Saludables' (in RI) and `Pasos' (in CA), culturally and linguistically adapted, individually- tailored print (Seamos) and web-based (Pasos) interventions for a diverse population of sedentary Latina women that were successful in increasing PA in Latina women. We then conducted formative interviews with Latino men, which confirmed that an intervention would be well-received by them. However, substantial content modifications were needed, so we adapted the print intervention and tested it in a demonstration trial with 10 Mexican American men. After 12 weeks, participants reported a significant increase (p=.03) in mean minutes of PA from 1.50 min/week at baseline to 125.70 min/week at 12 weeks with 100% retention and expressed enthusiasm for the program. However, less than half of the men achieved the PA guidelines of 150 minutes/week. Thus, further enhancements appear to be needed. Follow-up interviews indicated that the intervention was well received, but the men felt that they needed greater accountability, more contact with staff and other participants, briefer and more frequent information, more updates on PA opportunities, and ideas for addressing environmental barriers. The men specifically mentioned interest in web and/or text-based interventions to meet these needs. Thus, we will conduct formative research with a diverse population of Latino men in RI to inform the adaptation of the Pasos web-based intervention that was developed for Latina women, enhance it with new cell phone/text-based intervention components, and ensure that it is culturally appropriate for Latino men of Caribbean, South and Central American origin. We will then conduct a pilot study to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy with a diverse population of Latino men in RI. In the pilot study, we will also explore potential moderators of treatment effects including demographics, acculturation, and environmental variables such as the neighborhood built, social and economic environments. The results of this pilot study will inform a future randomized controlled trial with Latino men to increase PA."

"9314220","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Liver cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers; hundreds of thousands of new cases occur yearly with only a 20% chance of survival one year past diagnosis. Furthermore, the mortality rate of liver cancer is increasing beyond most other cancers. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) makes up to 70-85% of all cases of liver cancer, and currently only the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor Sorafenib is approved as therapy outside of surgery and radiation. Sorafenib was first approved in 2007, and since this time all subsequent approaches have thus far failed to improve upon an average 2.8 month extension in overall survival for liver cancer patients. A significant challenge in improving upon Sorafenib is that the mechanism of this drug, in particular the functional basis for efficacy and toxicity, remains poorly understood in HCC. Although originally developed as a RAF-kinase inhibitor, it is unlikely that RAF inhibitory activity is responsible for patient responses to Sorafenib. VEGFR has been suggested as an important target, yet other more potent VEGFR inhibitors have failed to extend life in comparison with Sorafenib. Due to the multi-kinase activity of Sorafenib, I hypothesize Sorafenib is modulating both undesirable anti-targets as well as desirable targets. I furthermore posit that it is the balance between the targets and anti-target activities of Sorafenib that largely determines the therapeutic index of this drug. Here, I propose to evaluate a focused library of Sorafenib analogs (Sorafelogs) to uncover structure-activity relationships (SAR) that will be used to identify functional targets and anti-targets of Sorafenib. We have already identified striking SAR with preliminary compounds in the context of HCC cell line models, and are using cross-comparison of these structurally related compounds to uncover the mechanistic basis for growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis by Sorafenib. Putative physical targets will be validated using biochemical and genetic approaches. Furthermore, we have identified a Sorafelog, which we term AD80, which is 10 to 100-fold more cytotoxic on HCC cell lines than Sorafenib. However, in whole animals, this compound is well-tolerated suggesting limited side-effects. We will explore both Sorafenib and AD80?s targets and anti-targets using pathway analysis on cell line models, and a whole-body fly genetic model of HCC. These findings should lead to an optimized version of Sorafenib that would inhibit drivers (ie. targets), but avoid suppressors (anti-targets). These studies will provide a greater mechanistic understanding of viable therapeutic options for this heterogeneous disease, and furthermore will provide compounds that ideally reduce toxicity and increase efficacy in HCC. This will also help to better select patients with the highest probability of responding to Sorafelogs, and decrease the costs impaired by liver cancer."
"9380810","The dendritic cells (DCs) of the mammalian innate immune system are responsible for detection of microbial encounters and the initiation of inflammation and adaptive immunity. This central role of DCs in host physiology has attracted much attention, and these cells are the subject of active investigation. Despite the appreciation of the importance of DCs, there remain large and fundamental gaps in our knowledge of their mechanisms of regulation. For instance, DCs encode several receptors that detect bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), yet the functions of only one (TLR4) have been examined extensively. Recent work by us and others have identified the LPS receptors CD14 and caspase-11 as being capable of inducing novel signaling pathways that proceed either upstream of TLR4 (CD14) or in parallel to TLR4 (caspase-11). The collective actions of CD14, TLR4 and caspase-11 are important for DC activation and host defense, yet their mechanisms of action are poorly defined. Thus, significant gaps in our knowledge exist to explain the earliest stages of DC interactions with bacteria. We also lack an understanding of how DCs interact with T cells at later stages of infection, yet it is clear that these interactions lead to profound changes in the activities of both cell types. Much of the research into these interactions has focused on how DCs promote changes in T cell activities. In contrast, we have a minimal understanding of how T cells influence the activity of DCs. In this application, we propose to fill these gaps in our knowledge of DC biology through forward genetic screening for novel regulatory factors in mice. This approach is facilitated by recent advances in genome editing provided by CRISPR-based technologies. A pipeline of gene discovery will be generated through the use of established and emerging FACS-based assays. These assays will be used in vivo and ex vivo to identify DCs that are deficient for regulators of DC interactions with microbes or T cells. All screens will depend on significant interactions between the informatics, mouse perturbation and CRISPR library Cores associated with this U19 application. Subsequent functional analysis of candidate regulatory proteins will be performed in collaboration with other investigators on this grant. The cumulative result of these efforts will be a series of novel gene sets that should define pathways and processes that explain numerous aspects of DC biology as they relate to host defense."
"9327800","ABSTRACT  Digital Microfluidics ? Minimizing blood volume for pediatric coagulation screening (HL125484) It is reported that up to 20% of neonates undergoing cardiac surgery suffer a major thrombosis event. Mortality related to pediatric stroke, pulmonary embolism, or thrombosis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery may be as high as 10%. In addition to mortality, the morbidity of pediatric thrombosis is significant, and includes prolonged hospitalization and permanent disability. Pediatric patients who are at increased risk for thrombosis due to either congenital or acquired hypercoagulability require individualized anticoagulation management. A hypercoagulability panel allows both risk stratification for guiding therapeutic management, as well as a panel to monitor anticoagulation therapy during and post cardiac surgical procedures. Screening for hypercoagulability is indicated in pediatric patients with a family history of thrombosis, or in those who have suffered a major thrombotic or thromboembolic event. Widespread screening of low risk pediatric patients is controversial, and therefore not an optimal target population for this proposal. Unfortunately, there are no large randomized trials in pediatrics due to the large volume of blood necessary to perform the testing; this is a major deterrent to collecting the data necessary to resolve this controversy. Currently available screening tests are expensive, time-consuming and ordered individually, requiring large volumes of blood sample. These issues make screening and monitoring for a full hypercoagulability panel clinically impractical, especially in high-risk pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Hence, there is a compelling need for an inexpensive hypercoagulability laboratory panel that requires very small volumes of blood, has a rapid turn- around time and has the potential to be applied to a larger number of potentially at-risk patients at multiple time points during their surgical management. Such a diagnostic panel is possible by employing a digital microfluidic system. Hypercoagulability tests on a digital microfluidic cartridge will enable portable automation, rapid turn-around time, and multiplexing several assays, including different types of assays (immunoassays and functional) utilizing about 350 nL sample per test. A disposable single-use cartridge for hypercoagulability panel testing using digital microfluidic manipulation of droplets will be used on a small form factor instrument. In Phase I, we successfully translated immunoassays (Anti-thrombin III, Protein C and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1) and functional assays (Anti- thrombin III, Protein C, Plasminogen, Factor VIII and Thrombin generation) onto a digital microfluidic cartridge. In Phase II, we will multiplex the assays for a complete thrombophilia panel on a single disposable cartridge, perform comprehensive analytical validations, and conduct a pilot study at Boston Children's Hospital. The ultimate goal is the development of a single platform that can perform multiplexed immunoassays and functional assays using less than 50 µL whole blood sample to determine hypercoagulability risk and guide anticoagulation management, with initial emphasis on high-risk pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery."

The focus on interdisciplinary training at the Harvard School of Public Health, its rich research resources, and its talented and diverse student body and faculty makes it an ideal setting in which to provide a training program in environmental statistics."
"9320728","OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This project serves as the ligand/drug development component of a comprehensive collaborative effort to study the structural and functional properties of CB1 and CB2, the two known cannabinoid receptors. During the current funding period we have developed high-affinity covalent and non-covalent CB1/CB2 ligands that have allowed us to probe the manner in which structurally diverse classes of ligands interact and activate or deactivate each of the two receptors. To study the foot-printing of individual ligands on each receptor, we developed a Ligand Assisted Protein Structure (LAPS) approach which includes the use of covalent ligands capable of irreversibly attaching to the receptor active site(s) in conjunction with judiciously designed receptor mutants and detailed LC/MS/MS methods. To date, our results provide initial evidence that different classes of cannabinergic ligands interact and activate/deactivate the CB1 and CB2 receptors through distinct binding motifs. We have hypothesized that the individual binding motifs we have identified may be associated with distinct identifiable signaling pathway(s) leading to different ligand-dependent pharmacological profiles (functional selectivity/biased agonism). The project will provide the basis for the development of novel functionally selective CB1 and CB2 ligands and includes two complementary components. This project encompasses two components: 1) The first is a ligand development aspect which proposes the design and synthesis of novel high-affinity photoactivatable and electrophilic covalent ligands for CB1 and CB2 in which the reactive groups are strategically introduced in one (monofunctional) or two (bifunctional) sites within the parent ligand. Additionally, this component includes the design and synthesis of high-affinity reversible functionally distinct ligands and a lead optimization aspect for the design and synthesis of functionally selective CB2 agonists; 2) In the second component strategically designed single and multiple site mutants of CB1 and CB2 (human and rodent) expressed in HEK293 cells will be used to test individual successful ligands for covalent attachment and for their functional properties using the cAMP assay as an initial screen (under the auspices of Core 2). Binding site characterization will be based on the complementary use of a) receptor mutants; and b) LC/MS/MS characterization of the specific amino acid residue(s) to which the ligand is attached using our LAPS methodology. The results and ligands produced under the auspices of this project will serve as a basis for the treatment of addiction and pain using novel medications with improved pharmacological profiles. This Project 1 will design and synthesize novel ligands to probe their interactions with the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. The results can be used to develop improved medications for pain and addictive disorders."
"9272956","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major goal of this application is to maintain the Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) program at the Caribbean Primate Research Center's (CPRC) through support of operations, management, veterinary care, virological and MHC typing, and by the improvement of the comprehensive genetic management plan. A unique feature of the CPRC animals that had facilitated the successful establishment and improved sustainability of the SPF colony is that these animals are naturally free of SIV and SRV-D, two of the four viruses to be tested for(4). Undoubtedly, this trait has contributed to the establishment of a successful program with very limited number of sero-conversions. Nevertheless, for safety and as required for the SPF Program, The CPRC continues systematically testing for all four viruses (B virus, STLV, SIV and SRV-D). The Program provides unadmixed Indian-origin rhesus monkeys with defined genetic and virological background. The population genetic analyses revealed that the SPF colony has remained genetically homogenous over time with sufficient amounts of heterozygosity and minima stratification from its non- SPF founders. Genetic variation will be maintained in the SPF colony using the genetic management strategies described in this application. The genetic management approach will allow for enrichment of desired MHC markers in demand for biomedical research while maintaining genetic diversity. To ensure the long-term viability of the CPRC-SPF colony, the Center's approach for genetic management will be concordant with the NIH's National NHP Genetics and Genomics Working Group's guidelines. The estimate of Indian ancestry among the C P R C - S P F a n i m a l s is also among the highest that have been calculated across several National Primate Research Centers (NPRCs) in the US. Funds are requested in this application to maintain the SPF program and to meet the proposed aims. With continued NIH support, the Institutional contribution and with funds from the program income, the SPF program at CPRC will remain a significant national research resource and will be able to provide healthy SPF Indian- origin rhesus monkeys of defined genetic and virological background to NIH-sponsored research programs, specially HIV/AIDS studies."
"9277916","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a proposal for the renewal of a training grant, the primary purpose of which is to provide stipends for five predoctoral and three postdoctoral fellows who will be broadly and intensively trained to conduct research on the neurobiological and behavioral effects of alcohol. This program has a long history of training predoctoral and postdoctoral students in alcoholism research to help the national effort of producing the next generation of independent scientists with a focus on alcohol research. Training opportunities span the breadth of state-of- the-art approaches including molecular biology and genetics, electrophysiology, cellular imaging, neurochemistry, and behavior. Research models include both animal and human. The training program will promote and support collaborative research across multiple departmental units and Ph.D. programs including Clinical Psychology, Behavioral Neuroscience, Pharmacology, Neuroscience, and Cellular and Molecular Biology. Molecular biology training will encompass 1) studies of the function of excitatory and inhibitory ion channels in cellular expression systems (Mihic, Harris), 2) development of new transgenic animal models (Messing, Harris, Mihic, Pierce-Shimomura, Atkinson), and 3) identification of ethanol responsive genes (Atkinson, Harris, Mihic, Pierce-Shimomura). Genetics training will involve genotyping of human and animal subjects (Fromme, Harris, Mayfield, Ponomarev). Electrophysiological and microscopic imaging training will comprise experiments with whole cell and intracellular methods in single cells and in brain slices (Morrisett, Mihic, Harris, Atkinson, Pierce-Shimomura, Messing, Marinelli). Training in neurochemistry will focus on 1) intracellular and extracellular signaling mechanisms with an emphasis on phosphorylation (Morrisett, Mayfield), 2) release and transport of glutamate, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters (Gonzales, Harris, Dominguez), and 3) expression of proteins (Harris, Mayfield, Morrisett, Messing). Research on the behavioral effects of ethanol will include its influence on motor skills, reinforcement, anxiety, and withdrawal (Harris, Gonzales, Dominguez, Morrisett). Training in psychosocial aspects of alcohol research (Fromme) and the interaction of genotype and effects of alcohol drinking in humans (Fromme, Harris) will also be done. The training program will continue to emphasize professional development including improvement of oral and written communication skills and grant writing. Predoctoral students will be required to complete a series of core course requirements, scientific ethics, experimental design, and statistical analysis, and will end up with a Ph.D. degree. Postdoctoral training will be for three years and consist of focused alcohol research guided by a faculty mentor. We will continue to focus on minority recruitment. The training faculty has an excellent history of collaboration with a primary focus on alcohol research. The research laboratories are well equipped with the latest instrumentation for neurochemical and behavioral testing."
"9308008","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the proposed research is to identify somatic genetic mutations that occur in brain regions of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SZ), and bipolar disorder (BD). Ultimately the discovery and characterization of somatic mutations may help us to understand the etiology of these disorders and eventually lead to improved therapeutic strategies and diagnostic markers. ASD, SZ, and BD are all commonly occurring neuropsychiatric disorders that have a large genetic basis (with estimated heritability of ~75% to 80% for each condition). However, relatively few DNA variants have been identified that have causal roles in the etiology. We hypothesize that somatic mosaicism--the occurrence of mutations in selected body regions after conception--occurs in brain and contributes to the etiology of ASD, SZ, and BD. Specific Aim 1 is to identify the nature and extent of somatic mosaic mutations across brain and body regions in postmortem samples from apparently normal individuals. We will assess four categories of somatic variation: (1) single nucleotide variants (SNVs), (2) structural variants (SVs) including copy number variants, (3) L1 retrotransposition events, and (4) mitochondrial heteroplasmy. These types of variation will be detected using whole genome sequencing (Years 1 and 2), single molecule imaging with DNA nanochannels (Year 2), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Samples include brain regions (e.g. prefrontal cortex and cerebellum) and organs (e.g. heart and kidney). After identifying somatic variants we will perform rigorous validation. Specific Aim 2 is to identify the nature and extent of somatic mosaicism in genomic DNA from individuals with ASD, SZ, and BD. The same approaches for discovery and validation will be applied as in Aim 1. Specific Aim 3 is to functionally categorize somatic variants, particularly those that are predicted to disrupt the functions of genes previously implicated in those disorders. One approach is single-cell RNA-seq (to determine the consequence of the mutation on transcription, and to infer the cell type of origin of the somatic variant). Another approach uses neurons (or glia) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and stably expressing the wildtype or mutant forms of the somatic variants. These studies will help to establish the role of somatic mutation in neuropsychiatric disorders, including the functional consequences of such variation."
"9279214","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This 4-year award supports career development and mentored research experience for Katherine Yun, MD MHS, a clinician-scientist focusing on health disparities and access to care for children in refugee and immigrant families, including children with special healthcare needs (SHCN). Through the K23 award, Dr. Yun will gain advanced training in qualitative research and research ethics, and she will expand her skills to include health measurement and the development of community-based interventions. This training will serve as the basis for future, large-scale interventions to promote the health of children in refugee and immigrant families. Dr. Yun proposes a comprehensive research program with the Bhutanese refugee community in Philadelphia that will allow for future comparative work across immigrant populations. The proposed research will empirically define, measure, and develop an intervention to promote healthcare navigation, meaning the skills and strategies used by parents to realize access to pediatric healthcare. Aim 1 uses the New Immigrant Survey and National Survey of Children's Health to identify parental characteristics associated with realized access to care in order to develop a purposive sampling plan for Aim 2. Aim 2 uses multiple qualitative methods to build a conceptual framework for healthcare navigation, using parents in the Bhutanese refugee community as key informants. Aim 3 uses the conceptual framework to build and evaluate an instrument to measure healthcare navigation competency and to identify areas for support to improve individuals' ability to use health services. Aim 4 uses mixed methods to adapt, pilot, and evaluate a single-arm community health worker intervention to promote mastery of these skills. The conceptual framework created in Aim 2 will be used to adapt the intervention protocol, and data on feasibility, acceptability, and effect sizes will be used to refine the intervention and power a future controlled trial. This work has the potential to impact the 30,000 children who enter the US as refugees each year; it also has significance for the 1.2 million publicly-insured, US children in immigrant families who have SHCN and continue to report difficulties obtaining necessary care. Dr. Yun is a junior investigator and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics with training in health services research, extensive experience with healthcare for refugee and immigrant children in the US, and existing partnerships with Philadelphia's Bhutanese community. She has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors and advisors led by David Rubin, MD MSCE (primary mentor), Frances Barg, PhD MEd (co-mentor), [and Leela Kuikel, MA (community co-mentor)]. Her career development program will include coursework; [a 1-year, NIH- supported mixed methods research training program;] directed reading; and mentored practical experience in methodologies from the disciplines of medical anthropology, biostatistics, psychometrics, and public health. The Division of General Pediatrics, the Department of Pediatrics, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia are committed to her success and the advancement of her career."
"9297351","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the vertebrate nervous system, myelinating glia performs the spectacular feat of iteratively wrapping their membrane around axons to form the myelin sheath. Myelin allows for rapid nerve impulse propagation, and the glial cells that make myelin are also essential for neuronal health and survival. The importance of myelin is underscored in diseases in which it is disrupted, including multiple sclerosis, leukodystrophies, and numerous peripheral neuropathies. To date, no therapeutic strategies exist to halt demyelination or stimulate remyelination in disease or injury. As a vertebrate model organism that is amenable to both chemical and genetic screens, zebrafish represent the ideal system with which to dissect the molecular mechanisms that govern myelination.  In a previous forward genetic screen, we discovered that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr126 is essential for myelination in the peripheral nervous system, although the mechanisms by which Gpr126 functions are not completely understood. As a GPCR, Gpr126 represents an excellent potential therapeutic target to stimulate remyelination. To this end, we will define Gpr126-mediated pathways in glial development and myelination using both chemical and genetic screens in a hypomorphic gpr126 mutant, which generates reduced levels of myelin in the peripheral nervous system. (1) We will perform large-scale compound library screens to discover small molecules that can enhance or suppress the hypomorphic gpr126 mutant phenotype. (2) We will perform a forward genetic enhancer/suppressor screen of 2,000 genomes to define genetic modifiers of gpr126. Together, these experiments will define the mechanisms by which Gpr126 mediates myelination. Critically, these screens can also uncover new chemicals and genes that regulate glial cell development and myelination independently of Gpr126. These screens will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that govern nervous system development and may point the way to novel therapeutics to promote nervous system repair in humans."

"9309089","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Human brain complexity is considered unique, yet the genesis of many neuronal and glial sub-types and their migration and integration into functional circuits in neonates remains poorly understood. Moreover, these processes are likely disrupted in hypoxic neurological injuries, which can result in death, cerebral palsy and/or long-term cognitive disabilities. The proposed program focuses on human interneuron (IN) and oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) development during 3rd trimester (24-40 weeks) gestation, and whether lineage ontogeny, migration and differentiation is regulated by oxygen levels and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. This program is an outgrowth of the investigators common interests, productive collaborations and the close association of their laboratories in the recently built Ray and Dagmar Dolby Building in the Eli and Edythe Broad Institute for Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF. The investigators have studied the human fetal and newborn brain and recently identified (1) the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), (2) chain migration of young neurons of medial migratory stream (MMS) and (3) the impact of injury on oligodendrocyte development in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). We propose three projects and cores to promote an understanding of human brain development and injury. Project 1 investigates migration of young INs to focal regions of human newborn brain, their differentiation and the developmental impact of oxygen- regulated pathways. Project 2 will define structure and OPC production of the human OSVZ from 24-40 weeks gestation, and regulation of lineage ontogeny by oxygen levels. Project 3 will provide direct evidence for HIF pathway activation in IN and OPC populations in human neonates with HIE, and cell-intrinsic functions of HIF pathway genes during pre- and post-natal IN and OPC development. The administrative core (A) provides budgetary oversight, coordination and access to resources. All projects will use primary human neuropathological specimens for histological analysis supported by a neuropathology core (B). All projects will employ animal experimental systems. Based on compelling preliminary data, we propose an animal model core (C) to support studies in neonatal ferret brain."
"9506021","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Academic Nephrology Training Program at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) is to prepare trainees for successful academic careers through expert and comprehensive mentoring in laboratory-based, clinical, or translational research in kidney disease. The rationale for the program is the pressin need for well-trained faculty in adult and pediatric nephrology. Its major mission is to develop independent investigators in the pathophysiology, genetics, epidemiology and treatment of kidney diseases. The program described in this application has the faculty expertise, infrastructure, and research opportunities to provide outstanding training. The major emphasis of this application is the training of MD and MD/PhD postdoctoral fellows who anticipate research careers in academic medicine. Most of the proposed mentors are from the Divisions of Nephrology and Pediatric Nephrology at UCSF, but training faculty from other UCSF departments provide greater scope and depth of training opportunities. The training faculty has been selected to accommodate the increasingly complex and technologic nature of basic research training and to provide intensive mentoring in clinical (patient-oriented and health services) research methods. The training program emphasizes thematic and interdisciplinary research pertinent to kidney disease.

The Program takes pride in its commitment to diversity and academic excellence and actively recruits women and minority trainees."
"9307898","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The completion of the Trial to Reduce Insulin Dependent Diabetes in the Genetically at Risk ('TRIGR') will determine whether weaning to a formula in which (foreign) proteins have been extensively hydrolyzed, reduces disease risk for type 1 diabetes (T1D) in genetically susceptible children, as it does in rodent models. The Specific Aims are: I-a: To determine whether weaning to casein hydrolysate reduces the frequency of clinical diabetes; and I-b: To assess a potential shift in the age-adjusted incidence (not the cumulative incidence) of autoantibodies and T1D to a later time period in the group treated with the hydrolyzed study formula. This longest and largest, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in subjects with an affected first-degree relative and risk-associated HLA genotypes is currently in its 14th year. An international, multicenter consortium has been developed comprising 77 centers in 15 countries. Enrollment of 2159 eligible infants was completed successfully, providing a cushion above the required 2032 infants. The 6-8 month intervention designed to compare the effects of either hydrolyzed casein or standard cow milk based weaning formula was completed in 2007. Duration of breast-feeding was at the mothers' discretion and similar to or above background populations. All subjects are followed during and after the intervention period for at least 10 years with measurements of immune markers of intact cow milk exposure, diabetes predictive autoantibodies and the clinical and/or metabolic indices of diabetes (the end point at age 10-14 years). Currently all planning parameters have been met and drop- out rate is 2% with compliance at expected level. A large, cross-linked repository of stored sera, DNA, T-cell data, and cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells allows independently funded ancillary and mechanistic studies related to the natural history of prediabetes and the hypothesis to be tested. This application covers years 16- 18 for the International Coordinating Center and the Core Autoantibody Laboratory at the University of Helsinki and for the study centers in Europe and Australia which is submitted in tandem with those of the US coordinating center and clinical centers and that of the Data Management Unit. Funding is requested for completing the trial and reporting the outcome."
"9280637","DESCRIPTION:         The proposed research and training for this five-year Career Development Award (CDA-2) of Dr. Matthew Major, PhD, will contribute to the realization of the VA mission and vision by conducting studies that aim to reduce falls and improve the quality of life of older veterans with transtibial amputation (TTA)] while enhancing Dr. Major's skills to direct a dynamic research program of rehabilitation science as an independent investigator in the VA system. Previous studies have demonstrated that older persons with lower limb amputation are at a substantially increased risk of falling as compared to able-bodied age-matched controls and have reduced confidence in their balance, both contributing to their restricted mobility and daily activity. As upright balance is vital to safe mobility, an important consequence of elevated fall incidence is an increased risk of fall-related injuries that may lead to lost independence and early mortality. Due to the dearth of comprehensive controlled studies on this topic, the relationships between variables of postural control and fall risk in this population remain poorly understand and this has significantly hampered progress towards addressing this important concern for veterans with [TTA]. Therefore, the proposed research activities will involve a series of controlled experiments to develop much-needed insight into the sensory-motor mechanisms of upright balance and fall risk in older veterans with [TTA]. The two specific aims are: 1) identify discriminating biomechanical and clinical factors related to upright balance between older adults with [TTA] classified as [frequent fallers and controls], and 2) evaluate the motor control strategies employed by older adults with [TTA] when subjected to an unexpected perturbation during standing and walking. These research activities will be performed in the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center Motion Analysis Research Laboratory under the guidance of Dr. Steven Gard, an experienced VA Research Health Scientist of rehabilitation and prosthetics research. Information from this study will lead to the identification of sensory-motor variables related to fll risk that may be modified through targeted interventions and development of a clinically-relevant predictive model of falls. Dr. Major's career objective is to become a highly skilled independent investigator within the VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Service. Resulting from previous research and training, he has developed a solid foundation of skills related to investigating the biomechanics of human movement with specific focus on gait of lower limb prosthesis users. Dr. Major is proposing diverse training activities that will compliment his education in biomechanics by refining skills in amputee clinical care and motor control theory. His goal is to develop a productive VA research career aimed at improving functional balance and mobility of veterans with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal insult. His training plan includes formal education in prosthetics clinical education, clinical and translational sciences, project management, team leadership, and grant writing skills to develop his abilities as an independent VA scientist and effective leader. Dr. Major has assembled a well-qualified team of mentors who will provide expert guidance on various aspects of the proposed project in the form of directed readings and, most critically, exposure to the VA healthcare system such that he may develop a research program that is sensitive to the VHA patient care mission. The results of this research will facilitate pursuit of future research initiatives to explore design of theraputic interventions for improving postural control that may be integrated into the VA system of care, development of clinical diagnostic tools to accurately assess fall risk in older veterans with [TTA], inform VA prescription guidelines of current prostheses, and design future prosthetic devices that enhance functional balance. Importantly, these results will provide the basis for the submission of two VA Merit Awards that will be instrumental in transitioning Dr. Major to the role of an independent investigator working to fulfill the VHA patient care mission and vision."
"9335825","The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act 2009 gave FDA authority to limit cigarette nicotine levels. Arguments have been made for mandating a reduction in cigarettes in order to reduce levels of nicotine dependence and therefore increase smoking cessation rates and decrease the overwhelming morbidity and mortality associated with smoking (Benowitz and Henningfield, 1994). Studies have suggested reduced nicotine cigarettes result in decreased nicotine intake (Benowitz et al. 2007; Donny et al., 2015) and decreased nicotine dependence (Donny et al., 2015). However, critical questions remain regarding the abuse-liability of reduced nicotine cigarettes, whether exposure to reduced nicotine cigarettes reduces use in both reduced- and full-nicotine cigarettes, whether reduced-nicotine cigarettes will substitute for full-nicotine cigarettes, and the dose-effects of these potential effects. The addictive effects and abuse liability of reduced nicotine cigarettes, therefore, are not well understood. This double-blind study will systematically determine the abuse liability of reduced-nicotine cigarettes compared to standard full-nicotine cigarettes using a behavioral economics abuse- liability approach. The proposed study in 100 (50 men/women) non-treatment seeking dependent smokers will determine the abuse liability of reduced-nicotine cigarettes compared to full-nicotine cigarettes using a behavioral economics abuse-liability approach. Laboratory determination of cigarette consumption under various response requirements will occur before and after 6 weeks of at-home exposure, with participants randomized to full (15.8 mg nicotine/g tobacco) or varying levels of reduced nicotine cigarettes (5.2, 2.4, and 1.3 mg/g) to determine the role of experience on the abuse-liability of reduced nicotine cigarettes. Abuse liability will be assessed by 2 essential demand metrics: lower demand intensity and increased demand elasticity, as well as other demand metrics and subjective ratings of ?liking?. The study will also determine the degree to which reduced-nicotine cigarettes may substitute for full-nicotine cigarettes ? testing whether a reduced-nicotine policy would achieve the goal of reducing full-nicotine cigarette consumption. By examining nicotine dose-effects, the study will also determine a nicotine ?addictiveness threshold? below which abuse- liability and nicotine dependence decreases. We hypothesize that abuse liability of reduced- and full-nicotine cigarettes will be decreased after 6-weeks exposure to reduced-nicotine, but not full-nicotine cigarettes. We hypothesize that reduced-nicotine cigarettes will substitute for full-nicotine cigarettes both before and after the exposure period, but there will be an increase in the degree of substitutability. Regarding dose effects, we hypothesize that reduced abuse liability will be observed with exposure to 2.4 and 1.3 mg/g relative to 5.2 and 15.8 mg/g cigarettes. We hypothesize that results with demand curve metrics (decreases in intensity of demand and increases in elasticity) will show significant but modest correlations to decreased ratings of ?liking.? This study stands to substantially inform tobacco public policy with advanced empirical abuse-liability testing."
"9320654","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) contains a multitude of growth factors in physiological proportions, which is an appealing benefit compared to using isolated growth factors. However, the specific targeting of therapeutic agents to sites of tissue damage in vivo is a major challenge that limits the success in delivering growth factors, PRP, or even stem cell therapy. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) can have a beneficial effect on injured and diseased skeletal muscle, but a concern with standard delivery is getting them to, and keeping them at, the targeted tissue. This proposal will use fluorescent iron oxide-based superparamagnetic nanoparticles (NPs), which can be visualized by both MRI (in vivo) and fluorescence microscopy (after harvesting). The overall goal of this proposal is to target platelet and hMSCs to a site of musculoskeletal injury in vivo by exploiting the magnetic properties of NPs. Cells can be labeled with a variety MRI contrast agents and detected in vivo following local or systemic injection. Recent work shows that: a) cells readily take up NPs and can be mobilized in vitro by the application of magnetic force, and b) platelets readily take up the NPs, without complex cellular labeling strategies that rely on the overexpression of specific receptors or the conjugation to specific ligands. We will build on these two findings to develop an in vivo therapeutic intervention. We propose that the location of PRP/hMSCs can be controlled by use of a surface magnet; thus allowing movement of platelets/cells to a desired site, clustering to enrich the area with growth factors, and preventing the premature loss at the site of injury. Musculoskeletal injuries are one of the most common complaints treated by physicians; they account for the majority of all sports-related injuries as well as a significant proportion of low back pain. We will use a cellular -- organ system -- clinical approach in studying this novel application to promote regeneration at sites of tissue damage. The focus of this proposal is on platelets/hMSCs, however this technology has exciting applications in a variety of cells and for a range of pathologies."
"9312742","The recent Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in Western Africa, which introduced the virus to non-African nations  including the United States, highlights the imminent threat to global health posed by filoviruses and the urgent  need for basic and translational efforts. A critical step in the viral lifecycle of filoviruses is the replication of the  non-segmented, negative strand RNA genome by the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) complex.  The EBOV RDRP complex is composed of the large protein (L), nucleoprotein (NP), viral protein 35 (VP35) and  viral protein 30 (VP30) and is essential for transcription of viral mRNA and replication of antigenomic and  genomic RNA. During RNA synthesis, components of the RDRP complex undergo multiple structural  rearrangements to make the NP-associated RNA template accessible to the L polymerase while protecting the  NP-RNA template from cellular nucleases. Despite the importance of the EBOV RDRP complex to pathogenesis  and the potential as therapeutic targets, insights into RDRP complex assembly and its regulatory interactions  with host or viral proteins are lacking. We will address these longstanding mechanistic questions in this PPG.  Project 2 will use biochemical and hybrid structural methods that will combine results from NMR, X-ray  crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) in order to define  the molecular mechanism of the EBOV RDRP complex assembly and function, and to define its regulatory  mechanisms and structural dynamics. Our strong preliminary results support a working model where  conformational remodeling of the RDRP complex is controlled by cis- and trans-acting factors. We have  assembled a highly productive and collaborative team of investigators with complementary expertise to perform  the following Aims: 1. Define the molecular mechanism by which EBOV VP35 facilitates delivery of NP in the  RNA-free form. 2. Elucidate the internal dynamics of the NP protein and define the role of different NP  conformations in viral RNA synthesis. 3. Determine the molecular architecture of the EBOV RDRP complex by  hybrid structural methods. 4. Determine the structural basis for cis-acting RNA elements identified in Project 1  and novel host factors from Project 3/Core B that regulate EBOV RDRP complex. Completion of these studies  will address longstanding and critical mechanistic questions in EBOV biology that are also central to a better  understanding of non-segmented negative sense RNA viruses (NNSVs). These insights are also expected to  yield new opportunities for antiviral development."
"9383507","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Studies are proposed to better understand the pathogenesis of drug-induced immune conditions that affect blood platelets and to improve their diagnosis and management. Aim 1 concerns drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) of the ?quinine-type? (Qn-DITP), so-called because quinine is the prototypic trigger for this condition, which can be induced by at least 100 different medications. A curious aspect of Qn-DITP is that the responsible antibodies (abs) are harmless unless drug is present, in which case they bind to a platelet glycoprotein (GP) and cause platelet destruction. We produced monoclonal abs (mAbs) that mimic the behavior of abs from patients with Qn-DITP and have used them to show that Qn promotes binding of these mAbs to their targets by reconfiguring ab binding domains so they recognize an autologous GP. The findings suggest a previously un-described mechanism for drug-induced immune injury in DITP that could be applicable to other types of idiosyncratic drug reactions (IDRs), an important cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations. Aim 1 describes studies to generalize the new findings by producing platelet-reactive mAbs specific for drugs other than Qn utilizing protocols designed to improve the efficiency of ab induction and to develop a mouse model that mimics the human disease, DITP. A successful outcome could define a new paradigm for induction of certain types of IDRs and have important implications for new drug development. The widely used drugs clopidogrel, ceftriaxone and piperacillin are being implicated as triggers for DITP with increasing frequency, but serologic testing for abs is often negative in such patients. A likely reason for this is that a drug metabolite, rather than unmodified drug is the sensitizing agent. A second goal of Aim 1 is to define the extent to which metabolites of these three drugs trigger DITP and to identify the responsible metabolites. Other drugs will be similarly studied if time and resources permit. Findings will define the extent to which drug metabolites cause DITP and other IDRs and will yield improved diagnostic tools for identifying patients with thrombocytopenia caused by sensitivity to a drug metabolite. Aim 2 concerns heparin-induced immune TP (HIT), a major case of morbidity and mortality in patients treated with heparin. Our recent findings suggest that a key aspect of HIT pathogenesis is antibody recognition of platelet factor 4 (PF4) in a complex with platelet membrane glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), leading to platelet activation, thrombocytopenia and predisposition to thrombosis. In Aim 2, PF4-dependent priming of platelets for recognition by pathogenic abs will be characterized at the molecular level and findings made will be applied to development and validation of improved methods for identifying heparin-treated patients who are at high risk for thrombosis that can be performed ?on-demand? in patients suspected of having HIT."
"9305733","Project Summary/Abstract Vocabulary learning is a pervasive and persistent problem for individuals with language impairment (LI). This challenge has meaningful consequences as vocabulary knowledge is related to academic success, occupational status, and social functioning. To provide effective vocabulary interventions, it is vital that we understand how the cognitive mechanisms underlying LI contribute to vocabulary learning. There is robust evidence that impaired short-term and working memory are primary barriers to word learning for individuals with LI. However, we lack an understanding of potential retention deficits, as the ability to retain taught material is rarely measured weeks, months, or years post-training. Relatedly, training strategies have differential effects on short-term and long-term retention for children with typical development (TD). However, we know little about how these strategies affect children with LI as long-term retention is rarely assessed. Given the time that clinicians, parents, and children invest in interventions and their potential lifelong benefits, it is essential that we determine the most effective and efficient training strategies to foster long-term retention of children with LI. To address these gaps in the knowledge base, the broad objective of this research program is to improve the retention, generalization, and integration of words for children with LI. The current project focuses on understanding and improving retention through the following specific aims. 1-To compare learning and forgetting rates of words by children with and without LI, and 2-To identify the aspects of training that enhance long-term retention of words by children with LI. The research strategy involves two experiments in which children with and without LI are taught novel word-object pairs and then tested across various retention intervals (e.g., two weeks, one month). Two aspects of training show robust effects on long-term retention in typical populations will be assessed in children with LI, timing of exposures and type of engagement with materials. The effect of these factors on the retention of words by children with LI will be assessed. This research will advance our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying language impairments by identifying whether children with LI have deficits in short-term memory alone or have deficits in both short- term and long-term memory. The current work will also demonstrate how type and timing of training affects long-term retention in children with LI, which will lead to improved treatment of language impairment. Thus, the achievement of the specific aims will advance both research and clinical practice for children with LI."
"9323225","ABSTRACT  The Multiplexed Protein Quantification Core uses LC-tandem MS with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to measure protein abundance. SRM is unique among the various quantitative mass spectrometry methods because, like Western blots, proteins are carefully selected and targeted for quantification. Targeting is achieved by designing the SRM method to measure the abundance of several peptides, which are unique to the protein when digested with trypsin. These peptides are then detected in complex samples, such as whole tissue homogenates, based on their sequence-specific fragmentation reactions driven by collision- induced dissociation (CID). The peptides are identified as chromatographic peaks at characteristic retention times and the abundance calculated based on the integrated area of those peaks. Two key features of SRM make this a powerful new tool for Geroscience research. First, SRM is a high throughput method where one can measure ~30 proteins in a single assay. The Core has developed panels of protein assays that allow investigators to interrogate entire pathways such as antioxidant proteins, beta oxidation, Krebs cycle, glycolysis, TCA-cycle, and others with new assay panels continuously being developed. Second, a new assay can be designed and validated for any protein from any animal in a few hours. The Core has developed a methodical design process that evaluates the protein sequence using a fundamental understanding of peptide chromatography and gas phase ion chemistry, along with information in public databases, to rapidly select, test, and validate the best peptides for each protein. This rapid and effective assay design/validation process is especially important for aging research using animal models where the availability of antibodies is severely limited. Although SRM has many advantages over immunochemical-based assays like Western blot and ELISA, SRM does require a major piece of equipment (an advanced, high sensitivity LC- tandem mass spectrometry system), expertise to operate that instrument, and expertise for the development and validation of the peptides used to measure each protein. The systems do have the capacity to run as many as 6000 to 8000 samples per year, which makes a core laboratory an excellent way to maximize the benefit of these powerful tools.  The Specific Aims for the Targeted Protein Quantitation Core are:  Aim 1. Provide high throughput multiplexed protein quantification of panels of proteins in  multiple pathways for tissues/cells from mice and rats.  Aim 2. Develop new assays and panels for invertebrates and other animal models, e.g., long-lived species, and for proteins requested by individual investigators.  Aim 3. Develop the technology to measure the post-translational modifications of proteins."

"9353424","Project summary/abstract Dr. Al-bataineh?s career goals for the award period are to develop a research project and professional expertise that will enable him to develop scientific independence from his mentor and to establish his own career path to independent translational research in acute kidney injury. Dr. Al-bataineh will further his laboratory research and training by developing his proficiency in (i) validated animal models of renal injury including the two-kidney hanging-weight mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and mouse model of AKI-CKD progression, (ii) advanced approaches of kidney microscopy including multiphoton microscopy, three-dimensional imaging, and quantitative microscopic analyses, and (iii) technical expertise in molecular biology techniques such as ChIPseq and promoter-luciferase reporter assays. Dr. Al-bataineh plans to make the transition to an independent, tenure track position within 2-3 years of his mentored research training during this award. His long-term career goal is to become a fully independent academic investigator in the broad fields of renal physiology and kidney disease, performing research that provides insight into fundamental physiological problems that impact clinical issues, with a particular focus on AKI pathology, prevention, and treatment. ?-catenin signaling is a complex cellular response that is activated in renal tubules during kidney injury. While moderate ischemia results in transient induction of ?-catenin levels that associated with kidney protection, severe ischemia leads to sustained activation of the ?-catenin pathway and development of kidney fibrosis, implicating severity of injury as a key determinant of long term outcome. Emerging evidence supports a role for the transmembrane glycoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1 in humans, Muc1 in animals) in regulating ?-catenin activity. In tumor cells, (i) MUC1 directly binds to ?-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus, (ii) MUC1 blocks glycogen synthase kinase 3 ??(GSK3?)-mediated degradation of ?-catenin, and (iii) MUC1 overexpression correlates with increased levels of nuclear ?-catenin and its transcriptional activity. We previously reported that Muc1, found on the apical surface of normal kidney epithelia, plays a protective role in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) by comparing kidney function and morphology in Muc1 KO mice and congenic control mice (AJP-Renal 2015; PMID: 25925251). Our recent studies showed that Muc1 induction and targeting to the nucleus after moderate ischemia was associated with increased ?-catenin levels and signaling (AJP-Renal 2016; PMID: 26739894). We also observed that sustained upregulation of Muc1 was also associated with prolonged induction of ?-catenin in mouse kidney homogenates at 7 d after severe ischemia. Based on these findings and on previous reports related to the acute and chronic effects of ?-catenin after kidney injury, we hypothesize that Muc1 protects against the early stages of AKI via transactivation of ?- catenin pathway, but persistent Muc1/?-catenin signaling after severe AKI leads to CKD progression and renal fibrosis. Our proposed studies will utilize both a mouse model of moderate and severe IRI, and a cultured human kidney cell line (HEK-293) after ATP depletion as an established model of ischemic cell injury. Moreover, we have already obtained mice with varying levels of Muc1 expression (Muc1 knockout, heterozygotes, and a transgenic overexpressing human MUC1) that will be used to assess if increased levels of Muc1 in the kidney in the short term enhance protection during IRI, while prolonged expression of Muc1 promotes kidney fibrosis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide important insight into the signaling pathways that are altered during IRI and repair, and will provide valuable information to help us design novel therapeutic strategies to treat AKI and prevent CKD progression."
"9315694","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The mission of the DARE Collaboratory is to harness the power of the adaptive immune system to reduce the size of the reservoir during antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to control any residual virus after ART is interrupted. Our overall hypothesis is that that durable remission of HIV infection will require a robust immune response that is persistent and functional. Moreover, these responses need to be in the right place at the right time. We propose four highly linked research foci aimed at reaching these goals. We will define the role of putative immune-privileged sanctuaries that enable SIV/HIV to persist during ART and use the monkey model to develop therapies to breach these sanctuaries (Initial Research Foci 1, IRF1). We will characterize the distribution on replication-competent virus in lymphoid tissues of ART-suppressed adults and develop PET imaging modalities to quantify this reservoir (IRF2). We will define the role of immune checkpoints (PD-1, others) and their blockade on T cell function in monkeys and people (IRF3). Finally, we will define the safety, immunogenicity, and anti-HIV effectiveness of a human CMV (HCMV) vectored HIV vaccine in HIV-infected adults on ART (IRF4). All four initial research foci are linked by their shared goal to understand how best to quantify, reduce, and control HIV in the human lymphoid system. We anticipate meeting the following milestones and deliverables: (1) definition of the replication-competent reservoir in lymphoid tissues from SIV- infected monkeys and HIV-infected humans on suppressive ART, (2) determination of whether B follicles serve as a immunologic sanctuary for infected CD4+ TFH and, if so, whether B follicular depletion reduces the size of the reservoir, (3) determination of the characteristics of virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses that have optimal activity for reservoir reduction and/or post-ART viral control, (4) determination if the tissue reservoir can be measured by radiolabeled tracers and PET scanning, (5) identification of the optimal combination of immune checkpoint blockers that enhance T-cell function and/or reverse HIV latency, (6) definition of the safety and immunogenicity of immune checkpoint blockers in treated SIV and HIV disease, (7) determination of the safety and immunogenicity of the HCMV/HIV vaccine in treated HIV disease, and (8) determination if B cell disruption and/or immune checkpoint blockade might be necessary for this vaccine (or other comparable interventions) to achieve reservoir reduction and/or durable remission. Our work will set the stage for a future proof-of-concept clinical trial of the HCMV/HIV vector in antiretroviral-treated individuals, either alone or in combination with B cell follicle disruption and/or immune checkpoint blockade."
"9341342","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Whether or not to surgically correct ambiguous genitalia to be more female- or male-typical with genitoplasty is an area of pediatric medicine that is highly controversial. Suboptimal outcomes such as poor post-surgical cosmesis and sexual dysfunction following outdated surgical procedures have driven intense controversy in the medical community over how, or if, genitoplasty should be used in the treatment of young children with ambiguous genitalia. To resolve this debate, a prospective study of outcomes of current genitoplasty procedures, including complication rates associated with these procedures, is needed of individuals who receive masculinizing or feminizing surgery during early childhood. Additionally, studies of parents who decide to proceed, or not, with genitoplasty for their young child are necessary to understand how these controversial decisions impact parents' reactions to surgical outcomes for their child. The overall goal of this proposal is to assess the outcomes of modern genitoplasty techniques with a consideration of the psychological outcome of parents who make the decisions to proceed with genital surgery for their child. This information is crucial for physicians to provide guidance to parents regarding the optimal approach for the management of ambiguous genitalia in young children, including the possibility that no surgery is best. The interdisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers included in the proposed studies spans the fields of psychology, statistics, pediatric endocrinology, and pediatric urology. The collective experience of our group optimizes our ability to translate findings from the proposed studies to a clinical setting in a timely manner."
"9307826","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        This is a renewal of the training grant Training in Molecular Toxicology at UCLA that was first funded in 2008. The training grant has catalyzed the expansion and consolidation of molecular toxicological research and training at UCLA and has stimulated interactions and collaborations among the participating faculty and the pre- and postdoctoral trainees. During the current funding period, the number of training grant faculty members increased from nine to fourteen. The faculty has primary appointments in nine different departments at UCLA.  Four of the new appointees are Assistant Professors, and represent potential future leaders of the program. Seven of the faculty members have M.D. degrees. These faculty provides a potential avenue for the recruitment of physician-scientists to postdoctoral (and perhaps also pre-doctoral) positions in the training grant. The training grant requests support for five years and for four pre-doctoral students in the Molecular Toxicology Interdepartment Doctoral Program (IDP) at UCLA, and two postdoctoral trainees in the laboratories of the training grant faculty.  Pre-doctoral trainees wil usually be appointed for three years, and postdoctoral trainees will be appointed for up to two years.  In general, only pre-doctoral trainees who have completed their first year (during which most do rotations) will be awarded positions on the training grant. This number of trainee positions requested is justified by the increase in the number of our faculty, their substantial NIEHS and non-NIEHS funding, the investigators' previous success in recruiting excellent pre-doctoral and postdoctoral trainees, and the excellent publication record of the trainees. The faculty has a common interest in the mechanisms whereby environmental toxins cause disease. There are four major foci of research interest: i) The role of pesticides in the etiology of Parkinson's disease, ii) genetic damage (including carcinogenesis) caused by environmental agents, (iii) the toxic effects of secondhand cigarette smoke and of fossil fuels and their combustion products, and iv) nanotoxicology. Other areas of research pursued by individual faculty include metal toxicity and the analysis of transcription networks in toxicity. The UCLA Vice Chancellor for Research very recently announced a Grand Challenge initiative. One of the six Challenges focuses on preventing diseases associated with energy, pesticides and environmental technologies. The training grant faculty and trainees are poised to make major contributions to this endeavor. The UCLA Academic Senate undertook an eight year review of the Molecular Toxicology IDP in 2010, and an External Advisory Committee reviewed the training grant in 2011. The Committees were clearly impressed with the IDP and the attainments of the training grant. UCLA has committed considerable resources to the Molecular Toxicology Program, and institutional support is very strong. Over the next five years the NIEHS training grant will further enhance and stimulate molecular toxicological research and training at UCLA, should encourage more students and postdoctoral fellows to pursue research in toxicology, and will signal the increasing importance of toxicology as a discipline at UCLA."
"9410134","PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT).  The HIV Care Continuum is a compelling epidemiologic framework describing the movement of people living with HIV/AIDS through care, including diagnosis, linkage and retention in care, use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and ultimately, viral suppression. Health policies may profoundly influence outcomes along the Care Continuum, and these effects may be modified across regions and through individual contexts.  In observational cohorts, retention in clinical care, ART use, and viral suppression proportions have varied depending on available data and the population under study. The US National HIV/AIDS Strategy (updated to 2020) and the revised 2013 World Health Organization ART guidelines also reference milestones in the Care Continuum. Because the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other national health policies in North and Latin American countries aim to improve healthcare access and reduce health disparities, describing the effect of policy and contextual factors on Care Continuum outcomes in these settings is of great interest to epidemiologists, clinicians, and policy makers.  This research seeks to quantify health policy, sociodemographic, contextual, and geographic patterns and correlates of HIV Care Continuum outcomes among HIV-infected persons in the United States (US), Canada, and Mexico. Contextual factors include psychiatric illness, regional poverty, residential urbanicity, and other individual and environmental characteristics. The North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA- ACCORD) and Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) provide rich data sources in which to conduct this work.  Aim 1 will quantify disparities in Care Continuum outcomes in North and Latin America, assessing health system, demographic, risk, contextual, and geographic differences. Because research into the influence of contextual factors and health system characteristics on Care Continuum outcomes in longitudinal cohorts with clinical care data have been sparse or geographically limited, this analysis will be novel and of significant importance.  Aims 2 and 3 will provide inferences about the ACA's effects on improving healthcare among HIV-infected individuals in care in the US. The state-led expansion of Medicaid coverage under the ACA will be used as a quasi-experiment to assess effects on Care Continuum and other HIV disease outcomes, comparing pre-ACA (pre-2014) to ACA implementation periods."
"9353417","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is virtually a lethal disease for which no gold-standard detection method exists and virtually no significant treatment improvements have occurred within the last 30 years. Because PDA is associated with metastases at presentation, hypovascularity, desmoplasia, acidosis, overcoming the physical and microenvironmental barriers to deliver efficacious drugs to pancreatic tumor cells remains elusive. In this endeavor, we have developed an ultra-acidic pH-responsive theranostic (UPRT) nanoparticle, whose distribution within mice bearing orthotopic pancreatic tumors can also be quantitatively imaged by Optoacoustic Tomography, enabling whole body, real-time mapping of biodistribution and accumulation. Three innovative aspects in this proposal are: 1) development and characterization of UPRT polymeric drug carriers with a tunable and sharp pH response pH < 0.3 containing both a contrast agent and drug; 2) use of newly-emerging imaging technology, Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography, for sensitive and specific detection of UPRT nanoparticles with quantitative assessment and innovative image analysis; 3) identification of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics properties of the nanoparticle along with validation of Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography imaging assays of UPRT nanoparticle delivery using standard methods, i.e. histology and LC-MS. Our overarching hypothesis is that UPRT-nanoparticles will target the acidic pH resulting from excessive lactic acid production associated with hypovascularity in pancreas tumors to deliver drugs to tumor cells and serve as a diagnostic contrast agent in vivo. Because Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) has high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, increased depth of penetration, potential for whole-body imaging, and potential for longitudinal imaging, MSOT will be utilized to determine biodistribution and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of the proposed polymer-based, theranostic nanoparticles. To test this hypothesis, we will evaluate the following aims: 1) Characterize the biophysical properties, drug/contrast agent loading and release, and in vitro efficacy of UPRT nanoparticle; 2) Optimize design and kinetics of UPRT nanoparticle that delivers NIR dye/drugs to hypovascular tumor areas; 3) Determine spatiotemporal distribution, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity profiles of UPRT nanoparticle using Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography in orthotopic models of pancreatic adenocarcinoma which spontaneously metastasize. Detection and treatment of pancreatic cancer with this delivery system will likely constitute an effective approach to improve detection and drug delivery for these currently untreatable patients."
"9294114","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to maintain continued support for four highly qualified predoctoral candidates committed to innovative research careers in the area of nutrition and cardiometabolic disorders. Opportunities for training are available in basic science, clinical interventions, and gene-environment cohort studies, with emphasis on the translational nature of the work. Cardiovascular diseases alone account for over 1/3 of all deaths in the U.S., with minority populations carrying a disproportionally high burden. Scientists who are trained across disciplines, particularly in those that have a translational component at the intersection of nutrition, functional genomics and cardiometabolic disorders are uniquely qualified to make innovative contributions to this enormous healthcare challenge. For our Training Program, eligible candidates must have been admit- ted to the doctoral program at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University and completed one or two years of coursework, depending on prior training. Candidates must also have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement, identified a dissertation topic in the area of nutrition and cardiometabolic disorders, established their aptitude to conduct research, obtained commitment from a Training Program mentor to serve as their Thesis Advisor, and have stated their career goal to become an independent researcher. Training Program mentors, from multiple divisions across the Tufts University Health Sciences Campus, have demonstrated a strong record in training doctoral students and garnering extramural research support. Critical components of the Training Program include a strong structured didactic curriculum, rich environment of intellectual exchange across the Health Sciences Campus (e.g., laboratory meetings, journal clubs, seminars and university-wide research days), rigorous mentored dissertation research, and comprehensive training in the responsible conduct of research and post-degree survival skills. Training Program administration and trainee supervision is governed by the program's Director and Co-Director, Steering Committee and External Advisory Board. The Director and Co-Director are responsible for the day to day activities of the Training Program, particularly as it relates to individual trainees and mentors. The Steering Committee meets two times per year, and on an 'as needed' basis, and is primarily responsible for selecting trainees, monitoring trainee progress based on programmatic benchmarks, ensuring the quality and breadth of training opportunities, and assuring a robust mentoring program with particular emphasis on facilitating their transition to an in- dependent research career. Additional oversight is provided by an External Advisory Board. We believe the collective training environment of the Health Sciences Campus provides an outstanding opportunity for future researchers in the area of nutrition and cardiometabolic disorders, and that continued support is a worthy in- vestment in the future of cardiometabolic science.

"9310058","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every animal must distinguish sensations that arise from its own movements from those arising from stimuli in the external world (e.g., lifting your arm vs. having your arm lifted for you). This distinction between self- and other-produced movements requires precise self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is instantiated mechanistically by copies of motor commands-corollary discharges-that prepare the nervous system for the arrival of sensations triggered by self-produced movements. Corollary discharge signals can gate, cancel, or otherwise modify incoming sensory signals. We propose to investigate two novel aspects of corollary discharge: Its expression in early infancy and its modulation by sleep-wake state. One impetus for this proposal is the observation that, in newborn rats, sensory feedback from self-produced limb twitches during active (or REM) sleep triggers spindle bursts in sensorimotor cortex and increased Purkinje cell activity in cerebellar cortex. In contrast, during wakefulness when vigorous, self-produced limb movements typically occur, cortical spindle bursts are surprisingly absent and Purkinje cells are largely silent. This paradoxical masking of neural activity during wake suggests the novel hypothesis that corollary discharge mechanisms are regulated in a state- dependent fashion. Importantly, the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of twitches produced by infant rats each day during sleep trigger substantial brain activity that is ideally suited to promote activity-dependent development in the sensorimotor system.  Specific Aim 1 will characterize state-dependent neural activity in sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum across the first two postnatal weeks in rats, a period of rapid change in those structures. Critically, by comparing spontaneous and evoked neural activity during sleep and wake, this Aim will establish two new models for exploring the neural mechanisms and developmental origins of corollary discharge. Specific Aim 2 will provide critical new data regarding sensorimotor processing in early infancy through systematic comparison of state-dependent activity in brainstem nuclei implicated in (a) the production of limb twitches, (b) the reception of proprioceptive input from limbs, and (c) the processing of corollary discharge. We will also test the novel hypothesis that the locus coeruleus, a brainstem nucleus that is both wake-active and a primary source of norepinephrine to the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, contributes to the state-dependent modulation of corollary discharge. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will explore the developmental emergence of reciprocal and state-dependent modulation of sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum. Such reciprocal interactions are essential for mature sensorimotor integration throughout the brain. The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience emphasizes the need for more basic research to understand neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. This proposal meets that need by uniquely integrating several innovative conceptual and methodological approaches to provide new insights into the functional development of critical sensorimotor systems."
"9305095","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this successful predoctoral Training Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology at UC Davis is to provide Program Trainees, who represent the best students in molecular and cellular biology, with the breadth of knowledge and research training that will prepare them for their own successful careers in the national biomedical workforce. Training is provided by 50 Trainers in 14 academic departments, with wide- ranging interests including genetics, biochemistry, structural biology, cell and developmental biology, physiology and neuroscience. Trainers are selected from the top molecular and cellular biologists on campus, each with an active research program and a successful track record of mentoring. Trainees are selected from the top graduate students across six different Graduate groups. The Training Program hones Trainees' critical thinking abilities, oral and written communication skills, career development and networking, and responsible conduct of research. The Training Program also serves as a mechanism for both integrating and appreciating the diverse array of interdisciplinary molecular and cellular biology research performed, and for increasing diversity in graduate education, across the UC Davis campus. This Training Program requests support for 15 predoctoral student slots to support 7-8 trainees for 2 years each, typically during the second and third year of their PhD training, a modest increase given the success that this Training Program has demonstrated. Institutionally, UC Davis has made a major commitment to establish the faculty and infrastructure in molecular and cellular biology to achieve these training goals, and to support such training in the form of this Training Program through substantial institutional support for the future. With such support, this Training Program will make these trainees fluent in the multidisciplinary languages and integrative methods needed to address important problems in molecular and cellular biology, ranging from molecules to disease. While supported by this training grant, Trainees will be involved in 1) research training in Trainers' laboratories and discipline-specific presentations; 2 presentations to interdisciplinary audiences; 3) research skills workshops across all areas of molecular and cellular biology; 4) a career development/networking series; 5) a trainee-organized seminar series; 6) a course on teaching biology to undergraduates; and 7) an annual research retreat, and training in the responsible conduct of research throughout. We believe that this combination of discipline-specific training in Trainers' research laboratories, interdisciplinry scientific training in cutting-edge molecular and cellular biology, and career development offered by this Training Program will make our trainees better prepared for the changing technical and intellectual climate faced by the next generation of basic biomedical scientists."

However, recent advances in understanding receptor pharmacology indicate that receptors are capable of engaging in multiple signaling cascades and that the chemical nature of the ligand can direct these downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that diverse signaling pathways can give rise to distinct physiological responses produced by a drug. This paradigm yields a novel manner by which to fine-tune receptor signaling in order to enhance desirable biological effects (such as pain relief) while simultaneously eliminating unwanted side effects (such as sedation or negative effects on mood). The project described herein is focused on the characterization of functionally selective ligands at the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. We hypothesize that ligands that bind to certain regions of the receptor will lead to different signaling profiles than those that bind to other regions. Moreover, our goal is to use probe compounds characterized for such functional selectivity to determine if they induce certain behavioral responses while sparing other physiological responses. To this end we will work closely with Project 1 to evaluate compounds that are shown to bind to particular residues in the CB1R in multiple signaling assays, validate signaling in neurons (AIM 1) and then test behaviors in mice (AIM 2, Project 3). The development of such important tools will not only serve to allow for the testing the hypothesis that functional selectivity can fine tune drug efficacies in vivo, but may also serve as the building blocks for the development of future therapeutics for pain, depression and addiction."
"9309082","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain following acute peripheral nerve injury is a major public health issue. Our primary goal in this proposal is to understand the cellular processes that underlie plasticity in cutaneous and muscle sensory neurons following injury and regeneration. Specifically, we will look at injury-induced plasticity of primary sensory neurons reinnervating either skin or striated muscle.  In the first aim, we use ex vivo skin or muscle/nerve/DRG/spinal cord preparations and our novel method for recovering individual functionally characterized sensory neurons to determine the comprehensive phenotypes of cutaneous C-fibers and Group IV muscle afferents in naive mice. This includes characterization of the gene expression profiles of the individual functionally characterized fibers. In our preliminary studies we have indentified several unique functional classes of these fibers.  In the second aim, we will first examine the effects of nerve injury on the functional properties and correlated changes in gene expression in individual characterized fibers reinnervating skin or muscle. In our preliminary studies we have confirmed and expanded upon earlier studies showing that these fibers are sensitized following regeneration. In addition, our results suggest that some fibers are changing phenotype. Next we will examine changes in DRG expression of specific trk, GFRalpha, ASIC, TRP and purinergic receptors/channels contained in these fibers to indentify possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the changes in function observed following nerve injury and regeneration.  In the third aim, we will use our novel in vivo siRNA knockdown technique to test the hypothesis that the injury-induced increase in the expression of particular receptors/channels (e.g. ASIC, TRP and purinergic) mediates the observed functional plasticity in specific populations of cutaneous and muscle afferents. For example, we expect to find that knockdown of the increase in TRPM3 expression levels following cutaneous nerve injury and regeneration will block the observed sensitization of cutaneous C-polymodal fibers to heat. Similarly we expect that knockdown in ASIC3 expression following muscle nerve injury and regeneration will block the sensitization of muscle afferents to mechanical stimulation.  The determination of the specific receptors/channels responsible for sensitization of these fibers will provide new insights to these processes and more importantly could provide potential targets for the development of pharmaceutical therapies. These new therapies could provide for improved treatments for the alleviation of the adverse symptoms of chronic neuropathic pain."
"9323227","ABSTRACT  The goal of the Targeted DNA Methylation & Mitochondrial Heteroplasmy Core is to provide researchers studying aging and age-related diseases with state-of-the-art molecular analyses that are not available at institutional cores. The Core focuses on DNA methylation and mitochondrial heteroplasmy because we have developed novel technologies that address fundamental questions of how genomes change with age. DNA methylation is a major regulator of gene expression; studies show that DNA methylation patterns change with aging, and these changes can be caused by a wide variety of environmental stimuli at any point in the lifespan. As a fundamental regulator of gene expression, altered DNA methylation patterns could cause genes to be aberrantly expressed (e.g., cancer) or suppress genes required for continued cellular function (e.g., senescence). On the other hand, increases in mutations and deletions in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) with age have been known for some time, but the field has struggled because assays that lack coverage across the entire mitochondrial genome and have limited quantitative accuracy. Accurate and comprehensive analyses of mtDNA will provide data that define the contributions of mtDNA changes to mitochondrial dysfunction. This Core will enable Geroscience researchers to utilize DNA methylation and mitochondrial (mtDNA) heteroplasmy analyses in their research programs by providing unique assays, instrumentation not present in individual laboratories, and technical expertise to generate and analyze the data from these studies. The specific aims of the DNA Methylation & Mitochondrial Heteroplasmy Core are:  Aim 1. Perform quantitatively-accurate DNA methylation analyses, ranging from genome- wide to gene-specific, using advanced sequencing technologies.  Aim 2. Measure mitochondrial genome heteroplasmy and copy number with new methods that allow for comprehensive variant analysis and absolute genome copy number quantification  Aim 3. Develop DNA methylation assays for exceptionally long-lived animals and mitochondrial heteroplasmy analyses for invertebrates (e.g., Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast) and exceptionally long-lived animals."
"9240417","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus and is a leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which is a condition where the inner ear is unable to convert sound into nerve impulses to the brain. This hearing loss and its detrimental effect on language development contribute nearly $4 billion annually to the health care costs in the U.S. Unlike other types of SNHL, CMV induced hearing loss can be treated. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that antiviral therapy may prevent progressive hearing loss if administered early in life for severely affected (symptomatic CMV) infants. These promising findings have given rise to a debate regarding the best method for identifying and treating less affected but more numerous (asymptomatic CMV) infants with CMV. One approach is CMV testing only those newborns who fail their newborn hearing screening. This path has been advocated as a targeted option to identify those infants at greatest risk to develop progressive hearing loss. Utah is the first state to mandate this approach whereby infants under three weeks of age who fail their newborn hearing screening undergo CMV testing. Since we anticipate maximal benefit from antiviral therapy, we will compare the hearing, and language outcomes of asymptomatic CMV infected valganciclovir (VGC) treated and untreated infants identified via a hearinglosstargetedearlyCMVapproach(HT-CMV).Thisanalysiswillinformpublicpolicyandpotentiallyshift our current clinical practice regarding pediatric hearing loss evaluation. In the proposed work, the investigators will pursue two specific aims: (1) Compare the hearing and language outcomes of asymptomatic CMV-infected hearing-impaired treated to untreated infants via a multi-institutional double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial. (2) To evaluate the safety of antiviral valganciclovir therapy for asymptomatic CMV-infected hearing impaired infants. This project is directly relevant to the mission of the NIDCD ?to support research evaluating approaches to the identification and treatment of communication disorders and patient outcomes .? More specifically, in the 2012?2016 NIDCD Strategic Plan, in the Priority Area of Hearing and Balance Research, Priority Area 4 includes comparative effectiveness research which will inform health care decisions."
"9352624","Tau protein aggregation is the most common pathology among neurodegenerative diseases, which collectively are termed ?tauopathies.? These diseases encompass over 15 distinct disorders that greatly affect Veterans, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury. As the most common cause of dementia in the United States, AD affects more than 5 million Americans, including 600,000 military personnel and costs $200 billion per year. Effective treatment strategies remain elusive. We are applying fresh perspectives from different disciplines and are investigating cellular senescence as a novel cell stress response involved in tau-associated neurodegeneration.  Large insoluble tau-containing aggregates, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), are the closest histopathological correlate with neuron loss and cognitive decline in AD. However, because NFT-containing neurons do not die, their role in neurodegeneration remains unclear. We suggest that NFTs may evoke toxicity through secondary, non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Specifically, we propose that NFT-containing cells may contribute to tissue destruction by secreting toxic soluble factors in a mechanism similar to cellular senescence.  Cellular senescence is generally characterized by a permanent cell cycle arrest and alterations in gene expression, metabolic state, morphology, and cytokine secretion. In neurons, ?senescence? has been used to describe age-associated changes that include swelling of the soma, loss of dendritic spines, and progressive ?choking of cytoplasmic space? with abnormal material; phenotypes in good agreement with NFT-containing neurons. While there is no single unifying marker that defines the complex senescence stress response, robust phenotypes include elevated gene expression of tumor suppressor p16INK4a (p16) and inflammatory cytokines. Studies have illustrated that senescent cells contribute to tissue damage and functional decline with age. Recently, we found that transgenic mice with NFTs have a significant elevation in senescence markers in the brain, including p16. The increase in p16 was associated with an elevation in brain cytokines, Tnf? and Il1?. Only mice with NFTs, but not age-matched controls with high levels of soluble tau, expressed senescence- associated factors. Collectively, these data suggest that pathogenic tau and cellular senescence are interconnected. The research goal is to elucidate whether tau-associated pathogenesis induces a senescence- like phenotype that reciprocally contributes to brain pathology and behavioral deficits in tau-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Ongoing studies with transgenic mice will focus on molecular mediators of cellular senescence in the brain, specific cell types involved and the mechanistic interplay among cellular senescence, tau pathology, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.  Through the activities proposed in this CDA-2, I will achieve my ultimate career goal: to become an independent investigator dedicated to the pursuit of understanding AD while improving the health and wellbeing of Veterans and their families. I have developed a comprehensive program, guided by an outstanding mentoring team. They represent leaders within the VA and in the research of AD, senescence and inflammation. Through the planned activities, I will acquire new technical skills to achieve my research goals and lay the foundation for my independent career. My mentoring team will advocate for my career development within the VA, including providing me opportunities for leadership and supporting my greater community outreach activities. The exceptional training opportunities at the South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio, and community involvement in ?Military City, USA?, provide an ideal environment for my ambitions as a well-rounded scientist. By the completion of the CDA-2 I expect to be fully prepared to (1) lead an independent research program focused on AD; (2) have generated sufficient data to compete for Merit Review Award funding; (3) and joined the VA scientific workforce."
"9332637","PROJECT SUMMARY  End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis (HD) are encouraged to follow several dietary recommendations related to dietary phosphorus (P) intake in light of the evidence that hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased mortality in these patients. ESRD patients are advised to have a maximum of 800 to 1000 mg of dietary P per day, but these recommendations do not distinguish between different types of dietary P. There are two types of P in food: (1) natural or organic P that is bound to proteins and found in foods that are high in protein, and (2) added or inorganic P that does not naturally occur but is added as a preservative in processed foods such as colas, deli meats, cereals, and processed cheeses. The added inorganic P is more readily absorbed through the digestive system and may have a greater influence on hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients than an equal amount of organic P. Ethnic and cultural influences often mediate dietary food choices. Compared to Whites, African Americans may have greater intake of high protein foods and may be more likely to eat processed food with added inorganic P. The differences in dietary P intake across racial/ethnic groups of HD patients are not well studied. Renal dietitians play an integral role in the management of dietary P intake in HD patients. We dietitians are responsible for communicating nutrition therapy recommendations while also being sensitive to patients' personal and cultural food preferences and explore the underlying factors related to adherence to a low-P-diet. Different assessment tools may result in major differences in estimating P and its subtypes, and race may have a role in these differences and their impact on occurrence of hyperphosphatemia. The paucity of reliable patient-centered assessment of dietary intake of P through identification of key foods and analysis of actual food intake among different racial/ethnic groups in HD patients is a major gap in our understanding. As a Black renal dietitian and PhD student, I am committed to studying these important questions. I plan to examine the hypothesis that different dietary P assessment methods yield different estimates and that dietary P intake of HD patients is different across race/ethnicity. To do so, I will assess dietary P intake and sources of dietary P by a food frequency questionnaire in 450 HD patients and through a 3-day diet record with interview in a randomly selected subgroup of 120 patients. I will also examine the hypothesis that estimated P intake by diet record is more strongly associated with hyperphosphatemia than estimates from FFQ, and that African American HD patients by virtue of eating more processed food with higher added inorganic P have higher likelihood of hyperphosphatemia. My proposed 3-year study will enable me to address an important gap, and my project also has the potential to inform kidney disease nutrition education materials, which would allow us to provide more efficient and culturally sensitive nutrition counseling to kidney disease patients in order to improve their adherence to P intake recommendations. I plan to use this valuable data for my doctoral dissertation.  "
"9369692","SUMMARY (See instructions): The Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FACS-SR) provides AECC investigators with technologies required for fluorescence-based cell analysis and sorting. A broad range of research in a large proportion of AECC associated laboratories is supported by the FACS-SR, with connections to virtually all AECC programs and training activities. The instruments required for flow cytometry and cell sorting are intricate and expensive, making this a logical resource to provide through a centralized facility. In addition, cell sorting presents complex issues in biocontainment, requiring specialized laboratory space and highly trained personnel for proper management. The organization of these resources within the FACS-SR has proven to be an extremely efficient approach to creating a well supervised, quality controlled, cost effective and safe environment for FACS-based analysis and cell sorting. Since the last CCSG review in 2007, the FACS-SR has undergone major expansion to add new capabilities as well as a needed increase in the capacity for all services. Substantial additional laboratory space has been added, including rooms that are specially configured for enhanced BSL-2 work involved with sorting of primary human cells or potentially infectious material. Work performed to a great extent by AECC members has driven technology development in the FACS-SR, and supported multiple successful NIH Shared Instrumentation Grants over the past five years. This, along with substantial ongoing institutional support, has led to the acquisition of major new equipment and expansion of the resources and services provided by the FACS-SR. Three new cell sorters have been added to the facility since the last competing renewal, enabling accommodation of the growing need for this resource. Both Beckman-Coulter MoFlo and BD FACSAria sorters are operated by the facility, providing an extraordinarily advanced and versatile range of cell sorting applications. In addition, several analytical flow cytometers have been added to the facility's inventory, and facility staff has been increased to achieve maximum utilization of the instrumentation. The FACS-SR has also been highly successful at introducing novel technologies to AECC investigators in recent years, such as laser scanning cytometry and newly derived fluorescent proteins with unique spectral properties. The FACS-SR staff provides training on all the instruments, as well as consultation to assist with experimental design and instrument selection. A well established administrative structure ensures orderly management of facility operations and efficient delivery of services at the lowest possible cost."
"9308000","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Migraine is an immense healthcare burden with limited therapeutic options. Environmental enrichment (EE) reduces migraine. The long-term goal of this project is to determine how EE mitigates migraine, modeled using spreading depression (SD), in order to identify novel targets for development of therapies. SD, the likely cause of migraine with aura (MwA), transiently disrupts myelin. Microglia can polarize to distinct phenotypes that range from classically (M1) to alternatively (M2a) activated states. Microglia generate the oxidative stress that occurs with SD and lowers SD threshold (SDT), suggesting that a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype enhances SD by damaging myelin and increasing aberrant cross-talk between nerve fibers. In contrast, EE promotes an anti-inflammatory M2a phenotype and raises SDT, while increasing myelination, and oxidative tolerance (OT). EE increases CNS interleukin-11 (IL-11), and IL-11 alone can recreate these effects. The rationale for this project is based on evidence indicating that microglial M2a polarization increases SDT via secreted factors. Preliminary data show that while exosomes released from M1 microglia reduce SDT, those from M2a microglia increase SDT, perhaps by increasing myelination/OT, which could prevent the aberrant excitability that provokes SD. This study will further explore the effects of EE-induced M2a polarization on increasing SDT through production of exosomes. The overall goal is to define exosomal miRNAs from M2a- polarized microglia that most potently increase SDT plus myelination/OT and test their effectiveness in vivo after nasal administration. The central hypothesis is that M2a-polarized microglia release exosomes containing miRNA that mimic the effects of EE on SDT, myelin levels and OT. The aims are: Aim 1: Establish the impact of M2a versus M1 microglia-derived exosomes on SDT, myelination/OT. SD is used to model MwA in rat brain slice cultures and rats. Exosomes from polarized primary microglia are applied to slice cultures for measurement of SDT, myelination/OT. Aim 2: Identify miRNA species differentially expressed in M2a versus M1 microglia-derived exosomes and validate their role in influencing myelination/OT. miRNAs are identified using arrays and bioinformatics. Targets are verified using qPCR and Western blots. Aim 3: Determine the extent to which unique miRNAs identified in Aim 2 impact SDT, myelination/OT. Exosomes from M2a microglia and dendritic cells (DCs) will be electroporated with specific miRNA inhibitors and mimics respectively, then tested for impact on slice culture SDT, myelination/OT. DC exosomes will be used, as they enter brain nasally to produce functional effects. Aim 4: Establish the impact of M2a exosomes in vivo. M2a exosomes will be nasally delivered to brain for measurement of SDT, myelination/OT, and target mRNA/proteins. Trafficking will be determined via in vivo and confocal imaging of tagged exosomes. This work is innovative because it explores M2a microglial exosomes/miRNAs as a means to increase SDT via myelination/OT. It is significant, because it will identify therapeutic miRNAs to be loaded into exosomes for nasal delivery against SD/MwA."
"9351172","Project Summary/Abstract The Genito-Urinary Developmental Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) has generated information and research tools to enhance our understanding of the development of urogenital system, both informing and stimulating research into urogenital development, and associated disorders and disease. Our proposed studies focus on the developing kidney complementing existing data available through the GUDMAP website. The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron ? hence, our focus on obtaining a thorough understanding of mammalian nephrogenesis. The current GUDMAP view of this process is largely two-dimensional and mouse focused. We will harness recent advances in both static and live dynamic cell imaging, the access to human kidney specimens and the development of pluripotent stem cell (PSC) culture-seeded nephrogenesis to extend our understanding of both mouse and human nephrogenesis. In Aim 1, we will develop high-resolution 3D views of mouse and human nephrogenesis through selective imaging approaches comparing mouse and human nephrogenesis to develop comparative 3D molecular atlases of nephron patterning and nephron morphogenesis. In Aim 2, we will take advantage of improvements in imaging and organ culture, and a bank of genetically modified mouse strains, to perform time lapse imaging of the nephron progenitor niche, and the formation, morphogenesis and patterning of the mouse nephron. Dynamic imaging studies will be applied to pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived models of human nephrogenesis. Together, these studies will significantly enrich the GUDMAP resource generating comparative 4D views of nephron development in the mouse and human kidney. Given the recent advances in the directed differentiation of PSCs into nephron-like structures, the studies will provide a benchmark for normal nephrogenesis that will guide the emerging field of regenerative kidney biology."
"9398707","Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment in psychiatry, and among the most effective in medicine. Despite its apparent non-focal effects leading to a generalized seizure, its therapeutic benefits are specific to a few clinical syndromes, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BD). These two syndromes share core deficits in reward processing (i.e. anhedonia). ECT improves anhedonia across mood disorders and syndromes, implying selective effects on the functional dynamics and structural properties of reward networks.  Reward-related functions represent key behavioral dimensions of pathological relevance across neuropsychiatric disorders, and have a central place as positive valence constructs in the RDoC matrix. There has been a growing recognition that ?anhedonia? does not represent a unitary dimension; among its subcategories, three constructs emerge with clear relevance to behavior and disease: consummation (liking), motivation (wanting) and reinforcement (learning). Quantitative behavioral measures exist for each of these three, with clinical validity as biomarkers and predictors of response.  The anatomy of the reward network is well known, with a core in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), and projections to cortical and subcortical nodes via the mesocorticolimbic pathway and its ramifications. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) has significantly advanced the technologies for imaging brain connections in humans, accelerating innovation in the emerging field of Connectomics. Preliminary data from our group describes the feasibility of obtaining multimodal MRI measures of reward circuit biology (morphometry, tractography, functional connectivity) in patients undergoing ECT, and extracting clinically meaningful information to identify treatment targets and develop biomarkers and predictors.  At a time when therapeutic research is stalled due to the absence of clear targets and useful biomarkers, understanding the mechanisms of our most effective treatments is a priority for our field. In this study, we propose a novel translational strategy that takes advantage of the high efficacy and fast response of ECT, and uses it to probe target engagement at the circuit level. With a systems neuroscience framework, in line with NIMH strategic priorities and the RDoC Initiative, we will focus on reward circuitry and its clinical dimensions across two clinical syndromes that are commonly treated with ECT: MDD and BD. We will use HCP multimodal MRI protocols combined with validated behavioral measures of reward constructs to assess patients before, during and after ECT, in addition to a cohort of matched healthy controls that will be imaged twice. This study is innovative in its proposal to combine ECT with multimodal MRI as a framework to study anhedonia transdiagnostically, with the translational aims to (1) discover treatment targets, (2) develop biomarkers and (3) identify predictors of response."
"9323511","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own FDA Science and Mission at Risk report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA."
"9337487","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When a blood vessel ruptures, a hemostatic clot, consisting mainly of platelets and fibrin, is formed to restrict the loss of blood. Physiological blood clotting is highly regulated, but a pathological clot (thrombus) may form within a vessel and restrict blood flow to organs or clot pieces (emboli) can detach and be carried to the lungs, causing a life-threatening complication called pulmonary embolism. Also, clots are formed in coronary arteries, causing heart attacks, and in brain vessels, causing ischemic strokes. The high morbidity and mortality rates (about 900,000 incidences and 300,000 deaths annually just from venous thromboembolic disease) underscore the biomedical importance of studying processes limiting clot formation. However, the mechanisms stopping clot growth are poorly understood. In particular, current models of thrombus development do not address how structure of fibrin network (FNW) affect spatial-temporal evolution of blood coagulation factors and the interplay between FNW and platelets under flow conditions limiting blood clot growth. This proposal combines development of 3D Multiscale Blood Clot Modeling Environment (MBCME-3D) and coupling MBCME-3D simulations and specifically designed experiments using optical tweezers and microfluidic chambers, to study two specific roles that a FNW plays in regulating blood clot growth: 1) impeding protein transport; and 2) mediating platelet-FNW binding kinetics under physiological or pathological conditions. This will result in detailed examination of the common clinical scenario of increasing blood shear in response to partial obstruction and narrowing of the vessel lumen, which is considered a critically important component, affecting both the generation of fibrin and binding of platelets, mechanisms limiting blood clot growth. Better understanding of the structure and properties as well as the mechanisms of clot growth and its limitations under blood flow will help physicians to estimate risk of thrombotic disease for an individual patient by identifying critical values of parameters o processes regulating thrombogenesis. Additionally, the generalized MBCME-3D will be able to simulate in detail motion of biological cells and proteins in the fluid environment in the presence of porous biogels at the micro- and mesoscale which will contribute to the development of a variety of predictive multiscale computational models for biomedical research."
"9322449","Summary Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at increased risk for problems with adherence and suboptimal glycemic control, and novel approaches are needed to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. The majority of adolescents obtain insufficient sleep (defined as <8 hours/night), and in our data, sleep disturbance was significantly associated with poorer adherence and predicted greater problems with quality of life and worse glycemic control. Yet, no interventions have addressed sleep in youth with T1D. Working from a biopsychosocial and contextual model of sleep, we propose to tailor a sleep-promoting intervention to meet the needs of adolescents with T1D by conducting interviews with to identify the barriers and facilitators to adequate sleep specific to this population. We will then develop and pilot test a brief, behavioral sleep-promoting intervention, building on successful interventions in other populations, including components such as limiting caffeine, establishing a media curfew, and positive bedtime routines, while addressing the needs unique to adolescents with T1D, such as fear of hypoglycemia. The study will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team, consisting of Sarah Jaser, PhD, a pediatric psychologist, Beth Malow, MD, MS, a neurologist with specialty in sleep medicine, Cindy Lybarger, MSN, APRN, CDE, a nurse practitioner and certified diabetes educator, and Jill Simmons, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist. Sleep is a potentially modifiable risk factor that may have both a physiological and behavioral impact on diabetes outcomes. Given the strong associations between sleep and diabetes outcomes in our preliminary data, and accumulating evidence indicating the impact of insufficient sleep on insulin sensitivity, behavior, and mood, there is reason to believe that a sleep-promoting intervention has the potential to improve outcomes in adolescents with T1D indirectly by improving self-management and directly through its effect on metabolic function and glycemic control. Therefore, the proposed study offers a novel approach to improve glycemic control, adherence, and quality of life in adolescents with T1D."
"9340051","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to develop and deploy a low-cost measurement system which tracks exercise compliance and enables remote health coaching for patients with low back pain. Back pain is the most common cause of activity limitation in individuals younger than 45 years and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. afflicting between 70% and 85% of the population. It is the leading cause of lost wages and accounts for more than 700,000 surgical procedures per year with a total over $80 billion annually spent on treatment and care. Dynamic motion of the lumbar spine has been shown to change with disc degeneration and pain. Furthermore, these aberrant motion patterns can be improved with prescribed physical therapy and exercise. In practice, therapists qualitatively monitor back pain treatments through series of guided exercises and stretches in the clinic and then prescribe a protocol of exercises and stretches to be performed in the home. It is difficult to track performance and compliance over long periods of treatment. This research program aims to enable the long term treatment-tracking of patients with chronic low back pain. A novel, low-cost, highly accurate system that tracks and encourages compliance with a patients exercise protocol will be developed in phase II. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a device which measures compliance to physical therapy regimens will increase patient participation. Specific Aims: 1) Develop a production-ready prototype hardware system; 2) Design and implement easy-to-use, cloud-enabled software for patients and health coaches; and 3) Conduct a human study to evaluate the effect of the system on compliance and quality of life."
"9402437","Abstract Neutrophils mount an early and critical defense in the innate immune response to pathogens, but are also associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, autoimmune disease, and cancer. Recruitment of leukocytes to sites of acute inflammation is a finely orchestrated process initiated by membrane expression and functional activation of leukocyte and endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) including selectins, integrins, and Ig-super family ligands. A set of unifying themes have emerged over the tenure of this R01 which provide molecular scale insight into how PMNs integrate force as a spatio-mechanical cue in the transition from rolling to firm arrest and transendothelial migration: 1) Selectins are endowed with mechanical and biochemical properties that allow their dissociation lifetime to increase with the rate of tensile loading; 2) Shear stress and transmembrane calcium release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels regulate calcium flux which functions to synchronize integrin mediated arrest and shape orientation under shear; 3) allosteric upregulation in affinity of both LFA-1 and L-selectin in binding ICAM-1 and E-selectin, respectively, facilitates tensile force buildup to trigger key outside-in signals that are cooperative during PMN recruitment. In this competitive renewal we apply innovative vascular mimetic microfluidic channels combined with real-time immunofluorescence imaging to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Establish the ligand binding and mechanotransduction events by which human neutrophils are activated to arrest on E-selectin/ICAM-1 via signaling through L-selectin. 2) Define the mechanotransduction mechanism by which LFA-1 bonds to ICAM-1 elicits outside-in signaling via Kindlin-3 and other as yet unidentified adaptors. 3) Develop and test small molecule antagonists to allosteric domains that interrupt neutrophil activation and recruitment using vascular mimetic microfluidic screening technology. Our strategy entails the use of freshly isolated human neutrophils with the overarching goal of identifying regulatory pathways and molecular targets for prognosis and treatment of granulocytic inflammatory diseases.

"9302611","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) progresses from a normal liver, to alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite of intensive studies, the pathogenesis of ALD is poorly understood due to the lack of animal models which mimic the stages of ALD progression. Furthermore, the role of IL-17 in ALD has not been evaluated. We have recently demonstrated that IL-17 signaling plays a critical role in development of liver fibrosis and cancer. Based on our preliminary data, IL-17 signaling also required for ALD, and mice devoid of IL-17 signaling develop less steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Here we propose to further explore the role of IL-17 in ALD, using an improved model of ALD in mice, which was developed as a result of a collaborative effort of Drs. Karin, Gao, Tsukamoto and Kisseleva. This model most closely reproduces the stages of ALD and reflects physiological ALD progression from steatohepatitis to alcohol-induced liver fibrosis and HCC in patients. Our central hypothesis is that IL-17 exacerbates progression of ALD from steatohepatitis to fibrosis and HCC. The goal of the study is to determine if the strategy of blocking IL-17 will have a therapeutic effect on ALD. The role of IL-17 signaling in ALD, and pathways of IL-17 regulation will be tested in this study using IL-17-/-, IL-17RA-/-, and several cell-specific knockout mice to determine the role of IL- 17 signaling 1) chronic-binge model that mimics early stages of steatohepatitis (AIM 1), 2) intragastric ethanol feeding model that mimics alcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis (AIM 2), and 3) diethylnitrosamine (DEN)+alcohol model that mimics alcoholic liver cancer (AIM 3). Specifically, these models will allow us to dissect specific IL-17 functions at different stages of ALD. Thus, for each model, 1) development of alcohol- induced liver injury will be determined by measuring alcohol-metabolizing enzymes dehydrogenase (ADH), cytochrome, P4502E1 (CYP2E1), expression of adipogenic genes (PPAR?, PPAR?, CEBP1), lipid peroxidation, ROS production. 2) The role of IL-17 in recruitment of inflammatory cells, Kupffer cells/macrophage activation will be determined. 3) The cellular sources of IL-17 will be identified. 4) The IL-17 target cells that critically mediate ALD progression will be determined, specific cell types will be isolated and ex vivo analyzed. 5) We will generate conditional IL-17RA-/- knockout mice in Kupffer cells, hepatocytes and Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSCs) to study their contribution to ALD. 6) The global cytokine expression profile will determined for each type of knockout mice. 7) The regulatory role of IL-23, IL-25 and IL-27 cytokines in IL-17 by Th17 cells (or other IL-17 producing cells) will be determined. These unique genetic studies will provide an insight into usefulness of IL-17 inhibitors as a novel approach to treat ALD in patients."
"9321102","PROJECT SUMMARY ? NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE Autopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of diseases that cause dementia. It provides knowledge essential for developing biomarkers, understanding cellular pathology responsible for the dementia, and retrospectively identifying features most reliable for early diagnosis. Without this information rational discovery of disease-modifying drugs for dementia syndromes would not be possible. The Neuropathology Core therefore plays a pivotal role in all functions of the Northwestern ADC. In the next cycle, the Neuropathology Core will provide state-of-the-art postmortem diagnosis on all Clinical Core subjects that come to autopsy. The results will be made available in a timely fashion to family, clinicians, researchers, and NACC. Another key function of the Neuropathology Core will be to collect, curate, and distribute biospecimens to qualified research projects, both within Northwestern University and for multi-center collaborations including NCRAD and ADGC. In addition to supporting research related to the aging-MCI-AD continuum, the Neuropathology Core will have a special focus on unusually successful cognitive aging (SuperAgers), non-amnestic dementias such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and non-AD pathologies related to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Pursuing these themes, which constitute areas of special emphasis for the Northwestern ADC, will require bilateral tissue sampling for detection of hemispheric asymmetry and unbiased stereology for quantitative comparisons of cellular pathology with in vivo clinical and imaging data. The infrastructure of the Northwestern ADC will also enable the Neuropathology Core to train the next generation of neuropathologists in a multidisciplinary setting that includes close interaction with clinicians, imagers and neuroanatomists."
"9320731","RESEARCH & RELATED - OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CB2 cannabinoid receptor agonists show intriguing therapeutic promise in diverse preclinical models. However, the lack of detailed information about the signal transduction mechanisms underlying the observed in vivo efficacies has thwarted translational efforts aimed at developing CB2-based therapeutics. We have recently described striking functional selectivity (whereby different agonists activate distinct networks of signaling pathways) among different CB2 agonists. We hypothesize that the inability to move CB2 agonists forward from preclinical development to novel therapies is in part due to an insufficient appreciation of the functional selectivity of this class of drugs. We contend that understanding of the mechanism of CB2 agonist functional selectivity is a prerequisite for rationally designing CB2 agonists exhibiting functional selectivity for specific classical CB2 agonist signaling pathways. We will test the hypothesis that selective activation of a restricted set of signaling pathways will produce unique therapeutic benefits by evaluating the effects of novel, functionally selective CB2 agonists in four different preclinical models. This project works iteratively with Core B, and Projects 1 & 2 to systematically evaluate functional selectivity of the novel CB2 agonists synthesized in Project 1 (in vitro assays) and determine if CB2 agonist functional selectivity can be exploited to develop more efficacious CB2 agonists for the treatment of chronic pain, inflammation, and reward (in vivo assays). We will test our central hypothesis and accomplish these objectives by completing two specific aims:  1. To characterize the in vitro functional selectivity of rationally designed CB2 agonists from distinct  chemical classes. The compounds showing the most distinct profiles of functional selectivity will then  be advanced to the second specific aim.  2. To identify the optimal functional selectivity profile of CB2 agonists for suppressing neuropathic pain,  inflammation, and reward in vivo. The most promising compounds identified in Aim 1 will be evaluated in Aim 2 for efficacy with acute and chronic (as appropriate) treatment. Completion of the first aim will map CB2 agonist chemotypes associated to specific patterns of functional selectivity. The second aim will identify signaling networks required to suppress neuropathic pain, inflammation, or reward in our preclinical models, which may or may not involve overlapping functional selectivity profiles. (This approach will also identify the signaling pathways that are not necessary (i.e. dispensable) for a particular behavioral outcome, which is important information to obtain and will be a helpful guide for future medicinal chemistry efforts.) Together, the knowledge gained from these aims will allow us and others to develop novel CB2 ligands with focused pharmacological efficacy and possibly reduced side-effects for treating indications where CB2 agonists are likely to prove beneficial."
"9361853","PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching aim of the Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network (NNE-CTR) is to establish the necessary infrastructure to conduct high-quality clinical and translational research that will ultimately improve health outcomes for residents in this largely rural region. To achieve this ambitious aim, NNE-CTR leadership and staff will need to develop systems to continuously assess progress and identify opportunities for mid-course corrections. The Tracking and Evaluation Core (TEC) will provide the requisite infrastructure to ensure that the NNE-CTR can establish its own value and efficiency, and enact needed program improvements in a timely and effective manner. Led by a multidisciplinary team of evaluation, outcomes research and quality improvement experts, the functions of the TEC will be to: 1) identify meaningful and reliable performance metrics for the overall program, and the individual Key Component Activities; 2) continually track and monitor these metrics; and 3) rigorously analyze, synthesize, and disseminate performance information to NNE-CTR leadership and key stakeholders throughout the implementation process. Working collaboratively with Maine Medical Center and the University of Vermont, TEC staff will use a flexible, stakeholder-centered approach to facilitate the selection of performance metrics for each Core and the broader NNE-CTR initiative; implement and customize the REDCap data portal to support tracking and data collection; collect primary qualitative and quantitative data relevant to the conduct of clinical and translational research; routinely analyze and report performance data to the NNE-CTR leadership and key stakeholders; respond to evaluation consultation requests from other Cores; and produce summative reports of activities and outcomes of the IDeA-CTR award. The TEC activities will be grounded in the Center for Disease Control and Preventions' evaluation framework, which applies a population health model ideal for evaluating the health and systems-level outcomes of clinical and translational research. To complement the CDC model, the TEC Core will also adopt the ?systems evaluation partnership? model to assess a broad range of process and short- and long-term outcome measures. In addition, the TEC will apply quality improvement tools and techniques in tandem with more traditional evaluation methods to provide the NNE-CTR leadership and stakeholders with actionable rapid cycle feedback to help inform implementation efforts and identify opportunities for improvement. Through these activities, the TEC will facilitate transparency, promote data-informed decisions regarding the management of the initiative's many components, and thereby ensure the ultimate success of the overall program."
"9323663","Project Summary The purpose of this administrative core is to support high levels of innovation and collaboration, implement research team processes, and assume responsibility for administrative work as the foundational infrastructure enabling the investigators to focus on achieving the scientific goals of this program project, Pathogenesis of Rebound SIV/HIV Viremia after Antiretroviral Therapy. Progress toward the ultimate goal of eliminating rebound of HIV viremia after stopping early antiretroviral therapy will be accelerated if the experimental strategies of this PPG are informed and actively updated of discoveries from the entire, international HIV research effort. We have proposed creative and feasible mechanisms to assure the active engagement of our entire PPG team with new knowledge and to support nimble re-design of experimental plans with appropriate allocation of resources. The design of the AC uses robust tools for communications and administrative processes with the intent to be economically efficient and reserve resources for experimentation in the scientific projects and non-human primate core. The AC will be led by the PPG Program Director, Dr. Richard D'Aquila, and will address the following three aims: 1) Establish governance structures facilitating maximum research collaboration and productivity, implement processes for effective communications, and promote excellence via critical, productive external review, 2) Assure that PPG investigators function at the edge of discovery by supporting continual evolution of experimental strategy informed by engagement with HIV research advances outside the PPG, and 3) Establish efficient processes for administrative and fiscal management of PPG resources and effort across all performance sites. The AC will use an experienced Program Manager, an Executive Committee of the principal investigators, and an annually-convened Scientific Advisory Board to manage, govern, and review the PPG, respectively. The AC will work with an additional, innovative component to keep PPG research at the edge of discovery - the CORA (Clinical Observation of Rebound after pausing ART) Advisory Team. The CORA Advisory Team (CAT) will bring together leaders from the US Military HIV Research Program investigating early infection in a human cohort in Thailand (the RV 254/SEARCH 010 study), clinicians and clinical investigators from diverse Chicago institutions at the forefront of HIV care, and patients in order to review the newest information in HIV cure and viremia rebound research and plan a human pilot, observational study in years 4-5 of this PPG. AC support of the PPG scientific team and the CAT will accelerate the pace of scientific discovery by strengthening integration, promoting communications, efficiently delivering administrative services, and lowering organizational barriers to allow investigators to productively and interactively advance the scientific aims of this program."
"9294140","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genome of each individual harbors millions of nucleotide variants, and a major challenge is to understand how these variants contribute to phenotypic variations in the population. We propose a combined computational and experimental framework for identifying non-coding variants that affect cellular and physiological traits, with the goal to establish computational models that can predict the probability of exhibiting a physiological trait from the sequences of non-coding genomic regions. This framework involves iterative refinement of model assumptions and parameters with experimentation. To develop the framework and validate the predictive models, we will focus on the disease Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness among the elderly in the country. Previous studies have identified a number of sequence variants strongly associated with AMD. We will develop computational models to predict (or narrow down) the set of non-coding sequence variants that contribute to the disease phenotype. As experimental assessment, we will perform genome editing in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to test the consequence of removing or introducing such sequence variants on molecular and cellular phenotypes in cell culture and in rodent models. While the proposed method is developed for AMD, the general approach is expected to apply to other genetic diseases."

"9351176","PROJECT SUMMARY Normal function of the lower urinary tract (LUT) requires coordination of neuronal activities to allow bladder filling for urine storage later followed by bladder contraction to accomplish emptying at an appropriate time and place. Despite the fact that much is known about the neuroanatomy and mature circuitry of the LUT, relatively little is known about the molecular composition, development and postnatal maturation of distinct neuron subtypes that regulate bladder contractility. At present we lack a catalog of receptors expressed by different types of pelvic ganglia neurons that could be used to investigate how these critical neurons reach their targets in different LUT organs or direct regenerative efforts in cases of surgical damage. Even less is known about the molecular makeup of chemosensory brush cells and paraneurons in the urethra that are positioned to modulate LUT contractility. These cells contain high levels of neurotransmitters and thus can act as neuromodulators that stimulate bladder contraction in response to infection or mechanical stretch. Knowledge of the connections between motor neurons in pelvic ganglia and these neuromodulatory cells would enable detailed mechanistic studies of bladder sensitization and contractility in response to infection, inflammation or urine composition. The overall goal of this GUDMAP Atlas project is to fill these gaps in knowledge so that future mechanistic studies can be pursued. Four Specific Aims are proposed: (1) compile an atlas of genes expressed by pelvic ganglia neurons at single cell resolution during development and postnatal maturation; (2) map the first appearance and distribution of urethral neuromodulatory cells during development in the mouse; (3) identify genetic markers for subsets of urethral neuromodulatory cells by RNA-seq ; (4) generate a detailed spatial and temporal map of nerve terminals between neuromodulatory cells and sensory or autonomic pelvic ganglia neurons. These studies will generate novel information that is current lacking from the GUDMAP database. Our results will be summarized in diagrams and tutorial maps on the GUDMAP site and the gene sets identified will expedite comparative studies in human tissues. As a result the research community will be able to investigate the functions of specific cell types and test hypotheses using cell type and gene specific approaches."
"9315210","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain injury during cardiac surgery results primarily from cerebral embolism and/or reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF). The latter is of particular concern for the growing number of surgical patients who are aged and/or who have cerebral vascular disease. Normally, CBF is physiologically autoregulated (or kept constant) within a range of blood pressures, allowing for stable cerebral O2 supply commensurate with metabolic demands. Cerebral autoregulation is impaired in patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery and have cerebral vascular disease or many other conditions. Such impairment could lead to brain injury because current practices of targeting low mean arterial blood pressure empirically (usually 50-70 mmHg) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may expose patients with impaired cerebral autoregulation to cerebral hypoperfusion. The hypothesis of this study is that targeting mean arterial pressure during CPB to a level above an individual's lower autoregulatory threshold reduces the risk for early neurologic complications from cardiac surgery or postoperative cognitive decline. Cerebral autoregulation will be monitored in real time by using software that continuously compares the relation between arterial blood pressure and low-frequency changes in transcranial Doppler measured cerebral blood flow velocity as well as cerebral oximetry measured with near infrared spectroscopy using methods we have validated. The primary endpoint of the study will be a composite outcome of clinical stroke, and/or new ischemic brain lesions detected with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and/or cognitive decline from baseline at 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. We will further assess for a relationship between blood pressure below the limits of autoregulation and delirium, an end-point associated with morbidity and mortality. Brain injury from cardiac surgery is an important source of operative mortality, prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare expenditure, and impaired quality of life. Developing strategies to reduce the burden of this complication has wide public health implications and is within the mission of the NHLBI."
"9419603","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor reading comprehension (RC) has significant public health consequences. About 25-30% of adolescents in the U.S. perform at a Below Basic level, a level that does not promote successful academic achievement; however, successful RC intervention for much of this population has been elusive. The evidence suggests that there are multiple factors contributing to RC failure, but we do not yet have a clear understanding how these factors interact over development to affect RC. First, there is scant neurobiological understanding of listening comprehension and word recognition development (the so called Simple View of RC) as related to RC, even though we have shown neurobiologically the importance of speech and print binding for predicting individual differences in reading. Second, research by us and others increasingly shows that executive function (EF) is related to RC, mostly in older readers, thus providing initial neurobiological links to RC theories that include higher order reasoning (Construction-Integration). Despite these findings, it is currently unknown how the neurocognitive correlates of EF influence RC development. The next 5 years of HD044073 thus proposes to fill these gaps in the literature by using a longitudinal design that follows children from 2nd-5th grades, first probing the foundational question of how the neurobiological correlates of word and comprehension-level processing development, across modalities, predicts 4th/5th grade RC outcome (Aim 1). Then, we focus on the role that EF plays across RC development (Aim 2). Such knowledge may reveal the importance and role of EF in the transition from learning-to-read (word recognition emphasis) to reading-to-learn (RC emphasis). Our multimodal neuroimaging and behavioral measures together enable a unique window into neurocognitive systems across RC development, and have the potential for moving forward RC theoretical models and providing insights into why some continue (or sometimes begin) to struggle to read as they get older. In particular, using neuroimaging to capture changes in language networks, thus mapping of the Simple View into measurable patterns of integration and changing connectivity in the brain, will allow us to move toward causal brain based accounts of the powerful but poorly understood link between spoken and written language. Understanding how these skills integrate neurobiologically over RC development (and the role of EF in guiding integration) may hold some answers about targets for early intervention and prevention, especially for older poor readers who typically have both lower and higher-level deficits. Ultimately, this line of work may guide the development of more tailored treatments at more optimal time points, and provide a clearer understanding of how to identify and treat RC deficits (or risk factors/precursors thereof) prior to 4th grade. In summary, we seek to provide a fine grained study of the neurobiological correlates of RC development to understand more about how the transition between critical reading stages happens. The overarching long range goal is to treat RC failure before it impedes school learning. Such work could have wide-ranging implications and public health importance."
"9297334","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with intellectual disability often display severe destructive behaviors (e.g., aggression, self- injurious behavior) that pose significant risks to self or others and represent overwhelming barriers to community integration. These destructive behaviors are often treated with behavioral interventions derived from a functional analysis (FA), which is used to identify the environmental antecedents and consequences that occasion and reinforce the target response. One treatment that is inexorably linked to FA is called functional communication training (FCT), which involves extinction of destructive behavior and reinforcement of an alternative communication response with the consequence that previously reinforced destructive behavior. Results from epidemiological studies and meta analyses indicate that interventions based on an FA, like FCT, typically reduce problem behavior by 90% or more and are much more effective than other behavioral treatments. Despite these impressive findings, FCT interventions reported in the literature have typically been developed and evaluated by highly trained experts in tightly controlled research settings, and treatment effectiveness has not been established under more routine conditions. In addition, when attempts have been made to increase the practicality and ease of implementation of FCT for use by parents and other caregivers, treatment efficacy was markedly reduced in about 1/2 of cases and led to more intrusive procedures, such as punishment.1 The current project aims to address these limitations of FCT by (a) demonstrating the effectiveness of a simple and efficient empirical assessment for selecting the most appropriate FCT response; and (b) showing that by bringing the FCT response under the control of discriminative stimuli that are separate and distinct from those controlling destructive behavio using multiple schedules will (1) facilitate tranfer of treatment effects to routine caregivers and settings, (2) prevent resurgence of destructive behavior during periods when the FCT response does not produce reinforcement, and (3) prevent the need to add a punishment component to the FCT treatment package in order to sustain maximum treatment efficacy under routine conditions."
"9340246","PROJECT SUMMARY  Most quiescent and differentiated mammalian cells assemble primary cilia, antenna-like organelles that emanate from the cell surface and sense extracellular cues and growth factors. Failure to assemble and maintain normal primary cilia and centrosomes leads to developmental defects and ciliopathies. Ciliogenesis begins when the maternal centriole matures and acquires a new function as basal body, recruiting vesicles that build the ciliary membrane and allow fusion with the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, the details of this remarkable transformation remain a mystery. For example, it is not known how centrioles mature to basal bodies and how the basal body recruits vesicles needed to build the primary cilium in a manner that is coordinated with microtubule growth and axoneme elongation. Indeed, the key steps that control the early stages of cilium assembly are not well understood.  Our central hypothesis states that key controls govern initiation of basal body formation and recruitment of vesicles required for cilium assembly and that these transitions critically depend on the function of a network of proteins at distal ends of basal bodies. In this proposal, we will investigate the function of early ciliogenesis regulators, and in particular, Talpid3, a protein required for ciliogenesis. We propose that Talpid3 is required to promote cilium assembly through basal body maturation and recruitment of proteins required for assembly of ciliary vesicles and will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In the first Aim, we will test a role for Talpid3 in the specification of mother centriole identity and basal body assembly by combining structure- function analyses with use of knock-out cells and loss-of-function mutants. The function of Talpid3 remains unknown, and in Aim 2, we will examine the function of Talpid3 in cilium assembly and the impact of mutations in the human gene, which result in a ciliopathy, Joubert Syndrome, using human cells and zebrafish. We have shown that loss of Talpid3 leads to defects in centriole length and assembly of distal appendages required to recruit ciliary vesicles. Using cells carrying loss-of-function and Joubert Syndrome mutations, we will explore interactions with other distal centriolar proteins and link their function to the mechanistic roles of Talpid3 in distal appendage assembly, centriole length control, ciliary vesicle recruitment, and ciliogenesis. In the final Aim, we will perform proteomic and functional siRNA screens to identify additional regulators of early ciliogenesis, allowing us to uncover the network of proteins that interact with Talpid3 to build distal appendages and anchor vesicles needed to build the cilium. Using a combination of state-of-the art imaging and cell biology, directed siRNA screens, biochemistry, and human mutation data, we will begin to link genes and mechanisms that underlie early ciliogenesis with processes that are deficient in human disease. Our studies will also unravel fundamental mechanisms that specify basal body identity during the early stages of ciliogenesis."
"9303351","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of mutations in the GJB2 gene encoding connexin26 (Cx26) in sensorineural deafness underscores the critical importance of this protein in cochlear function. Cxs, uniquely among ion channels, have dual functional roles, as intercellular, gap junction (GJ) channels, which mediate direct electrical and chemical communication between cells, and as undocked hemichannels (HCs), which mediate signaling across the plasma membrane. Despite a wealth of information obtained from studies of null mutations, the role of Cx26 in the cochlear sensory epithelium remains poorly understood. This is due, in part, to the fact that all functions for Cx26, including GJ- and HC-mediated, are abolished precluding assessment of GJ vs HC contributions as well as limiting investigation of mechanisms underlying cellular dysfunction. This proposal focuses on a growing number of functional variants of Cx26 that also cause sensorineural deafness, with hearing loss accompanied by neoplastic and infectious cutaneous manifestations resulting in their classification in one of several syndromes such as keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID), a particularly severe affliction. KID mutants exhibit differential effects on Cx GJ channel and HC function and our studies are uncovering different aberrant functional properties that appear to underlie the notable phenotypic differences among patients. In this proposal, we build on our initial characterizations, investigating additional aberrant characteristics to gain insights into mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, genotype-phenotype associations as well as channel structure-function relationships pertaining to Cx channel permeation, gating and regulation. The common association of KID mutants with the aqueous pore suggests altered permeability characteristics are principal contributors to disease and we examine effects on permeability to Ca2+ and ATP, known key signaling molecules in the cochlea. Purinergic signaling, in particular, plays a prominent role in cochlear function and we investigate how KID mutants affect HC-mediated ATP release and subsequent signaling, teasing out GJ- and HC mediated components. We examine ATP signaling, first in exogenous expression systems, which permits quantification due to defined Cx expression and simple coupling geometries, but extend studies to native cells using cochlear explant cultures. Using a Tet-On inducible expression system, we will introduce KID mutants into cochlear supporting cells and examine effects on cell function, purinergic signaling and possible impact on hair cell survival. Finally, we use our extensive knowledge of GJ and HC structure/function and propose to generate variants of Cx26 specifically lacking function as a HC (Cx26-HC) without compromising biophysical properties of the GJ channel and conversely lacking function as a GJ channel (Cx26-GJ). Given the absence of Cx-specific blockers, these reagents would provide a unique means of unequivocally assessing contributions of GJ channels and HCs to cochlear function. Overall, we view that this work will have a major impact in understanding Cx-mediated hearing loss as well as a growing list of disorders in which aberrant Cx channels underlie tissue dysfunction."

"9273275","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, adolescent females are at highest risk for sexual HIV transmission, but yet also at risk for unwanted pregnancies. Sub-Saharan African adolescents utilize a range of contraceptives to prevent pregnancy. However, hormonal contraceptives have been implicated in increasing HIV risk in women. Contraceptives could influence HIV transmission by mediating effects on the levels and/or susceptibility of HIV target cells in the genital mucosa. Contraceptives might mechanistically mediate these HIV target cell changes by impacting the bacterial ecosystem (microbiome) at the vaginal mucosa. This study will be the first to evaluate the effects of contraception on two aspects of South African adolescent female genital tract that may render them at increased risk of HIV: genital HIV target cell susceptibility, and the genital microbiome. There are currently multiple available options for effective, reversible contraception in the public sector of South Africa (SA), and three of these will be assessed in this proposal. Norethisterone oenanthate (Net-En) is a long-acting injectable progestin used commonly in sub Saharan Africa. The other contraceptives contain both estrogen and progestin, and include combination oral contraceptives (COCPs) which need to be taken daily, and the Combined Contraceptive Vaginal Ring (CCVR), which is inserted into the vagina every 28 days. There is some evidence that the estrogen component may provide a protective benefit for HIV acquisition. This study will evaluate the hypothesis that in SA adolescent women, progestin-only contraceptives result in a skewed vaginal microbiome that leads to an increase in vaginal HIV target cell levels and susceptibility, compared to combination contraceptives. To address our hypotheses we will enroll 150 HIV-negative SA adolescents between the ages of 16 and 17 years from a separate randomized controlled trial of Net-En, COCPs, and CCVRs. Samples will be collected and evaluated at baseline for genital tract protein and gene expression, the phenotype/activation state of T cells from cervical cytobrush samples (by flow cytometry), and the genital microbiome (Aim 1). The young women will then be randomized to a contraceptive method, and will be followed longitudinally for 8 months. After 4 months, all participants will have their contraceptive method randomly switched. Aim 2 will evaluate the effect of contraceptives on the genital tract protein and gene expression, as well as evaluate the phenotype/activation state of T cells. Aim 3 will evaluate the vaginal microbiome during contraceptive usage utilizing 16S and metagenomic deep sequencing, and evaluate the findings from these aims in a cervical explant culture model. The studies outlined here may uncover why African adolescents are so disproportionately affected by HIV and has the potential to dramatically impact how contraception is administered to adolescents in developing countries to reduce HIV acquisition while allowing effective and safe family planning."
"9285689","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol and tobacco use disorders are serious public health problems, but only a small number of medications are approved for treatment of either disorder. There is a pressing need to identify new neurotransmitter targets for medication development. There is clear preclinical and emerging clinical evidence that the glutamate (Glu) system plays a central role in development and maintenance of regular alcohol and nicotine use, withdrawal and reinstatement after a period of abstinence. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor, type 5 (mGluR5). This study will examine the mGluR5 receptor in persons with alcohol use disorder (AUD) compared with age-matched healthy controls (HC) and persons with tobacco use disorder (TUD); it also will clarify the effects of smoking and TUD in the AUD population. Positron emission tomography (PET), using the specific mGluR5 radioligand [18F]FPEB, will quantify mGluR5 binding potential (BPND), a PET-derived measure that relates to receptor availability and density. Specifically, aim 1 will compare mGluR5 BPND in non-treatment seeking AUD (N=80) versus HC participants (N=40). Additionally, among AUD subjects, smokers (AUD+TUD; N=40) will be compared with nonsmokers (AUD only; N=40) (aim 2), and TUD only participants (N=40) will be compared with AUD+TUD (N=40) and HC participants (N=40) (aim 3). All participants will complete standardized assessment procedures to characterize alcohol and tobacco use history. Eligible AUD participants will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and complete a three day, unmedicated alcohol detoxification; smokers will maintain their usual quantity/frequency of cigarette use; measures of alcohol withdrawal and craving as well as mood will be obtained. On day 4, AUD subjects complete PET measurement of mGluR5 BPND. On day 5, AUD subjects participate in an alcohol-motivated progressive ratio procedure to quantify extent of responding for and consumption of alcohol. In addition to the between-group comparisons, we will examine relationships between [18F]FPEB BPND and CRU measures of alcohol withdrawal and craving (aim 4), amount of alcohol-motivated responding (aim 5), as well as baseline assessment measures of amount and frequency of alcohol and tobacco use (aim 6). To date, therapeutic benefit of clinically approved or investigational AUD medications has been modest. However, there are multiple lines of evidence indicating that the mGluR5 site is highly sensitive in animal models, and shows promise as a target for treatment. This proposal will be the first to characterize mGluR5 in living humans with AUD, to clarify the modulating role of tobacco use in this population and to examine the relationship of mGluR5 to key behavioral measures of alcohol and tobacco use. Importantly, mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) are in development by several drug companies and are undergoing clinical trials for several psychiatric diseases. This proposed study will set the stage for future research to directly test the therapeutic effects of mGluR5 NAMs on brain mGluR5 occupancy and behavioral outcomes in AUD clinical population."
"9254201","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           This pilot study tests the feasibility of an emotion regulation training, Manage Emotions to Reduce Aggression (MERA), to decrease aggression in Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and improve PTSD treatment outcomes. Background: Aggression is common among Veterans with PTSD and can lead to devastating interpersonal and societal consequences, such as incarceration, family violence, and disruption of treatment-facilitating factors, such as social support. Veterans with PTSD primarily engage in impulsive aggression (emotional, reactive, and uncontrolled) rather than premeditated aggression (deliberate, instrumental, and planned). Emotion dysregulation, or underdeveloped skills in emotional awareness, emotional acceptance, behavioral control, and/or content-appropriate regulation strategies, fully mediates the relationship between PTSD severity and impulsive aggression in Veterans. Additionally, fear of anxiety predicts which Veterans failed to complete PTSD evidence-based psychotherapy. Emotion regulation appears to influence both aggression and treatment outcomes in Veterans with PTSD; thus, this proposed study targets emotion regulation with the goal of reducing impulsive aggression and preparing Veterans for PTSD evidence-based psychotherapy. Research Plan: Our goal is to test the feasibility of an innovative emotion regulation training, MERA, with an open trial of 20 Afghanistan and Iraq Veterans with PTSD and impulsive aggression. MERA is provided in a 3-session condensed time frame to address logistical barriers faced by younger Veterans who have careers, school, and families that compete with treatment time. The training is delivered in a group format and incorporates emotion education, cognitive-behavioral and acceptance-based skills training, and information about what emotional experiences to expect from PTSD treatments. Veterans will complete emotion regulation and aggression measures weekly. The study's feasibility will be examined using Veterans' judgments of MERA, in addition to recruitment (number of referrals versus those who opt-out), enrollment (proportion screened versus enrolled), initiation (attend 1 session), and completion (attend all 3 sessions) rates. MERA's preliminary effectiveness will be estimated with pre- to 1-month post training changes in aggression and emotion regulation. We predict Veterans who complete MERA will have reductions in IA and emotion dysregulation. Finally, rates of PTSD evidence-based psychotherapy initiation (attend 1 session), engagement (attend at least 2 sessions), and completion (therapist indicates termination is appropriate) will be examined 6 months post MERA. We predict Veterans who complete MERA will initiate, engage, and complete PTSD evidence-based psychotherapies at a greater rate than Veterans who do not complete MERA. Significance: This study supports 2 Veterans Affairs missions: reduce aggression and increase PTSD treatment initiation. First, PTSD is one of the most commonly occurring and costly psychiatric conditions among Veterans, and Veterans with PTSD are more likely to engage in aggressive behavior than civilians with PTSD. Reducing aggression is a critical need for Veterans, their families, and society to reduce interpersonal violence, incarceration, and injury. Secondly, there are effective treatments that have been shown to reduce PTSD symptoms, yet few Veterans with PTSD receive PTSD evidence-based psychotherapies. One reason for the low rate of treatment initiation may be that Veterans fear they will not be able to control their emotional responses when they begin treatment. Equipping Veterans with emotion regulation skills and knowledge about PTSD treatments may help them initiate, complete, and benefit from PTSD evidence-based psychotherapies."
"9321985","ABSTRACT - Project 5 ? Retention-Early Warning Project This project builds on two lines of inquiry that are rarely integrated. First, we draw on prior research that has investigated the impact of attrition in longitudinal studies of aging. Second, we incorporate research that has probed the impact of ?early warning? signs for later life health decline. Putting these together, we submit that those lost to attrition over time are likely to have worse cross-time health profiles compared to continuing participants (CP). The reasons for predicting greater decline among attriters are that: (a) they had more extensive profiles of early warning markers at baseline ? something we demonstrate with preliminary studies, and (b) these starting vulnerabilities are expected to increase their risk for subsequent stress exposures as well as worsening psychosocial profiles across time, the combination of which we hypothesize will account for their greater mental and physical health decline over time compared to continuing participants (CP) in MIDUS. To examine these issues, our specific aims are to: (1) locate and reinstate attriters from MIDUS 2 and 3 using proven survey methods; (2) characterize longitudinal change in physical (including biomarkers) and mental health between attriters and CP; and (3) test hypotheses about early warning vulnerabilities, subsequent stress exposures, and worsening psychosocial profiles to account for differences in cross-time health between attriters and CP. These aims will be accomplished by using high incentives and state of the art methods for tracking and contacting attriters who will be given a condensed battery of psychosocial, cognitive, and health assessments via personal home visits. We have excellent current contact information on 85% of MIDUS attriters and expect to collect new data from about 20% (500?600 individuals) of the full attrition sample. Our work stands in contrast to other longitudinal aging studies, which have concluded (using multiple imputation methods) that attrition is not biasing obtained findings. We submit that these assertions may be problematic when those lost to attrition are not missing at random, the case for which we seek to test. To sharpen understanding of these differing accounts, we will examine findings on cross-time health from reinstated attriters to CP to alternative findings derived from multiple imputation methods that adjust for attrition using observed baseline data. We predict that multiple imputation will under-represent the magnitude of health decline observed among reinstated attriters. Further, we will explore an alternative imputation strategy that uses newly collected data on reinstated attriters to multiply impute values for attriters not reinstated. All such comparisons will be preceded by analyses to assess the degree to which the 20% reinstated attriters are representative of all attriters, and if necessary, correct for bias between the 20% and the 80%. To facilitate this widened range of analyses, the project now includes two biostatisticians with expertise in missing data methodologies in longitudinal research."
"9312307","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The spatial organization of chromosomes plays important roles in regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability. Detailed knowledge of the spatial arrangements of chromosomes will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the human genome, and will provide insights into the genetic basis of human disease. We have developed powerful molecular and genomic technologies to probe the three-dimensional structure of chromosomes. These methods allow the analysis of chromosome folding through the comprehensive analysis of long-range chromosomal interactions between widely separated functional elements, such as promoters and enhancers. We have applied these technologies to human cells during cell division and discovered that chromosomes can be organized in two fundamentally distinct three- dimensional structures: one structure, observed in interphase cells, is composed of a hierarchy of different types of chromosomal domains and chromatin loops. This structure is dedicated to gene regulation. A second structure is observed in mitotic cells, when chromosomes become condensed in preparation of cell division. We discovered that this structure is best described as a linearly organized longitudinally compressed array of consecutive chromatin loops. Here we propose to first study these two distinct chromosome conformations in more detail, and then to study the genomic elements and mechanisms cells employ to build each structure. Our proposed studies will lead to insights into the finer-scale organization of chromosomes and the intricate folding pathways that connect interphase and mitotic chromosome structures."

"9312862","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Blood pressure (BP) control among hypertensive patients reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Yet, BP is controlled at only 56% of hypertension-related office visits. Worse control of BP among Blacks is a key contributor to racial disparities in cardiovascular disease. The Seventh Joint National Committee on the Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VII) address hypertension management. While clinician adoption of JNC VII guidelines has steadily improved relevant to initiation of BP treatment and medication selection, clinicians have largely failed to implement the JNC recommendation for monthly visits for patients with uncontrolled BP. This translational gap represents a potential opportunity to improve suboptimal BP control while also addressing disparities in BP control. The primary aim of this research project is to improve clinician implementation of the JNC guideline for monthly visits for hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP. Our secondary aim is improved BP control. We propose to accomplish these aims using a theoretically informed and evidence-based multimodal quality improvement intervention implemented within the Clinical Directors Network, a practice based research network of federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Our central hypothesis is that targeting clinician awareness, attitudes, skills and routines relevant to this recommendation will improve patient visit frequency. Our secondary hypothesis is that improving visit frequency will improve BP control. We propose to rigorously test these important hypotheses through a pragmatic randomized trial that uses a stepped wedge phase-in of the intervention in participating FQHCs. We will assess visit frequency and BP through abstraction of data from electronic medical records of participating practices.  Our specific aims are:  Aim 1: To implement the JNC recommendation for monthly visits for hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP using a theoretically-informed, empirically grounded, multimodal QI intervention.  Aim 2: To improve BP control and reduce disparity in BP through implementation of monthly visits.  Aim 3: To assess potential mediators and moderators of the intervention. Findings have national implications for best strategies for effective implementation of this guideline. If successful, implementation of monthly visits represents a simple and feasible means for improving BP control, and potentially, for addressing racial disparities in BP control. To our knowledge, this project will be the first randomized trial of implementation of monthly visits to improve BP. Our team, which includes experts in hypertension, pragmatic trials, FQHC research, and clinician-patient communication, is well suited to undertake this study and disseminate findings through formal and informal networks."
"9297204","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morbidity and mortality of human newborns remain significant public health concerns. Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) cause invasive infections such as pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis in human newborns. Moreover, GBS are a significant cause of in utero infections leading to preterm births and stillbirths. We recently showed that the pluripotent toxin important for GBS infections is an ornithine rhamnolipid pigment also known as granadaene. The pigment/lipid toxin is cytotoxic to a number of host cells and induces a proinflammatory immune response. The objective of this proposal is to understand how the pigment causes host cell lysis and induces an immune response and to also define how pigment mediated activation of host cells affects GBS colonization and infection-associated preterm births."
"9330717","ABSTRACT The Annual Course on Principles of STD and HIV Research was first held in 1993 to provide an intensive overview of skills needed to pursue a research career in the field of STD/HIV. Since then, approximately 2025 trainees have attended the course, including many women and racial/ethnic minority students. Increasingly, an interdisciplinary approach has become essential in designing studies and in obtaining funding for STD/HIV research. Establishing familiarity with research perspectives outside one's own discipline provides young investigators with tools for continued interdisciplinary learning and collaboration, and for maintaining a broad scope of investigative possibilities. This course offers a unique opportunity for state-of-the-art introductory training in behavioral, clinical, epidemiologic, statistical, implementation, and basic science research by providing a practically oriented overview of language and skills common to these broad disciplines. Course duration is limited to two weeks to encourage individuals who are establishing active research careers and allow those who reside outside of the local area to attend. In addition, an on-line version of the course has been developed to expand our reach to international sites for asynchronous group learning. Course objectives are to: 1) Introduce young investigators to critical research areas and emerging questions in the field of STD/HIV; 2) Familiarize investigators with research techniques and tools needed to conduct scientifically and ethically sound studies, including study design, experimental approach, development of instruments for data collection, human subjects considerations, and data analysis; 3) Teach trainees the fundamentals of different disciplines involved in STD/HIV research in order to foster research collaborations; and 4) Discuss strategies for successfully finding a mentor, competing for research funds and publishing one's work. The course integrates six tracks: 1) Essentials of STD/HIV interdisciplinary research; 2) Clinical and epidemiologic aspects of infections; 3) Pathogenesis of specific infections; 4) Behavioral research methods and research in special populations; 5) Implementation Science and health economics; and 6) Strategies for successful and ethical research. The course proceedings are disseminated on a participant website with access restricted to registered students. The course website contains learning objectives, speakers' slides, audio recordings of lectures, and key references."
"9294910","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide, there were over 6,000 new HIV infections a day in 2010 and almost half were among women. Injectable contraceptives have been associated with a 2-4 fold increased risk of HIV acquisition in some observational studies. Yet, these injectable progestin's, like Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA]), are the second most common contraceptive method used by women worldwide. Animal data support the increased HIV risk. Prospective clinical evidence is lacking. If injectable contraceptives increase HIV susceptibility, and if heterosexual women at high-risk for HIV infection desire to continue injectable contraception use, effective HIV prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) become even more important. For women at high risk of HIV infection, PrEP with daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) can substantially reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. In July 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved TDF/FTC for PrEP and emphasized that effectiveness is strongly correlated with drug concentrations. Individuals with lower than expected drug concentrations had higher HIV seroconversion rates. While adherence to daily TDF/FTC is thought to explain the differences in plasma concentrations, our preliminary data indicate that sex steroid hormones may also contribute to lower antiretroviral concentrations and increase HIV susceptibility. Given these findings, we hypothesize that the injectable contraceptive, MPA, increases HIV susceptibility through inducing immune activation and increasing HIV co-receptor expression on genital tract target cells. Further, we hypothesize that MPA decreases effective TDF/FTC concentrations through increased renal clearance secondary to increased glomerular filtration and/or up-regulation of progesterone-sensitive drug transporters on CD4+T and kidney cells, as well as alteration of drug phosphorylation and activation in CD4+T cells. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine the effect of MPA on HIV susceptibility in blood, cervical tissue, and cervicovaginal fluid; and (2) quantify the impact of MPA on TDF/FTC in vivo pharmacokinetics and, secondarily, in vitro pharmacodynamics in blood, cervical tissue, and cervicovaginal fluid. There is an urgent need to address this dilemma regarding injectable contraceptives in women at risk for HIV infection. Does the use of injectable MPA, a highly effective and inexpensive birth control option, increase HIV acquisition risk and diminish the HIV protective effects of TDF/FTC PrEP? This information is needed to inform women's contraceptive choice, especially among those at high risk of HIV."

"9485621","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated protein in human cancers. Clinical studies of breast cancer have suggested that the type of p53 mutation can be linked to cancer prognosis, response to drug treatment, and patient survival. It is thus crucial to understand the molecular basis of p53 inactivation by various types of mutations, so as to understand the biological consequences and assess potential cancer intervention strategies. This project contributes to this important goal by determining the structural and functional mechanisms of p53 inactivation by cancer mutants in its transactivation domain (TAD). Intriguingly, p53-TAD is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). Its properties are governed by a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations that does not lend itself to description using traditional methods that are geared toward describing a coherent set of similar structures. Reliable atomistic simulations have an important and transformative role to play in terms of describing IDP ensembles and their interactions. At the same time, the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of IDPs like p53-TAD also present important challenges that push the limit of the protein force field accuracy and conformational sampling capability. In this project, we wil leverage our extensive experience and recent contributions in developing advanced techniques for atomistic simulation of IDPs and pursue two parallel specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop novel multi-scale enhanced sampling techniques for efficient and accurate atomistic simulations of IDP ensembles and their interaction. In Aim 2, we will integrate these advanced simulation techniques with NMR and other biophysical experiments to determine the structural and functional consequences of p53-TAD cancer mutations. Specifically, we will test a novel hypothesis that TAD cancer mutations can modulate unbound conformational ensembles, perturb the balance between p53 binding to negative regulator MDM2 and the general transcriptional co-activator CBP, and further alter how this balance is regulated by multisite phosphorylation of p53-TAD. Successful completion of this project will provide cutting-edge computational tools for de novo simulation of protein conformational equilibria and transitions. The proposed research also represents the first systematic study of the biophysical basis of how disease mutants affect the structure-function relationship of p53-TAD, and provides a paradigm for understanding many other IDPs that are key components of cellular regulatory networks and over-represented in major disease pathways."
"9313917","ABSTRACT Type 2 diabetes is a serious and costly disease that impacts at least 20 million people in the United States, with chronic complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular and microvascular disease. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized the field of complex disease genetics in recent years, where intense efforts have been successful in discovering key genetic variants robustly associated with type 2 diabetes. However, GWAS only reports genomic signals associated with a given trait and not necessarily the precise localization of culprit genes. As such, over the past ten years, GWAS did not strictly represent a decade of gene target discovery, rather it was simply a decade of signal discovery. One clear example of this is highlighted by the recent progress in characterizing the FTO locus in the related trait of obesity. The GWAS signal that resides within an intronic region of FTO has in fact been recently shown to primarily influence the expression of the IRX3 and IRX5 genes nearby rather than the ?host? gene itself, suggesting that this variant is in an enhancer embedded in one gene but influencing the expression of others. So a key question is: how often is this the case with type 2 diabetes association signals? Indeed, we have already addressed the most significant GWAS finding in type 2 diabetes reported to date, namely genetic variation within the transcription factor 7?like 2 (TCF7L2) gene, which the P.I. on this application first described in 2006. Given that the type 2 diabetes genetics community widely consider the T allele of the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7903146, within TCF7L2 to be the causal variant at this locus, we utilized chromatin conformation capture and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing techniques to target this specific genomic region. As a consequence, we have compelling evidence that the actual culprit gene at this locus is in fact ?acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family, member 5? (ACSL5). Given we already have a dedicated infrastructure in place funded by the Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia to conduct such ?variant to gene mapping? efforts, our team is poised to determine how additional recently uncovered type 2 diabetes GWAS-implicated loci affect the expression and function of specific genes through the use key cutting-edge molecular biology approaches. The application of ?3D Genomics? based techniques will aid in the pinpointing of the causal gene(s) at ten of the type 2 diabetes GWAS signals, where the ?credible set? of SNPs is no more than ten variants i.e. a number of loci have already been distilled down through extensive genetic mapping efforts to a manageable shortlist of candidate variants, of which one must be causal. As such, these recently published lists of SNPs represent a workable number of variants in order to both determine the causal gene(s) at each locus and to demonstrate the generalizability of our approach. Only by uncovering the correct functional context of these genetic variants and understanding how they operate can we truly translate these high value GWAS reports in to meaningful benefits for patient care."
"9351177","Project Summary Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract are common birth defects. These defects are a significant public health problem affecting Americans and further, may go undetected but increase the risk of chronic diseases later in life. Since its inception, the GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) has provided a framework and repository for extensive expression data to provide a molecular anatomy of genitourinary development in the mouse with the long-term goal to harness and share our knowledge of urogenital development to forge innovative new approaches to treat disease. This work has advanced our understanding of subpopulations and patterning events in the developing nephron, lower urinary tract, and gonads. A deep understanding of the molecular drivers of kidney formation serves to inform current efforts in the field to create kidney organoids for therapeutic and disease studies. We propose to operate a GUDMAP Database that will facilitate a coordinated, focused, adaptive and interactive program of research by several groups, yielding results faster than a static collection of independent research projects. Coordination across the research consortium demands the ability to rapidly integrate new research projects, communicate results, and share knowledge and data across the consortium. Our work will generate connections between mouse and human data to link function to disease and thus identify potential causal and therapeutic targets. By providing tools to coalesce and link disparate datasets, we will provide efficient and easy methods to pose questions and further research. The GUDMAP Database will conduct meta- analysis to produce both informative ways to use the tools we build, and propose new testable hypotheses regarding urogenital development and disease. Our proposed GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) Database that will: 1) create organizational structure and processes that will enable seamless and frequent communication and collaboration between GUDMAP researchers, the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the broader research community; 2) create a highly usable database that will empower changing collections of researchers to rapidly upload, organize, and search heterogeneous data types; 3) build a comprehensive toolkit for data annotation, curation, analysis, visualization, and cross validation; 4) broaden the research community and create a framework for targeted shorter term research results by establishing an opportunity pool program; 5) disseminate consortium resources to the wider research community. In total, the impact of these elements of the GUDMAP will accelerate the rate of discovery within the consortium and the broader community."
"9260714","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) caused by blast effects of explosive devices is the signature injury of service members deployed to combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Resultant persistent postconcussive symptoms (PCS), such as impairment of memory and concentration, irritability, mood instability, and sleep disturbances, frequently have disabling personal, professional and domestic consequences. In addition to these immediate consequences, repetitive mTBI may initiate processes leading to neurodegeneration and dementia.  This application is a resubmission of a proposal to continue a currently funded VA RR&D Merit Review: B77421, Mild TBI and Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration. In the current funding period, we have made substantial progress in 1) identifying objective structural and functional neuroimaging biomarkers that characterize the clinical phenotype of blast-induced mTBI and distinguish mTBI from combat trauma posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 2) identifying objective impairment of cognitive function in mTBI Veterans using our refined neuropsychological assessment battery, 3) identifying a potential mTBI-specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker, and 4) identifying unanticipated CSF neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory biomarkers of deployment independent of presence or absence of mTBI. We have integrated neuroimaging, cognitive, and biomarker findings into a consistent model of regional brain dysfunction in repetitive blast mTBI. Goals of this continuation proposal are to determine whether cognitive performance is associated with CSF biomarkers of and/or genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative dementia, and to determine whether neuroimaging and CSF biomarker abnormalities are transient, static, or progressive. We also propose three new clinical assessments: in-theater sleep history, sleep/activity monitoring via Actigraphy, and balance/vestibular function testing; and two additional neuroimaging analyses: white matter tractography and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) for detection of microhemorrhages.  Specific Objective 1: To continue characterizing longitudinally the clinical (neurocognitive, neurologic, behavioral) and structural/functional neuroimaging characteristics of disrupted cerebellar-thalamic- frontoparietal cortical function in OIF/OEF/OND Veterans with repetitive blast trauma mTBI.  Specific Objective 2: To determine if OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with repetitive mTBI exhibit CSF biomarker changes associated with the onset and progression of neurodegenerative dementing disorders, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Specific Objective 3: To determine the effects of genetic risk factors for neurodegeneration (apolipoprotein E [APOE] polymorphisms and microtubule associated protein tau [MAPT] subhaplotypes) on both clinical characteristics and CSF biomarkers in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with repetitive mTBI.  This proposal addresses the RR&D priority areas of Validation and Refinement of Diagnostic Imaging Technology and Innovative Approaches to Late or Long-Term Consequences of TBI. VHA faces a huge burden of providing primary medical, rehabilitative, mental health and long term care to this vulnerable population. Identification of objective neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers of mTBI and clarification of the long- term risks of neurodegenerative dementias in mTBI will: improve diagnosis of mTBI and ability to monitor response to potential treatments; provide targets for improving Veterans' health care; and allow appropriate allocation of limited VHA resources. Successful completion of the proposed research has a high likelihood of yielding both short-term and long-term clinical impacts.

"8892226","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2-5 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness, stroke and even death. Unfortunately, therapy for AF is limited. One of the major drawbacks in developing better therapy for AF is that our understanding of what causes AF (its 'mechanisms') is not clear. This renewal project builds on discoveries by this group in the last funding period that human AF is not random or chaotic, but instead is often maintained (driven) by a small number of 'sources' in the form of rotors (akin to electrical spinning tops) or focal beats, that are stable over time. Sources may lie in regions of the heart (the atria, or top chambers) that are different in each patient, often away from where physicians typically target cautery therapy (ablation). In this project, we will study 1) the effectiveness of ablation of rotos and focal sources alone (that drive AF); 2) how ablation alters rotors, trigger sites near the pulmonary veins, or other mechanisms; 3) the mechanisms for AF that may recur in some patients after ablation. We will pursue these aims by recording detailed maps of AF and studying several major possible mechanisms for AF in each subject. These studies will include detailed recordings of atrial tissue function, mathematical analyses of AF, detailed follow-up of patients after ablation and repeat study in patients in whom AF may recur. The patient-specific analyses that we will perform in this project will be among the most detailed and clinically-relevant in the field, and will be used to understand the disease and to help design better therapy. This project is significant because it will define the success of therapy at recently discovered novel mechanisms for AF and, in cases when such therapy is unsuccessful, we will study why. In this way, we will develop an approach to better define the causes (mechanisms) for AF in each patient. This project will be performed in patients with AF during electrophysiologic study, so that its results can be translated directly to practice. This approach may also allow a more rational general approach to drug development and gene therapy."
"9287415","Project Summary  Auditory Verbal Hallucinations (AVH) occur in the context of a range of mental health conditions as well as in individuals who are otherwise considered healthy. AVH lead to significant distress, impairment, and need for care in some, but not others. The RDoC framework is ideally suited to better understand the phenomenology of AVH as they may be part of a continuum of psychotic experience ranging from ?normal? to pathological. Building on the principles of the RDoC framework, the proposed project focuses on AVH as part of the broader construct of Auditory Perception and leverages an integrative multi-method paradigm leveraging measures from two RDoC units of analysis: Self-Report and Behavior. Our multidisciplinary investigative team proposes to use integrated mobile data collection techniques that we have piloted extensively (Ecological Momentary Assessment for self-report and automated multi-modal sensing to capture behavior) to study AVH experience and associated behaviors, as they occur in real-time/real-place in people with and without need for care. We propose to use innovative online and community-based participant recruitment strategies that we have piloted in relevant populations to enroll a clinically diverse sample of individuals with AVH. Participants will be provided with an integrated smartphone data collection system and will actively self-report AVH experiences and associated variables as they occur in real-time using EMA. Smartphones will also passively collect multi-modal behavioral sensing data continuously. We will combine both forms of data to examine the extent to which temporal relationships between self-reported AVH and behavioral measures vary across both groups. Specifically, we aim to: evaluate whether clinical status is associated with how AVH is experienced in real- time/real-place; examine relationships between demographic, functional, and immediate social/contextual factors and AVH; and test time-varying relationships posited in a cognitive model of psychosis between AVH appraisal, affect, and behavioral response. The study will advance our understanding of the phenomenology of AVH and move us closer to understanding why some develop impairment and need for care, while others do not. Findings may help inform the subsequent development of prevention strategies for subclinical populations so they do not progress in the psychotic trajectory, as well as inform more targeted treatments for individuals who already require treatment. If successful, the project will demonstrate the utility of applying the RDoC framework and integrated methodological approach in psychosis research."

"9328798","ABSTRACT The consensus view of tight junction structure is strands are composed of claudin proteins. Some claudins are thought to form pores that allow paracellular flux while others form the seal that defines the epithelial barrier. An alternative view is that claudins form pores, but not the seal. In this model sealing claudins, i.e. those that enhance barrier function, play a regulatory role by competitively interfering with the function of pore-forming claudins. Neither model has been definitively demonstrated, which limits our ability to develop means to modulate claudin function therapeutically. It is, however, known that claudin proteins interact in both cis, i.e. within a single cell, and trans, i.e. between proteins on adjacent cells, configurations. Further, some progress has been made in defining which claudins are able to interact homo- or heterotypically. These interactions are dynamic, as tight junction protein complexes undergo continuous molecular remodeling at steady state. Specific trans-interactions between claudin extracellular domains have been implicated in both claudin anchoring and strand assembly. While the contribution of cis-interactions to strand assembly is less well defined, it is clear that disruption of claudin-2 anchoring can result in loss of claudin-2 pore function. There are, however, many gaps in these data, including detailed analysis of claudin barrier and pore properties as functions of cis- and trans-interactions. Such information would help to better understand the mechanisms of claudin function. The overall objective of this application is to define claudin protein interactions and determine how these affect claudin pore assembly and function as well as barrier development and maintenance. Such data would fill the knowledge gap, relate integration of claudin functions, and overcome a major obstacle to progress in tight junction biology. My central hypothesis is that claudin-2, a pore-forming claudin, is competitively regulated by claudin-4, a sealing claudin, via disruption of claudin-2 pores. These studies build upon both published reports and my preliminary data showing that claudin-2 and claudin-4 have distinct dynamic behaviors and differentially regulate paracellular permeability of model epithelial monolayers. My hypothesis will be tested by determining the roles of cis- and trans- interactions in claudin-2 anchoring and function and the regulation of these properties by claudin-4 (Aim 1) and by characterizing claudin protein interactions biochemically and in complex multicellular models (Aim 2). The rationale is that improved understanding of claudin pore and sealing functions will make it possible to develop pharmacologic agents that modulate barrier function. While both models of claudin function have merit, I anticipate that my studies will validate the claudin competition model of tight junction. This proposal is innovative because the novel model investigated will provide new perspective on how claudins define paracellular permeability and barrier function. The significance of this proposal is it will move tight junction biology forward and benefit human health by allowing for the creation of more targeted therapeutic treatments for human intestinal barrier dysfunction."
"9355702","Attaining effective optical modulation and readout of neuronal circuit activities has been a longstanding goal in neuroscience and is a key near-term aim of the BRAIN Initiative. Such neurotechnology is required to decipher how the brain?s electrical signals relate to perceptual, cognitive, emotional and motor functions. The idea to use light to modulate neuronal activities found its first broadly successful realization with the development of caged glutamate, but only since the use of genetically encoded (optogenetic) actuators such as channelrhodopsin, has this approach become overwhelmingly successful. The idea to use light to record electrical signals in the brain was conceptualized with the discovery of the first voltage-sensitive dyes more than half a century ago. Voltage imaging approaches have contributed much to our understanding of brain physiology, both at the cellular and systems levels, but the broad experimental use of these small molecule dyes suffers from several limitations including invasive staining procedures, pharmacological side effects, and blindness towards cellular diversity. These three limitations have been overcome by the recent invention of genetically-encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). Although in many aspects superior to classical voltage sensitive dyes, GEVIs have not yet been satisfactorily optimized and their combination with optogenetic modulation has been difficult to achieve in practice. One major obstacle is the overlap of the spectral bands of light used to activate opsin-based actuators and at the same time excite and image available GEVIs. What is required to overcome this hurdle are well performing far red GEVIs that can be orthogonally combined with blue light-activated opsin-based actuators. We propose to use novel near-infrared (NIR) phytochrome-based fluorescent proteins (FPs) to generate a new class of GEVIs that are excited and fluoresce in the NIR spectrum, building on our expertise to generate GEVIs using GFP-like FPs. We plan to combine these NIR-GEVIs with blue-light activated excitatory and inhibitory opsins, to enable an optical approach that expands classical microelectrode-based intracellular single cell current-clamp recordings to large numbers of genetically defined neurons in awake mice. Transgenic mice in which this tool can be activated via Cre-recombinase expressing driver mouse lines will be one of our key deliverables."

"9303747","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the population, with the rising incidence of cardiovascular disease contributed to by epidemic increases in the incidence of obesity and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although existing drugs are effective in acutely correcting decompensated heart failure, this continues to be associated with unacceptable rates of rehospitalization and mortality. A new drug combination that adds neprilysin inhibition to the current standard-of-care for heart failure, angiotensin receptor blockade, was approved by the FDA on the basis of extension of the life of patients with reduced cardiac output. However, the very broad action of the peptidase inhibitor in this combination theoretically could be improved, thereby reducing possible side effects and increasing therapeutic effectiveness. The specific enzyme substrate responsible for the beneficial effects of this drug is not yet clear. While it has been assumed to be natriuretic peptides, other peptides are also cleaved, many of which have potential offsetting and/or side effects. Another prominent potentially beneficial substrate of neprilysin is secretin, a peptide hormone with useful effects on cardiac contractility and ejection fraction, coronary perfusion, peripheral vascular resistance, post-cibal satiety, and glucose-sensitive incretin action. There are currently no known drugs that target the secretin receptor, providing these effects. This proposal is designed to develop appropriate assays and to screen for candidates with potential to impact this major public health problem using high throughput screening (HTS). The OBJECTIVE is to identify molecules that enhance signaling at the secretin receptor, either by acting as positive allosteric modulators of secretin action or as direct agonists of this potentially important therapeutic target. This represents a partnership between Dr. Miller, with extensive secretin receptor experience, and Dr. Sergienko, with HTS and chemical genomic expertise. There are three specific aims: (i) Primary and secondary assay implementation and optimization, (ii) HTS using cells expressing human secretin receptor and hit confirmation, and (iii) Hit validation and characterization. The primary assays will focus on intracellular cAMP responses in the CHO-SecR cell line stably expressing wild type human secretin receptor, with the assays run in both positive allosteric modulator mode in the presence of submaximal secretin stimulation and in agonist mode without exposure to secretin. During confirmation, the assays will be repeated with compound concentration- dependency evaluated and using a neuronal cell line that naturally expresses a physiologic density of secretin receptor, NG-108 cells. Parental CHO cells and a CHO cell line expressing the Gs-coupled type 2 vasopressin receptor will be studied as controls to be certain that observed responses are secretin receptor-mediated. Selectivity will be explored using other class B GPCR-expressing cells, and a survey of other signaling events, internalization, cell cytotoxicity, and proliferation will be performed. The goal will be to identify candidates with adequate activity to be tested in pre-clinical systems for proof-of-concept, and ultimately in clinical trials."
"9306757","The overall mission of this CHAVI-ID application is to define immunogens and immunization regimens that induce sustained HIV cross-protective B cell and CD4+ T cell responses in preclinical models and, thereby, guide product development strategies for a preventive human AIDS vaccine. For Focus #2, our hypothesis is that long-term humoral immunity is critically dependent on CD4+ T cells, and particularly T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and that the efficient generation of these cells is an essential and obligatory component of an effective HIV vaccine.    Nearly all licensed anti-viral vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies and the development of such antibodies is typically CD4+ T cell dependent. Therefore understanding and controlling CD4+ T cells, and Tfh cells in particular, is important for rational vaccine strategies. Focus #2 is designed to improve our knowledge of: 1) the specificity, phenotype and function of Tfh cells in HIV infection and in humans who have received licensed successful vaccines; 2) the pathways involved that lead to the induction of Tfh cells; 3) the precise Tfh signals that lead to the induction of affinity maturation and broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies; and 4) the role of HIV-specific effector CD4+ T cells in the early focal control of mucosal HIV infection. Tfh cells are also potentially extremely useful biomarkers in human vaccine clinical trials as predictors of long-term humoral immunity and antibody quality. The information gained in Focus #2 will be translated into the design of immunogens and immunization strategies in Focus #1 for evaluation in knock-in mice and NHPs. As we gather together information on optimal immunogens and immunization strategies, we will move forward with small-scale human trials with the advice and close involvement of our Vaccine Discovery Scientific Research Support Component."
"9379942","ABSTRACT With increased interest in patient-centered outcomes research and precision medicine, investigation of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) in clinical trials has emerged as a key area of study. HTE is an assessment of the degree to which the impact of an intervention varies between subgroups. Evidence from trials of selenium supplementation indicates that this is a critical area for investigation of HTE. To date, three major clinical trials of the trace element selenium (Se) as a chemopreventive agent have been completed. First, in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial, participants were supplemented with 200 µg of Se per day or matching placebo, and a statistically significant 58% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence among participants randomized to receive the selenium supplement was observed. Next, the results of the Selenium and Vitamin E Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) were published. The largest trial to date of Se for cancer prevention, SELECT demonstrated no reduction in risk of colorectal cancer among men supplemented with 200 µg/d of Se as L-selenomethionine. We have recently completed the Selenium Trial, which was the third major clinical trial of Se for chemoprevention. This was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 1535 participants received 200 µg/d of Se as selenized yeast or placebo to ascertain whether Se supplementation reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence. No differences in overall colorectal adenoma recurrence by intervention group were detected; however, subgroup analyses revealed the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). Among participants who had an advanced adenoma at baseline, there was a statistically significant reduction in adenoma recurrence for those randomized to Se as compared to placebo. However, there was also a statistically significant increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among older participants (>63 years) receiving selenium. These results identify a major research gap regarding the need for identification of individual characteristics that may contribute to HTE and thus determine whether Se supplementation elicits a beneficial or harmful effect. This is a particularly timely question given that approximately half of American adults report using dietary supplements. We propose herein to investigate several factors that may affect individual outcomes related to Se supplementation, including 1) Genetic background; 2) Intake and blood concentrations of fat-soluble antioxidants; and 3) Oxylipin profiles in response to Se supplementation. In summary, we contend that the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of Se in a given individual may be influenced by genetic background, interactions with antioxidants, and oxylipin metabolomic profiles. The findings of this study will have a direct impact on public health recommendations by identifying individual characteristics that may elicit either beneficial or harmful health effects of Se supplementation."
"9313253","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Fast-Track program is to develop a novel, stable non-aqueous glucagon formulation with an infusion pump system in closed-loop with continuous glucose monitoring, for treatment of post-bariatric surgery patients who have experienced repetitive severe postprandial hypoglycemia. This approach will provide: (a) automated or semi-automated glucagon; (b) personalized dosing that will not trigger hyperglycemia; and (c) provide a more economical treatment strategy. In this patient population, eating to correct hypoglycemia can actually trigger another subsequent hypoglycemic event, whereas glucagon acts to increase blood glucose levels without triggering excess insulin secretion. Thus there is an urgent need for improved approaches for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia to maintain health, allow optimal nutrition, and improve safety in patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) syndrome. The primary objective of the current proposal is directly relevant to the NIDDK research priorities for obesity treatment and prevention, as well as type 2 diabetes treatment. The Phase I effort of this project will develop algorithms using CGM information to trigger real-time alerts in the presence of hypoglycemia using an automated trigger algorithm that will deploy and deliver a dose of soluble glucagon from a pump, and test this proof-of-concept (POC) in a clinical setting. The Phase II effort of this program will take th optimized algorithm from Phase I into a closed-loop pump system for use in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The data generated in the project may also enable future outpatient studies in which patients can test the system in real-life situations. We propose that the resulting closed-loop glucagon (CLG) system with Xeris' glucagon in an OmniPod(r) will be a more effective treatment for PBH syndrome."
"9393136","SUMMARY Identification of the parasite genes that influence transmission, virulence and host specificity is of central interest for understanding host/parasite interactions. The central aim of this proposal is to identify the genetic basis of two such traits in Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic fluke that infects 67 million people in South America, Middle-East and Africa. We will focus on the larval stage of the parasite lifecycle in aquatic snails. Following penetration of the snail host, schistosome larvae reproduce clonally, castrating their snail host, and hundreds to tens of thousands of motile cercariae larvae are released into the water where they infect humans or rodents. Two key transmission- related traits show high levels of heritable genetic variation among parasites. First, the timing of cercarial release from the snail varies among populations and overlaps with the water contact patterns of their vertebrate hosts. Most S. mansoni populations that primarily infect humans shed cercariae larvae in late morning, while parasite populations that primarily infect rodents shed cercariae in late afternoon or night. Late shedding has evolved at least three times in S. mansoni populations. Laboratory crosses demonstrate a simple genetic basis for this trait, but the genetic architecture of late shedding is different in the three populations where it has been documented. Second, the number of cercariae larvae shed from the intermediate aquatic snail host varies ?7-fold among individual schistosome genotypes. High shedding parasites have greater potential for transmission but also castrate and kill their intermediate snails more rapidly than low shedding parasites. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that this trait responds rapidly to selection and is highly heritable. Schistosome parasites are unusual among parasites of humans because the complete lifecycle can be easily maintained in the laboratory, so genetic crosses can be staged and thousands of progeny isolated, while a complete genome sequence and a growing molecular toolkit now allows genomic and functional characterization. In preliminary work, we conducted genetic crosses between diurnal and nocturnal shedding parasites from Oman and identified a region on chr.1 that determines cercarial shedding time (LOD=6.1). In Aim 1, we will exploit the growing schistosome molecular toolkit to fine map and functionally analyze the gene(s) that determine shedding time in the Omani cross, and we will conduct additional crosses to determine the genetic basis of this trait in other parasite populations where late shedding is observed. In Aim 2, we will use RNAseq to examine rhythms in expression of nocturnal and diurnal shedding parasites from Oman across the 24 hr light/dark cycle, to investigate the metabolic pathways underlying control of cercarial release. Finally, in Aim 3, we will analyze genetic crosses between parasites showing 7-fold differences in numbers of cercariae shed from infected snails, and then fine map and functionally analyze the genes involved. We have previously used genetic linkage mapping and functional analysis to identify the mutations underlying oxamniquine resistance in S. mansoni. We anticipate that this approach will be equally powerful for identifying the genes that underlie heritable parasite traits that are critical for transmission, host specificity and virulence in this important human helminth parasite. Our genetic approach also provides a novel way to probe the biology of schistosome sporocysts, a neglected stage in the schistosome lifecycle that is key to understanding transmission from the snail to the vertebrate host."

"9211413","SUMMARY In the hematopoietic system, aging has been shown to result in dramatic changes in the clonal composition of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, a shift their developmental potential, and a degradation of their overall activity. The broad goal of this Project is to understand the mechanisms that underlie these changes with a view to enhancing their activity and reverting their behavior to a more youthful state. Through deep epigenetic profiling, we showed that aged murine HSCs exhibit marked changes in the distribution of several epigenetic markers including DNA methylation and a set of histone marks. In humans, clonal evolution in the stem cell compartment is associated with mutations in epigenetic modifiers, particularly those involved in regulating DNA methylation. These data strongly suggest that changes in epigenetic regulation are leading to some of the deficiencies in HSC function that occur with age. We hypothesize that changes in the adaptive landscape with age promote the expansion and selection of HSCs with specific characteristics, acquired either through epigenetic drift and/or through mutations in epigenetic regulators. To address these questions, we will (1) Examine the epigenetic and gene expression changes characteristic of aged HSCs. In collaboration with Projects 1 and 2 and the Bioinformatics Core, we will comprehensively map age-driven chromatin remodeling, profiling in parallel MuSCs, NSCs, and HSCs. This will allow us to identify both core? and cell type-specific aspects of chromatin and epigenetic regulation. We will also examine nucleosome occupancy and variation in repetitive elements with age in HSCs. (2) We will examine the link between mutations in epigenetic regulators and age-associated epigenetic changes, and the the ability of the environment to promote these change in mutant HSCs. We will examine epigenetic changes in aged versus Dnmt3a-KO HSCs, test the behavior of 3aKO HSCs in an aged vs. young environment, or in an inflammatory milieu. (3) We will test the impact of rejuvenation interventions on age-associated phenotypes in the hematopoietic system. We hypothesize that specific interventions may slow acquisition of age-associated HSC phenotypes. In collaboration with Projects 1 and 2 and Core B, we will examine heterochronic parabiosis, exercise, rapamycin and cyclic fasting regimens to attempt to induce rejuvenating effects on stem cells. In addition, we will specifically explore the use of DNA methylation to induce more youthful functional and molecular phenotypes. We will globally express DNMT3A using a Dox-inducible system. In addition, we will use a novel CRISPR-Cas9 system to induce DNA methylation at specific sites in order to test their importance for the HSC aging phenotype. Together, these experiments will reveal the central role of epigenetic changes associated with aging, and the impact on hematopoietic phenotypes. These studies will lay the groundwork for future attempts to modulate the local environment for stem cells to promote healthy aging."
"9302799","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and disturbances to maternal sleep adversely affect pregnancy outcomes. Maternal sleep comprises, on average, 87 days of a full term pregnancy yet little is known about the role of normal or disordered sleep on the developing fetus. Our objective is to bring measurement of the fetus, using leading edge technologies which include the recent advancement in procuring fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) data in the antepartum, to the field of pregnancy sleep research. We propose that the fetus reacts to the physiological changes that accompany normal and that disordered maternal sleep and chronic sleep disturbances have persistent effects on fetal neuromaturation. To evaluate this premise, we will a) record fetal ECG continuously during nocturnal maternal sleep at 28 weeks gestation while participants are undergoing polysomnography, and b) record fetal neuromaturation indicators during daytime maternal wakefulness at 28 and 36 weeks gestation to evaluate functioning in relation to polysomnography-detected sleep disordered breathing and self-report of habitual sleep characteristics in a sample of 130 obese pregnant women. Fetal neuromaturation measures include fetal heart rate and variation, motor activity, and somatic- cardiac coupling. We focus on obese women because, while sleep disordered breathing has been shown to exert additional independent risk to pregnancy outcomes above that conferred solely by obesity, obesity is the primary risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances in pregnancy. We predict that: 1. obstructive sleep apnea as well as milder forms of sleep disordered breathing will be contemporaneously associated with decelerations in fetal heart rate and reduction in heart rate variability during the night; 2. fetal heart rate and its derivatives will vary by maternal slep stage; 3. sleep disordered breathing will have residual effects on fetal neuromaturation that will be evident in daytime recordings during maternal wakefulness; and 4. maternal perception of sleep quality and disruption will be reflected in alterations to fetal neuromaturation between 28 and 36 weeks gestation. This project will forge an interdisciplinary team of technical and clinical expertise with long-standing independent research programs on both sleep in pregnancy and fetal neurodevelopment. Results will provide new information on the interface between maternal sleep and fetal neurological development and will have implications for clinical management of pregnancy with respect to both sleep disorders and obesity. If successful, we hope these findings will generate a new and productive avenue of inquiry regarding the potential fetal programming effects of disordered maternal sleep as well as essential understanding of the interface between maternal sleep and fetal functioning."

Although striatal responses to reward are correlated with learning and positive emotions, it remains unclear how the experience of reward in humans is causally linked to the striatum. Indeed, the striatum is buried deep inside the brain, making it inaccessible to approaches that assess causality via noninvasive brain stimulation. The goal of this project is to determine whether reward-related responses within the striatum can be influenced via stimulation applied to cortical connections. We will use a novel form of noninvasive neuromodulation, that we coined short-term transcranial alternating current stimulation (st-tACS) to prefrontal cortex while participants engage in reward tasks that reliably evoke activation within the striatum. We will address two specific aims. In our first aim, we will investigate whether st-tACS alters striatal responses to reward and pleasure associated with a simple guessing game. In our second aim, we will investigate whether st-tACS alters striatal responses to reward and learning. We hypothesize that st-tACS applied to prefrontal cortex will increase striatal responses to reward, an effect that will be tied to increased pleasure (Aim 1) and increased learning (Aim 2). These findings would therefore establish causal links between the human striatum and reward. Moreover, remote modulation of the human striatum could expand the purview of noninvasive brain stimulation approaches, potentially establishing a foundation for new therapeutic directions for psychopathologies characterized by aberrant responses to reward."
"9280354","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The explosive increase in our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of disease processes is generating exciting opportunities for well-trained scientists to explore new approaches to treatment of complex diseases, such as those related to alcohol abuse and alcoholism. The purpose of the training program ?Alcoholic Tissue Injury? is to train qualified predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows in the pathobiology of experimental alcoholic injury to develop the requisite transdisciplinary skills to explore these new opportunities. The program consists of a predoctoral program that will support six candidates who are preparing for a Ph.D. degree or a combined M.D./Ph.D degree in one of the Ph.D. programs at the Jefferson College of Biomedical Sciences (JCBS), with a specialization in basic experimental and computational aspects of Alcohol Research. In addition several trainees are drawn, through a collaborative agreement, from the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Delaware. The postdoctoral program provides specialized research training in topics relevant for alcohol-related research for up to three qualified candidates holding a Ph.D. or M.D. degree. Training faculty includes investigators with a strong track record and a commitment to alcohol research and existing or pending research grants related to alcohol research, as well as investigators with relevant expertise in other areas who are available to provide specialized training relevant to the training program. The program will build on previous successful efforts to include students and faculty from additional regional neighboring institutions. A multidisciplinary approach will emphasize concepts and research techniques of cellular and molecular biology, biophysics, biochemistry, neuroscience, immunology, and developmental biology, complemented by a unique strength in genomics and computational systems biology. The program is institutionally supported by providing financial, laboratory and core facility resources to the participating faculty to enhance the robust research environment, and by providing tuition, stipend and benefits support to the students. All trainees will be evaluated annually for their progress and their continued commitment to alcohol research, and reappointment for an additional year will depend on satisfactory progress. In addition, highly qualified candidates will be encouraged to apply for individual NRSA fellowships during their first or second year in the program. In addition to research training in the laboratory, the trainees will attend formal courses, workshops, journal club sessions and research seminars. All trainees are expected to present their research annually at the Philadelphia Area Alcohol Research Community (PAARC) Day and at national and international meetings. The program has a strong record of successful trainee achievements in research. An annual evaluation of the program goals and achievements will be carried out by the Advisory Board composed of senior alcohol researchers and experienced senior investigators not directly associated with the training program, who will advise the Program Director of potential issues of concern and recommend improvements."
"9322416","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Institute of Medicine identified sufficient sleep as one of the leading health behavior objectives for Healthy People 2020. Older (high-school-aged) adolescents are especially vulnerable to insufficient sleep as pubertal changes to sleep regulation (sleep homeostasis and circadian timing) increasingly favor alertness later into the evening and night, making an early sleep onset difficult, and these biological changes coincide with early high school start times. Thus, many high schoolers (aged 14-17 years) are faced with a conflicting biological drive to fall asleep late and a social drive to wake early for school. Approximately 80 to 90% of older adolescents in the U.S. report an average of 1 to 2 h less sleep than recommended on school nights. Sleep restriction is associated with many negative outcomes, including an increased risk for depressed mood and suicidal ideation, poor decision making, poor academic grades, and obesity. The broad objective of this project is to develop an effective, yet feasible intervention to extend school-night sleep duration of older adolescents. This application is in response to PA-11-063, which calls for ...developing and refining novel health-related behavioral interventions specifically targeting adoption or maintenance of health behavior. We propose to develop and test a feasible behavioral intervention to increase school-night sleep duration by advancing the circadian system and providing a time management plan for after-school activities in youngsters most at risk for insufficient school-night sleep - high school students who experience difficulties falling asleep at a desired early time on school nights. Study 1 (intervention development) will examine effectiveness and acceptability of two different durations (30 mins & 90 mins) of morning advancing bright light compared to room light (tested in the lab on one weekend). We will time the bright light based on new data from adolescents collected in our lab. We will use the results of Study 1 in Study 2 (proof of intervention concept), which utilizes morning bright light on one weekend spent in the lab. Weekend wake time - and the start of bright light - and bedtime will shift earlier to advance the circadian system to facilitate earlier sleep onset during the subsequent school week. A school-night time management plan will also be implemented to facilitate these earlier bedtimes. Circadian phase, sleep, neurobehavioral functioning and mood will be measured before and immediately after the intervention and compared to a control group who keeps their usual sleep schedules at home, does not come to the lab for weekend bright light treatment, and is not given any after-school time-management instruction. Long-term effectiveness will be examined after a 3-week maintenance period, during which adolescent will be instructed to follow their earlier and longer sleep schedule and use occasional bright light on weekend mornings at home. Adherence and acceptability of the intervention will be assessed. These data will provide evidence-based treatment strategies for delayed and sleep-restricted adolescents, and acceptability of and adherence to the treatment in this age group."
"9314236","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACKGROUND. Racial and ethnic disparities are pronounced in sexual and reproductive health outcomes. African American and Hispanic girls (young women of color), comprise 57% of all teen pregnancies1 and 79% of all new HIV infections2, although they represent only 26% of this population2. High rates of medical indigence, related to poverty in young women of color, limit access to quality sexual and reproductive health services3-4. Research has identified barriers that maintain health disparities in healthcare, in particular provider (e.g., lack of training and skills) and patient (e.g., perceived discrimination) level barriers as well as patient-provider communication barriers (e.g., discomfort with sexual health communication)5. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is a model of primary care that advocates for quality patient-centered care that is accessible, continuous, and comprehensive6-7. Over 50% of youth have medical homes, and those youth are less likely to have unmet needs and more likely to engage in preventative medical visits in primary care7, though little is known about sexual health care in this context. This model was designed to help underserved communities achieve health equity through culturally-responsive care8. For example, the PCMH model has built-in financial incentives for providers to decrease racial and ethnic health disparities, such as participation in learning collaboratives, including e-learning courses8-9. The PCMH model has already been effective at decreasing healthcare costs and health disparities10. Therefore, the PCMH model is an ideal vehicle by which to reduce the sexual and reproductive health disparities of young women of color. SPECIFIC AIMS. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct a mixed-methods needs assessment with PCMH providers and young women of color to understand the needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare (on provider and patient levels). The knowledge gained will be used to create a detailed content outline, which will inform next-steps or the development of an e-learning course for time-limited healthcare providers to enhance cultural competency and progress towards health equity. METHODS. A sequential multilevel mixed-methods needs assessment will be conducted with providers and young women of color. The quantitative phase will include survey methods to quantify needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare and to identify major topics and themes to guide discussions during the qualitative phase. The qualitative phase will consist of in-depth individual interviews with physicians and iterative focus groups with young women of color to explore the meaning of these themes and how they may be addressed. During the integration phase, the quantitative and qualitative data will be integrated to create a detailed content outline for the e-learning course. LONG TERM GOAL. My long term goal is to develop a program of health services research focused on culturally-responsive healthcare interventions for youth to address health disparities of major significance."
"9479336","This proposal seeks crucial support for The Bipolar Sequencing Consortium (BSC), which brings together leading researchers from around the country and internationally who are carrying out exome and genome sequencing studies of bipolar disorder (BD). BD is a devastating mood disorder that imposes a significant burden on public health. It is among the most heritable serious mental disorders, with estimates ranging up to 90%. Yet, success in identifying susceptibility genes for BD has lagged noticeably behind other serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia. In this proposal, the BSC will share resources and sequence data for combined analyses that will advance the search for the genetic etiology of BD at a scale not possible by each of the research groups working by themselves. Recent efforts by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to implicate common genetic variation in the risk for BD. However, GWAS miss the contribution of rarer genetic variation with minor allele frequencies <1%. It is hypothesized that rarer genetic variation may further contribute to the heritability of complex disorders like BD, and that identification of rarer genetic variation may more directly implicate underlying biological mechanisms in the etiology of BD. Advances in next generation sequencing technology are making it increasingly possible to sequence the exome or entire genome in large numbers of individuals in a costeffective manner. With this technology, studies can now interrogate the full spectrum of genetic variation and correlate it with disease. Researchers in the BSC are taking advantage of next generation sequencing to study BD in families with multiple affected relatives or in large numbers of unrelated cases and controls. In this proposal, we will assemble the largest existing collection of sequencing data on BD and carry out combined analyses of over 4,700 cases and 9,000 controls from 5 different case-control sequencing studies and over 200 families with over 1,000 affected relatives from 10 family sequencing studies. We will integrate the findings from the combined analyses with other on-going genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic studies to clarify the role of rare variants in the genetic architecture of BD and characterize the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms by which implicated rare variants and genes may contribute to risk for BD. We will then follow-up the top findings from our analyses and test them in an independent sample of over 5,000 cases and controls that will be made available to us through a new whole genome sequencing initiative. All summary data and results from the combined analyses will be freely shared via an on-line study resource with the research community. Next generation sequencing technology holds great promise for revealing the genetic architecture of complex psychiatric disorders. This proposal will build on the NIMH's considerable investment in sequencing to maximize our ability to explain the genetic contribution to BD and lay the needed foundation for improved treatment/prevention strategies."
"9305118","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large-scale high-throughput mouse gene knockout studies have generated considerable data with respect to adult phenotypes of viable homozygous mouse strains. However, many strains do not survive into the post- natal period. The current KOMP2 initiative provides a tremendous opportunity to determine how the disruption of numerous genes impacts embryonic development and to provide insight into the gene networks responsible for normal embryogenesis and fetal development. These studies are especially relevant to the investigation of the underlying causes of human pregnancy loss and structural birth defects. Importantly, some of the most frequent developmental abnormalities observed in large-scale mouse knockout studies are also common human birth defects. Defects in neural tube closure and neural crest formation account for a high proportion of birth defects in humans and these defects can have severe consequences on viability. This reinforces how knowledge gained from the study of mouse models can impact our understanding of human pathology.  This proposal brings together three experts - Williams, Clouthier, and Niswander - who have extensive and collaborative experience in the detailed characterization of embryonic mutations that disrupt neural tube closure, craniofacial formation, and heart development. Our experience in forward genetic screens and high- throughput characterization makes us cognizant of the necessity for rapid analysis of mutant strains in order to minimize the shelf-time of the live colonies. Our goal in Aim 1 is to expand and complement the phenotyping information for the KOMP2 strains by providing a detailed histological assessment of strains that would not otherwise undergo this gold standard of analysis at KOMP2. All data will be uploaded and available through a publicly accessible website, with annotations and ontologies established by IMPC, MGI and KOMP2.  Aims 2 and 3 will delve much deeper into the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the defects seen in neural tube (Aim 2) and neural crest (Aim 3) formation in a select number of KOMP2 strains. Aim 2 is relevant for understanding the causes of human neural tube defects such as exencephaly and spina bifida (1 in 1000 births). Molecular assays and genetic interaction studies will provide pathway information to elucidate the genetic networks that orchestrate NT closure. Innovative live-imaging will explore how changes in gene function alter the cell behaviors that underlie neural tube morphogenesis. Aim 3 is relevant to major abnormalities associated with neural crest pathology include craniofacial defects (1.5 in 1000 births), heart defects (1 in 125 births), and enteric nervous system defects (1 in 5000 births). Aim 3 will study formation, migration and differentiation of the neural crest ad its interactions with surrounding tissues. Furthermore, tissue-specific knockout studies will determine if the observed defects are autonomous to the neural crest or if they are caused by defective signaling interactions with other tissues, particular the ectoderm. Overall these proposed studies will provide biological insight into the function of new genes arising from the KOMP2 centers."

"9301607","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Project 3: Animal Models of FSHD for Therapy Development  FSHD is one of the more common forms of muscular dystrophy yet the underlying cause(s) of the clinical symptoms seen in patients are still unclear. During the first period of support of our Wellstone Center, critical discoveries have been made by us and others on some of the key molecular players in disease causation.  The open reading frame in the last D4Z4 repeat encoding the protein termed DUX4-FL clearly plays a role in disease progression. The misexpression of DUX4-fl and it's downstream target transcripts likely play a role in the disease but which are important for pathogenesis are still unclear. There is a large unmet need in available animal models of FSHD for the study of pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutics.  Project 3 of The Wellstone Center renewal aims to use xenografts of mouse and human muscle as well as a zebrafish model of DUX4 misexpression during development. The humanized mouse muscle either by direct engraftment of human skeletal muscle or with cell transplantation provides human muscle in a living organism on which to develop therapeutic approaches. The models should allow the search for modulators  of DUX4-fl expression and any key developmental targets of DUX4-fl expression. In addition, the latter should result in an understanding of the generation of clinical symptoms outside skeletal muscle. Knock down of Dux4-fl through AAV as well as morpholino administration will be developed in the xenografts with the ultimate goal of using these approaches in clinical trials. The project will be informed by Project 1 and Project 2 on additional candidate genes and biomarkers whose expression will be assayed in the models.  The Project will also rely heavily on the Cell Core for well characterized FSHD and unaffected control cells and muscle biopsies."
"9293291","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human postnatal dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs) are unique precursor populations which are isolated from the dental pulp, root apex and periodontal ligament based on the primary characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow. DMSCs offer an attractive cell therapy for the regeneration and repair of dental and craniofacial tissue defects due to their convenient isolation and lack of immunogenicity. However, very little is known with respect to the molecular and epigenetic events that control DMSC commitment and differentiation to dental and craniofacial bone tissues. DNA and histone demethylases are newly-identified enzymes for removing DNA and histone methyl markers associated with gene activation or silencing. Using molecular and epigenetic approaches, we found that estrogen potently promoted odonto/osteogenic differentiation of DMSCs by inducing the histone lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) and DNA demethylase Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 (TET2). Contrary to estrogen, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) to inhibit DMSC differentiation. Very intriguingly, we observed that estrogen abolished TNF inhibition of DMSC differentiation by blocking NF-?B. In the realm of therapeutic dental and craniofacial tissue regeneration, the defective or injured tissues are frequently inflamed with pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is critical to control inflammation in order to achieve a successful regenerative therapy. In this competing renewal, based on our novel findings, we hypothesize that estrogen epigenetically promotes DMSC differentiation by histone and DNA demethylation while simultaneously inhibiting NF-?B and inflammation. To test our hypothesis, we proposed the following three specific aims: 1) Determine how estrogen induces KDM6B to enhance odonto/osteogenic differentiation of DMSCs by demethylating repressive H3K27me3 marks; 2) Determine how estrogen induces TET2 to enhance DMSC differentiation by DNA demethylation; and 3) Determine whether estrogen circumvents TNF inhibition of DMSC differentiation and promotes DMSC-mediated craniofacial bone regeneration and repair in vivo. Taken together, identifying whether estrogen not only promotes odonto/osteogenesis of DMSC but also inhibits inflammation would be a major therapeutic advance. Our work may help to develop novel strategies for promoting dental and craniofacial tissue regeneration and repair and for controlling inflammation."
"9508001","Obesity is a hyperlipidemic state characterized by excessive adipose tissue that often leads to diabetes and osteoporosis. Glucocorticoid receptor-? (GR?) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?) are members of the nuclear receptor family that are essential to adipocyte differentiation and function. In general, GR? and PPAR-? can be viewed as physiologic antagonists, with GR promoting lipolysis at adipose tissue, but PPAR-? promoting adipogenesis and lipid storage. Moreover, each receptor is regulated by phosphorylation, but in opposite ways: stimulatory to GR?, but inhibitory to PPAR-?. We have recently shown that two nuclear receptor chaperones, protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) and the FK506-binding protein-51 (FKBP51), can reciprocally regulate the molecular and metabolic activities of GR? and PPAR-? through phosphorylation. PP5 dephosphorylates GR at multiple serines to decrease its lipolytic activity, while dephosphorylating PPAR? at serine 112 to increase its adipogenic and lipid storage actions. Thus, PP5 can be viewed as a pro-lipogenic, anti-lipolytic factor. Our studies in PP5-KO mice support this view since the mice have greatly reduced whole body fat, including low lipid content in marrow fat cells and increased bone density. Interestingly, the PP5-KO mice also have increased insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure. The latter features suggest increased PPAR? insulin-sensitizing activity in the null mice ? actions known to be inhibited by CDK5-mediated phosphorylation at S273 of the receptor. Our latest data suggest that PP5 increases PPAR? S273 phosphorylation by dephosphorylating and activating the p35 regulatory subunit of CDK5. Thus, PP5 may inversely control the lipogenic and insulin sensitizing actions of PPAR? by directly dephosphorylating the receptor at S112 and indirectly phosphorylating the receptor at S273 by activating CDK5. We have shown that FKBP51 also negatively regulates GR? and positively regulates PPAR?, but it does so by inhibiting the Akt-p38 kinase pathway, leading to decreased phosphorylation of PPAR? at S112 and GR? at serines 220 and 234. This results in FKBP51-KO cells that are also resistant to adipogenesis and lipid buildup and in FKBP51-KO mice with reduced adipose depots and increased bone mass. Interestingly, FKBP51-KO mice are resistant to high-fat diet effects on insulin sensitivity and resistant to the PPAR-? agonist rosiglitazone. In this application, we will test the overall hypothesis that PP5 and FKBP51 are pro-adipogenic, pro-osteoporotic and pro-diabetic factors that act in adipose tissue by differentially targeting GR? and PPAR-? via phosphorylation. Thus, each chaperone may represent an ideal inhibitory drug target for obesity, osteoporosis and diabetes through the dual effect of inhibiting lipogenesis/osteoporosis but promoting anti-diabetics activities. This will be tested in molecular and cellular assays to further define the roles of the CDK5 and Akt-p38 kinase pathways in regulation of each receptor, and by directly testing the relevance of these kinase pathways to receptor effects on metabolism and bone density in both null and adipose-specific knock out mice."
"9315013","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The biological functions and activity of our genomes is not determined by linear DNA sequence information alone. To fit within the nucleus, DNA assembles with nucleosomes to form chromatin that coils into spatially defined territories that determine if genes are active or silent through poorly understood mechanisms. The local and global organization of chromatin are integrated in the nucleus to determine gene activity and genome function. To visualize the different structural scales of genome function in intact cells, ChromEM has been developed that exploits a cell permeable fluorescent small molecule that binds specifically to DNA and upon excitation paints the surface of chromatin with an osmiophillic polymer that can be visualized using electron microscopy (EM). By combining ChromEM with new advances in multi-tilt EM tomography (EMT), chromatin ultrastructure and 3D organization can be visualized at nucleosome resolutions as a continuum through unprecedented nuclear volumes. In Aim 1, ChromEM will be used to visualize chromatin structure-function in human embryonic stem cells and differentiated lung epithelial cells at nucleosome resolutions and genomic scales. We will qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the large-scale changes in chromatin structure and organization in response to Adenovirus infection and HDAC/DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. We will expand the scale and 3D nuclear volumes using serial section EMT and serial block face EM. A major goal will be to reconstruct entire sister chromatid pairs in metaphase cells to determine if they have identical chromosome architectures and chromatin organization. In Aim 2, the EM equivalent of `multi-color' fluorescence will be developed. We will implement `multi-color EM' by using sequential excitation cycles of miniSOG and ChromEM to photo-oxidize different metal chelates of DAB that can be discriminated by elemental mapping using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Multi-color EM will be used to visualize the structural interactions of viral oncoprotein and PML bodies with chromatin that regulate he silencing and activation of p53 and anti-viral genes. Also, workflow will be extended to incorporate live imaging to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of PML and chromatin associated interactions that are disrupted by wild type and mutant adenovirus infections in primary cells. In Aim 3, novel probes will be developed that enable a single copy gene to be identified in a sea of chromatin within the nucleus while preserving native ultrastructure and sequence context. Synthetic self- assembling nanoparticles will be engineered with different architectures, sizes, metal and fluorescent properties so that multiple genes can be labeled and visualized using live imaging, X-Ray microscopy and high resolution 3D EM. These labels will enable GFP-tagged loci to be visualized by EMT together with endogenous gene loci using dCAS9 fusions. The chromatin ultrastructure of telomeres and critical growth regulatory genes will be visualized using live imaging and 3D EM in the dynamics of the cell cycle and viral infection. These studies will change the understanding of the nucleus and chromatin structure-function."

The goal of our MBTP is to train students to work at the interface between quantitative molecular approaches and key problems in biology and medicine. The MBTP operates in a unique niche, providing a deeper grounding in the physical sciences for trainees who have a biological sciences background, and a more thorough exposure to the biological sciences and medicine than is usual for students with a physical sciences or engineering background. Though the program draws its training faculty from 7 different departments, it is rooted in an established network of common research and training activities. The 75 current students associated with the MBTP is nearly 3 times the number (27) from 10 years ago. Moreover, 12 of the current trainees (16%) are from groups that are underrepresented in science. Together, our trainees, the 23 Training Faculty and scientific staff and postdoctoral fellows make for a highly collegial and collaborative community. Beyond a personally designed curriculum, trainees meet along with the entire MBTP community at a minimum of two formal research seminar and one informal gathering each month. The scope of research spans the range of modern molecular biophysics, from understanding the principles of protein folding, to structural characterization of membrane proteins, to defining the action of multi-protein cellular machinery, to investigating the movement of biomolecules into, out of, and within cells. Research projects involve a broad spectrum of physical, chemical, and computational approaches, including X-ray crystallography, NMR, EPR and fluorescence spectroscopies, mass spectrometry, cryo-electron microscopy, cell imaging and molecular/cellular simulations, and often utilize multiple approaches. Trainees join the MBTP in their first year of graduate training after choosing a thesis laboratory, and are then supported for one and/or two years. Grant support covers the time needed for additional specialized didactic training and the initiation of thesis research. However, all trainees (and ther preceptors) remain active in MBTP program activities throughout the duration of their graduate training. Overall, the MBTP enriches each student's research and training experience and is designed to foster the development of the next generation of independent research scientists."

"9295958","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-traumatic joint stiffness (PTJS), a common cause of pain and disability, is a challenging clinical problem because injury severity often doesn't correlate with loss-of-function, making it difficult to predict patient risk. PTJS is especially problematic in the elbow because of high susceptibility to loss of motion and a lack of viable treatment options. The key factors responsible for the initiation, progression, and persistence of PTJS remain unclear. While capsule stiffening likely contributes, the role of other periarticular structures (e.g., ligaments, muscle, tendon, cartilage, bone) is unknown. We recently developed a model of PTJS in Long-Evans rats by inducing relevant elbow injuries followed by six-weeks of immobilization. This protocol led to impaired joint mechanics that persisted even after remobilization, thereby mimicking symptoms of the human condition. Objective: use this animal model to correlate joint dysfunction with tissue-level alterations in periarticular structures that contribute to the development of PTJS. Hypothesis: dysregulation of normal healing will lead to a fibrogenic biological response, abnormal and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production/deposition, and mechanical stiffening of several periarticular tissues that together will cause debilitating joint contracture. SA1: Determine contributors to joint contracture by identifying mechanical, biological and morphological changes that occur in the periarticular structures of stiff elbows. Rationale: A rat elbow model of PTJS wil be used to identify which periarticular joint structures exhibit altered tissue-level mechanics and determine what biological, organizational and morphological changes accompany these differences. Targeted mechanical testing, qPCR, and histology will be used to evaluate periarticular soft tissues and µ-CT imaging/histology to evaluate bone. Hypothesis: Joint contracture is caused by a maladaptive fibrotic response in several periarticular structures (mediated by TGF-ß signaling and leading to improper ECM regulation) demonstrating the multifactorial nature of PTJS pathophysiology. SA2: Elucidate causes of stiffness/contracture by correlating improvements in altered properties of periarticular structures following remobilization with subsequent recovery of joint function. Rationale: Correlation of impaired joint mechanics with time-dependent improvements to periarticular tissues will elucidate which anatomical structures contribute to long-term PTJS. Hypothesis: Joint- and tissue-level properties will improve following remobilization, but persistent joint dysfunction will correlate with permanently altered tissue- level properties of several periarticular structures (e.g., increased stiffness of ligament/tendon, proliferation of capsule/scar, ECM dysregulation in muscle, abnormal bone morphology/remodeling, cartilage degeneration). This study will elucidate tissue-specific changes that cause the development and progression of PTJS. Results will provide insight towards developing improved prevention/treatment strategies that directly target affected periarticular tissues, and will enable future study of other common elbow pathologies (e.g., instability and OA)."
"9298720","Project Summary  Given its central role in animal health and survival, the gut has evolved a sophisticated network of regulatory inputs from a variety of sources, including immunological, metabolic and microbiotic. Playing a prominent role in this regulatory network is the brain-gut axis, the bi-directional communication between the nervous system and the gut. While there are several well-described brain-gut signals, the exact mechanisms are not always well understood, and many of the signals, particularly stress signals and those involving the microbiome, remain elusive.  The fruit fly Drosophila has emerged as a robust model system for unraveling the genetic and cellular basis of human disease, from cancer and neurological disorders to obesity and diabetes. This project seeks to develop Drosophila as a model system to study brain-gut interaction. A novel signal from the fly brain to the gut has been discovered that is activated by metabolic stresses such as fasting. Short Neuropeptide F (sNPF), a relative of mammalian Neuropeptide Y (NPY), is involved in this brain-gut signal. Preliminary studies suggest a model in which sNPF is secreted by a specific set of neurons that integrate the stress signal and innervate the gut. The sNPF signal functions to maintain heightened gut epithelial integrity during periods of stress; in its absence the gut loses epithelial integrity, resulting in an unchecked inflammatory response that depletes energy stores, leading to acute starvation sensitivity and shortened lifespan.  The sNPF neurons that innervate the gut will be identified and specifically inactivated using the advanced genetic tools available in Drosophila. If the brain-gut stress signaling model is correct, inactivation of the sNPF neurons should result in the loss of epithelial integrity, inflammatory response and depletion of energy stores. Similarly, activation of the sNPF neurons should lead to enhanced epithelial integrity and resistance to bacterial challenge, and increased energy stores. The model also predicts that sNPF acts directly on the gut via its receptor, sNPF-R. To test this, sNPF-R levels will be knocked down specifically in the gut by RNAi and mutations in the sNPF-R gene will be generated.  The discovery and verification of such a brain-gut signal will establish Drosophila as a genetic model system for brain-gut signaling during periods of stress and lay the foundation for identifying novel mechanisms underlying mammalian brain-gut signaling."

Currently, there are no effective treatments that regenerate permanently damaged or degenerated fibrocartilage tissue, largely due to our severe lack of knowledge in TMJ fibrocartilage biology. Few studies have specifically elucidated and defined TMJ fibrocartilage cellular constituents or assessed the regenerative properties of the TMJ. Our preliminary data demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of putative stem/progenitor cells in the TMJ condyle. To test the application of putative TMJ stem/progenitor cells for regeneration, we have established a surgical TMJ condyle replacement model in vivo. Accordingly, our long- term goals are1) to isolate and comprehensively characterize putative TMJ stem/progenitor cells; 2) determine the regenerative potential of characterized TMJ stem/progenitor cells in biomaterial scaffolds. Our overall hypothesis is the TMJ harbors stem/progenitor cells that can be harnessed in biomaterial scaffolds for TMJ regeneration. Our goal is to regenerate TMJ fibrocartilage that gradually approximates the native tissue in multiple, reiterative in vivo experiments in skeletally mature animal models. Overall, these studies are anticipated to not only to enhance our understanding of fibrocartilage biology and regeneration, but may also contribute to the development of novel regenerative therapies for fibrocartilage injuries and diseases."
"9522684","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal."
"9513132","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract The epithelium of the distal lung performs the critical biological function of gas exchange and serves as a barrier to prevent access of deleterious airborne agents into the body. In order to maintain these functions the lung has an extensive ability to respond to injury and regenerate lost or damaged cells. Current models posit that epithelial repair can be attributed to cells expressing mature lineage markers. By contrast, we have recently defined the regenerative role of rare lineage-negative epithelial stem/progenitor (LNEP) cells present within normal distal lung. Orthotopic transplantation of LNEPs reveals a striking capacity for direct differentiation into type 2 pneumocytes and distal airway cells. However, after severe influenza injury, LNEPs activate a ?Np63 and cytokeratin 5 (Krt5) remodeling program whereupon cells proliferate and migrate toward heavily injured alveolar areas. This pathway largely results in an abnormal epithelial barrier rather than type II cell differentiation. The dysplastic alveolar epithelial cysts result i part from ongoing excessive Notch signaling and are reminiscent of honeycombing cysts in fibrotic human lungs. Interestingly, transplantation of the total LNEP population demonstrates both bronchiolar and alveolar differentiation, whereas cells expressing low levels of Krt5 are heavily biased toward airway-like cystic expansion. Furthermore, principle component analysis of single cell transcriptomes indicates multiple subpopulations of cells. These observations suggest that heterogeneity within the LNEP population is a manifestation of lineage-primed subpopulations predisposed towards particular fates. This proposal seeks to address the biological significance of this heterogeneity with the following specific aims: 1) Test whether murine LNEPs consist of both unbiased and primed stem/progenitor cell populations. 2) Identify the human equivalent(s) of LNEPs and explore their role in human lung disease. 3) Define distinct signaling cues that modulate airway and alveolar regenerative responses of unbiased and primed LNEP subpopulations. These aims will utilize single cell RNA-Seq, lineage tracing, organoid culture, and orthotopic cell transplantation to interrogate cellular heterogeneity and regenerative dynamics with a high degree of tractability. These studies will lay the foundation for development of a quantitative and predictive model of lung epithelial injury responses. Such a model will inform future efforts to manipulate regenerative mechanisms in order to achieve better disease outcomes."
"9353404","This proposed project is for developing the second-generation MR-compatible SPECT system (MRC-SPECT- II). The proposed MRC-SPECT-II system, based on a novel inverted compound-eye (ICE) gamma camera design would offer the potential of dramatically improving SPECT imaging instrumentation from several aspects. First, this approach helps to tackle one of the most limiting aspects of SPECT instrumentation, by offering a dramatically improved sensitivity without sacrificing its resolution capability. The proposed MRC- SPECT-II system could offer an unprecedented sensitivity of 1.5% with a reconstructed imaging resolution of 0.5 mm across and 1.5 cm diameter field-of-view (FOV), and 9% at 1.2 mm spatial resolution (as compared to the typical levels of 0.1% - 0.01% found in modern pre-clinical SPECT instrumentations). This greatly increase in detection sensitivity could potentially provide a radical change in how we might employ SPECT imagining in pre-clinical research by offering a dramatically lowered detection limit and allowing for new imaging procedures that would not be feasible with the current generation of SPECT instrumentations. Second, the ICE-camera design allows the MRC-SPECT-II system to have a significantly reduced physical dimension, while compared to any existing SPECT systems with similar FOV. This would allow the MRC-SPECT-II system (and future MRC-SPECT systems based on similar ICE camera design) to be integrated in most of existing MR scanners. Third, the ICE camera design could also offer dramatically improved sensitivities for scaled-up SPECT scanners for large animals and for human (e.g. brain and heart) imaging applications. Finally, the proposed MRC-SPECT-II system allows for simultaneous SPECT and high-field (9.4T) MR imaging studies. Within this particular project, the MRC-SPECT-II system will be developed and refined for in vivo study of the efficacy and fate of therapeutically engineered neural stem cells in malignant brain tumors, which could help to bring this promising therapeutic approach into clinical practice."
"9315801","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent work has shown that activation of the alternative pathway of complement is central to the pathogenesis of a large number of glomerular and tubulointerstitial renal diseases. It is not known, however, why the kidney is so frequently and uniquely vulnerable to alternative pathway-mediated injury. The central hypothesis of this grant is that the plasma protein factor H is critical for controlling alternativ pathway activation on the glomerular basement membrane and the surface of injured mesangial cells and tubular epithelial cells. Complement regulation within the kidney by factor H is disrupted by the local production of proteins that impair factor H function and by complement-activating microparticles shed by injured cells throughout the body. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be pursued. Aim 1) Determine which regulatory proteins control complement activation in the kidney. The working hypothesis for this aim is that factor H prevents spontaneous complement activation on the GBM and on injured mesangial and tubular epithelial cells. We will use in vitro and in vivo methods to determine which renal surfaces require factor H to prevent complement-mediated injury. We will use targeted complement inhibitors to restore factor H to sites of complement activation within the kidney. Aim 2) Determine how the protein annexin A2 modulates complement regulation by factor H within the kidney. The working hypothesis for this aim is that annexin A2 expressed within the injured kidney blocks factor H function, thus permitting local activation of the alternative pathway. The experiments in this aim will utilize recombinant annexin A2, SiRNA, and mice with targeted deletion of the gene for annexin A2 in order to determine how annexin A2 promotes complement activation on the surface of cells of the kidney in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3) Determine whether plasma microparticles impair complement regulation within the kidney. The working hypothesis of this aim is that microparticles shed from injured endothelial cells cause complement activation within the kidney. These experiments will utilize cyclosporine to generate endothelial microparticles and test whether they cause injury in factor H deficient mice. Cyclosporine-induced microparticles will be injected into factor H deficient mice to determine whether the microparticles directly increase alternative pathway activation and cause renal injury. Finally, we will test whether CR2-factor H, a targeted complement inhibitor, prevents cyclosporine-induced vascular and renal toxicity in factor H deficient mice. The approach outlined above is innovative because it challenges the current understanding of how factor H controls complement activation on tissues and it provides an explanation for why the kidney, among all of the organs, is so uniquely susceptible to alternative pathway-mediated injury. The studies in this grant are significant because they examine a process central to the pathogenesis of a wide range of renal diseases and provide new treatment strategies for these diseases."
"9272958","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major limitation in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) is the development of L-Dopa induced dyskinesias (LIDs). LIDs are disruptive involuntary movements that lead to a decreased quality of life in PD patients. To date, the neural mechanism underlying this debilitating side effect is poorly understood. Thus, this proposal combines neurophysiology, optogenetics, and automated motion tracking to explore the mechanism involved. Prior work demonstrates a reduction in LIDs following serotonergic neuron ablation in a rat model of PD. In the proposed study, we will address the involvement of the serotonergic system by first determining if serotonergic neurons are necessary for the development of LIDs (Aim 1) and then determining if it is specifically serotonergic projections to D1 neurons in the striatum that modulate LIDs (Aim 2).  To identify the general role of serotonergic system in the development of LIDs, we will inject hemiparkinsonian Lmx1bf/f/p mice, lacking serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system, with L-dopa and document abnormal involuntary movements. Next, we propose to optogenetically target the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as the main nucleus involved in LIDs, as it heavily projects to the striatum.  To study the interaction between the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in the striatum during LIDs, we first combine striatal neuronal ensemble recordings with pharmacological manipulations. Striatal activity (neuronal firing rate and local field potential) will be paired wih LIDs in awake-behaving animals. Secondly, we measure LIDs while pharmacologically inhibiting serotonergic neurons and transiently stimulating D1 neurons with optogenetics techniques. Elucidating the mechanism of LIDs may lead to the development of therapies that will inhibit dyskinesias, enhance motor benefits from L-dopa, and potentially avoid the need for more invasive surgical treatment, significantly increasing the quality of life in these patients."
"9285827","Using a preclinical model system of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the proposed studies will identify new  auditory processing based biomarkers that can be used as reliable outcome measures for therapeutics and  provide new insights into neural mechanisms underlying auditory hypersensitivity in FXS. FXS is the most  common inherited cause of mental impairment, and is a leading genetic cause of autism. Data from humans  with FXS and the mouse model (Fmr1 KO) indicate auditory processing deficits. In vivo electrophysiological  data from cortical neurons in adult Fmr1 KO mice suggest hyper-excitability in response to sounds and  altered spectral and temporal responses. The proposed studies will determine the developmental time  course of auditory cortical deficits in Fmr1 knock out (KO) mice, address mechanisms of these deficits and  evaluate novel drugs in treating auditory functional deficits. Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that  auditory processing deficits in the adult Fmr1 KO mice arise due to a deficit in developmental refinement of  cortical processing. These studies will also compare auditory cortical responses between mice in which  Fmr1 is deleted only in the excitatory neurons to address sources of deficits. In addition, recordings will be  obtained from mice in which cortical Fmr1 is deleted only from 3 weeks postnatal to disambiguate  developmental versus acute role for Fmr1 in establishing cortical responses in adult mice. Dendritic spine  morphology of Al neurons will also be tracked during development to identify possible structural correlates  of functional deficits. Specific aim 2 will determine baseline and sound evoked electroencephalogram (EEG)  responses in awake, behaving mice. We will determine the effect of candidate drugs in reversing the  auditory deficits at the single neuron and EEG/ERP levels. The EEG response will provide high throughput  markers to test drugs. These studies will also identify new therapeutic strategies based on analysis of matrix  metalloproteases in the auditory cortex in specific aim 3. An integrated approach based on in vivo  electrophysiology, neuroanatomy and pharmacology will be used to address mechanisms of auditory  processing deficits and drug effects in reversing these deficits."
"9297366","Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are defined by their ability to undergo self-renewal and maintain the capacity to generate all types of mature hematopoietic cells within the blood and immune system. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment supplies critical pro-hematopoietic signals that regulate the maintenance of the hematopoietic system. Understanding these signals may lead to the development of novel strategies to increase the number of HSCs that would be available in a clinical setting to treat a wide variety of hematological diseases. The overall goal of this research project is to define mechanisms by which NF-kB signaling in the BM vascular niche regulates the maintenance of the HSC pool during homeostatic and regenerative conditions. We have recently demonstrated that endothelial cells (ECs) play an essential role in maintaining HSC homeostasis through activation of the Akt pathway, enabling ECs to maintain and expand functional HSCs. However, the signaling pathways downstream of Akt responsible for endowing ECs with the instructional capacity to regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs are unknown. We have found that the inhibiting NF-kB signaling in Akt-activated ECs results in robust expansion of functional mouse HSCs thereby enhancing hematopoietic recovery following myelosuppression, in part, by protecting the BM microenvironment. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway in BMECs regulates the maintenance of the HSC pool by protecting the hematopoietic and vascular system from radiation-induced DNA and metabolic damage. To study the role of NF-kB signaling in BMECs, we will use a transgenic mouse model in which NF-kB signaling is inhibited under the control of a vascular specific promoter. Utilizing novel techniques developed in our laboratory that enable us to isolate and cultivate ECs from the BM, we will be able to test if inhibiting the Akt/NF-kB signaling axis within the vascular niche 1) protects the HSC from radiation induced DNA and cellular damage, 2) helps maintain and restore the proper metabolic profile during hematopoietic regeneration, 3) rejuvenates the BM vascular niche and hematopoietic system by transplanting properly activated BMECs, and 4) enhances the expression of novel pro-hematopoietic factors that promote homeostatic and regenerative hematopoiesis. These studies will begin to unravel the mechanisms by which ECs support the balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation. These studies will lay the foundation to develop new therapeutic strategies aimed at rejuvenating the HSC niche and restoring the hematopoietic compartment following myeloablative treatments."
"9431366","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. The mission of the West Virginia University Injury Control Research Center (WVU ICRC) is to advance the science and practice of injury prevention and control through research, education, outreach and service. The long-term goal of the Center is to reduce the societal burden imposed by injury. We aspire to prevent injury-related mortality and morbidity, and reduce the adverse health and economic consequences associated with injury. The WVU ICRC addresses national priorities for injury control while simultaneously emphasizing topics that are most relevant to West Virginia and the surrounding Appalachian region, a region that is economically depressed and exhibits disproportionately high injury rates. As a center of excellence, the WVU ICRC is much more than a collection of individual research projects. Rather, the Center is an interdisciplinary organization that applies a comprehensive approach designed to advance the field of injury prevention and control. Accordingly, the activities proposed in this center grant application are intended to accomplish the following overarching aims:  1. To advance scientific discovery in the field of injury prevention and control, including the development  of new and effective injury prevention and control strategies;  2. To improve injury prevention and control capacity at the local, regional, and national levels;  3. To increase public awareness of the burden of injury and public support for injury prevention and  control efforts; and  4. To strengthen injury prevention and control programs and policies. To fulfill these aims, the WVU ICRC has developed four Core areas (Administrative, Outreach, Education, and Research). Each Core has established specific goals, objectives, and methods, which, collectively, comprise the cross-cutting activities of the Center. In this application we propose four new research investigations focusing on national and regional injury priorities including motor vehicle injuries, falls in the elderly, prescription drug overdoses, and suicide. The proposed research spans the spectrum of injury control including primary prevention, acute care, and public health translation. Further, we propose an expansion of our educational program and the establishment of a variety of innovative training opportunities for our students in collaboration with our many external partners. Finally, we plan to expand the impact of our Center through a series of activities designed to actively disseminate research findings, promote enhanced regional collaborations, and support community-based injury control practitioners and policymakers."
"9300931","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine receptivity, the ability of the uterus to accept embryo implantation, is dependent upon ovarian steroid signaling which coordinates the paracrine crosstalk between the epithelial and stromal compartments of the endometrium. The ovarian steroid Progesterone, P4, acting through its cognate receptor, Pgr (mouse), is critical in the regulation of the compartmental crosstalk. During pregnancy, Pgr is expressed in the uterine epithelial for a finite period prior to embryo attachment. In humans, alteration in the PGR signaling is associated with endometrial diseases, such as infertility, endometriosis, and endometrial cancer. Hyperstimulation of PGR is associated with pregnancy failure after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer, IVF/ET. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulated by Pgr and how they function in the regulation of uterine receptivity and disease. Utilizing Chromatin Immunoprecipitation combined with whole genome sequencing, ChIP-Seq, we have identified the binding sites of Pgr in the murine genome and have identified the transcription factor Sox17 as a Pgr target and potential partner of Pgr in the regulation of uterine receptivity. The hypothesis of this proposal is that cell specific and temporl interactions of Pgr and Sox17 are critical for uterine receptivity and alterations in the expressio of Sox17 and Pgr will impair uterine function. This proposal will investigate the role of Sox17 in the regulation of mouse uterine function. We will then investigate the molecular interactions of Sox17 in the regulation of endometrial function. Finally, we will test the importance of the timing of Pgr regulated signaling in mouse uterine receptivity. Completion of the aims of this proposal will define the role of PR in the regulation of endometrial function and determine the functional interactions of PR with other transcription factors in the regulation of endometrial gene expression and function. This proposal will also determine the importance or the temporal expression of PR in the uterus. Understanding how altered expression of PR disrupts uterine function is critical in understanding how the uterus response to endocrine therapy."
"9336774","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revision of a renewal application for a project known as the Victoria Longitudinal Study (VLS). A prospective study underway for over 20 years, the VLS has operated effectively and productively for the last decade in two coordinated labs. The general objective of the VLS is to examine actual short- and long-term changes in middle-aged and older adults across many domains of cognition as they are dynamically influenced and modified by multiple aspects of health (e.g., conditions, beliefs), biological attributes (e.g., functional, genetic), lifestyle activities (e.g., cognitive, social, physical engagement), and neuropsychological status (e.g., cognitively successful, normal, cognitively impaired). According to our Research Plan, we collect systematic, multivariate, and comprehensive data on long-term volunteer participants through repeated waves of observation at regular intervals (every 3-4 years, with 10-12 hours of testing at each wave). Since its inception, the VLS follows a design that features three initially healthy sequential samples (all initially aged 55-85 years, now about 63-100+ years). The three samples were begun in adjacent decades (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s). The VLS now has longitudinal data that span a gradient of 40 years of aging, plus numerous control (e.g., younger, middle-aged adults) and emerging target and comparison groups (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, Mild Cognitive Impairment). The current Specific Aims are to (a) continue the systematic assembly of a rich data archive on actual cognitive changes with aging, (b) identify key patterns of cognitive differences, changes, and transitions with aging, and (c) investigate theoretically and clinically relevant precursors, correlates, and modifiers of healthy, normal, and impaired changes with aging. We report substantial progress in pursuing these aims in the recent grant period. Our Proposed Research includes (a) continued collection of critical waves of longitudinal data, (b) development and management of all longitudinal and comparison samples, and (c) new research in four integrative themes of contemporary cognitive aging. Each proposed theme involves innovative studies on (a) independent and interacting influences (e.g., health, lifestyle, genetic, functional across (b) multiple domains of reliably measured cognitive change (e.g., declarative memory, executive function, speed and inconsistency) using (c) well-characterized and large samples of broad age-bands of adults who may be (d) representative of theoretically and clinically interesting health groups of significance to aging, and are always (e) followed carefully across longitudinal waves. The General Significance of the VLS lies in its ever-growing rich, unique, and multi-faceted data set on actual changes in human aging. A more specific significance pertains to the increasingly integrative studies showing both independent and interactive influences on cognitive aging trajectories and outcomes. The research we conduct addresses historically valid and currently compelling empirical, theoretical, and practical issues of health and aging."
"9332380","Passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009 provides the FDA with regulatory authority to reduce the nicotine content of cigarettes if doing so will result in improved population health. Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing nicotine content in cigarettes reduces smoking behavior and toxicant exposure among adult daily, dependent smokers. However, such research leaves open the question of the effects of nicotine reduction on experimentation with cigarettes among adolescents and young adults at risk for progression to regular use and dependence. This is an important question since a nicotine content that reduces tobacco use and dependence among daily smokers could conceivably support continued experimentation and progression to dependence among non-daily smokers. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to evaluate reactions to, and choices to self-administer, cigarette smoke with varying nicotine content among low-frequency, non-dependent adolescent/young adult smokers between the ages of 18-25 yrs. The proposed sample (n=90) approximates the age and smoking patterns of individuals experimenting with cigarettes and as such, will provide critical information about the role of nicotine content in promoting and sustaining continued experimentation and progression to use. Participants will undergo three sessions in which their reactions to fixed doses of smoke from investigational cigarettes with three different nicotine contents (15.8 mg/gram of tobacco, 2.5 mg/g, and .4 mg/g). Following the third fixed-dose session, participants will return to the lab to choose one of the cigarettes to self-administer. Order of the fixed-dose sessions will be counterbalanced and randomly assigned; all tests will be conducted double-blind. We hypothesize that intermediate nicotine content cigarettes will produce greater positive reactions than very low nicotine content cigarettes and less negative reactions than normal nicotine content cigarettes. Participants will choose to self-administer intermediate content cigarettes over the others. The proposed research will provide an evaluation of the amount of nicotine in cigarette smoke that produces reactions associated with progression from initial smoking to nicotine dependence in a sample representative of individuals experimenting with cigarette use. Specifically, observing that a nicotine content level (2.4 mg/g) that reduces smoking among dependent, daily smokers, results in reactions and choices that are associated with progression to regular smoking and dependence, can have a significant impact in establishing new cigarette product standards."
"9380806","Reconstructing the circuits that control how immune cells adopt specific states and control an immune response is a major challenge, due to the diversity of cell types, the spectra of cell states, and their temporal changes over the course of the response. The combined advent of massive scale single cell genomics and large scale genetic CRIPSR screens suddenly provide an extraordinary opportunity to reconstruct a systems level model of the complex molecular and cellular processes that unfold during an immune response, including the cell types and states that compose the response, the regulators that control them, how cells affect each other, and how they integrate to form physiological and pathological responses. However, to learn such knowledge from massive, noisy and heterogeneous data there is an enormous need for sophisticated, innovative, robust, and scalable computational methods. These span include early data quality control and processing that addresses noise such as false negatives in single cell RNA-seq profiles, and the inference of the regulators that control cell types, states and temporal transitions, and guidelines for adaptive experimental design, from the number of cells to analyze to the choice of genes to perturb. In particular, because the current capacity to perturb genes in vivo is limited, ranking candidates for perturbation and refining their predictions and ranking as new perturbation data is collected is key for successful discoveries. Finally, because of the complexity of the data and of the underlying biology, achieving insights requires a close partnership between immunologists and computational experts. Unfortunately, successful methods and foundational datasets often remain out of reach for immunologists, absent software and data portals that would serve those. Here, we will leverage our extensive and pioneering expertise in computational biology for systems immunology ? which we developed, harnessed and demonstrated in a long-term and close collaboration with the members of this Program ? to develop and deploy computational methods and tools to bridge the gap between data and knowledge in systems immunology, and apply them in the context of the program?s projects. Specifically, we will develop, establish and maintain cutting-edge tools for the analysis of single cell RNA-seq data including identification of cell types, states, temporal transitions, and the associated pathways and signature, with high efficiency compatible with massive scale data (Aim 1). We will develop, establish and maintain cutting-edge tools to predict key regulators associated with these cell types, states and responses, as they unfold over time, and develop and use methods that rank regulators and select targets for genetic manipulation in CRISPR screens in vivo, followed by adaptive identification of new regulators following additional genetic screens (Aim 2). We will establish and maintain a public portal for all data, analyses and methods we collect, and release software tools as part of our open source Trinity package (Aim 3). Throughout, we will serve as an effective nexus for all project and core leads for all analysis purposes."
"9325871","ABSTRACT  Cranial radiotherapy is associated with progressive cognitive decline that disrupts quality of life for long- term cancer survivors. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, in which neurons are born and integrated into the hippocampal circuitry, is important for learning, memory, and mood regulation. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is persistently reduced following cranial irradiation and may contribute to post-irradiation cognitive decline. Data from our laboratory confirm that neuroblasts and their precursors are reduced acutely after irradiation in the adult hippocampus. Interestingly, deficits in neurogenesis continue for many months despite the survival of radial glial cells (RGCs), the stem cell of the adult hippocampus, after irradiation. The long-term response of individual neurogenic cell types to cranial irradiation is not well characterized. I hypothesize that cranial irradiation impairs the ability of RGCs to divide and give rise to intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1, where I will quantify RGC BrdU incorporation and Ascl1+ and Tbr2+ IPC population size in the hippocampus three months after 8 Gy cranial gamma irradiation. This aim will utilize transgenic NestinCreERT2 YFP reporter mice and immunohistochemistry to fate- map RGCs and their progeny.  Endogenous bone morphogenic proteins 2, 4, and 6 (BMP2/4/6) inhibit RGC division. Data from other models show that long-term increases in BMP2/4/6 contribute to persistent deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Furthermore, blocking BMP2/4/6 activity has been shown to effectively increase neurogenesis in healthy and aged mice. Based on this evidence, together with my preliminary data showing an increase in BMP6 mRNA in whole brain homogenates after irradiation, I hypothesize that a long-term increase in BMP2/4/6 activity following irradiation reduces RGC division, and that blocking this pathway will promote RGC division and rescue neurogenesis. In Aim 2, I will test this hypothesis by 1) quantifying changes in mRNA of BMP2/4/6 and downstream targets three months after 8 Gy cranial gamma irradiation, and 2) quantifying changes in RGC BrdU incorporation and IPC population size in response to intraventricular administration of noggin, a BMP inhibitor, three months after 8 Gy cranial gamma irradiation.  Together, experimental results achieved in these aims will contribute to our over-arching goal of reducing the side effects of cranial irradiation on the hippocampus. Ultimately, this work will enhance our understanding of adult hippocampal stem cells and may inform future development of therapies to mitigate cognitive decline in individuals exposed to radiation. Techniques mastered through the proposed experiments will help me achieve my next goal of obtaining a competitive academic post-doctoral position."
"9309998","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the most deadly cancer with an overall 5-year survival rate of ~7% over the last decade. This is primarily because PC tends to develop surreptitiously over the course of multiple decades (i.e., over 20 years from initiation to metastasis) with no appreciable symptoms presenting until the very final stages of cancer progression. There are no techniques available which are suitable for population- wide screening of PC. The goal of this project is to develop and test a novel optical technology for the detection of PC.  This technology will target the ultrastructural alterations presenting in Field Effect of Carcinogenesis (FC). FC is the phenomenon by which a number of physical alterations in tissue structure occur throughout an entire affected organ at an early time- point, long before metastasis. These physical alterations happen at subdiffractional (nano) length-scales. Light scattering techniques have shown the ability to detect and characterize these ultrastructural alterations in both in-vivo and ex-vivo studies for multiple cancer types.  The purpose of this project is to extend on previous work and develop a noninvasive fiber optic probe for use during an upper endoscopy procedure to probe the periampullary region of the duodenum for ultrastructural alterations. The periampullary region of the duodenum serves as a surrogate site from which cancer risk status can be assessed, since it is exposed to the same milieu as the pancreatic duct (pancreatic juices and microbiome) and the pancreatic duct is not practical for probing.  The approach of this project will be divided into roughly two phases: 1) an engineering phase and 2) a clinical testing phase. First I will develop simulations to accurately model the probe design. I will build, test, and validate the probe design with phantoms. The probe will then be tested with human subjects to develop a prediction rule for detecting pancreatic cancer, and finally the prediction rule will be validate with an independent set of patients."
"9317155","At the global level, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there are ~14 million cases of serious pneumococcal disease and more than 1.6 million people die each year from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Streptococcus pneumoniae has a number of virulence factors that contribute to its ability to cause disease including polysaccharide capsule, pneumolysin and pneumococcal surface proteins A-C. We have recently identified a novel immunoregulatory property of Spn. Our data show exposure of murine effector cells to a soluble fraction generated from mechanically disrupted Spn results in effective inhibition of cytokine production and granule release. The inhibition we observe is a highly novel and unexpected property of pneumococcus. Importantly, this effect is not restricted to a single strain. We have tested an array of clinical and laboratory isolates finding that all could inhibit T effector cell function.  In characterizing the inhibitory factor, we found it to be heat labile and protease sensitive. Through a series of fractionation and sequencing approaches, candidate molecules were identified. Two candidates were cloned, engineered to express a His tag, and expressed in E. coli allowing for efficient isolation and further testing. Our data show that one of the candidates could reproduce the T cell inhibitory effect observed with disrupted Spn and in addition, function was found to be independent of the known enzymatic activity of the protein.  The ability of Spn to actively regulate function in effector cells presents a new mechanism for immune regulation by this clinically important bacterium. The studies in this application are designed to understand how the differentiation state of the T cell impact susceptibility to the negative regulatory protein. In addition, we propose studies to elucidate the nature of the interaction of the regulatory protein with T cells. Finally, we will determine the susceptibility of human T cells to the negative regulatory capabilities of Spn. These critical questions will be addressed in the following aims. Aim 1 To determine how the differentiation state of a T cell impacts its susceptibility to the immunoregulatory effects of Spn PepN. Aim 2 To determine whether PepN interacts with the extracellular membrane or gains entry into the cell and the potential partners with which PepN interacts.

Using an ecologic framework, we propose that neighborhood social network factors likely promote unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to this disparity. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify social network factors tha promote healthy diet, physical activity and healthy weight among public housing residents. We focus on the social network - the connections among people within a community - as theoretical work suggests that social networks have an important influence on health behaviors. However, no previous studies have examined lifestyle behaviors in a social network analysis or targeted these behaviors with a social network intervention. We will explore three aims: 1) To characterize the relationship between the social network and obesity / lifestyle behaviors of 500 adults living in public housing developments in Baltimore, MD; 2) To assess if an interaction between the social network and built environment exists and how such an interaction influences the lifestyle behaviors among public housing residents; and 3) To develop a social network intervention to facilitate lifestyle behavior change and pilot test it in residents of public housig developments as in Baltimore, MD. The candidate's long-term career goal is to improve the health of at-risk populations by preventing and treating obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). She completed a Clinical Research Fellowship in General Internal Medicine (GIM) at Johns Hopkins, and joined the GIM faculty as an Assistant Professor at Johns Hopkins in July 2012. She has laid out a career development plan to enhance her skills in advanced statistical methods, social network analysis, and behavioral theory. She has also assembled a core mentorship team along with a multidisciplinary advisory committee to support her research and career development. Her core mentorship team is headed by her primary mentor, Dr. Jeanne Clark, Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, who has extensive experience in mentoring and clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of obesity. This core team also includes Dr. Carl Latkin, Professor of Public Health with expertise in social networks, and Dr. David Levine, Professor of Medicine with expertise in community-based participatory research and CVD risk reduction. In year 5, the results from this work will lead to an R01 application to conduct a randomized controlled trial testing the effect of the social network intervention on healthy lifestyle behavior change that promotes and sustains a healthy weight among the high-risk public housing population."
"9381419","Cisplatin and carboplatin (Pt) are used heavily in the clinic against a variety of cancers, such as those of ovarian, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), testicular, head & neck, and bladder origin. These drugs demonstrate good activity, but in most cases, the activity is short-lived as tumors become desensitized by the onset of resistance. Several options are available to sensitize tumor cells to platinum-based therapy. Since Pt drugs interact with DNA to form DNA adducts as a mechanism of their action, inhibition of DNA repair can make tumor cells highly sensitive through persistence of the DNA adduct. Repair of these adducts by nucleotide excision repair (NER) in testicular cancers is low, which makes these cancers highly sensitive to Pt drugs and leads to about 90% cure rate. Recent data suggests that repair of these adducts is complex, and involves NER-mediated incisions that induce double strand breaks as intermediates, which are then repaired by homologous recombination (HR). The base excision repair (BER) pathway has also been implicated in cisplatin repair. Interestingly, the spectrum of Pt activity in the clinic has broadened to include triple-negative breast cancers that harbor BRCA1 mutation or low BRCA1 expression (BRCAness tumors). High sensitivity has also been observed in hereditary or low-expressing BRCA1 ovarian cancers. Sensitization from loss of BRCA1 is due to resultant HR defect, which when combined with inhibition of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) in the BER pathway by olaparib produces synthetic lethality. Thus, olaparib further augments Pt sensitivity in tumors with the BRCAness phenotype. This sensitization, however, is limited to the small number of BRCA1 patients, but in our proposal we will test the hypothesis that small molecules inducing cell cycle blockade will suppress BRCA1 expression in BRCA1-proficient ovarian and breast cancers to enhance tumor cell sensitivity to Pt drugs and PARP inhibitors. We will address this hypothesis through three specific aims: 1) Establish the relationship between cell cycle blockade and BRCA1 expression and delineate the mechanism of cell cycle blockade causing BRCA1 suppression; 2) Define downstream mechanisms downregulating BRCA1 as a result of cell cycle blockade; and 3) Identify rational combinations for synergistic activity and demonstrate proof-of- concept in xenograft/PDX systems. Several agents are reported independently to induce cell cycle arrest and we will prospectively establish the novel relationship with BRCA1 suppression utilizing pharmacologic tools to define antitumor activity, biochemical and molecular tools to define the underlying basis of cell cycle blockade and of BRCA1 suppression, and use the Bliss and Chou-Talalay mathematical models to identify synergistic combinations of cisplatin and olaparib with an optimal inducer of BRCAness. This project has the potential to sensitize cisplatin refractory cancers and also broaden the cancer base that could be treated rationally on a proven therapy-based principal of BRCA1-mediated defect in HR. There is high expectation that the studies proposed will change the trajectory of survival outcomes in large numbers of BRCA1-proficient cancers."
"9281681","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Penn Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders (PCMD) will continue to enhance the research productivity of, and provide critical resources and programs to, investigators to address multidisciplinary research strategies for musculoskeletal problems. The overall goal of this Center is to promote cooperative interactions among investigators, accelerate and enrich the effectiveness and efficiency of ongoing research, foster new collaborations and new research, and ultimately, translate our research efforts into better and new therapies for musculoskeletal disorders. The central theme of the Center will continue to be Musculoskeletal Tissue Injury and Repair. This theme is broad (as it includes all musculoskeletal tissue types, such as bone, cartilage, disc, ligament, meniscus, muscle, and tendon), focused (as takes advantage of commonalities in approaches across tissue types), and clinically significant (as it fosters development of assays, procedures and knowledge in pre- clinical animal and human models of translational relevance). It is important to note that our PCMD is not a bone center nor is it a muscle center. Rather, it is truly a musculoskeletal center and has emerged as the recognized home for musculoskeletal research across the Penn campus and as a technical and intellectual resource for the broader Philadelphia musculoskeletal research community. Thus, the primary overall aims of this Center are to enhance and advance the research productivity of investigators in musculoskeletal tissue injury and repair by: 1) Providing innovation within critical resource core facilities in areas that cross  disciplines, length scales, and hierarchies. These core facilities are µCT Imaging, Biomechanics, and Histology, 2) Developing a pilot and feasibility grant program for investigators, with direct mentorship, whereby new approaches, ideas, and collaborations can be developed prior to seeking extramural funding, and 3) Developing educational and research enrichment programs spanning tissue types, research approaches, and paradigms, through which members can learn from national leaders and from each other. High quality musculoskeletal research is currently being conducted by many groups at Penn. While many bring sophisticated approaches to bear on musculoskeletal problems, few groups have the required expertise and facilities to perform high quality and specialized assays in their own labs.  Furthermore, most investigators are not aware of approaches utilized, and results obtained, in other tissues that may have direct relevance on their research questions. Ultimately, close cooperation, communication, and collaboration among researchers across musculoskeletal tissue types and from a wide variety of disciplines will significantly enhance the research of our members. The Center will provide opportunities to integrate multi-disciplinary techniques to determine mechanisms for tissue function, injury, degeneration, repair, and regeneration, with the ultimate goal of advancing the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and injuries of the musculoskeletal system."

Recognizing the significant need for rigorous research training in urology, we propose to extend and expand the program to include adult and pediatric urology. The current T32 program is now completing its third year. To date, we have been highly successful at recruiting trainees of diverse backgrounds, skills and interests. We are particularly proud of our trainees' performance, including those directly supported by the T32, and others who have benefitted from the infrastructure the T32 has provided and the collaborative spirit it has fostered. While our clinical research programs are particularly strong, we are committed to maintaining a flexible and rigorous training program that leverages the broad scientific excellence of Stanford University. Research opportunities available to candidates have diversified and expanded. Our program is interdisciplinary, as 27 of the 37 Training Faculty hold primary or secondary appointments in basic science departments or Institutes (Chemical and Systems Biology, Developmental Biology, Molecular & Cellular Physiology, Computer Science, Cardiovascular Institute, Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine), Health Research and Policy, or other research institutes and/or graduate schools at the University. It should be emphasized that ours is the only program at Stanford specifically directed at training scientists for research and teaching careers in adult and pediatric nephrology (and if expanded, in urology). Thus, continuation of this program - newly titled as the Adult and Pediatric Nephrology and Urology Research Training Program - is essential for Stanford to function as a major training center in kidney and urologic disease research."
"9353803","PROJECT SUMMARY - ABSTRACT  The maintenance of salt and water balance is essential to the functional stability of the macromolecules that carry on the business of life. Failure to properly maintain osmotic equilibrium is a contributing factor to the pathologies of nearly every organ system. Changes in extracellular osmolality are detected by osmoreceptors, cells that are osmosensitive and capable of producing an effector, typically a hormone, that is capable of restoring osmotic equilibrium. Because little is known about the modulation of osmoreceptors, the characterization of osmotically and hormonally induced regulation of osmoregulatory effectors represents a promising tool to advance our fundamental knowledge on how to counteract osmoregulatory disequilibrium. This approach can be especially valuable if the model for characterization of such regulatory mechanisms is naturally and strongly responsive to subtle, physiologically appropriate, osmotic stimuli. By employing an accessible fish cell model that is remarkably sensitive and responsive to physiological changes in extracellular osmolality, we seek to identify novel mechanisms that regulate osmoreception and autocrine regulation. The proposed research comprises two main overlapping goals: 1) Characterize the effects of autocrine regulation of a potent osmoregulatory hormone, the tilapia prolactin (Prl), on Prl cells. Tilapia Prl cells are an established vertebrate endocrine model for osmoreception. A fall in extracellular osmolality stimulates its main secretory product, Prl, which exerts ion-retaining activity on target osmoregulatory tissues. Preliminary evidence indicates that the autocrine regulation of two isoforms of Prl are differentially modulated by extracellular osmolality; and 2) identify the mechanism(s) underlying changes in osmotically-modulated autocrine regulation. Two Prl receptors have been identified and shown to be differentially osmosensitive. Their involvement in the mediation of autocrine regulation by Prls will be assessed pharmacologically. Findings from the proposed studies shall provide fundamental knowledge on the regulation of osmoreceptors and endocrine cells, which may ultimately lead to the development of therapeutic intervention strategies for osmoregulatory dysfunction."
"9324301","Transitioning from pediatric to autonomous adult care is a vulnerable period when many adolescents drop out of HIV treatment programs. In contrast to trends in adult HIV infection where mortality is decreasing, rates of mortality among infected adolescents are increasing in many settings, underscoring the need for improved transitional care. Standardized transition tools, such as the US-based Got Transition model, have been developed to help children, caregivers, and providers plan for and execute transition across diverse chronic diseases; these tools are effective, and widely utilized in the US. However, transition tools are largely untested in settings with high HIV prevalence, and there are few systematic approaches to transition being used in Africa. Furthermore, effective transition can only occur alongside HIV disclosure, which can be delayed due to caregiver concerns about coping, guilt, or inadvertent loss of confidentiality. Transitional care and pediatric HIV disclosure are complementary urgent priorities for adolescents with HIV. We propose to adapt the Got Transition tool for use in Kenya where we have previously observed low rates of retention and disclosure among adolescents. We will utilize nationwide electronic medical records (KenyaEMR) to determine rates of successful transition in existing youth treatment programs, and determine predictors of successful transition (Aim 1). We will conduct interviews with adolescents, caregivers, healthcare workers and policy-makers to inform adaptation of the Got Transition tool for use in Kenya (Aim 2). Finally, we will test a combined intervention package consisting of the adapted transition tool plus a previously validated disclosure tool in a cluster randomized trial (Aim 3). This proposal builds on a >25 year HIV research collaboration between the University of Washington, the University of Nairobi, and the Kenya National AIDS/STI Control Programme (NASCP). Our collaboration with NASCOP enables us to conduct research that is impactful, locally relevant, and aligned with national programmatic approaches to facilitate implementation at scale. Adapting the established Got Transition model for use in Kenya and combining this with the disclosure toolkit is an efficient approach to address the continuum between pediatric to adult HIV care, and is expected to result in a novel product that can be implemented nationally. The study will additionally provide important evidence for a generalizable approach to improve disclosure and transition for adolescents with HIV infection throughout Africa."

"9305047","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vast majority of prostate Cancer (PCa) are histologically classified as adenocarcinoma (AdenoCa), characterized by gland formation and expression of luminal markers androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). It is recognized that some cases of PCa are indolent and require no treatment while others can be treated by local therapies. Advanced PCa is treated by hormonal therapy which eventually fails and progresses to castration resistant PCa (CRPC). Some of the recurrent tumors do not form glands or express luminal markers and are known as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC). Abiraterone and Enzalutamide have recently been approved for CRPC but disease resistance develops quickly. A multi-institutional team has been assembled to biopsy metastatic PCa from 300 men who have failed both conventional and second-line hormonal therapies. From the initial 150 cases, we discovered that some tumors maintain the histology of AdenoCa, while 15% of the tumors have SCNC histology. 30% of the tumors have an intermediate histology which we have named CYBAC (Cytologically Bland Aggressive Carcinoma). While SCNC and CYBAC have uniformly poor prognosis (median survival 6-9 months), patients with metastatic AdenoCa have highly variable outcomes. The novel disease biology poses challenges to clinicians and the research community. The proposal attempts to address some of the most urgent clinical issues with the following specific aims: Aim 1. Identify biomarkers that predict the prognosis of patients with metastatic AdenoCa: We will determine if Gleason grading, which is the best predictor of clinical outcome for primary PCa, can predict the outcome of men with metastatic AdenoCa. We will also determine if certain immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based biomarkers can be used to predict outcome in these patients. Aim 2. Establishing diagnostic criteria for the newly identified PCa histologic variant CYBAC: We have established histologic criteria for the newly identified CYBAC. To help pathologists diagnose this disease entity with confidence, we will establish IHC profile of CYBAC to complement the histology criteria."
"9308717","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines health disparities as the differences in the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups in the United States. Accumulated data now shows that frequently noted disparities are those between ethnic, racial, and income groups. However other factors also determine health outcomes and include age, disability, gender, geographic location, ability to speak English and other social, environmental and psychological factors. Even policies governing violence - domestic, gun and gang, which is very prevalent in our target area - have a fairly significant impact on disparities.  The NIMHD is committed to the challenge of closing the gap in health care across social, ethnic, and racial groups in the U.S. To assist NIMHD in achieving this goal, the Health Research Policy Consortium (HPRC) project will establish Transdisciplinary Collaborative Centers (TCCs) that draw upon regional coalitions of academic institutions, community organizations, providers, and government to focus on priority research. The approach includes the following: (1) Establish regular channels of communication with stakeholders. (2) Oversee patient acquisition. (3) Leverage the power of Information Communication and Technology. (4) Identify specific metrics for the chosen disease area. (5) Regularly conduct periodic meetings and produce outcome analysis. (6) Report and upload the results to NIMHD for Congress. The TCCs will provide the practical steps on how evidence for addressing health disparities could be translated into practice, thus bridging the gap between surveillance and healthcare delivery and policy outcomes. The TCCs will focus on Prince George's County (PG County), MD, in particular, and will also broaden its scope to the Tri-state - DMV (DC, MD, VA) within Region III (VA, MD, DC, DE, PA, and WV). Cardiac Heart Diseases (CHD) is a chronic condition among the affected population groups in the region and is the disease area the TCC will study first. As a microcosm of the larger American landscape the areas will provide the TCC with diverse communities that have higher rates of morbidity and mortality across a broad range of disease conditions. The Pilot program is representative of American urban areas and, as such, will allow the pilot to be easily ported as a sustainable model with high predictive reliability across other high minority urban areas.          RELEVANCE: The HPRC project will establish TCCs to examine how health policies impede the access of ethnic and racial minorities to adequate and affordable health care. The TCCs will do this by first researching CHD in PG County, leveraging Information Technology to gather valuable data with the cooperation of community-based groups and healthcare providers. The TCCs will then make policy recommendations that will foster the reduction and elimination of disparities in health care."

The training grant fits well with and enhances the tremendous growth in neuroscience research in general, and neuroendocrinology in particular, enjoyed by the UCCOM over the years since our original submission. The faculty of the training program consists of highly qualified and well-funded investigators from diverse departments with a common interest in metabolic and stress homeostasis, and most of the faculty are located in contiguous space at the recently renovated Metabolic Diseases Institute (MDI) of the UCCOM. The primary purpose of our training structure is to enable students and fellows to understand and apply principles of homeostasis to their research, and to provide an environment that encourages students and fellows to explore research that involves more than one of the focus areas. In particular, we want to expose students to a broad array of advanced techniques that they can be incorporated into their ongoing and future research. The training for both pre- and post-doctoral trainees includes a blend of coursework, seminars and journal clubs, and extensive one-on-one instruction, and at all levels there is an emphasis upon ethics and the responsible conduct of research. We believe that we have achieved an outstanding record of accomplishment in terms of recruiting, training and placing highly qualified trainees, and that thi is particularly true for under- represented minority trainees. For this renewal application, we are requesting funding for 3 pre- doctoral students and 3 post-doctoral trainees as recommended by prior reviews. The pre- doctoral students will have passed their general exams and be supported for their doctoral thesis, and all trainees are anticipated to complete their training within 2 to 3 years."
"9323171","Project Summary Psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with hyperactive dopaminergic signaling in striatal pathways. Currently available treatments for schizophrenia are often effective in ameliorating psychotic symptoms but induce adverse parkinsonian-like effects that limit their long-term utility. Given the shortcomings of current antipsychotics, it is imperative that novel approaches be identified that can decrease dopamine release to provide clinical efficacy with reduced adverse effect liability. The finding that the M1/M4-preferring muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist xanomeline demonstrates robust antipsychotic efficacy for all symptom clusters of schizophrenia, generated a major interest in developing selective M1 and M4 agents. Highly selective M4 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) represent a promising therapeutic target for schizophrenia, but the mechanism underlying their antipsychotic efficacy is not well understood. Recent data from our laboratory suggests that selective activation of M4 receptors on medium spiny neurons results in a novel form of dopaminergic regulation and may, in part, be mediated by the metabotropic glutamate 1 receptor (mGlu1). We postulate that mGlu1 may provide a critical link for the antipsychotic-like effects of these compounds and may possess antipsychotic-like effects independently of M4 activation. However, validation of the therapeutic potential of mGlu1 has awaited development of an mGlu1 selective modulator. The Conn laboratory has successful developed both a positive and negative allosteric modulator (VU6004909 and VU0483650, respectively). This research proposal has been designed to develop the candidate?s technical research skills that are necessary to conduct independent neuropharmacology research, while having a positive impact on the field of glutamate systems biology and neuropsychiatric disorders. The proposed studies will bring together novel pharmacological and genetic tools to help define the functional roles of mGlu1 on neural circuity and subsequent antipsychotic-like actions. As such, we will utilize ex vivo and in vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), optogenetics and behavioral assays to investigate whether mGlu1 co-activation is required for M4 PAMs antipsychotic effects and reduction in striatal dopamine release. In addition to providing important new insights into the antipsychotic-like effects of M4 PAMs, these studies, coupled with previous genetic studies in schizophrenia patients, raise the possibility that deficits in mGlu1 signaling could enhance midbrain DA signaling and symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Therefore, we will elucidate whether selective activation of mGlu1 will have antipsychotic-like effects and reduce DA release in a manner similar to that of M4 PAMs. The studies outlined in this application represent a major breakthrough that promises to allow fundamental advances in the therapeutic approach for the treatment of schizophrenia."
"9308706","Defining the entire ensemble of molecular interactions and networks present in an organism (i.e., the Interactome) is essential for understanding the function, dynamics and logic underlying complex cellular systems. Large-scale efforts, involving both yeast-two-hybrid approaches and affinity-mass spectrometry, have begun to define large portions of the eukaryotic Interactome. While these approaches have proven effective for evaluating cytoplasmic interactions, they are inadequate for defining the interactions involving the 1/3 of the human proteome represented by secreted proteins and the ectodomains of integral membrane proteins. These proteins and their interactions are vital to cellular and multi-cellular processes as they detect the developmental, morphogenetic and environmental cues that are central to normal physiology and pathology. These receptor:ligand complexes also offer enormous promise as therapeutic targets and for the development of biologics to treat autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases and malignancies. At present there exists no platform to support the discovery of these extracellular interactions. To address this challenge, we have recently established strong proof-of-concept for two distinct high-throughput platforms for mapping of the ?Ecto-Interactome?, the entire set of interactions formed by secreted and cell surface proteins. These efforts exploit a multi-disciplinary team, composed of protein chemists, automation specialists and biologists, which is merging multiple protein expression/presentation strategies with cutting-edge cell microarray and flow cytometry technologies. The optimization and implementation of these platforms promises to have transformative impact by revealing extracellular interactions and networks that yield novel insights into normal physiology, disease and therapeutic strategies. We are positioned to make significant progress in assessing the feasibility of defining the Ecto-Interactome. Together with the considerable body of cytoplasmic interactions that is accruing, these studies will provide important insights into the full range of molecular circuitry that integrates multiple disparate signals into cellular and multi-cellular function."
"9335333","PROJECT ABSTRACT Stimulant drugs induce wide-spread epigenetic perturbations in the brain, but their effects on the epigenetic regulation of the latent HIV provirus and responses to latency-reversing therapies targeting this regulation are unknown. The central hypothesis of this application is that histone methylation by the SET and MYND domain- containing enzyme Smyd2 (also called KMT3C) is a robust latency-inducing mechanism and a new target for latency-reversing therapy in HIV+ cocaine users. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of preliminary results generated by the applicant identifying Smyd2, among 45 cellular lysine methyltransferases, as a top enzyme that suppresses HIV transcription in latent CD4+ T cells. It is also based on published work by others showing that expression of G9a, another methyltransferase linked to HIV latency, is decreased in the brain after chronic cocaine exposure, while expression of Smyd2 is unchanged. The central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Define how Smyd2 functions as transcriptional repressor in HIV latency. The working hypothesis is that Smyd2, by associating with the latent-HIV promoter in vivo, induces durable transcriptional repression despite cocaine exposure. The applicant will test this hypothesis with CRISPR/Cas9 gene?editing technology and by examining the mode of Smyd2 recruitment with and without cocaine exposure. She will also test latency reversal in response to small-molecule Smyd2 inhibitors in CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV+ cocaine users. 2) Determine the lysine methylation mark(s) set by Smyd2 at the latent HIV promoter. The working hypothesis is that monomethylation of lysine 20 at histone H4 (H4K20me1) is the main mark set by Smyd2 at the latent viral promoter during cocaine exposure. The applicant will test this hypothesis by determining the methyl marks introduced by Smyd2 using mass spectrometry and by performing chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) for Smyd2 histone?methyl marks in latent cells with and without cocaine treatment. 3) Identify the mechanism underlying how H4K20me1 induces HIV latency. The working hypothesis is that H4K20me1 at the latent provirus is bound by the MBT-containing protein L3MBTL1, which induces chromatin compaction and, thus, durable transcriptional repression and latency with cocaine exposure. The applicant will test this hypothesis by performing ChIP and histone accessibility assays (ATAC-Seq) to measure L3MBTL1 recruitment and chromatin compaction, respectively, in latent cells with and without cocaine exposure. Successful completion of this proposal will significantly enhance the understanding of epigenomic regulatory mechanisms in HIV/AIDS infection in combination with substance abuse in alignment with this RFA. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by shifting the focus in HIV latency research to monomethylation of histone H4, recruitment of L3MBTL1, and induction of histone compaction. Based on this work, the applicant expects to make important advances in therapies for HIV+ drug users and in improving the understanding of the epigenetics of drug use."
"9315164","?    DESCRIPTION:  The innate and adaptive immune response involves the recruitment of leukocytes from the blood stream to the site of infection and inflammation. Upon reaching the location, leukocytes clear invaders and begin the process of digesting and repairing damaged tissues. However, when the body fails to properly regulate the recruitment of leukocytes, the inflammation can become chronic, resulting in irreversible tissue injury and loss of functionality. Rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type-1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis are all examples of autoimmune diseases caused by the uncontrolled recruitment of leukocytes. While much research has been dedicated to the identification of the cascade of specific biochemical processes involved in the recruitment of leukocytes, much less is known about the mechanical events driving their migration, in particular how they generate the necessary traction forces to cross the vascular wall and further traverse the three- dimensional (3-D) extravascular space. Thus, the main objective of this study is to provide the much needed complementary information connecting specific cell molecular processes (i.e., adhesion dynamics, actin turnover, and myosin II contraction) to the generation of cellular forces that regulate leukocyte extravasation and their subsequent directional migration in 3-D extravascular tissues through the use of novel 3D Fourier Traction Force Microscopy (3DFTFM) techniques and genetic and pharmacological manipulations. To achieve this objective, we propose three Specific Aims. We will first characterize the temporal and spatial generation of 3-D traction forces exerted by leukocytes crawling on flat surfaces (Aim 1); we will then investigate the mechanical processes regulating transmigration across the vascular endothelial monolayer and the basement membrane (Aim 2); and finally, we will develop a novel Elastographic 3DTFM to determine both traction stresses and the non-linear material properties of the Extra Cellular Matrix to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating the mechanics of leukocytes' chemotactic migration in 3-D environments (Aim 3). The proposed in vitro approach overcomes a number of existing challenges to measuring the 3-D traction forces driving leukocyte extravasation and migration and builds on the extensive experience accumulated by our multidisciplinary team of biologists and engineers who have been studying the mechanics of amoeboid cell migration for the last seven years. The outcome of this research will result in a far more comprehensive understanding of the mechanics of leukocyte motility than that available to date and will have the potential to aid the development of new approaches that could target specific mechanical processes to inhibit (or slow down) leukocyte motility and help in the design of complementary regimens to treat inflammatory diseases."
"9309018","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a high-throughput method to test the functional activity of cis-regulatory elements in vivo, in specific cell types. Powered by Next Generation Sequencing, a range of high-throughput methods can generate data that allow investigators to predict the locations of potential cis-regulatory elements in the genome. Collectively these methods have generated hundreds of thousands of predictions. A major problem is that there are no corresponding technologies to validate the cis-regulatory activity of these predictions in vivo. To address this problem we propose to develop a massively parallel reporter gene assay to test the activity of cis-regulatory elements and their allelic variants in vivo, in specific cell types. Our plan is to develop methods to create large libraries of cis regulatory elements in lentiviral-based reporters, and to develop methods to assay the activity of these libraries from specific populations of cells in vivo. We propose to develop this technology first to study cis-regulation in specific cell types of the brain, but the approach will generalizeto a large range of cell types from different tissues in different organisms. Successful completion of our aims will result in a high-throughput method for testing the effects of cis-regulatory polymorphism in vivo, in specific cell types. Since a large fraction of disease causing variants are thought to reside in non-coding DNA, a scalable method to test the effects of allelic variation in cis-regulatory elements would have a large impact on the field."
"9388261","Abstract N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common messenger RNA and long noncoding RNA modification in eukaryotes. Through its effects on RNA processing, export, translation, and decay, m6A influences diverse processes including stem cell differentiation, energy homeostasis, and spermatogenesis. The cellular functions of m6A are mediated through its recognition by m6A reader proteins. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (HNRNPG) is a novel m6A reader protein that functions in neural development and regulates several alternative splicing events linked to neuromuscular diseases. Our preliminary data indicate that m6A influences the cellular localization of HNRNPG, and that m6A and HNRNPG co-regulate the alternative splicing of ~1,000 m6A-containing transcripts. To investigate how m6A regulates HNRNPG localization, I will examine the function of a specific m6A-modified lncRNA in the nuclear retention of HNRNPG, and I will determine the role of nucleo- cytoplasmic shuttling in the cellular function of HNRNPG. To investigate how m6A impacts HNRNPG-regulated alternative splicing events, I will use a pull-down approach to identify splicing factors that are recruited to m6A- modified transcripts by HNRNPG, and I will examine how knockdown of these splicing factors influences alternative splicing. Using the m6A reader HNRNPG as a model, these studies will elucidate novel mechanisms by which m6A influences protein localization and alternative splicing, two crucial cellular processes that are disrupted in a variety of human diseases."
"9281779","The Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited form of mental disability, is caused by transcriptional  inactivafion ofthe FMRI gene. FMRI encodes FMRP, an RNA-binding protein that associates with about  1000 mRNAs in the brain. FMRP represses mRNA translation by impeding ribosome translocation, thereby  reducing the rate of polypeptide elongation. Thus in the absence of FMRP, protein synthesis in the brain is  aberrantly high, which causes the disease. CPEB is a second RNA binding protein in the brain, but instead  of repressing translation like FMRP, it stimulates translation by inducing cytoplasmic polyadenylation. The  FMRP knockout (KO) mouse is an exceptionally useful tool for studying Fragile X. FMRP/ CPEB double  (dKO) mice display re-balanced translation in the brain such that overall rates of protein synthesis are  normal. Moreover, all measured electrophysiolgoical, morphological, and behavioral phenyoptes that are  defective in FMRP KO mice are rescued to wild type (WT) or near WT levels in dKO mice. Acute depletion  of CPEB in the hippocampus of adult FMRP KO mice rescues hippocampus-dependent working memory.  The rate of polypeptide elongation is restored to WT levels in FMRP/CPEB dKO brains, demonstrating that  ribosome translocation is the underlying molecular defect causing the Fragile X syndrome. Aim 1 tests the  hypothesis that CPEB-associated factors that comprise the cytoplasmic polyadenylation complex are also  involved in FMRP regulated translation, behavior, and synapse function. Aim 2 employs a novel genomewide  method to identify the mRNAs whose translation is rescued in FMRP/CPEB dKO brains. Aim 3  employs another new genome-wide method to test the hypothesis that the polyadenylation of specific  mRNAs is necessary for rescue of Fragile X phenotypes in FMRP/CPEB dKO brains. These studies will  address the molecular causes of Fragile X and will indicate novel therapies to treat the disease."
"9298390","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) continue to be a significant public health concern among American adolescents. AUDs are commonly accompanied by co-occurring psychiatric disorders including depression. This comorbidity has been associated with increased severity of AUD, earlier treatment termination, poorer outcomes, and increased suicidal risk. Presently there is neither a consensus nor a standard, evidence-based intervention to address the need for an effective and feasible treatment for both disorders. However, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective for each of these disorders, separately. In addition, in some, but not all, adolescents with both disorders, depression appears to respond rapidly to CBT that targets only alcohol or substance abuse. This suggests that early depression responders (EDRs) may not need additional treatment that targets depression directly, unlike their non-early responding NEDR counterparts. However, no studies have compared longer term outcomes of adolescent EDRs to NEDRs. Moreover, no randomized, controlled studies have tested the hypothesis that an integrated CBT intervention for co-occurring AUD and depression will be effective for both disorders, in NEDR adolescents.  In this two-site study, submitted in response to PA: PAS-10-251, we will recruit 170 eligible adolescents (102 at the University of Connecticut and 68 at Duke University), ages 13 to 18, with AUD and clinically significant depression. All subjects will receive 12-weeks of Motivation Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive Behavior Therapy (MET/CBT-12), a standard, evidence-based intervention for alcohol or drug abuse. After four weeks, NEDR adolescents will be randomized to depression treatment augmentation, either with seven sessions of CBT (CBT-D), integrated with MET/CBT-12, or with enhanced depression-treatment-as-usual in the community (D-ETAU). We estimate that 120 adolescents will be randomized; we will stratify randomization on gender, age, and presence/absence of a Major Depressive Episode. We will assess all 170 participants at baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 12 (after treatment), and at 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up.  The first aim of this study is to describe the percentage of depressed AUD adolescents who demonstrate EDR during alcohol abuse treatment alone, examine EDR durability and EDR predictors. The second and third aims test the hypotheses that, for NEDR teens, an integrated treatment augmentation (CBT- D) will lead to better depression and alcohol outcomes, respectively, than augmentation with D-ETAU. We will compare outcomes of all three groups (EDRs; and NEDRs in each augmentation), on alcohol use, depressive symptoms, alcohol-related functional impairment, maintenance of alcohol treatment gains, and depression remission rates over time, and will analyze the temporal ordering of changes in alcohol use and depression during and after treatment. This is the first study to test an adaptive treatment model with depressed AUD youths, and thus has significant potential to guide clinical practice."
"9301660","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K23 application is submitted by Michael A. Dimyan, MD, Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University Of Maryland School Of Medicine. My long-term goal is to become an independent clinical investigator focusing on the neural substrates of arm motor control as a basis for developing interventions to improve neurorehabilitation after stroke. This K23 award will allow me to pursue advanced training in arm motor control and their neurophysiological substrates. I will train in the technique of concurrent multimodal neurophysiology and imaging. This training will be applied to investigating the dynamic modulation of interhemispheric inhibition throughout the time-course of arm activity, with a goal of identifying targets for intervention to enhance arm rehabilitation after stroke. I will be mentored by a team of experts in clinical neurorehabilitation, arm motor control, neurophysiology and multi-modal imaging including Dr. George Wittenberg, Dr. Jill Whitall, Dr. Rao Gullapalli and Dr. Peter Gorman.  Even after comprehensive rehabilitation, 30% of stroke survivors are left with arm weakness. Chronic hemiparesis is significant because 50% of the reduction in quality of life for stroke survivors is due to arm weakness. Current treatments of hemiparesis are based on different models of how the two arms interact after stroke. However, these models are limited by an incomplete understanding of interhemispheric competition. In particular, we do not know how interactions between the two arms are dynamically modulated during arm activity. I will pursue this problem by 1) defining normal interhemispheric interactions between the two arms during unilateral arm activity 2) discovering how aging and stroke impair those dynamics and 3) determining how other brain areas influence the interaction between the two arms. This will be done by studying neurophysiological measures of corticospinal and interhemispheric interactions in hemiparetic patients and healthy controls performing an arm activity. I will also use multimodal neurophysiological and imaging techniques to examine brain network interactions and their influence on corticospinal activity. The proposed research is innovative conceptually in its elaboration and addition to the model of interhemispheric interactions during movement and after stroke. The results of this research may significantly contribute to our understanding of the interaction between the two arms. This is important because it will allow us to design therapies that take advantage of those interactions. The impact of this proposal is that it will allow us to design interventions that taret specific neurophysiological impairments at specific time-points during movement to enhance rehabilitation after stroke. This research proposal addresses the NIH missions to reduce the burden of neurological disorders and enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. This proposal also addresses the goals of the NIH BRAIN initiative to develop a dynamic picture of the human brain describing how neural circuits interact in time and space."
"9488844","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram negative bacterium which poses a serious threat to immunocompromised patients as well as those with cystic fibrosis. Resistance of this bacterial pathogen to antibiotics is the main cause of therapeutic failure. B-lactams are important anti-pseudomonas antibiotics and bacterial resistance to this class of antibiotics involves multiple mechanisms, but occurs primarily through overexpression of class C ?-lactamase (AmpC), which is insensitive to ?-lactamase inhibitors currently used in clinic. We have recently identified and characterized the ampG gene in this bacterium, which encodes a membrane transporter involved in cell wall recycling and is essential for the ampC expression. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa with ampG mutation is much more sensitive to ?-lactams than the ampC mutant, indicating that the AmpG is required for multiple mechanisms of ?-lactam resistance. Consistent with this, sensitivity to ?-lactams can be restored among pan-?-lactam resistant clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa by knocking out their ampG genes, demonstrating AmpG is an ideal target for the control of resistance. In this proposal, we intend to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of AmpG-dependent resistance against ?-lactams and identify effective AmpG inhibitors for clinical application. As cell wall recycling is a common process among Gram Negative bacteria, the AmpG inhibitors will be effective against broad spectrum of bacteria. Effective AmpG inhibitors can help us to fight against ?-lactam resistant pathogens while bring ineffective ?-lactams to life, expanding our arsenals against the deadly bacterial infections."
"9335230","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In principle, delegating risk should encourage large integrated provider groups to achieve efficiencies. As suggested by our prior work, risk-bearing plans in Medicare Advantage (MA) may produce greater value than Traditional Medicare (TM) in terms of quality of care and resource use, but because MA plans are typically not clinically integrated with providers, the influence they can exert on contracting providers may be more limited relative to Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). In Project 3, we will conduct rigorous evaluations of ACO initiatives in TM to determine if direct risk contracting with integrated provider groups is a viable complementary strategy for Medicare to control spending while improving quality of care. The gains achieved by an ACO will be determined by the changes in payment incentives introduced through its contracts with Medicare and other payers and its capacity to limit utilization and improve quality of care in response to those incentives. As suggested by previous research, the ability of ACOs to deliver more cost-effective care may be related to structural characteristics such as size, specialty mix, and integration with hospitals. In particular, advanced models of primary care such as the patient-centered medical home have been proposed as essential building blocks of high-performing ACOs. As potential predictors of performance under new payment incentives, these factors may also influence organizations' decisions to participate in the Medicare ACO programs. Project 3 will identify conditions systematically related to effective responses by organizations to ACO payment models. We focus on organizations participating in the Medicare ACO programs because of their large number (we anticipate over 400 ACOs in our analysis), their diversity, and the concentration of concurrent commercial ACO contracts among them. We will link novel national databases on provider organizations, their structural capabilities, and their commercial ACO risk contracting to claims data to identify and describe ACOs and non-ACO provider groups. By elucidating predictors of program participation and responses by organizations, our project will provide an empirical basis for fostering organizational learning from high performers, improving the structure of ACO contracts, and estimating potential gains from program expansion to existing and newly integrated provider groups. By assessing spillover effects of ACO contracts in Massachusetts on ACOs' patients not included in those contracts, our project will also characterize the extent of organizational change elicited by mixed payment incentives and the potential benefits of aligning incentives across payers."

"9354263","Summary ? Core B This Core has been a critical component of this Program since its beginning, providing to the Projects all human tissue specimens and performing initial tissue processing of those specimens, as well as animal specimens. Irrespective of its consistent value, Core B has been reconfigured over various funding periods to reflect changes in the manner of participation by the team members based in the United Kingdom and the contributions made by those resources to the overall goals of the Program. The organization of Core B has also been adapted to evolving goals in this renewal application. Notably, the collections maintained at Imperial College ? London by will be incorporated into Core B, and this greatly expands availability of diverse, well- characterized human tissue specimens. As a consequence, the Core will no longer need to collect material from new autopsies, as the combined resources of the two institutions provide sufficient material for the needsof Program investigators. One important resource remains the 3D-dissected discrete structures, e.g., olfactory,hippocampus, etc., flash-frozen in for molecular and biochemical analysis in Projects 1, 2 and 3. Other Core B deliverables include: i) 3D dissection of the fresh left half of each animal brain for use by Projects; and ii) collection of blocks from the formalin-fixed right half of either human or animal brains that will be sectioned,immunohistologically reacted, digitally imaged, and image-captured according to investigator requirements. Providing these Core services will enhance and facilitate achievement of the aims of each Project as consistent dissections and staining techniques are supplied, allowing among other things, comparisons across the various Projects. Standardized protocols, record keeping, and primary data analysis? hallmarks of the work of Core's traditions?are vital for successful completion of the specific aims of the Projects in this Program."
"9302819","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 application summarizes a five-year training program for the development of the academic career of Dr. Sarbattama Sen in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine. Dr. Sen has already shown that she is committed to becoming a leader in the field of maternal obesity research. This career training award would allow her to pursue formal training through a Master's degree in Clinical and Translational Research, with a focus on designing interventions and conducting clinical trials to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. She will benefit from the experience of an expert mentoring team. Her primary mentor will be Dr. Simin Meydani, Professor of Nutrition and Immunology at Tufts University and a renowned expert in micronutrient intervention studies. Her co-mentors will be Dr. Marlene Goldman, an expert in antioxidant interventions and reproductive health, Dr. David Greenblatt, an expert in pharmacologic interventions and obesity and Dr. Norma Terrin, an expert in clinical trial design. Dr. Diana Bianchi and Dr. Jonathan Davis will serve as career mentors. The academic environment at Tufts University and The Department of Pediatrics at Tufts Medical Center/Floating Hospital for Children is an ideal training environment, with an established track record of successfully transitioning junior faculty to independent researchers. In addition, Tufts University and the Jean Mayer USDA HNRCA provide an unparalleled combination of resources, core facilities, intellectual expertise and potential collaborations in nutrition and obesity research. The proposed research project, BMI-based prenatal vitamins to ameliorate oxidative stress in obese pregnancy, is a novel intervention aimed at decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, key abnormalities in the intrauterine milieu of obese pregnancy. Dr. Sen previously identified the importance of oxidative stress in the causative pathway of intergenerational obesity in an animal model, and her pilot data shows that oxidative stress is markedly increased, and anti-oxidant defenses markedly depleted, in obese pregnant women. This trial is a logical extension of this previous work. Her central hypothesis is that obese pregnancy is characterized by an oxidant/anti-oxidant imbalance, which increases inflammation and adversely impacts maternal health and neonatal outcome. Restoring oxidant/anti-oxidant balance with a body mass index-based prenatal micronutrient supplement will decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. This hypothesis will be tested in a randomized controlled trial in obese pregnant women. Given its overwhelming current and future impact, innovative approaches to diminish the effect of maternal obesity on future generations are of paramount public health importance."
"9354528","Project Summary/Abstract The discovery of iPSCs provides an unprecedented opportunity for any scientist to derive an inexhaustible supply of patient-derived primary cells. These cells containing each patient's own genetic background can now be applied for in vitro human disease modeling, drug screening of personalized therapeutics, and the development of future regenerative cell-based therapies. The most valuable human clones already generated by the CTSA investigators collaborating on this proposal not only carry common disease-associated mutations and polymorphisms, but also carry knock-in fluorochrome reporters targeted to specific loci through state-of-the-art gene editing technologies. The goal of this proposal is the establishment of a CTSA network of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) repositories and iPSC cores that will enable advanced disease modeling using >1000 existing normal and disease specific human cell lines and banking 6,000 additional samples procured from the 2nd and 3rd generation participants of the Framingham Study. A concerted effort for curation, sharing, and distribution of this vital resource across all CTSAs does not exist. This proposal thus creates a CTSA iPSC Network led by teams who have championed an `Open Source Biology' approach, freely sharing iPSC lines and their reprogramming reagents with more than 500 labs to date across the globe. Its goals are to make patient-derived iPSCs together with the tools and expertise for their genetic manipulation available to the greater research community on a large scale to realize their promise for extending understanding of disease and developing potential therapies. To achieve these goals, it proposes: a) national sharing of >1000 iPSC lines already derived by the CTSA teams collaborating in this proposal, representing a critical resource in high demand by both basic and clinical researchers, b) development and support of formalized education and training programs able to nationally disseminate the expertise required to fully harness these new tools and differentiate them into the wide diversity of human cell lineages, c) maintenance and sharing of open source gene-editing tools and gene edited iPSC lines that will enable CTSA investigators to manipulate the human genome at will, and d) derivation for national sharing of additional iPSC lines generated from the most densely clinically and genetically phenotyped cohort of individuals currently followed in the USA today: the ~6,000 participants of the second and third generations of the Framingham Study."
"9320773","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reactivation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in response to antiandrogen therapy renders the disease immune to available treatment options and is ultimately lethal. Currently, antiandrogen therapeutics block AR signaling by direct inhibition of androgen-AR interactions or indirectly through depletion of circulating androgens. The CRPC phenotype can arise from multiple cellular mechanisms including gain of function mutations to the AR gene or compensatory function by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), another nuclear hormone receptor which binds to a nearly identical DNA response element as AR. While AR and GR signaling can be blocked by other DNA targeted therapeutics these compounds induce genotoxicity in tumor and healthy cells alike. The genotoxic effects in the tumor microenvironment often lead to a more aggressive treatment resistant phenotype.  The Dervan laboratory has pioneered the development of Py-Im polyamides for targeting double- stranded DNA. These small molecules achieve affinities and specificities similar to DNA binding proteins, localize to the cell nucleus, bind chromatin, and modulate endogenous gene expression in cell culture. The minor groove binding Py-Im polyamides have been shown to inhibit both transcription factor-DNA binding (AR-ARE) and RNA polymerase II elongation without DNA cleavage. Our aims are focused on a series of Py-Im polyamides that bind the DNA sequence found within both canonical androgen and glucocorticoid response elements. The Py-Im polyamides will be examined against several models of prostate cancer that represent androgen insensitive disease. This project includes the study of prostate cancer xenografts in mice to determine the activity of polyamides against tumors derived from CRPC-relevant cell lines. Biodistribution analysis of recent polyamides with an optimized toxicity profile will be carried out in vivo using both pharmacokinetic analysis and dosimetry (14C label). We will investigate the in vivo chromatin binding of the polyamides using ChIP-Seq to validate the genomic binding profiles.  Our long-term goal has been to develop a chemical method of modulating gene expression relevant for the treatment of cancer progression. The proposed research is significant because it will demonstrate that the mechanisms of resistance in prostate cancer can be attenuated with DNA-binding polyamides. Furthermore, this study will better our understanding of the effects of polyamide treatment against androgen insensitive prostate cancer in vivo, and contribute to the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of CRPC."
"9518247","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will provide the applicant, Dr. Engelmann, with protected time, resources, and training to help him transition into the role of an independent researcher in the field of addiction neuroscience. Dr. Engelmann's primary research interest is to identify brain systems and deficiencies that predispose smokers to relapse. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States, and the health benefits of quitting are well known. However, most smokers who try to quit relapse. Thus, it is important to develop more effective smoking-cessation therapies. A promising approach for developing better therapies may be to target brain processes involved in relapse. Thus, Dr. Engelmann's career goal is relevant to public health and to the scope of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), because improving smoking-cessation outcomes will reduce the burden of smoking on human health. To help Dr. Engelmann become an independent researcher, we propose a plan that will provide training and research experience under the mentorship of established, independent scientists. Training will focus on two areas: 1) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a non-invasive technique for measuring brain activity, and 2) addiction psychopharmacology, which includes pharmacological treatment of nicotine dependence. With respect to each of these areas, the applicant will complete formal coursework and hands-on training and publish research findings. Research experience will include completion of a project that addresses two specific aims: 1) determine how the imminent possibility of smoking affects brain responses to cigarette-related cues and 2) determine the immediate effect of smoking on brain responses to these cues. This project is a major step forward in understanding neural processes involved in smoking relapse. Relapse often occurs in the presence of cigarette-related cues when smoking is imminently possible. However, previous brain imaging research was limited to situations where smoking was not imminently possible. The proposed project, by studying the imminent possibility and immediate effects of smoking, provides a more ecologically valid model of how these factors may precipitate smoking relapse. To achieve our specific aims, 50 smokers will complete an fMRI session in which they will smoke cigarettes inside the fMRI scanner through a special device. We will compare brain responses to cigarette cues between trials where smokers are told that they cannot smoke (i.e., smoking not possible) and trials where they are told that there is a possibility that they can smoke (i.e., smoking imminently possible). We expect brain responses in areas involved in emotional processing to be largest when smoking is imminently possible. Our findings will potentially identify new neurobiological targets for effective smoking-cessation medications. Dr. Engelmann plans to apply for future grant support to use fMRI to study the effects of existing and new medications on these targets. The training and research activities proposed in this application will help him become an independent researcher capable of obtaining this support."
"9331741","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this consortium is to establish tools that can be used as biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective assays of social impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials. Specifically, we aim to accelerate the development of effective treatments for social impairment in ASD by validating (a) outcome measures that will be sensitive and reliable assessments of response to treatment and EEG and (b) eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used to reduce heterogeneity of samples via stratification, indicate early efficacy, and/or demonstrate target engagement. The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool (3-5 years) and school aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with IQ ranging from 50-115. Children will be assessed across three time points (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks, T3: 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status. This battery measures key facets of social-communication in ASD using well-validated paradigms appropriate for this developmental and cognitive range. Five Collaborating Implementation Sites (?Sites?), all highly experienced in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the methodologies proposed here in both typical and atypical development, will contribute equally to recruitment, screening, diagnosis, testing, and longitudinal assessment. The Data Coordinating Core (DCC) will provide a secure informatics infrastructure to streamline communication and data flow throughout the consortium to ensure organized, secure data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National Database for Autism Research and NIH/NIMH Data Repositories. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (DAAC) will oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for standardized data collection, processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core will oversee the operations of the Sites, the DCC, and the DAAC to coordinate with federal and private partners in this cooperative agreement to: 1) Compare whether LB measures versus clinician and caregiver assessments of social impairment are more sensitive indicators of clinical status; 2) Evaluate whether this set of ET and EEG measures, individually or in combination, has potential utility as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable measures of change in clinical trials, assessing viability in terms of: construct validity; test-retest reliability, consistency, and stability; discriminant validity ; convergent validity; and sensitivity to change; 3) Collect blood (DNA) samples from subjects and parents of ASD subjects for future genomic analyses and share raw, processed, and analyzed data to create a community resource accessible for use by all qualified investigators."
"9353423","?    DESCRIPTION:  Lung leaks from surgery, injury or diseases may result in lung collapse, which can be immediately life threatening. Treating a collapsed lung begins with emergent placement of a chest tube into the pleural space so that the accumulated air or liquid can be evacuated in order to re-inflate the lung. However, collapse often occurs in the setting of poorly healing tissue. Extensive tissue damage and chronic leak lead to substantial morbidity, mortality, and correspondingly high health care costs. To address these challenges, the proposed research will explore the use of a natural material, alginate, for use as a tissue sealant and therapeutic patch, to effectively treat lung leaks and aid in lung tissue regeneration. Chemically modified alginate, methacrylated alginate (Alg-MA), will be further modified to enhance adhesion to the lung surface to form a better seal. The use of the hydrogel as a drug carrier is also proposed to enhance wound healing. The overarching goal of our application is thus to establish the potential clinical efficacy of Alg- MA hydrogels as combination pleural sealants and therapeutic patches. The experimental design is centered on three aims: 1) to determine how the physical properties of Alg-MA hydrogels impact their capacity to seal a pleural leak, 2) to determine how Alg-MA hydrogel properties affect their capacity for dynamic mechanical stability and controlled release of drugs, and 3) to assess the ability of drug-eluting Alg-MA hydrogels to repair damaged pleural tissue in vivo. Alg-MA materials will be oxidized to enhance tissue adhesion, thus improving the burst pressure and sealant properties of the material. In addition, blending of Alg-MA with a similar natural material, hyaluronan (HA) will enhance the dynamic mechanical properties to ensure dynamic durability and longevity of leak prevention in vivo. To characterize the long-term use of the hydrogel sealant, adhesion and mechanical properties will be tailored to enhance degradation properties and drug release rates. An in vivo rodent model will be used to evaluate the efficacy of Alg-MA hydrogels as durable sealants and carriers for therapeutic drugs. Indeed, the broader impact of the proposed research is the development of a medical sealant for various uses, especially in cases when selective tissue adhesion is desired."

"9394914","Project Summary / Abstract  During neurodevelopment, more neurons are initially generated than are necessary. To prune away these superfluous neurons, neuronal death is required. While loss of neurons is necessary during development, neuronal death in the adult nervous system is highly detrimental, as these neurons must persist for the lifetime of the organism. As such, there need to exist tightly-regulated mechanisms that preserve neuronal viability. The identity of these pathways and whether they are perturbed in neurodegenerative disease remain poorly understood. The six-transmembrane protein GDE2 has been previously identified as a cell surface GPI-anchor cleaving enzyme that regulates Notch signaling during neurogenesis through the cleavage of GPI-anchored proteins. Recent evidence shows that levels of GDE2 and its GPI anchor-cleaving activity persist in the adult nervous system and that loss of GDE2 (Gde2-/-) results in slow, progressive neurodegeneration in mice. The proposed studies aim to define the neuropathology of Gde2-/- mice through immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses, to identify the downstream GPI-anchored proteins that mediate the neuroprotective function of GDE2, and to determine relevance for GDE2 dysfunction in human neurodegenerative diseases. Preliminary evidence identifies a target for GDE2 that mediates neuronal survival and demonstrates its altered processing in Alzheimer's disease patients. Taken together, these data suggest that GDE2 may regulate an important neuroprotective pathway that is perturbed in Alzheimer's disease. As the aging population grows, so too will the need for solutions to aging-associated diseases. With 5.3 million people afflicted with Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. alone and the annual rate of disease-related deaths increasing every year, finding an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease is crucial. Currently, Alzheimer's disease is being treated palliatively, and recent clinical trials have generally been ineffective, with most targeting behavioral symptoms or terminal pathologic features. Accordingly, there is a dire need for mechanism-based therapies and biomarkers that detect early signs of decline in patients. The proposed studies may uncover the potential for GDE2 and its GPI-anchored substrates as exciting and promising avenues for research in the quest for next generation Alzheimer's disease therapeutic targets and fluid biomarkers."
"9392092","Project Summary This proposal requests funds to be used to support travel and registration fees for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to attend the 42nd International Herpesvirus Workshop (IHW) in Ghent, Belgium, in 2017. The IHW is the major annual meeting for scientists studying all the herpesviruses and is very well established in its 42nd year. This meeting has been very successful, in part, because of the enthusiastic participation of the world?s leading herpesvirus researchers. The strength of the Workshop rests on the cross-fertilization that results from comparison of different herpesviruses, different approaches to key questions and on the support and participation of leading researchers in the field, most significantly including promising young investigators and students in training. Moreover, the forum is truly international, with broad-based world-wide attendance. The medical importance of this meeting is clearly indicated from the wide variety of diseases caused by the now-recognized eight human herpesviruses. These include skin and eye ulcerations (HSV-1), genital lesions (HSV-2), meningitis and encephalitis (HSV-1 and HSV-2), infectious mononucleosis (EBV), chicken pox and shingles (VZV). CMV is a major cause of birth defects including mental retardation, blindness and deafness due to congenital transmission but also a significant opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients and organ transplant recipients. More recently, CMV has been implicated as a pathogenic contributor in the development of atherosclerosis. Cancer has also been associated with herpesvirus infections. EBV is associated with Burkitt?s lymphoma, other B cell neoplasias and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The most recent human herpesvirus discovered (HHV-8 or KSHV) is associated with Kaposi?s sarcoma in AIDS patients and other immunosuppressed persons and in other groups. All of the herpesviruses persist for life and therefore pose significant problems in the treatment of immune-compromised individuals. Diseases caused by reactivation of most human herpesviruses are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in various immune patient populations. Workshop sessions will take an interdisciplinary approach to the following topics: virus structure, mechanism of virus entry and cell-cell spread, membrane proteins, pathogenesis and latency, DNA replication, vaccination and the immune response, transcriptional control, regulation of gene expression, chemotherapeutic targets, and virus gene therapy."
"9277247","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary essential hypertension is the major cardiovascular disease risk factor. Dietary salt intake is a putative driving force of blood pressure elevation; however, the mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. The central nervous system, heart and blood vessels, and kidney are primary participants and the kidney is the putative grand regulator of salt disposition and blood pressure. The overall goal of this work is t address whether or not local regulation of skin electrolyte metabolism is important for blood pressure control. Clinical evidence from pilot studies in humans and preliminary experimental data accumulated in our laboratory, support this hypothesis. Our data point to macrophage-derived vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) as a crucial factor controlling skin electrolyte homeostasis. VEGF-C promotes interstitial electrolyte clearance through the cutaneous lymph capillary network. Macrophages induce hyperplasia of subcutaneous lymph capillaries after sensing local Na+ or Cl- overload in the interstitium. The sensing function is accomplished by binding of the transcription factor tonicity-enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) to the promoter region of the VEGF-C gene. The cells exert their regulatory function by increasing VEGF-C expression and secretion. Blockade of this VEGF-C response from macrophages leads to skin electrolyte accumulation and arterial hypertension. We propose a comprehensive program to characterize the importance of TonEBP for macrophage-driven lymphatic regulation of skin electrolyte homeostasis in vivo (Aim 1). We will address whether or not disruption of subcutaneous lymph capillaries by selective VEGF-C depletion in the skin will lead to specific changes in skin electrolyte composition and increase blood pressure systemically (Aim 2). Finally, we will test whether macrophage-derived VEGF-C exerts its blood pressure-lowering effect via receptor binding to blood vessels, or by binding to cutaneous lymph vessels (Aim 3)."
"9313355","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The pattern of monosynaptic sensory-motor connections in the mammalian spinal cord is thought to be hard-wired, but there has been slow progress in identifying surface recognition systems that mediate input selectivity. Classical cadherins are known to delineate motor neuron subtypes according to their pool identities, and gain and loss of function studies have demonstrated that cadherin activity is required for the sorting of motor neurons into pools. Cadherins are also expressed by proprioceptive sensory neurons, and there is evidence for coordination in the profiles of cadherin expression by functionally interconnected sensory and motor neuron subsets. These observations raise the possibility of a developmentally relevant cadherin 'matching code' in which the homophilic or heterophilic interactions of paired cadherins expressed by sensory afferents and motor neurons promote adhesive interactions that direct synaptic specificity. This proposal aims to clarify the role of cadherin recognition in sensory-motor connectivity through a molecular analysis of the impact of classical cadherin inactivation in motor neurons. The early lethality of existing mouse motor neuron ß?-cat and N-cad mutants has precluded analysis of an independent role in sensory-motor connectivity. To bypass this problem we will use anatomy and physiology to examine sensory-motor connectivity profiles in viable ß?-cat and cadherin mutants, generated through the use of more selective cre driver lines that permit inactivation of target genes in restricted subsets of spinal motor neurons. We will examine whether selective disruption of  ß?-cat, N-cad or type II cadherins alone or in combination is sufficient to erode the fidelity of sensory motor connections. To probe further the mechanisms of motor neuron cadherin signaling we will use cell binding assays to explore the logic and specificity of interactions between N-cadherin and the many type II cadherins expressed by motor neurons. Together, these studies are intended to define the molecular basis of synaptic connectivity at sensory-motor synapses, a key early step in the establish ment of functional motor circuits."

"9315190","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients by renal transplant is severely limited by shortage of donor organs, while dialysis is expensive, inconvenient, and confers significant morbidity and mortality. There are nearly 400,000 people in the US who rely on thrice-weekly, in-center hemodialysis, and collectively, this population consumes over $30 billion annually in Medicare-paid healthcare. The prevalence of ESRD is increasing at 5% per year, and the vast majority of patients are unlikely to ever receive a transplant. We embarked on the development of an implantable artificial kidney (IAK) that combines a hemofilter constructed from silicon nanopore membranes (SNM) with a bioreactor of renal tubule cells to mimic nephronal function. In the final envisioned implementation, blood will be filtered in the hemofilter under circulatory system pressure to remove uremic toxins, salts, small solutes, and water. The resulting ultrafiltrate will then be processed by the bioreactor for volume homeostasis and electrolyte balance. The IAK could serve as a bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy for ESRD. In contrast to kidney transplant, the implantable device will not require the patient to be on immunosuppressive therapy. The proposed Quantum project addresses the advancement of key technologies towards a clinically practical device for long-term operation. One effort will investigate the conditions that optimize the tubule cells to resist phenotypic erosion. The other effort will focus on the design of the mechanically-robust and biocompatible device for ultrafiltration. In subsequent funding cycles, these efforts will be combined to first demonstrate a successful demonstration of the IAK in preclinical testing, and subsequently, first human subjects."
"9292258","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a significant problem for many Veterans, including new Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. It is also associated with a number of other significant problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and sleep problems. All of these can have significant negative effects of the quality of life of Veterans. Th current project seeks to help develop and evaluate two promising treatments that Veterans may find useful for helping them better manage chronic pain and its negative effects. Specifically, it s a randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of teaching skills in self-hypnosis and mindfulness meditation for reducing pain and improving the quality of life in Veterans. The project will also test hypotheses regarding how these treatment work by examining the meditating biological (e.g., brain activity measures), psychological (e.g., outcome expectancies), and social (e.g., therapeutic alliance) factors that could explain their effects. Potential moderators of treatment outcome (e.g., hypnotizability, baseline brain states) will also be examined. By better understanding the treatment effects of these interventions, as well as their mechanisms, and if the treatments are demonstrated to be effective as we anticipate they will be based on pilot and preliminary studies, Veterans will have more options for better managing chronic pain, and therefore maximizing the overall quality of their lives."

"9294043","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The world is suffering under a huge burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The discovery of new pathways controlling systemic energy homeostasis is badly needed. Adipose tissue is the major depot for lipid storage but also can become inflamed during obesity, contributing to certain dysfunctions in obesity. Brown fat dissipates chemical energy in the form of heat and represents an endogenous pathway to improve metabolic diseases. The past term of this MERIT award have allowed the discovery of key molecules and pathways in several aspects of adipose cell biology. We showed previously that PPAR? gets modified at serine 273 and this phosphorylation is both a cause of metabolic dysfunction in vivo and a key target for the PPAR? ligand drugs. We show here that we have created a germ-line mutation in mice whereby serine 273 of PPAR? is replaced by alanine, rendering it non-phosphorylatable. This mutant strain of animals represents a crucial opportunity to test the role of this modification in normal basal physiology and its role in obesity and insulin resistance. It also allows us to ask how much of the therapeutic effects of the PPAR? ligand drugs occur via the reduction in this phosphorylation event. New data shows that PPAR? docks the coregulator Thrap 3 only when it is phosphorylated at S273. We will study this interaction, using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques, including hydrogen-deuterium exchange. Importantly, we will create a series of deletions and mutations in both molecules that will better define this functional interface. This will also allow the creation of dominant negative alleles of Thrap 3. Th Thrap 3 /PPAR? interaction will be disrupted transgenically, either through the use of tissue-selective expression of a dominant-negative version of Thrap 3 or by making a tissueselective knock-out at the Thrap 3 locus. Animals bearing such transgenes will be perturbed with diet induced obesity, and analyzed by both MRI and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Our previous work has highlighted the crucial role that the coregulator PRDM16 plays in the fate and function of brown and beige adipose cells. In preliminary data, we have purified PRDM16 complexes from cultures enriched in beige fat cells and identified potentially interesting molecules, including LSD1, a lysine specific demethylase with a wellstudied pharmacology. We will identify important molecules in the PRDM16 complexes, especially those that distinguish beige and brown cells. To do this, we will purify PRDM16 complexes and perform comparative, quantitative proteomics by Mass Spectrometry after isobaric tagging. The function of proteins identified will be altered genetically by both gain and loss of function methods, in vitro and in vivo. Enzymes present in these complxes will be probed chemically, where the pharmacology is developed, as in the case of LSD1. The overall goal of this project will be to elucidate pathways of basic science that can inform novel therapeutic approaches to metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and hepatic steatosis."
"9352550","PROJECT SUMMARY Influenza virus is a serious pathogen in immunocompromised persons, especially hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. However, these individuals respond poorly to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). High dose (HD)-TIV has increased immunogenicity and efficacy in adults >65 years of age. It is not known whether a HD-TIV will be safe and immunogenic in severely immunocompromised persons. The standard measure of immunogenicity for TIV is hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that HD-TIV will be more immunogenic compared to standard dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) in adult HSCT recipients as evident by higher HAI antibody responses to influenza A antigens. The proposed study is a multi-center, phase II immunogenicity and safety trial comparing two doses of HD-TIV to standard dose QIV in adult HSCT recipients. A total of 138 patients (?18 years of age) who received an allogeneic HSCT and are 3-23 months post-transplant will be enrolled at the following clinical sites: Vanderbilt University Medical Center (lead site); Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. The specific aims are as follow: Specific Aim 1) to determine whether HD-TIV compared with standard dose QIV will increase the probability of achieving either a ?4-fold rise in HAI titer, a HAI titer ?1:40, or a higher geometric mean titer (GMT) to influenza A antigens in adult HSCT recipients; Specific Aim 2) to determine the frequency and severity of solicited local injection site adverse events and solicited systemic adverse events associated with HD-TIV compared with standard dose QIV in adult HSCT recipients; Specific Aim 3) to define the relationship between HAI titers, in vivo T and B cell phenotype, and in vitro influenza-specific T and B cell responses in adult HSCT recipients receiving either HD-TIV or standard dose QIV. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either 2 doses of 2017-2018 HD-TIV (60µg of each influenza antigen) or 2 doses of standard dose QIV (15µg of each influenza antigen). HAI and microneutralization titers to influenza virus antigens, phenotypic B and T cell responses, B and T cell specific influenza responses, complete blood count, quantitative CD4+/CD8+/CD19+ levels, and quantitative serum IgG and IgM concentrations will be measured prior to the first and second vaccine dose, 28-42 days after the second vaccine dose, and approximately 7 months after second vaccine. Solicited adverse events will be recorded by the subject seven days following vaccination and a telephone/email follow-up by study staff. The results of this study will fill a gap in knowledge regarding influenza vaccine responses in HSCT recipients and will guide vaccine recommendations in this vulnerable population."
"9302247","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions);    The mission of the Developmental Core (Core B) is to foster and support innovative, interdisciplinaiy research into the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS by Penn CFAR investigators; enhance the cadre of investigators studying HIV/AIDS by providing support and leadership for emerging investigators and facilitating entry into the field by researchers in other areas; and encourage and support innovative research in scientific priorities areas identified through CFAR strategic planning. In order to achieve these goals, the Developmental Core carries out three Specific Aims: (1) a Pilot Grant awards program that funds up to 6 developmental grants each year, evaluated through a rigorous peer review process for scientific merit and concordance with the mission of the Developmental Core and scientific priorities of the CFAR; (2) a Mentoring program to provide advice, support and leadership for the next generation of investigators to facilitate their transition into independent research careers in HIV/AIDS, and; (3) a series of workshops, working groups and outreach activities designed to bring together investigators from different but potentially interrelated areas to foster interdisciplinary interactions. In the 14 years since the Penn CFAR's inception (FY2000-2013), the Developmental Core has supported 77 pilot projects that have resulted in significant new knowledge of HIV/AIDS: supported the development of research priorities identified through the CFAR strategic planning process: served as the springboard to independent research careers of junior scientists: and led to subsequent funding of multiple research grants from NIH and other sources with an investment of $2.9M in pilot funding and a total of $55 million in new funding, for a 19 to 1 return on investment in developmental funding support.

"9301069","The Neuropathology and Functional Imaging Core will provide neuropathological and physiological services focused on the evaluation of both patients with myotonic dystrophy and mouse models of the disease. The Neuropathology component will provide neuropathological characterization of patients who have died with myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2). The objective is to define the distribution and nature of the neuropathological alterations associated with DM1 and DM2, with a particular emphasis on correlation with antemortem neuroimaging and/or clinical CNS-related deficits in patients who have been studied in Project 3. The Core will aid investigators in Projects 1 and 2 by providing histological services and tissues with a major focus on correlating the neuropathological findings in the transgenic mouse models with those of the corresponding human diseases to understand pathological mechanisms.    The Functional Imaging component of the Core will provide functional assessments of the cerebral cortical circuitry in the mouse models developed by Projects 1 and 2 and test in the mouse models for abnormalities identified in DM patients by Project 3. The Core will use optical imaging and single cell electrophysiological recordings to characterize the cerebral cortical circuitry in vivo. As DM patients have exaggerated sensitivity to sedatives and stimulants, the Core will investigate whether cerebral cortical circuits show altered sensitivity to these drugs. Flavoprotein imaging has revealed correlations in the background fluorescence among different regions in the cerebral cortex that can be used to assess functional connectivity. The alterations in white matter integrity and grey matter in DM is likely to result in changes in functional connectivity. Therefore, Core A will also test whether this functional connectivity in the cerebral cortex is abnormal in the DM mouse models. Finally, Projects 1 and 2 are proposing to develop mouse models with the goal of reversing the disease phenotypes. Having defined specific circuit abnormalities in the cerebral cortex, the Core will evaluate if the abnormalities are corrected in these rescue mouse models."
"9284283","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Self-injurious behavior (SIB) is one of the most serious problems experienced by individuals with intellectual disabilities. The standard of care for the assessment of SIB involves conducting a functional analysis. This assessment procedure involves observing the individual under several analog conditions to identify the situations in which SIB occurs consistently. In most cases, functional analysis indicates that SIB is reinforced by caregiver reactions (e.g., caregiver attention). In roughly 25% of cases, SIB levels are unaffected by social consequences - suggesting that the behavior itself produces reinforcement through unspecified processes such as sensory stimulation. The term automatic reinforcement (or automatic SIB) has been used to describe this amorphous and highly treatment-resistant type of SIB. In contrast to the vast body of research demonstrating the clinical and heuristic value of identifying social subtypes of SIB, little effort has been aimed at delineating subtypes of automatic SIB. We propose three subtypes of automatic SIB based on distinct clinical features observed during the functional analysis and in the context of treatment. We hypothesize these clinical features reflect distinct underlying factors related to the reinforcing (and aversive) consequences produced by SIB. The model is also informed by research on the biological basis of SIB, including altered pain sensitivity. For one subtype, the rates of SIB decrease as a function of the level of stimulation in the environment (Subtype I). For this group we posit that SIB produces sensory stimulation that is moderately reinforcing in that it can be readily overcome by other sources of reinforcement (e.g., toys). For other individuals, however, SIB is highly persistent and occurs irrespective of the level of environmental stimulation (Subtype II). We propose that for this group, SIB produces more highly potent biologically reinforcing consequences. Finally, some individuals with automatic SIB also engage in self-restraint, a behavior that is incompatible and actively prevents the occurrence of SIB (Subtype III). We propose that for these individuals, SIB also produces aversive (e.g., potentially painful) consequences, which negatively reinforces self-restraint because it prevents SIB. Analysis of pilot clinical data obtained from 39 cases with automatic SIB provides some preliminary support for the model. The proposed model provides the conceptual basis for subtype- specific and testable hypotheses. Although we cannot directly observe internal processes underlying automatic SIB, we will perform analyses that can help us understand what may underlie these clinically distinct subtypes. We will employ a range of assessment techniques and measures to examine how reinforcing (or aversive) SIB is in 60 individuals with the behavior. The current proposal represents an initial step of subtyping automatic SIB - one that will set the stage for future research aimed at understanding the biological underpinnings of each subtype, and for clinical trials evaluating more targeted behavioral and pharmacological interventions."
"9307724","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will determine how the intestinal microbiota shapes the development of innate-like B cells and the specificities of antibodies represented in the natural IgM (nIgM) repertoire. nIgM plays significant roles in maintenance of immunological homeostasis and the clearance of potentially immunogenic autoantigens represented on apoptotic cells, suppressing the development of autoimmune and allergic diseases. Innate-like B cells are the source of nIgM, and possess specificities for polysaccharide and phospholipid epitopes that are conserved between mammalian antigens and commensal bacteria harbored within the gut, however little is known regarding the impact of microbiota-derived antigens on the development of this subset of antibodies. Observations that innate-like B cells undergo antigen selection in the small intestine lamina propria leading to the differentiation of IgA secreting plasma cells in those tissues, and observations that mice maintained under germ free conditions experience exacerbated diseases in allergy models and in several autoimmune disease models led us to hypothesize that the microbiota plays a previously unappreciated role in shaping the systemic B cell repertoire and the generation of nIgM. We investigated the distribution of B cells specific for the T cell-independent (TI) antigen N-acetyl-D-Glucosamine (GlcNAc) between specific pathogen free and germ free mice and have found substantial evidence that intestinal colonization increases the numbers of B cells and levels of serum antibody specific for GlcNAc, while inducing shifts in the dominant immunoglobulin V-gene used to generate this specificity. To further dissect these interactions, we developed a novel fluorescence-activated cell sorting approach to study the distribution of TI antigens on species of commensal bacteria. Through simultaneous evaluation of the IgA opsonization status of these antigens, we expect to (i) identify immunologically relevant microorganisms bearing specific TI- antigens that interface with humoral immunity in the gut. Using gnotobiotic animal models, wherein germ free mice are reconstituted with flora enriched for particular antigenic determinants with the platform described above, we plan to test the hypothesis that antigen derived from the commensal micoflora leads to selection of B cell clonotypes into the nIgM-producing niche. We plan to test this hypothesis by (ii) evaluating the frequency and phenotype of splenic GlcNAc and Lewis X antigen-specific B cells following microbial reconstitution with bacteria commensal isolates enriched for these antigens, (iii) monitoring the generation of LP, spleen and bone marrow-localized plasma cells, and (iv) monitoring shifts in the B cell clonotypes composing those specificities. These experiments will demonstrate for the first time that interaction with exogenous antigen at peripheral tissues is required for development of a fully competent nIgM repertoire. This work will lead to the development of novel means of classifying the diversity of the intestinal microbiota, and offer valuable insight to the development of the nIgM repertoire value in designing immunotherapies aimed at boosting natural immunity."

"9355171","ABSTRACT Overdose acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI) accounts for nearly 50% of the acute liver failure cases each year. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the only antidote used clinically to ameliorate AILI; however, the effectiveness of NAC declines rapidly after APAP ingestion. Developing new life-saving treatment is critically needed. APAP-induced hepatocyte stress/damage results in the activation of liver resident M?s (Kupffer cells, KCs) and the recruitment of infiltrating M?s (IMs). We and others have demonstrated a hepato-protective function of hepatic M?s. A major goal of our research is to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. APAP challenge causes profound liver tissue hypoxia, which triggers the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1? and HIF2?. Our preliminary studies using mice with myeloid-specific deletion of HIF2? (HIF2?mye/-) revealed a critical hepato-protective function of hepatic M?-derived HIF2?. Screening of the hepatic protective and pro-toxicant factors shows that IL-6 mRNA level is significantly lower in the liver and nonparenchymal cells of HIF2?mye/- mice compared with WT mice. It is recently reported that HIF2? directly regulates IL-6 transcription. Together, these findings led to our hypothesis that APAP treatment leads to HIF2? stabilization in hepatic M?s, and that HIF2?, via promoting IL-6 production, plays a critical role in M?-mediated hepato-protection. We propose three Specific Aims to examine this hypothesis: (Aim 1). Determine the hepato-protective effect of the myeloid-specific HIF2?/IL-6 axis in AILI. (Aim 2). Evaluate the therapeutic potential of HIF stabilization in attenuating AILI. (Aim 3). Define the molecular mechanisms of the hepato-protective effects of myeloid-specific HIF2?/IL-6 axis. The findings will provide important insight into endogenous protective mechanisms during AILI. The knowledge gained could uncover therapeutic target and advance the development of antidote to treat patients with AILI."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission of a request for continuation of our Institutional NRSA, funded since 1975 for post-graduate training of MDs and PhDs in the University of Iowa Cardiovascular Research Center. All concerns of the Review Committee have been addressed in the Introduction. A large cadre of established investigators will serve as mentors for each of 13 trainees. Most of the 48 scientists who serve as primary mentors have been leaders and collaborators in major NIH funded research programs for several years. The research programs focus on 5 areas: Membrane Biology, Ion Channels, and Cell Signaling; Integrative Neurobiology and Sensory Signals in Cardiovascular Regulation; Endothelial/Vascular Biology, Atherosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Cerebral Circulation; and Hypertension. Multidisciplinary themes and core resources cut across these major research areas. The emphasis is on basic, clinical, and translational research and a primary goal of an academic career. Most trainees will require from 4 to 6 years of advanced training in expectation of a career as independent investigators. A plan is outlined with support from this training grant for 1 to 3 years and the remaining years funded by institutional sources or other NIH, foundation or American Heart Association career development programs. The trainees participate in seminars, graduate courses, bench research, genomic and clinical research, and epidemiologic surveys and biostatistics. Several courses will be mandatory for individuals seeking MS or PhD degrees and for all trainees in Responsible Conduct of Research. Our resources include the only medical school in the state of Iowa, one of the largest University-owned hospitals, the VA Medical Center, a College of Public Health, and a Cardiovascular Research Center of eminent national and international recognition. Our strengths are 1) the recruitment and retention of established investigators; 2) the cohesive interaction between basic scientists and clinical investigators providing an excellent environment for training of PhDs and MDs side by side; 3) the record of success in training outstanding cardiovascular scientists; and 4) the breadth and depth of research opportunities, and superb institutional commitment. Several important new developments have positioned us very favorably to continue to provide an outstanding environment for training cardiovascular scientists. These are: the renewal of 5 major program project grants, the creation of a new Institute for Clinical and Translational Research with a funded CTSA, the building of a new Institute of Biomedical Discovery, and the funding of a $25M endowment for research in diabetes and its cardiovascular consequences. In this renewal, we place greater emphasis on multidisciplinary collaborations, the link between basic and translational science, mentoring and evaluations, and recruitment of unrepresented minorities. The discovery of the causes of cardiovascular disease and of ways to prevent them and cure the patients who are suffering, requires dedicated physicians and scientists to devote their lifelong work to a health mission without which a civilized society would not survive. Such individuals require years of training in medical science beyond their professional degree under the tutelage and mentoring of established senior medical investigators/teachers working in an environment with exceptional intellectual, technical, and physical resources. At the University of Iowa Cardiovascular Research Center, we have provided a world-renowned training center since 1975, have graduated hundreds of scientists, many of whom are national leaders throughout the USA, and aim to continue to do so for future generations with the renewal of federal support that we are applying for and hope to attain.

Wagner (Core Director), Emerson (PI and Core Co-Director) and Brown (Core Co-Director) who with oversight by the Center Advisory Committee and NIH staff, will work with Center investigators to recruit, appoint, fund and mentor trainees. To enhance training of the students and to educate more broadly all FSHD investigators as well as FSHD patients, the Educational Core will include an annual internal Wellstone retreat, a biennial meeting with a FSH patient group, and an international research conference on FSHD."
"9332455","Project Summary Sepsis, an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory immune response to local infection by bacteria or fungi, is responsible for more deaths than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined, accounts for more than 40% of ICU costs, and is the most expensive inpatient condition in the U.S. (~$20B in annual U.S. healthcare expenditures in 2011). While it has been demonstrated that the time to initiating aggressive treatment is critical to improving outcomes (currently 30-50% mortality) and decreasing costs (>$22,000/case), emergency medicine physicians suffer from a lack of compelling diagnostic tools for detection of sepsis in the emergency department (ED), where >80% of sepsis cases originate in the hospital. CytoVale aims to improve the sepsis treatment paradigm by offering a platform to detect abnormal systemic inflammation at initial presentation. Our diagnostic platform will offer a cost-effective, robust, and rapid sample-to-decision assay (< 10 minutes), in which activated white blood cells that are indicative of uncontrolled systemic inflammation are interrogated in a label-free manner. In order to impact quality of care, the instrument must be situated at the point-of-care (POC), where it can provide rapid results to impact patient care. Currently, this is not feasible, due to manual operations required to prepare samples for the assay (e.g., centrifugation, pipetting) and the lack of an in- sample calibration. Here, we propose to capitalize on the success of our Phase 1 progress of automating the process of sample preparation by now developing a fully integrated module that combines the sample preparation and deformability cytometry microfluidics into a single cartridge and instrument. This will allow for the identification and triaging of patients earlier in their disease process at the ED POC from a finger-prick of blood. Additional cost and patient comfort benefits arise from the ability to track the course of disease and design treatments specific to patient response; saving days spent in the hospital and associated costs. Cytovale also proposes to develop and integrate a deformable sample control. Mechanical standard particles will be used as internal controls within each sample run, to ensure fidelity of the instrument readings and diagnostic accuracy. Not only will this help verify reliability and consistency of experiments, but will also supply a much needed calibration particle to the growing field of cellular biophysics. Combined, these aims will expand accessibility of powerful cell-based assays at the POC."
"9313888","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mineral formations in tissues are observed in normal and pathologic states. Pathologic biominerals that impair organ function are found in the breast, liver, kidney, salivary glands, brain, eye and vasculature to name a few. By systematically understanding the common denominators and differences between normal and pathologic biomineral formations in humans, effective pharmacological strategies can be developed. In this proposed research strategy we will investigate two distinct types of biomineral formations, intratubular and interstitial that we have observed along the length of a human renal papilla, a unique substructure in a kidney which acts as a biofilter and concentrator. Our preliminary data revealed intratubular mineralization and obstruction of the shorter proximal and peripherally located nephrons in contrast to the interstitial biominerals in the distal tip of the human papilla These two distinct yet overlapping processes have manifested into a spatially delineating interface between proximal and distal regions of the human renal papilla. From a function perspective, the shift in elastic modulus of the matrix at the interface between the proximally biomineralized and distally yet-to-be mineralized regions could be the trigger for interstitial mineralization. We hypothesize that the net decrease in functional papillary volume due to proximal renal papillary biomineralization shifts the elastic modulus at the interface. This shift n elastic modulus is the mechanoresponsive switch that acts as a biophysical cue along the papilla and triggers a biochemical cascade culminating in distal papillary interstitial biomineralization. Proposed specific hypotheses for aims 1 and 2 include: AIM 1) that the structure, elemental compositions, and mechanical properties of intratubular papillary mineral formations are different from those of interstitial formations; and AIM 2) that matrix composition and protein localizations are distinct between intratubular and interstitial mineralizations. The proposed multiscale approach at the level of the renal papilla will document changes in functional volume and will be correlated with spatial maps of mineral densities (MD) between proximal and distal papillary regions. At a tissue-level, respective MD variations will be correlated with spatial maps of molecular composition and elements within minerals, and elastic modulus maps on sections of papilla indicating shifts due to proximal intratubular and distal interstitial mineral formations in fresh human specimens. At an ultrastructure-level, mineral structure (crystalline or amorphous), and fibrillar and globular protein localization will help differentiate formation of intratubular from interstitial minerals. This study will help to elucidae common denominators and differences between nonpathologic (intratubular) and pathologic (interstitial) biominerals, and provide insights to direct discovery of novel therapies to mitigate mineral formations that lead to debilitating and excruciatingly painful urinary stone disease."
"9325038","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bioenergetic membranes are a key cellular apparatus that carry out a series of interlinked energy conversion processes providing ATP and key metabolites for a cell. The individual processes and their underlying membrane proteins have been investigated intensively, but rarely have the processes been studied together, in particular not on the scale of a full organelle. The reasons are both lack of whole-membrane atomic resolution models and huge complexity. In case of a rather primitive, yet still representative bioenergetic membrane, namely the photosynthetic chromatophore of purple bacteria, the overall structure has been recently described in atomic detail, also huge with an atom count of 100 million; however, computational tools and computer power are available today to investigate the system as a whole. This proposal seeks funds to study the chromatophore in several steps: (1) A 100 million atom model of an entire chromatophore is built and simulated through molecular dynamics to describe its key physical properties, such as quinol/quinone diffusion in the lipid phase as well as overall redox-state-dependent electrostatics. (2) Structural insight gained from this detailed simulation guides subsequent multiscale simulations of the membrane-wide charge transport via protein (cytochrome c2) and lipid (quinone/quinol) diffusion and binding. (3) Dynamics of insertion of key bioenergetic proteins into the membrane through the ribosome-linked insertase YidC and the coupling between the stator and rotor domains in ATP synthase are described through molecular dynamics. The proposed study will provide the groundwork for future membrane-wide investigations of bioenergetic and other cellular organelles."

An Office of Postdoctoral Affairs supported by the Provost's office, and programs in Development and Diversity and Interdisciplinary Research add to the richness of the training environment and help promote a healthy work/life balance."
"9312756","Breast cancer is a biologically and clinically heterogeneous disease that makes clinical management  challenging. Cancer genomics can identify candidate genetic lesions, but functional studies are required to  dissect which changes impact disease progression, treatment efficacy, and development of resistance. Core  B was conceived to facilitate functional studies in breast cancer by introducing state-of-the-art RNA  interference technology to the Program Project. It will incorporate and implement new technology developed  by Dr. Scott Lowe (the core leader) and Dr. Gregory Hannon (CSHL) based on RNA interference mediated  by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). The core concentrates its efforts on providing shRNAs expressed from the  miR-30 scaffold ? which Drs. Lowe and Hannon have optimized over the last 7 years ? as a tool to potently  and reversibly repress gene expression in cultured cells and in animals. This team has also developed  powerful strategies for regulated RNAi to inducibly suppress gene expression, as well as phenotype-based  screens using multiplexed RNAi formats; they also have developed rapid methods for producing inducible  shRNA transgenic mice for spatial, temporal, and reversible control of the expression of any gene, in vivo.  Core B will provide such advanced RNAi tools to program investigators, and continue to develop and  optimize RNAi methodology for controlling gene function in breast cancer models. These services will be  broadly divided into two components, the first, involving vector production and screening services and, the  second, support for production of inducible shRNA transgenic mice. Among these services include the  implementation of an RNAi ?sensor? assay that enables the identification of highly potent shRNAs against  genes of interest. The Core will benefit from existing infrastructure at MSKCC and interact with each of the  proposed Projects, thus providing cost effective services and a source of interaction for the Program.  Implementation of the RNAi tools provided by this core is expected to advance the ability to functional  studies throughout the Program, and will stimulate the development of new technologies (shRNA libraries,  and mouse models) that will be useful for the breast cancer research community"

"9316405","SUMMARY ? BIOANALYTICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND DRUG EVALUATION CORE The discovery that drugs targeting key pathways involved in aging processes can extend the lifespan of mice and other animals, has opened new research avenues where these drugs are become tools for research in the biology of aging, in research focused on age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, and in research focused on the effects of aging on a specific-organ system, such as the heart or vascular system. A drug- based approach offers a number of experimental advantages including flexibility in the timing of the intervention, the ability to combine drugs with other interventions to assess synergistic or antagonistic interactions, and the ability to readily treat any animal including unique transgenic disease models where genetic approaches could be time consuming or even unfeasible. Further, the built-in potential to eventually move a drug into human studies provides a solid basis of the translational relevance of the work. Consequently an expanding number of investigators are interested in either using existing drugs or developing novel drugs for their research. However, this breakthrough has created new challenges for the field, including (1) the need to ensure that drugs are effectively delivered to experimental animals, (2) the identification of inter-species differences in drug absorption and metabolism that limit the ability to generalize data from one animal to another species, (3) the high costs of conducting initial aging trials in sufficiently powered trials with vertebrates, and (4) the difficulties involved in conclusively linking the biologic effects of a drug to pharmacologic actions on a specific target or pathway. To address these challenges we have developed the Bioanalytical Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation Core (Pharmacology Core) to provide a range of innovative services that do not exist in any other Nathan Shock Center to promote the identification, implementation, and study of drugs in aging studies. Specifically, we will provide: (1) bioanalytical assay development and quantification of drugs in animals (C. elegans to marmosets) used to study aging and (2) the C. elegans model of aging for initial, rapid, and cost-effective testing of the effects of drugs on longevity and specific biological pathways in this animal. The overall purpose of the Pharmacology Core is to promote the application of existing and novel drugs to aging and age-related disease studies. The Core will include expertise in: drug selection; the development and implementation of bioanalytical assays; consultation on pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic approaches to drug dosing; the use of the rapid and cost effective C. elegans model for initial aging studies involving drugs; the use of C. elegans genetic and transgenic resources to study drug mechanisms; and the analysis and interpretation of experimental results. Together these services seek to accelerate research and provide assistance at multiple points in the process of applying a drug to aging studies from conducting initial survival studies, investigating or confirming the in vivo mechanism, testing the effects in mice or other mammals, or to applying a drug to research focused on age-related diseases."
"9272960","Abstract Mitochondria are integral to neuronal health. Subsequently, deficits in mitochondrial function contribute to a wealth of neurodegenerative diseases, where axonal dysfunction and die back usually precedes cell body demise. However, we know relatively little about the basic biology of mitochondrial biogenesis, morphological changes, transport, or function in axons in vivo. The discovery and characterization of new molecules regulating fundamental aspects of mitochondrial biology in axons may `open the door' to entirely new lines of research in neurodegenerative disease. In this proposal we aim to discover new regulators of mitochondria function in the axon using a novel and high throughput unbiased forward genetic screening approach recently developed in the lab. This approach allows us to assay mitochondrial morphology, number, and distribution in axons with unprecedented single axon and single mitochondrion resolution in vivo. Newly identified mitochondrial genes will then be characterized using an array of new tools we have optimized for mitochondrial studies in Drosophila, and we will determine precisely how mitochondrial physiology has been altered in vivo. We will also genetically determine how novel mitochondrial regulating genes function in defined pathways to control mitochondrial maintenance. Given that mitochondrial health and function is tightly correlated with neurodegenerative disease, it is likely that a number of these genes will play causal and/or accessory roles in neurodegeneration. We will therefore also investigate whether these novel mitochondria associated molecules have an exacerbated phenotype in dopamine neurons, since they selectively degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition where mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress is thought to play a fundamental role in disease progression. Functional conservation of these new molecules will then be assayed in mammalian neurons in vitro. This effort represents (to the best of our knowledge) the first high through forward genetic screen for molecules required for mitochondrial transport to and maintenance in axons. Thus a wealth of novel regulators of neuronal mitochondria, which have potential roles in neurological disease, await identification."
"9285392","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Background and Rationale: Asthma, the most common pediatric chronic illness, has high prevalence and morbidity among adolescents. Few interventions are tested in high schools; none when delivered by Community Health Workers (CHWs), despite this model's success in clinic- and home-based interventions. Further, rural adolescents, who represent a very large population, are overlooked in asthma intervention research. Given the high prevalence of asthma in this group, this oversight is a significant public health concern. Cost effectiveness analyses and implementation research are also lacking in asthma intervention research. This study addresses these treatment and methodological gaps. We developed and established the efficacy of Asthma Self-Management for Adolescents (ASMA), an 8-week, high school-based intervention, in urban Hispanic and African American adolescents. Objective: Using an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, we: (1) evaluate systematically the effectiveness of ASMA when delivered under real world conditions by CHWs to rural adolescents with uncontrolled asthma; (2) assess the cost-effectiveness of ASMA; and (3) conduct a theory-based, mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder process evaluation of the barriers and facilitators of ASMA's widespread implementation. Hypotheses: Over 1 year, relative to controls, ASMA students will have significantly fewer (1) night awakenings due to asthma symptoms, and (2) days with asthma-related activity limitations (primary outcomes). Secondary outcomes include other measures of morbidity (e.g., ED visits, hospitalizations, quality of life) and care-process outcomes. We also hypothesize that ASMA will have favorable value (ICER < 100,000/QALY) compared to alternative uses of health care resources over 1 and 5 years. Methods: We will enroll over 3 years, 400 9th through 11th grade students with uncontrolled asthma from 9 high schools in rural communities in South Carolina; we will randomize students within a school to ASMA and to an attention control condition. CHWs will deliver both interventions. Students and caregivers will be followed for 12-months post-treatment. The intention-to-treat (ITT) principle will be applied using linear and general linear mixed effects models. The cost-effective analysis will rely on a decision-analytic Markov model. The process evaluation is built on the RE-AIM model; we collect qualitative and quantitative data from students, caregivers, CHWs and school administrators. Together with key stakeholders from a variety of settings, we will develop models to widely disseminate and implement ASMA. Significance: The study has high public health significance because (1) it targets an understudied population, (2) it relies on existing community resources for intervention implementation, (3) it assesses ASMA's value through cost-effectiveness analyses, and (4) it bridges the gap between research and practice by identifying factors associated with implementation."

"9313290","Abstract/Project Summary Active remodeling of adherens junctions is crucial not only for keeping tissue integrity but also for driving the progression of many developmental events such as epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). Recent development in the research at the interface between cell biology and mechanical force has revealed that, in addition to the well studied biochemical signals, the mechanical tension plays an critical yet unappreciated role in the regulation of adherens junctions. The candidate's postdoc study has demonstrated that during Drosophila gastrulation adherens junctions in mesodermal primordium are repositioned and strengthened in response to apically localized myosin contraction. Such tension- dependent remodeling of adherens junctions protects junctions from Snail-driven junction disassembly and appear to developmentally time the EMT to occur only after the completion of the morphogenetic event. This establishes a model to study the mechanosensitive regulation of adherens junctions in an intact developmental system. The goal of the project is to elucidate the mechanism of tension-dependent adherens junction remodeling in the context of EMT. In the first aim, the dynamics of junctional components within individual junction clusters during the remodeling will be examined using photoconvertible fluorescent probes and in vivo junctional tension will be measured in live embryos using a FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy)-based FRET tension sensor that have been recently made and tested. In the second aim, a small yet comprehensive pool of direct Snail target genes identified from a recent genome-wide study will be tested for their roles in Snail-dependent junction disassembly. The identified genes will be further characterized in the independent phase. The last aim is to test the principle of tension-dependent junction remodeling and its impact on EMT in vertebrate cell lines in collaboration with McClatchey's lab. The cell lines with stably expressed live imaging markers will be made during the mentored phase. Junction dynamics and the role of mechanosensitive junction remodeling during EMT will be examined in the independent phase. Result from this project will advance our understanding on regulation of adherens junctions in response to myosin-generated tension and shed light on the novel function of Snail on disassembling junctions at post-transcriptional level during EMT."
"9360635","Project Abstract Recent studies have highlighted the very low efficiency (<10%) of reproducibility for research on drug targets transferred from academia to pharma target discovery. It is also well known that many failures across the drug development pipeline can be traced to inadequate drug target selection and validation. A striking case in point is the recent cluster of high-profile clinical trial failures in Alzheimer Disease (AD). In this case, a significant question now being asked is: was the common understanding of what was the ?right target? actually correct? This in turn has led to an intensified search for new targets. While the robustness and reproducibility problem is highlighted in AD research, it extends across many areas of translational research in biomedicine and ultimately has a great impact on both healthcare costs and productivity of research. We believe it is possible to improve reproducibility and robustness by improving the fidelity and computational tractability with which research results are represented. This project will build and test advanced informatics methods for improving the reproducibility of biomedical research - by creating software to build, analyze and apply structured ?standoff? metadata in the form of argument graphs (knowledge graphs, micropublications) across the assertions made and evidence presented in the biomedical literature and data archives. This metadata will be integrated with existing biomedical ontologies and serialized as linked data in RDF. Our objective in this project is to enable computational processing and reasoning over the details of claims, counterclaims, evidence and counter-evidence bearing upon specific areas - biological processes, mechanisms of drug action, etc. - required to be validated and understood in academic and pharmaceutical drug research and development. This project aims to demonstrate and explore feasibility of this approach. Our software will enable construction of (1) Highly specialized argument graphs as target validation criteria templates against which claims and evidence for pharmaceutical target advancement may be evaluated. (2) Libraries of graph metadata which can be assembled across entire areas of research, or applied one by one to individual articles. We will specifically target this project to Alzheimer Disease (AD). As part of our project we will develop a and publish corpus of detailed argument - claims - evidence graph metadata on the most influential articles in AD research covering the past 5-10 years. This is an area of great scientific and medical need, with many recent failures in clinical trials, no effective cures, a glaring need for new validated drug targets, and annual U.S. healthcare costs on the order of $220 million per year."
"9325560","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children, with more than 500,000 operations performed annually in the US. A large proportion of these are performed in children with primary snoring, or mild sleep-disordered breathing (MSDB) rather than in children with frank obstructive sleep apnea. Although AT has been shown to improve behaviour and quality of life in school-aged children with sleep apnea, the role of this common surgery in children with MSDB is not known, resulting in large practice and geographic variation in its use. Considering the morbidity and health care costs of AT, it is crucial to determine the impact of the surgery on outcomes of value to patients and the healthcare system. We propose to take advantage of a successful collaboration of leaders in sleep medicine, otolaryngology, neuropsychology and clinical trials to conduct a randomized clinical trial of AT for MSDB. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that children with MSDB benefit from AT as defined by improved behaviour and attention (primary outcomes) and decreased health care utilization. Using a single-blinded, randomized design, we aim to recruit 460 children (50% minority), aged 3-9 years, with polysomnographically-confirmed MSDB from 5 leading pediatric centers. Participants will be randomized to early AT or watchful waiting with supportive care, and undergo standardized evaluations of sleep, behavior, attention, quality of life, and health care utilization at baseline and 12 months. Body habitus, urinary cotinine levels, actigraphy, family functioning, atopy and socioeconomic status will be assessed to identify potential moderating influences. This rigorous design and comprehensive study will resolve existing uncertainties on initial management approaches for pediatric MSDB by addressing several critical issues: a) assess outcomes of importance to children and their families, particularly the patient- reported outcomes of behavior, quality of life, and sleep disturbances); b) examine differences in treatment responses among children who are at increased risk for MSDB, such as pre-school children, minorities, and children with asthma or obesity; c) evaluate health care utilization as a unique and timely outcome; d) assess moderating influences of second hand smoke, insufficient sleep, socioeconomic status and family functioning. Study results will provide evidence on whether children with MSDB benefit from surgery and will identify subgroups who are most likely to benefit, thus informing future management approaches of this common pediatric condition and helping to direct resources to those children most likely to benefit."
"9306840","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health problem in the US, with prevalence of >10% among all adults. Diabetes, hypertension, obesity and heart disease are common risk factors. CKD is currently managed with limited therapeutic options that act systemically and there are currently no drugs that directly and selectively target the kidney cells. Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells that are central for kidney function. Podocytes form the filtration barrier in the kidney and are a validated cellular target for proteinuric kidney diseases. Yet, rational development of podocyte protective therapeutics has been greatly hampered by lack of screening assays. We recently developed a novel podocyte cell-based screening assay and optimized it for use in 96-well plates. Our image-based assay showed Z' values of 0.46 and 0.44 in two independent primary assay readouts and a Z' > 0.65 for a multi-parametric classifier assay readout. Upon screening of a bioactive library of >2100 diverse chemicals, we identified 24 hits, validated them in secondary and functional in vitro assays and validated one select hit in an established in vivo model of proteinuric kidney disease. Analysis of specific molecular markers of injury also provided us with a potential mechanism of action of the novel hit compound. These data suggest that our novel assay could be a basis for rational chemical library profiling on podocytes. Thus, here, we propose that our cell based phenotypic assay could be further miniaturized and applied in an HTS environment to identify novel small molecules that protect podocytes from injury. Additionally, the identified hit could be validated in available downstream in vitro and in vivo assays. Our long-term goal is to develop novel podocyte- protective compounds for the treatment of a variety of proteinuric kidney diseases in humans. Our three proposed aims include: 1) Implementation and miniaturization of a newly developed podocyte cell-based assay for use in an HTS environment, 2) Execution of HTS campaign using the novel assay followed by confirmation and prioritization of the hit compounds, and 3) Validation of identified hits using in vitro and in vivo assays. We have all the in vitro and in vivo assays in place and validated in the laboratory. We have also assembled a team of experts at Rush and at Sanford-Burnham to successfully implement our proposed aims. We expect that our proposed studies, if successful, will lead to identification of novel chemical probes and compounds that directly target podocytes and protect them from injury. We also expect that the identified compounds could be further developed into therapeutics for treating proteinuric kidney disease in humans in the future, thus improving lives of patients with CKD."
"9348890","Vascular cognitive impairment is an insidious disease resulting from accumulated ischemic injury to the brain. Our VA Merit-funded Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis and Cognitive Function (ACCOF) found that in the setting of carotid stenosis, alterations of behavior can occur in the absence of physical manifestations of stroke. Otherwise asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis had worse cognitive performance than controls. In addition, approximately 40% of patients with stenosis had cerebral hemodynamic compromise at baseline; and hemodynamic compromise correlated with cognitive impairment. Not all patients with carotid stenosis have reduced cerebral perfusion. The geometry of the plaque (degree of stenosis, length and shape of the plaque) and, as we have demonstrated, the extent of intra-cerebral collateralization across the Circle of Willis, influence cerebral perfusion.  The implication of these findings is that a subset of carotid stenosis patients has hemodynamic compromise, and that reversal of the hemodynamic abnormalities by removing the stenosis may ameliorate the associated cognitive impairment. Therefore, treatment for carotid stenosis might need to be broadened to include preservation of cognition-related Quality of Life (QoL). The demonstration that some patients with carotid stenosis are living with reversible cognitive impairment would have important public-health implications. Carotid stenosis affects 2-12% of people. With 23 million Veterans in the country, approximately 1 million (4.3%) will have a stenosis. ACCOF shows that these patients are at risk for cognitive impairment which, with intervention, might be reversible.  We propose a longitudinal controlled observational study that assesses whether carotid revascularization improves cognitive dysfunction in patients with cerebral hemodynamic compromise. Proof of concept (followed by a clinical trial) is necessary before a shift in clinical practice is considered. If cognitive decline can be reversed in these patients, we will have established a new indication for carotid revascularization independent of stroke prevention. We will enroll 138 patients with asymptomatic high-grade (?70%) carotid stenosis undergoing planned carotid endarterectomy. Approximately 40% (n=55 patients) of patients are anticipated to have compromised cerebral perfusion at baseline (study group); the remaining 60% (n=83) will have carotid stenosis but will not have compromised perfusion (control group).  Our Primary Aim will determine if carotid revascularization improves cognitive performance at 1 year in patients with cerebral hemodynamic compromise at baseline. We hypothesize that among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy, cognitive performance will improve more in those with impaired cerebral perfusion at baseline versus those with normal baseline perfusion. Our Secondary Aim 1 will determine whether cerebral hemodynamic compromise is the result of pressure drop across the carotid artery stenosis. We hypothesize that among all patients enrolled, the degree of PWI-TTP delay at baseline will correlate with the degree of pressure drop across the carotid stenosis. Pressure drop will be measured by patient-specific computational fluid dynamic modeling based on 3D imaging of carotid luminal geometry, flow measurements, and analysis of the circulation in the Circle of Willis. Secondary Aim 2 will determine whether cognitive improvement after revascularization is the result of improved cerebral hemodynamics. We hypothesize that among patients with delayed PWI-TTP at baseline, the degree of improvement in cognition after revascularization will correlate with the improvement in pressure drop. Secondary Aim 3 will determine whether differences in cognitive outcome between the two groups impact quality of life. We hypothesize that 1 year after revascularization, quality of life will improve more in patients with impaired baseline cerebral perfusion versus those without impairment."
"9471089","Abstract Clinical cancer sequencing will increasingly be used to identify genomic alterations that are relevant to understanding cancer progression and improving clinical decision making for individual patients. Currently, the most critical bottleneck in the precision medicine workflow is at the interpretation step. However, there are few resources to help with the prioritization and interpretation of these alterations in a clinical context. Multiple groups are building their own databases documenting clinical interpretation of tumor mutations as they are observed in those groups. This represents a largely redundant effort with no mechanisms for capturing evolving evidence from the biomedical literature. Public knowledgebases are needed with sophisticated application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow rapid intersection of genomic alterations with interpretations of their clinical actionability. The goal of this proposal is to develop such an expert-curated knowledgebase, web interface and API for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC - www.civicdb.org). The knowledge created from this effort will be freely available and the product of open discussion across a diverse community. This will require an interdisciplinary approach to combine the expertise of genome scientists and cancer researchers, whose efforts are otherwise often isolated. Content will be created with transparency, kept current, be comprehensive, track provenance, and acknowledge the efforts of creators. It will cover all types of alterations from single nucleotide variants to structural variants, RNA fusions, expression changes, epigenetic alterations and others. The interface will capture both structured statements of evidence for actionability to allow computational data mining and also human-readable interpretations. Content and software will be unencumbered and easy to access to encourage both academic and commercial engagement. In order to achieve these goals CIViC will require well-designed data standards, use of structured vocabularies, and a user-friendly curation interface that balances data mining needs with human accessibility. Focused `hackathons' and curation meetings will be organized to establish community standards and coordinate with synergistic efforts by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and ClinGen working groups. The CIViC resource will serve as the foundation for development of applications critical to widespread implementation of precision medicine for cancer. Specifically, it will facilitate rapid generation of targeted sequencing assays, automated clinical report generation, and other applications built upon the open CIViC standards and APIs."
"9298056","PROJECT SUMMARY Studies suggest that abnormal elevations in extracellular glutamate can act as a pathogenic driver of schizophrenia, including in the hippocampus a brain region that neuroimaging studies suggest might be affected first and foremost. If this formulation is correct, then high glutamate should be considered a molecular target for drug discovery and agents that reduce extracellular glutamate should be an effective intervention. Pomaglumetad methionil (which we will call ?POMA?) is one such agent, because as an agonist of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptors this class of drug has been found to reduce glutamate release. Nevertheless, trials that have used POMA have to date shown little efficacy in patients with schizophrenia.  Despite these failures, we believe that, based on the accumulative evidence, high glutamate is indeed a valid target and that two reasons might account for these initial failures. First, as these trials did not use a reliable brain biomarker of glutamate elevations there was no readout of ?target engagement?, and thus it remains possible that these trials were false negatives. Second, and more importantly, schizophrenia is now thought to start in a prodromal phase before the onset of psychosis, and there is evidence to suggest that the prodromal stage might represent a unique time-window for therapeutic interventions, and so it possible that the drug was given at the wrong stage of the disease.  Pathophysiological support for these conclusions comes from our studies (Schobel et al, Neuron, 2013) in which we applied fMRI indicators of metabolism and volumetric MRI to patients in prodromal stages of the disease who then progressed to the psychotic stage, and to a mouse model of the disease. Collectively, these studies suggested that glutamate is a driver of hippocampal dysfunction, that fMRI measures are sensitive to glutamate elevations, and that glutamate-reducing drugs can ameliorate hippocampal dysfunction. We also have completed preliminary studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in which we show that hippocampal glutamate is elevated in prodromal stages of the disease.  Based on the results of these and other studies, we have recently proposed a mechanistic model of disease progression (Small, Neuron, 2014), which predicts that because of its distinct pathophysiological features the prodromal stage of disease is a unique time-window that is most amenable to glutamate-reducing interventions. This mechanistic model motivates this proposal in which we hypothesize that: 1) MRI based measures of hippocampal metabolism and glutamate can be used as in vivo biomarkers of target engagement when using a glutamate-reducing intervention. 2) Glutamate-reducing interventions will be most effective when administered to prodromal patients, and only when they are shown to engage their target. The R61 phase of this proposal is designed to test the first hypothesis, and the R33 phase is designed to the second."
"9355623","7. PROJECT SUMMARY The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) of the kidney expresses the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter, NCC, a mechanism essential to Na+ reabsorption, control of blood pressure, and K+ secretion. NCC is activated by phosphorylation, which is mediated by a pair of protein kinases: SPAK, a Ste20p-like kinase which directly binds and phosphorylates the cotransporter, and WNK4, an upstream kinase, which phosphorylates and activates SPAK. Increasing consensus is developing that the function of the DCT is to sense and regulate plasma K+ through the modulation of K+ secretion in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN). The precise mechanism(s) by which the DCT fulfills this function is still not well-understood. Preliminary data collected in the previous funding cycle indicated that even in the presence of a constitutively-active SPAK kinase, increase in plasma K+ still decreases phosphorylation of NCC leading to a first hypothesis that the K+ activated phosphatase, calcineurin, mediates inhibition of the cotransporter (Aim 1). Based on preliminary work that highlights the role of Cab39 adaptor proteins (Cab39 and Cab39l) in facilitating SPAK and WNK function we hypothesize that these proteins play a critical role in the pathway regulating NCC phosphorylation. In Aim 2, the molecular interaction between Cab39 and SPAK/WNK, the relationship with the Cl- sensitivity of WNK4, and the relevance of the adaptor proteins at the animal level will all be addressed. To account for the relationship between Na+ reabsorption in DCT and K+ secretion in the ASDN, we hypothesize that on top of the well-accepted view that Na+ delivery inversely modulates epithelial Na+ channel and ROMK, there is paracrine communication between the two nephron segments. This novel idea will be addressed in Aim 3. Finally, longer term coupling between the DCT and the ASDN involves significant remodeling for which we now have a precise signaling pathway to study. Through lineage mapping studies and Jagged-1 knockout studies we will test the hypothesis that NOTCH signaling increases the number of principal cells in the connecting segment (Aim 4). These new studies will provide a greater integrated view of the role of Na+ transport in the DCT in renal function.                                                                  "
"9307014","ABSTRACT I completed Fellowship Training in Maternal Fetal Medicine and Clinical Genetics in 2010. Since then, the science of genetics has evolved such that I now require further training in genomics and bioinformatics to complete my research goals and to keep pace with the changes occurring in clinical genetics. Completion of the K23 would provide me with further education in molecular genomic techniques, molecular variant analysis, bioinformatics, statistical genetics, and allow me to increase my understanding of the ethical, legal, and social implications of implementing genomic technologies in clinical practice. These skills are necessary for me to achieve my long term goal to use innovative tools to identify the root causes of genetic disorders that affect newborns and mothers and to translate these findings into improved clinical practice. Obtaining the K23 is the next logical step in my career development, because it will provide me with the essential didactic training and hands-on mentored research experience to generate pilot data for a future independent NIH award. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is an innovative genomic technology that has proven to be a powerful diagnostic tool in adults and children but has not been studied at earlier stages. To evaluate the use of this transformative technology, I will apply WES in pregnancies suspected to have a genetic etiology not identified by standard genetic testing. I will perform ES testing on 52 such triads. The goal of aim 1 is to identify major genetic abnormalities in pregnancies suspected to have a genetic etiology not identified by standard genetic testing. By completing Aim 1, we will be able to evaluate the performance of WES in a prenatal population, and identify critical clinical characteristics that can guide its application. Aim 2 will measure the impact of genetic information on parents. This information will be used to develop an ethical framework for the introduction of WES into the obstetric setting and a set of considerations to include in  decision aids, counseling protocols, and quantitative surveys for use in future studies of early exome sequencing. The results from this proposal are the first step toward my long term goal to establish a set of best practices to guide future implementation of new and innovative genomic technologies to benefit families."
"9519354","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Corrosive couple conflict (CCC) and coercive parent-child conflict constitute a ubiquitous, potent, and destructive (but modifiable) interpersonal poison to a wide range of adult and children's health outcomes. Such patterns are also linked with poor parent-child relationships and with more harsh punishment, which is associated with disturbed responses to environmental stresses (e.g., disruption in sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical responses), a wide variety of adverse health outcomes in childhood, including dental caries, obesity, and diabetes related metabolic markers. This phase of NIH's Science of Behavior Change program emphasizes an experimental medicine approach to behavior change necessitating identification of central interpersonal/social targets for maximal impact on far-reaching panoply of health outcomes. This project will focus on factors associated diabetes and oral health (though the processes affect many other disease outcomes). Both are associated with pain, distress, expense, loss of productivity, and even mortality. They share overlapping medical regimens, are driven by overlapping proximal health behaviors, and affect a wide developmental span, from early childhood to late adulthood. As requested by the RFA, we will isolate three proximal health behaviors: (a) medical regimen adherence; (b) eating and drinking high sugar/calorie items; and (c) self-care behaviors. CCC/coercive parent-child conflicts are marked by an interrelated set of affective, behavioral, and physiological signatures. In the UH2 phase, we will identify/develop/validate assays. We will also identify/develop, and test interventions to reduce CCC/coercion targets. In the UH3 phase, we expect to conduct at least 2 studies to test whether reduction in targets results in improvement in adherence and other health behaviors of interest. One study will focus on parents and children, the other on adults in intimate relationships. Health behaviors related to diabetes and oral health problems will serve as dependent variables as will self-care behaviors in both diabetes and oral health. To place these health behaviors in the context of disease conditions and medical regimen adherence, we expect to focus one study on a sample of children with early childhood caries and the other study on an adult sample with diabetes."
"9313643","Project Summary/Abstract  Our brains carry out complex cognitive tasks via the intricate electrical communication between neurons. The specialized site where this communication occurs is the synapse, and it is capable of various forms of plasticity that enable the constant and adaptive refinement of the communication between neurons. The amount of neuronal activity that is transmitted at the synapse typically dictates the type of modification, and raising the level of communication between neurons strengthens their synaptic connection through an adaptive increase in the number of connections. This process is collectively known as activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, and is thought to be the cellular foundation for learning and memory.  The long term goal of this project is to better understand the basic cell biological roots of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. In particular, I am interested in understanding the functional role of intracellular mitochondrial trafficking in supporting the growth of synapses adapting to increased neuronal activation. I will carry out this project using Drosophila Melanogaster larvae, or fruit fly maggots, as an experimental model system that was chosen due to the powerful genetic tools available. Like motor neurons in our spinal cord, the muscles in the body wall of the larvae are innervated by motoneurons that are responsible for sending the signal when to move. These motoneurons form a synapse onto the muscle, which is known as the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse. The presynaptic terminal of the NMJ synapse will undergo activity- dependent plasticity upon increased activity of the motoneurons, from increased movement of the larvae. I can microscopically image this synapse directly through the cuticle (skin) of the larvae using technology developed in my lab; including its changing shape and intracellular dynamics (such as changes in mitochondria) that occur simultaneously with the growth when neuronal activity is increased.  My central hypothesis is that neuronal activity induces the formation of acute synaptic growth that is eventually stabilized by the trafficking of mitochondria into this nascent growth, which facilitates its long-term maturation to becoming a mature synaptic connection. Using the tools I described, I will test this hypothesis with two specific aims: (1) I will use a genetic mutant larvae in which the trafficking of mitochondria to the NMJ is dysfunctional to see if any aspects of activity-dependent growth are successful, hence pinpointing a precise role for mitochondrial trafficking in the process. (2) I will seek to functionally characterize a molecular mediator responsible for promoting activity-dependent synaptic growth, and determine whether the driving force for its ability to promote the growth of synapses is in its regulation of mitochondrial trafficking. The insight gained from this work will uncover new knowledge on the cell biology of synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial trafficking in neurons, two processes that commonly result in neurodegenerative diseases when dysfunctional."
"9339721","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic insomnia are prevalent, debilitating, and challenging to treat, but their all too common co-occurrence amplifies morbidity and complicates the management of affected patients. Unfortunately, previous research provides limited guidance as to what constitutes the best and most practical management approach for this comorbid patient group. Various medications have FDA approval for insomnia management, but most have not been tested among comorbid OSA/insomnia patients. Moreover, many of these agents suppress respiratory drive making apnea symptoms worse, whereas others result in residual sedation, an unwanted side effect for the already sleepy OSA patient. Some promising preliminary data suggest that cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapy (CBT) may be a safe and effective adjunct to standard OSA therapies for comorbid OSA/insomnia. However, studies reporting these findings have included small patient samples, lacked both control groups and adequate follow-up periods, and failed to address how this promising therapy can be made more broadly accessible given the currently limited number of providers capable of delivering it. This dual-site randomized clinical trial will move the field forward by addressing the limitations of this previous studies. Specifically this project will use a ?SMART? design to test a stepped care model relative to standard positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and determine if (1) augmentation of PAP therapy with OCBT improves short-term outcomes of comorbid OSA/insomnia; and (2) providing a higher intensity 2nd-stage CBT to patients who show sub-optimal short-term outcomes with OCBT+PAP improves short and longer-term outcomes. The 384 PAP-treated comorbid OSA\insomnia patients enrolled will complete baseline assessment with sets of syndrome-specific measures as well as global measures of sleep/wake functioning. They then will be randomly assigned to a treatment consisting of the UC alone or PAP +OCBT. After 8 weeks they will be reassessed with all measures taken at baseline. Patients reaching remission status (insomnia severity index score < 10 + Quebec Sleep Questionnaire mean item score > 5) will be offered no additional insomnia intervention but will continue PAP and complete study outcome measures again after an additional 8-weeks and again at 3 and 6 month follow-ups. OCBT recipients classified as ?unremitted? after 8-weeks of treatment will be re-randomized to a 2nd- stage treatment consisting of a continued, expanded engagement with the OCBT or a switch to a therapist- directed CBT (TCBT). Those receiving the 2nd-stage intervention as well as the UC group will be reassessed after another 8 weeks and then again at 3- and 6-month follow-up time points. Results should provide much new information that greatly enhances our knowledge about how to effectively treat comorbid OSA/insomnia patients and about the role of OCBT intervention in the short- and longer term management of this patient group."
"9346110","Project Summary: SCD or sickle-cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by loss of flexibility of red blood cells and resulting in mortality and other serious complications. The greatest burden of SCD is in sub-Saharan Africa, where 75% of the 300,000 annual global births of affected children occur. Estimates are that 50-80% of these affected children will die before reaching adulthood despite the availability of low cost, effective therapies. SCD can be diagnosed (and subsequently treated) through newborn screening programs HPLC or electrophoresis systems, but these tools are too expensive and generally unavailable in low resource environments. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 70% of SCD deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are preventable and has declared SCD a Public Health Priority. Field studies need to be performed with a significant sample size for significant calculation. Sickle cell disorders are present in the US, but far more prevalent in Africa, India, and the Middle East. Additionally, the test is designed for use in low-resource environments, including rural clinics as well as US CLIA-waived sites. Field studies in clinical sites found in sub-Saharan Africa are an ideal setting to stress test the product in a low-resource environment targeting a population with the highest prevalence of disease. Our study centers will include African sites in Nigeria, Ghana, Angola, Tanzania, and Kenya but also include US sites in South Carolina. The international sites include the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Hasiya Bayero Pediatric Hospital, Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, and University of Abuja Teaching Hospital amongst others. US sites include the COBRA Human Services Agency, Orangeburg Area Sickle Cell Foundation, James R. Clark Memorial Sickle Cell Foundation, the Louvenia Barksdale Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation, and the Medical University of South Carolina. These sites will have facilities and staffing to conduct sampling and testing of the Sickle SCAN® product. The sites will have access to established method testing, coordinated by the clinical consultant. Any compensation to foreign sites will not be drawn from SBIR funding."
"9348767","The purpose of this study is to examine the long-term therapeutic role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibition in sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggered by repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI). Mild TBI (mTBI) comprises more than 75 % of all TBI. Among individuals with mTBI, a significant portion of them develop sustained TBI as the acute neuropathology of mTBI develops into chronic neurodegeneration. The acute neuropathology of mTBI initiates long apoptotic cascades leading to chronic neurodegenerative disorders with cognitive deficits such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer?s disease (AD). The major neuropathology of the neurodegenerative disorders includes neuronal death, gliosis and aggregation of phosphorylated tau protein (tauopathy) and ? amyloid (A?), which are considered to be the neuropathological landmarks of TBI. Among individuals with mTBI, those with repetitive concussions (rmTBI) are particularly susceptible to the risk of the chronic neurodenegerative disorders.  GSK-3 constitutively inhibits neuroprotection and promotes apoptosis. AD research indicates that excessive GSK-3 activity accelerates tauopathy and A? deposit, impairment in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, the essential neurobiological basis of cognitive function, and cognitive deficits. GSK-3 inhibition attenuates tauopathy and A? formation, and improves hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits. Studies using rodent TBI models indicate that GSK-3 inhibition reverses the neurodegenerative processes of TBI, reduces tauopathy and A? deposit and improves cognitive deficits. Although these studies suggest that GSK-3 inhibition may have therapeutic potential for veterans suffering sustained TBI, they have only focused on the short-term effects of GSK-3 inhibition. To our knowledge, there has been no study exploring the long-term therapeutic potential of GSK-3 inhibition for sustained TBI. This study focuses on long-term therapeutic effects of GSK-3 inhibition on sustained TBI with attenuating the conversion of acute TBI neuropathology to chronic neurodegeneration. We will examine long-term therapeutic effects of GSK-3 inhibition on neuropathology, synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits in the hippocampus of animals with sustained TBI triggered by repetitive concussions, using a murine mTBI model to explore the therapeutic potential of GSK-3 inhibition for veterans suffering sustained TBI. To inhibit GSK-3, we will use lithium, a typical GSK-3 inhibitor with additional neuroprotective properties and SB-216763, a specific GSK-3 inhibitor. We will pursue three specific aims as below.  Specific Aim 1 (Neuropathological study): To determine whether repetitive concussions trigger long- term neurodegeneration, and GSK-3 inhibition attenuates the neurodegeneration. We will examine the neuopathological evidence of neurodegeneration including the number of degenerating neurons and the density of phosphorylated tau and A? in the hippocampus.  Specific Aim 2 (Neurophysiological study): To examine whether repetitive concussions impair hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and GSK-3 inhibition reverses it. We will examine the long-term potential, the electrophysiological parameter of synaptic plasticity, and baseline synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.  Specific Aim 3 (Cognitive behavioral study): To examine whether repetitive concussions produce cognitive deficits and whether GSK-3 inhibition improves the cognitive deficits. We will examine hippocampal- dependent spatial learning, using the Barnes maze method.  At the completion of this study, we will be able to determine whether GSK-3 inhibition blocks the conversion of TBI acute neuropathology to neurodegenerative process and improves cognitive deficits and whether the drug effects on cognitive deficits are associated with its effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity. This study will contribute to developing an effective therapeutic strategy for veterans who suffer sustained TBI."

"9307683","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The production of serine ?-lactamase is one of the primary resistance mechanisms used by Gram-negative bacterial pathogens against ?-lactam antibiotics, which include the widely used penicillins and cephalosporins, as well as last resort antibiotics such as the carbapenems. The development of novel ?-lactamase inhibitors is a pressing need underscored by the continuing mutation of ?-lactamases. We propose the development of high affinity non-covalent ?-lactamase inhibitors by targeting conserved structural motifs, particularly those essential for extended spectrum ?-lactamase activity. Prototypes of these inhibitors have already been identified. Specifically, using the CTX-M Class A ?-lactamases as a model system, we aim to: 1) apply a fragment-based and structure-guided approach to develop novel ?-lactamase inhibitor chemotypes; 2) study resistance and ligand binding by ultrahigh-resolution and room-temperature X-ray crystallography; and 3) investigate the evolution of resistance mutations against non-covalent inhibitors. These experiments will lead to new ?- lactamase inhibitors with clinical potential, while providing a deeper understanding of ?-lactamase mutations relevant to resistance evolution."
"9381078","Project Summary  The most important function of vitamin D is the regulation of intestinal calcium absorption ? a classical role of vitamin D critical for bone health. Despite the importance of vitamin D in the intestine, the mechanisms of vitamin D action in intestine are not clear. Although most Ca absorption research has focused on the proximal small intestine, our novel preliminary data using distal intestine specific knockout (KO) or transgenic mice reveal an essential role for VDR in the distal intestine. The proposed research employs a genomic approach coupled to physiology studies in novel mouse models to test the hypothesis that the proximal and distal segments of the intestine have unique regulatory pathways controlling VDR expression and vitamin D action, and that calcium absorption and expression of VDR target genes in the distal intestine contribute significantly to bone and mineral metabolism. To address this hypothesis we have developed two specific aims. Aim 1: Define the functional genomics of VDR expression and signaling that mediate calcium absorption in the proximal and distal intestine and its impact on whole body calcium and bone metabolism. Using a genome-wide approach we will identify spatial (proximal vs distal intestine; villus vs crypt) and temporal (pre vs post weaning; young vs adult) effects on chromatin architecture of the Vdr gene locus to identify critical upstream regulators of Vdr expression in proximal and distal intestine. Next, VDR target genes in the proximal and distal intestine and in progenitor vs differentiated cells will be identified on a genome-wide scale. The human relevance of VDR targets as well as VDR regulatory mechanisms will be determined in studies using human-derived organoid cultures. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that Ca absorption in the distal intestine contributes significantly to bone and mineral metabolism using unique animal models including VDR KO mice with transgenic expression of VDR only in the distal intestine. We will also determine for the first time the effect of VDR deletion throughout the intestine or specifically in the distal intestine in adult mice on calcium and bone metabolism. Aim 2: Determine the translational potential of targeting the distal intestine to improve calcium balance and protect bone. We will test whether targeting the absorptive capacity of the distal intestine can be an effective way to maximize Ca absorption and minimize adult bone loss. This will be done using transgene-enhanced expression of VDR in the distal intestine and use of a natural, distal intestine-targeted vitamin D form (25 ? glucuronide 1,25(OH)2D3) to improve calcium balance and protect against bone loss. This proposed research is responsive to PA-16-332 ?Nutrigenetics and Nutrigenomics Approaches for Nutrition Research.? It combines expertise in vitamin D biology, nutrition, and genomics to determine how the molecular actions of vitamin D can be utilized to improve Ca status in groups at risk for accelerated bone loss and osteoporosis."
"9353264","Project Summary/Abstract:  An emerging body of work shows that unhealthy alcohol use substance use, smoking, and depression often co-occur in HIV-infected patients. In a large multisite observational study of aging and HIV, unhealthy alcohol use, substance use smoking, and depression were common among those with HIV and exhibited striking temporal concordance, often remitting and recurring together. For example, greater alcohol use decreases the odds of smoking cessation. While unhealthy alcohol use, substance use, smoking, and depression often co-occur, their screening and treatment does not. Screening and treatment strategies for these conditions are typically specified separately and enacted separately because of a multitude of factors, including distinct clinical guidelines, varying strength of evidence underlying those guidelines and distinct providers and programs for the treatment of each condition. As a result, patients who are screened for one may not be screened for another, and patients who are treated for one may not be treated for another. We propose developing a decision-analytic model to evaluate beneficial effects as well as potentially harmful effects and resource implications of integrated screening and treatment."
"9301415","Two overarching questions guide the activities of the NBER Roybal Center:  (1) What factors influence households' health and savings decisions?  (2) Which interventions based on mechanisms in behavioral economics generate behavior change?  We study these questions by applying and testing models in economics, psychology, and other  behavioral sciences. We are particularly interested in identifying interventions that are cost-effective and  scalable and that significantly change behavior. We use a wide range of methods, including field  experiments, natural experiments, laboratory experiments, and applied theory.  The NBER Roybal Center emphasizes individual decision-making, a focus that is particularly relevant in  light of the growing role of individual choice in the health and savings domains. Today individuals  themselves play a key decision-making role through institutions like defined contribution pension plans,  IRAs, health insurance exchanges, and consumer-driven health care. Decisions about insurance plans,  provider choice, diet, exercise, medication adherence, preventive care, retirement savings rates, asset  allocation, and retirement wealth decumulation fall on the individual and not on employers or governments.  The NBER Roybal Center seeks out opportunities for translating basic science results from research in  the economics of health and aging into practical applications that improve health and economic well-being at  older ages. We also translate successful behavioral interventions developed in the domain of retirement  savings to the domain of health and, vice versa.  Our first set of pilots will address the following questions. (1) Can savings can be increased by turning  loan repayments into savings contributions when the loan is fully repaid? (2) What is the effect of different  delay horizons when committing to start saving in the future? (3) How does observability and feedback  increase hand hygiene among healthcare workers? (4) Can annuitization rates be increased by broadly  framing the annuitization decision and changing the default? (5) Can an active choice intervention raise the  fraction of households that adopt an advanced directive for end of life medical care? (6) What determines the  savings flows into Health Savings Accounts and the use of medical services by households with such  accounts?"
"9315082","Project Summary Compared with younger individuals, older people exposed to the same environmental or genetic stressors are more likely to develop lung disease that reduces lifespan and healthspan. Understanding the cause of this frailty of the aging lung is one of the most important challenges for clinical medicine. Preliminary proteomic data from Dr. Balch (Core B) confirm work from C.elegans suggesting the function of the proteostasis network in the lung declines with age. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages are a self-renewing population of cells that develop outside the bone marrow and are present in nearly every alveolus of the healthy lung where they reciprocally interact with cells in the alveolar epithelium via a network of cell surface receptors and chemokine/cytokines to finely tune the immune response to environmental pathogens and particulates in the lung. In response to injury or proteostatic stress, monocytes are recruited from the bone marrow to the lung where they assist in an orchestrated pro-inflammatory response. We have found that these bone marrow- derived alveolar macrophages persist in the lung after the resolution of injury where they appear similar to the tissue-resident alveolar macrophages but exhibit a much more exuberant inflammatory response in response to influenza A infection. These data support our hypothesis that the loss of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and their replacement by bone marrow-derived alveolar macrophages in response to proteostatic stress over the lifespan contributes to the age related loss of proteostatic reserve in the alveolar epithelium and the associated enhanced susceptibility to influenza A pneumonia. Aim 1. To determine whether replacement of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages by bone marrow- derived alveolar macrophages during aging contributes to the enhanced susceptibility to influenza A pneumonia in aged mice. Aim 2. To determine whether tissue-resident alveolar macrophages or bone marrow-derived alveolar macrophages differentially respond to or modulate epithelial proteostasis in response to influenza A infection. Aim 3. To determine whether the preventing differentiation of bone marrow-derived alveolar macrophages attenuates influenza A-induced changes in proteostasis and lung injury during aging. In concert with Dr. Balch (Core B) and the other project investigators, our experiments will provide an unprecedented window into the role played by the alveolar macrophage in responding to and preventing the age related decline in the function of the proteostasis networks in the lung epithelium. We will generate unbiased gene expression and proteomic data to identify therapeutically targetable regulatory hubs activated by tissue-resident macrophages to maintain proteostasis in the epithelium. "
"9488852","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global health burden of annual influenza epidemics coupled with emerging influenza pandemics highlight the urgent need for new, effective treatments. The majority of current circulating seasonal influenza viruses, as well as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 and H7N9, carry the S31N mutant in their M2 genes, which confers resistance to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine). Influenza viruses that are resistant to oseltamivir, the only orally available drug, are continuousy on the rise. Thus there is a persistent need for novel anti-influenza drugs. The M2-S31N mutation is persistent in more than 95% of currently circulating influenza A viruses, and it is one of the most conserved viral proteins. Therefore inhibitors targeting M2-S31N will be excellent candidates for the next generation of anti-influenza drugs. This proposal focuses on developing M2-S31N channel blockers with favorable drug-like properties and in vivo activities. We implement a multi-faceted approach that includes structure-based drug design, medicinal chemistry, electrophysiology, and virology to design M2-S31N channel blockers. The goal is to develop broad spectrum antiviral drugs that are active against clinical isolates of influenza A viruses that are resistant to one or both classes of currently approved anti-influenza drugs.  In the R21 phase we will focus on optimizing our previously discovered M2-S31N inhibitors as well as exploring novel chemotypes. The inhibitor design will be guided by our previously solved solution NMR structure of M2-S31N. Synthesized molecules will be tested in antiviral assays against clinically relevant influenza A viruses that show resistance to either amantadine or oseltamivir or both. The mechanism of action will be confirmed using electrophysiological assays and solution NMR NOESY spectroscopy. To prioritize compounds for the in vivo studies, we will profile the ADME properties of top lead compounds as well as evaluate their tendencies to elicit drug resistance.  In the R33 phase, we will evaluate the combination therapy potential of M2-S31N inhibitors with oseltamivir or ribavirin. The structure-activity relationship studies will e driven by the in vitro ADME properties, cytotoxicity, and synergistic effects with oseltamivir or ribavirin. We will assay the in vivo pharmacokinetic ADME properties of up to five compounds in mice. For efficacy studies, mice will be challenged with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted influenza A viruses, and M2-S31N inhibitors will be administrated by oral gavage or tail vein injection. Survival rate, body weight loss, and other clinical signs will be used to evaluate the i vivo efficacy of M2-S31N inhibitors.  Upon successful completion of the proposed studies, we will have at least one compound that is ready for the next stage of studies needed for Investigational New Drug (IND) filling."
"9305129","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hallmarks of cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease include bronchiectasis, inflammation by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from blood, obstruction by mucus, and infection by bacteria. In landmark studies, the AREST CF consortium showed that first signs of bronchiectasis in CF children occur in small airways and coincide with PMN recruitment and high activity of neutrophil elastase (NE) in the airway fluid. Recently, we showed that a large fraction of airway PMNs in chronic CF disease release NE while viable, as part of a reprogramming process that includes metabolic activation, caspase-1 activity and hyperexocytosis. Here, we show that similar hyperexocytosis occurs in airway PMNs from CF children. In addition, we introduce a new model of human small airway in which naive blood PMNs exposed to apical CF airway fluid in vitro are induced to transmigrate and become hyperexocytic, recapitulating features of CF airway PMNs in vivo. Our long-term goal is to develop therapies aimed at correcting PMN dysfunction, ideally via targeted intervention in early CF disease. As a step toward this objective, we will conduct a mechanistic study of PMN function in early CF leveraging: (i) our renewed understanding of PMN dysfunction in CF; (ii) our new in vitro model, and (iii) the unique AREST-CF study about to be initiated in the Netherlands. This prospective cohort is modeled after the Australian AREST-CF study, including computed tomography (CT) and airway fluid analysis at 12, 36 and 60 months to closely follow the onset and progression of early CF disease. Our overall hypothesis is that early CF disease coincides with airway PMN reprogramming. Our aims are to: AIM 1- Determine the extent of PMN reprogramming in early CF disease, in vivo. Hypothesis 1A: Airways in CF children contain reprogrammed PMNs. Hypothesis 1B: Progression of airway disease measured clinically in CF children associates with higher burden of reprogrammed PMNs. AIM 2- Identify mechanisms of PMN reprogramming by CF airway fluid, in vitro. Hypothesis 2A: Airway fluid from CF children induces PMN reprogramming in our model. Hypothesis 2B: Modulation of functional pathways in reprogrammed airway PMNs can inhibit their dysfunction and associated disease burden. To leverage the extraordinary research opportunity afforded by the parent study, we assembled a group of CF researchers with multidisciplinary expertise. This proposed ancillary study is highly time-sensitive, since the parent study will start shortly, and high-content assays included here (e.g., flow cytometry, image cytometry, multiplexed qPCR, targeted mass spectrometry) require immediate processing of patient samples. We expect this study to yield better mechanistic understanding of early CF disease and strong proof- of-concept data on new targeted therapies to help prevent the vicious cycle of CF airway inflammation."

"9355636","ABSTRACT To date, efforts to develop clinically viable in vivo chemical sensors for real-time monitoring of blood gases, electrolytes, glucose, lactate, etc. in critically ill hospital patients have been stymied by inaccurate analytical results due to sensor biocompatibility problems (cell adhesion, thrombus formation, etc.) and a high risk of infection. Our research over the past 15 years has been to explore and optimize the chemistry required to fabricate in vivo chemical sensors that slowly release low levels of nitric oxide (NO). The local release of NO mimics the chemistry that occurs at the inner walls of all healthy blood vessels (NO production by endothelium) and by immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils) and is expected to greatly enhance the biocompatibility and bactericidal properties of the intravascular sensors. This will lead to improved analytical performance of the implanted sensors and less risk of infection. Indeed, results obtained with prior NIH support have clearly demonstrated that in situ release of NO significantly reduces surface thrombus formation and improves the in vivo analytical accuracy of intravascular oxygen and glucose sensors. Very recently, a completely new type of NO releasing polymer material (S-nitrosothiol (RSNO) impregnated catheter tubing) has been developed that possesses highly desirable long-term shelf stability, long-term NO release, ease of sterilization with ETO, and low toxicity. We now wish to utilize this simple and low cost NO release chemistry to implement a new phase of research that we anticipate will lead to translation of this technology to real-time sensor technology for the intensive care units (ICU) at the end of the proposed 4-year project period. Our primary goal will be to assess whether these new materials can be readily used to fabricate catheter type electrochemical sensors (for oxygen, glucose, and lactate) that exhibit greatly enhanced in vivo analytical performance (in pigs and sheep). In addition to NO release, we will also explore the potential advantages of combining the new RSNO- impregnation chemistry with immobilized CD47 on the surface of the sensors. CD47 is a potent anti- inflammatory/anti-platelet activation agent that binds to the SIRP? receptor on surfaces of many inflammatory cells, including platelets. Optimal NO release and combined NO release/CD47 modified sensors for monitoring oxygen (PO2), glucose, and lactate will first be evaluated side-by-side (vs. corresponding non-NO release controls) in vivo within arteries and veins of anesthetized pigs (over 24 h period). The most promising approach derived from this initial screening will then be tested in fully awake sheep over 10 d periods to prove the enhanced analytical performance resulting from the antithrombotic/antimicrobial properties of this new generation of implantable electrochemical sensors. The ability to reliably measure critical care analytes in blood continuously at a patient's bedside is the ?holy grail? for biomedical sensor technology, and this goal can only be achieved when sensor performance is not compromised by biocompatibility and infection issues."
"9332397","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sepsis accounts for 250,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Unrestrained stimulation of phagocytes can induce Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) resulting in failure of multiple systemic organs. Prolonged SIRS leads to enhanced susceptibility to nosocomial infection. Phagocyte recognition of microbial products is mediated by Toll like receptors via activation of Toll/IL-1R (TIR) adaptor MyD88-dependent NF-kB activation. There are numerous endogenous brakes involved in TLR activation, including phosphatases SHIP-1 and DUSP. The role of the phosphatase and tensin homolog PTEN in controlling macrophage activation and its role in controlling polymicrobial sepsis is unknown. This project is based on preliminary data showing that PTEN inhibits MyD88 expression by controlling actions of specific microRNAs. Furthermore, while PTEN activation has protective effects in acute sepsis, enhanced and chronic PTEN expression produces deleterious effects favoring endotoxin tolerance and possibly secondary infection. The hypothesis to be tested is that although PTEN protects against overwhelming inflammatory responses early in acute sepsis, excessive PTEN expression is responsible for both the initiation and maintenance of sepsis-induced immunoparalysis states by impairing TLR activation in phagocytes. These studies will increase our overall understanding of how innate immunity works, and will produce insights regarding the pathogenesis of acute sepsis and enhanced susceptibility to secondary infection in deleterious conditions. We propose the following specific aims: 1 - Determine how PTEN controls transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications involved in MyD88 expression; 2- Determine how PTEN influences sepsis outcome and morbidities associated with secondary lung infection. The identification of specific components and their modes of action in maintenance of sepsis may identify targets for therapeutic intervention resulting in improved immune responsiveness in settings of host vulnerability, and may suggest strategies to dampen the immune response in settings of exaggerated inflammation."
"9301346","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twin studies have provided fundamental information about how genes and environment contribute to individual differences in brain structure and cognitive function in health and psychiatric disease and how these influences change during development. Previous twin studies in older children, adolescents and adults indicate that genetic and environmental influences are region/structure specific and change with age. Early childhood is period of rapid structural and functional brain development that is implicated in the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the role of genetic and environmental contributions to brain structure and function in this crucial period of development.  The Early Brain Development in Twins study has been the first, and to our knowledge the only, twin study of early childhood brain development. To date we have enrolled and studied over 275 twin pairs, at birth, 1, 2, 4, and 6 years and provided novel and previously unknown information about genetic and environmental influences on brain development in early childhood. In the next funding cycle, we propose to complete our twin study of early childhood brain development by following the current cohort to age 6. MRIs, including structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state functional imaging, will be done at ages , 4, and 6 years. Cognitive development, including RDoC constructs of language and working memory will be assessed. Additional innovations for this funding cycle include the application of a recently developed methodology for delineating cortical thickness and surface area in very young children, and the addition of resting state fMRI. Knowledge gained in this study will improve our basic understanding of human brain development, allow us to determine how modifiable abnormal developmental trajectories associated with risk for psychiatric disease may be, and help us determine when in development early interventions would have the greatest impact. Relevance New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for understanding genetic and environmental influences on early childhood brain development, a period of risk for many neuropsychiatric disorders and will provide the fundamental information critical for developing preventative strategies for these disorders."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Africa University (AU) in Zimbabwe strives to be a center of research excellence and a research leader, contributing to knowledge generation and knowledge dissemination for leadership development, and for social and economic transformation. This project seeks to strengthen the research administration infrastructure at AU, in order to assist researchers to successfully compete for international funding to carry out the much needed research to solve the many health problems that Zimbabwe is facing. Currently the biomedical and biobehavioural research output at Africa University is low. Lack of grants management and other support for researchers is thought to be a contributory factor. This project proposes to develop the recently established AU Office of Research and Outreach Programs (OROP) to make it fully functional and productive to serve the needs of the AU research community. The project proposes a plan to develop the capacity of Africa University OROP leadership and staff in various aspects of research administration. This will result in the availability of a user-friendly central research office that is led and staffed by well qualified ad motivated cadres to support and motivate interested AU faculty, students and staff to move to the next level of productivity in research. The project proposes an innovative cost-effective staffing plan for the OROP. Then a two-tiered capacity building plan where initially the research administration leaders are trained in many areas, including NIH policies and processes, then they in turn pass on the knowledge and skills they would have acquired to the OROP staff. A variety of training methods will be used, including internships, formal certified courses, seminars, workshops, e-lessons, exchange visits. Mentoring will be provided by well-experienced leaders in research administration. The OROP staff will in turn support and train AU researchers on key areas that include developing research proposals, implementing and managing grants, report and manuscript writing. The ultimate goal is research output increasing at AU, especially large externally funded research. This will generate income that will in turn sustain the OROP, enabling it to provide even more professional services to researchers."

"9277547","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sepsis is a catastrophic systemic inflammatory host response to infection, which can lead to vascular leak, edema, organ failure, and death. Despite intense study, few therapeutic strategies other than nonspecific supportive care have been developed and death rates remain as high as 60-70% in cases of septic shock. More than 750,000 Americans contract sepsis each year and more of these patients die than those that succumb to breast cancer, prostate cancer, and AIDS combined. It is known that agonists found in septic patients, such as inflammatory cytokines, VEGF, thrombin, microparticles, bacterial toxins, and bacteria themselves induce the vascular instability and edema that help trigger septic pathophysiology. Our preliminary data suggest that the direct and immediate effects of these endothelial-disrupting agents may be mediated by diverse receptors that signal via a common convergence point, the intracellular GTPase ARF6. ARF6 appears to control trafficking of cell-cell junction proteins and is distinct from the canonical inflammatory pathways that regulate transcription (e.g., those activating NF-?B). In animal models of inflammatory disease, inhibiting the activation of ARF6 either through conditional genetic ablation or chemical inhibition stabilizes the vasculature, decreases inflammation, and increases survival rates. Therefore, we hypothesize that activation of ARF6 during sepsis induces pathologic vascular leak, which contributes to multi-organ failure and death and that pharmacologic inhibition or genetic ablation of ARF6 or its activating ARF-GEFs will stabilize human and mouse endothelium exposed to septic insults and increase survival rates in animal models of sepsis. We realize that the septic response in mice may not completely mimic the human response. Therefore, we will assess the similarities and differences between the species in regards to ARF-GEF?ARF6 pathway and its control of vascular integrity. In Aim 1, we will determine whether ARF6 represents a convergence point for regulating vascular permeability induced by agonists generated in the septic milieu. We will use defined agonists that are present in the plasma of sepsis patients to determine whether these agonists signal through ARF6 or other ARF family members to induce paracellular permeability of both human and mouse endothelium. We will identify the ARF-GEFs and adaptor proteins involved in these signaling processes. In Aim 2, we will individually ablate Arf6 and Arno (a known ARF6-GEF) in mice and use chemical inhibition of ARF6 in several animal models of sepsis to determine whether removal or inhibition of ARF6 activity stabilizes the vasculature and increases survival rates. To more closely mimic clinical situations, we will also use ARF6 inhibition as an adjuvant to antibiotics to assess whether combination therapy can reduce vascular leak and mortality rates in these animal models. In Aim 3, we examine the efficacy of ARF6 inhibition in in vitro human models of sepsis by assessing endothelial integrity following ARF6 blockade and exposure to plasma or microparticles from septic patients. In vitro whole blood models of sepsis will also be used to assess ARF6 function."
"9312903","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a severe X-linked pediatric neurodegenerative disorder impacting myelination in the central nervous system. PMD results from mutations in the PLP1 gene which encodes the most prevalent myelin protein of the central nervous system. PMD exhibits a spectrum of clinical phenotypes that reflect wide genotypic heterogeneity, but nearly all forms of the disease result in progressive neurological deterioration and death, often during childhood. With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies and cell fate reengineering, we have now developed robust methods for generation of patient- specific oligodendrocytes in vitro. This provides new access to model the phenotypic and genotypic spectra within PMD. We have generated a large comprehensive panel of characterized iPSC lines from PMD patients that spans the full genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of the disorder. In this application we will focus on the patient-specific molecular and cellular deficits in PMD patient oligodendrocytes and provide platforms for testing of therapeutics. Aim 1 will use the robust human iPSC-derived oligodendrocyte differentiation protocols that we have developed as a phenotyping platform for examining PMD patient oligodendrocyte dysfunction and assessing the ability of clinically-relevant pharmacologic therapies to rescue individual phenotypes in vitro. Aim 2 will use an approach by which we can produce humanized chimeric mice whose oligodendrocytes and myelin have been largely replaced by human iPSC-derived oligodendroglia. Combining this technology with PMD iPSC lines from our panel will enable us to generate patient-specific PMD glial chimeras and examine oligodendrocyte dysfunction in vivo. In Aim 3 we will test if genetically-corrected PMD iPSC-derived OPCs show restored myelination capacity in glial chimeric mice. Together, these studies should provide us new insight into the cell and molecular deficits driving the pathogenesis of PMD. Our goal is to establish in vitro and in vivo platforms for the modeling and treatment of PMD, while providing a broad strategy for the treatment of hereditary disorders of myelin."
"9320758","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Muscle cells undergo both healthy and unhealthy adaptive changes in response to environmental cues. A notable example is the hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes following infarction. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to be regulated in some way through the G?q family of G proteins which mediates signals from hypertrophic agents such as angiotensin II. G?q activates phospholipase C-? (PLC?) enzymes to produce Ca2+ signals in cells. Long term adaptive G?q responses involve Rho/Rac protein. We have shown that the activation state of G?q is stabilized by caveolae. Caveolae are membrane invaginations that can mechanically accommodate increases in cell volume by flattening. We find that this flattening releases G?q and destabilizes its association with PLC?. Ca2+ signals are then attenuated. Reduced association with G?q allows PLC? to move into the cytosol to bind to C3PO. C3PO is required for efficient RNA silencing of gene by promoting the activity of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). We have found that increasing PLC? reverses RN A silencing of specific genes through its interaction with C3PO, and produces large changes the cellular levels of microRNAs that have been implicated in heart disease. Here, we will test this novel connection between mechanical stress and gene regulation through caveolae / G?q/ PLC? /C3PO. We will first determine the organization, concentration and oligomerization of G?q, its associated angiotensin receptor and PLC? in caveolae domains using a series of fluorescence imaging and biochemical methods. We will then view their release from caveolae domains in real time as caveolae flatten upon the reversible application of osmotic pressure. We will determine the impact of osmotic stress on changes in the microRNA population due to PLC?-C3PO association in real time using RNA beacons to monitor microRNA and fluorescence complementation to monitor protein association. We will test the ability of these microRNAs to promote physiological changes in the cell. Since we find that active siRNA processing affects Ca2+ through G?q, we will determine if the underlying mechanism involves changes in PLC?-C3PO association that occur as the C3PO machinery is engaged."

"9333374","PROJECT SUMMARY /ABSTRACT Acute kidney Injury (AKI)-associated morbidity and mortality is a major clinical problem that involves multiple overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms. Our lab and others have established the modulatory roles of T lymphocytes as well as the protective role of transcription factor Nrf2 in ischemia reperfusion (IR) and cisplatin induced AKI. We recently demonstrated that T cell deletion of Keap1 which augments specific Nrf2 activity provides significant protection from IR induced AKI in knockout mice, and that adoptive transfer of T cells with augmented Nrf2 activity improves kidney function and survival following AKI in wild type mice. These findings were accompanied by a significant increase in regulatory T (Treg) cell frequency and numbers, and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by T cells in the kidneys of mice with Keap1 deficient T cells. These novel observations reveal an unexpected relationship between Keap1 and T cell homeostasis and function in AKI, however the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The overarching aim of this proposed study is to test the hypothesis that Keap1 regulates the expansion of Treg cell population that subsequently suppresses harmful inflammatory responses during AKI. In order to test our hypotheses, we will determine whether Treg cells with Keap1 deletion have enhanced proliferation or decreased apoptosis as compared to Treg cells from wild type (WT) mice. We will also evaluate if Keap1 deletion increases the suppressive function of Treg cells, enhances TCR sensitivity in T cells and regulates response to IL-2 under steady state and in two different models (IR and cisplatin) of AKI in mice. To further establish the specificity of Keap1 deletion and to investigate any Nrf2 independent effects of Keap1 in T cells we will generate mice lacking Keap1 specifically in Treg, CD4 and CD8 T cells and determine whether Treg specific Keap1 deletion is sufficient to prevent ischemic and nephrotoxic AKI. We will further generate mice with T cell specific deletion of either Nrf2 alone or Keap1 and Nrf2 together (double KO) to delineate Nrf2 dependent and independent effects. In the final aim we will transition from mechanistic studies to experiments that will set the stage for clinical translation. We will explore therapeutic approaches including pharmacologic Nrf2 activators to activate Nrf2 and Keap1 specific CRISPR/Cas9 technology, siRNAs and miRNAs to delete Keap1 in mouse T cells ex vivo. We will then examine the effect of these Nrf2 activation/Keap1 deletion strategies on phenotypic and functional T cell responses as well as AKI outcome in IR and cisplatin AKI models. We will test the most promising Nrf2 activation/Keap1 deletion strategy in human primary T lymphocytes and examine its effects on Nrf2 regulated antioxidant response, proinflammatory cytokine production, and T cell dynamics. Successful completion of these studies should result in major advances regarding our understanding on the role of Keap1/Nrf2 in T cell homeostasis and function, and also set the stage for future clinical interventions targeting Keap1-Nrf2 pathway for AKI and other inflammatory diseases."
"9301605","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Project 1 will seek to identify genetic modifiers of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy by focusing on nonmanifesting earners of the 4qA allele. Several carriers of the 4q161PAS allele have been identified in Italy who have no manifestations nor family history of the disease. In addition, our Wellstone Center has identified families containing affected and nonmanifesting relatives who share the same allele and similarly express DUX4-FL in skeletal muscle. These individuals suggest that the current genetic signature of FSHD (D4Z4 contraction in the presence of the 4qA allele and a polyadenylation sequence in a distal pLAM sequence) is not an exclusive determinant of FSHD and that there is either a second-hit resulting in disease or a protective gene resulting in muscle health. Project 1 has two broad aims. The first aim is to identify and characterize nonmanifesting carriers of the FSHD allele. 10 nonmanifesting carriers without family history have been identified and examined in Italy and 4 nonmanifesting carriers from FSHD families have been identified and examined in the U.S. to date. Additional subjects will be recruited from the FSH Society and a large epidemiological study by the Italian National Registry for FSHD. Subjects will have detailed genotypic and phenotypic characterization including determination of DUX4-fl expression, muscle strength, muscle histopathology and muscle imaging. The second aim will identify genetic modifiers of FSHD through the use of whole-exome sequencing of nonmanifesting and affected individuals. In addition to an unbiased analysis of all -20,000 human genes, we will also test targeted hypotheses regarding whether variants in any of the ~300 known muscle-disease related genes are associated with FSHD manifestion, singly or collectively. Project 1 will interact closely with Project 2 where RNAseq will generate RNA sequence information that will confirm and add to the exome sequence data to identify genetic changes related to modifiers. Project 1 will also identify subjects that will be the source of donation of muscle and myoblasts for xenografts in Project 3.

"9242086","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Glioblastoma is an incurable primary brain tumor. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are a subpopulation of cells that resist standard therapy to contribute to disease progression. Identification of new GSC-specific targets may facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. We have found that GSCs appropriate an evolutionary conserved neurodevelopmental program to promote their tumorigenicity. GSCs utilize Sema3C/PlexinD1 to promote the defining features of GSCs: survival, self-renewal, invasion and radioresistance. Importantly, neural progenitor cells do not use this pathway, suggesting that inhibition of Sema3C/PlexinD1 will have a high therapeutic index. We now guide the clinical translation of Sema3C/PlexinD1 into the clinic. Our central hypothesis is that GSCs use Sema3C/PlexinD1 to promote their own self- renewal and that Sema3C/PlexinD1 serve as important prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In Aim 1, we will use our large GBM specimen collection to assess the prevalence of Sema3C/PlexinD1 receptor in GBM and test the prognostic value of Sema3C in long and short-term survivors of GBM. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of Sema3C/PlexinD1 in regulating Wnt/?-catenin signaling. In Aim 3, we will provide proof- of-principle that targeting the Sema3C/PlexinD1 signaling axis in combination with radiation improves survival in mouse models of glioblastoma. If successful, these findings will lead to a prospective clinical trial assessing Sema3C as a prognostic biomarker and guide the development of novel therapeutics targeting Sema3C/PlexinD1."
"9522240","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the concomitant loss of dopamine in the striatum. While multiple processes likely contribute to the loss of dopamine neurons, we argue that disruption of the proper storage and release of dopamine from vesicles plays a key role. This theory is supported by the literature, which demonstrates that improper storage of dopamine causes the formation of oxidative dopamine byproducts and toxic aldehydes that damages neurons. Evidence from genetic and toxicological studies of PD demonstrates that many insults converge on the dopamine vesicle to exert their deleterious effects. We hypothesize that vesicular function mediates dopamine neuron toxicity, such that increasing vesicle function will enhance dopamine storage and release and confer resistance to neurotoxicants, while decreasing vesicle function will have the opposite effect. Our laboratory has generated and characterized two unique mouse lines that allow us to test this hypothesis: a bacterial artificial chromosome-based transgenic mouse that overexpresses VMAT2 (VMAT2-HI) and a genetic knockout of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C-KO), which was recently implicated in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Here, we provide preliminary data that clearly demonstrate that increased vesicular function is beneficial to the dopamine system and that SV2C is a novel regulator of dopamine uptake and release. Together, these findings provide the basis for the following aims. Aim 1: To determine the effects of variable VMAT2 or SV2C expression on vesicular dopamine storage and release dynamics. We will determine how these genetic manipulations alter vesicular dynamics, including the readily releasable pool. Aim 2: To determine if altered vesicular storage and release alters vulnerability of dopamine neurons in a model of PD. We determine the effect of reduced SV2C or increased VMAT2 on MPTP toxicity in aged mice, a classical and well-established model. Aim 3: To determine if altered vesicular storage and release of dopamine influences vulnerability to the PD-related toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). We expect that our mice will show an inverse correlation between vesicle function and PCB-induced. In addition to the novel mouse lines generated in our laboratory we will use a suite of cutting-edge techniques in our studies, including optogenetic stimulation, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, in vivo microdialysis, and CLARITY. Completion of these aims will establish a pivotal concept in neuroprotection: increasing vesicle function improves neurotransmitter signaling and opposes dopamine neuron toxicity. This suggests that modulation of synaptic vesicle function represents an innovative and unexplored opportunity for addressing dopamine neuron dysfunction and provides a foundation for new therapeutic approaches."

The postdoctoral trainees who participate in the CSTP include both M.D. and Ph.D. trainees. The M.D. trainees are physician scientists most commonly recruited from the Cardiology Fellowship Program at the University of Chicago, and the Ph.D. trainees have received their graduate degrees in diverse areas and seek additional training in the cardiovascular sciences. The CSTP also supports predoctoral training, an element essential to this integrated training program. The postdoctoral training strikes a balance between clinically-trained M.D. fellows who plan careers combining research with clinical medicine, and outstanding Ph.D. fellows who are dedicated to cardiovascular research. The CSTP offers training in six core components: 1) Molecular Cardiology, 2) Genetics/genomics, 3) Development and stem cell biology, 4) Imaging and Translational Biology, 5) Systems Biology, and 6) Vascular & Inflammation. Each of these areas has as its scientific mission furthering our understanding of cardiovascular function in health and disease. To this end, participants in this training program receive didactic, laboratory-based, ethics, and analytic training in order to prepare for careers in cardiovascular research. We propose to continue supporting 3 pre-doctoral and 6 post-doctoral trainees. The range of experience for the post-doctoral trainees ranges from 0 to 6 years of post-doctoral training since M.D. fellows have often completed postgraduate medical training at the time they begin in full time research in the CSTP. In the last training period, we emphasized programs in genetic and genomics reflecting the growth in these fields and their successful application to the cardiovascular sciences. We also enriched training opportunities in regenerative sciences since important advances have been made for cardiac and vascular biology in this area. In this next interval, we have additionally enlisted trainers with accomplishments in systems biology and analysis responding to needs to take better advantage of emerging and existing big data and the expertise on the University of Chicago campus. Systems analysis will be integrated with cardiac genetics and development and regeneration biology, since these topics are critical to define the normal and abnormal function of the heart."
"9293121","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Gulf War illness (GWI), a multisymptom condition resulting from service in the Persian Gulf War (GW), is one of the most prominent health issues affecting GW Veterans. Insomnia is common in Veterans with GWI. For example, all of the Veterans in our current VA Merit GW project who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for GWI and 64% of the Veterans who meet the Kansas GWI case definition (which, unlike the CDC4 case definition, has exclusionary conditions), have Insomnia Severity Index scores indicative of clinical insomnia. Furthermore, insomnia severity and subjective sleep quality are significantly correlated with GWI symptom severity, as assessed by the Kansas Gulf War Military History and Health Questionnaire (r's >0.45, p's <0.01) in these Veterans. This suggests that: (1) sleep disruption adversely affects systems (e.g., cognition, neuroendocrine, and autonomic) that likely play an important role in GWI, and (2) there are reciprocal links between sleep quality, sleep-wake regulation, and fatigue, a common symptom of individuals with GWI and insomnia. Study co-investigators Drs. Neylan and Maguen have previously shown Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) to be efficacious for reducing insomnia and non-sleep posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Because current PTSD symptom severity is also strongly correlated with insomnia and GWI symptom severity in Veterans in our current VA Merit project (r's >0.45, p's <0.01), we hypothesize that CBT-I will similarly reduce insomnia and non-sleep GWI symptoms in GW Veterans. The proposed study will test this hypothesis in a pilot trial of CBT-I for sleep and non-sleep GWI symptoms. Insomnia is commonly under-recognized and untreated. For example, none of the Veterans in our current VA Merit GW project who likely have clinical insomnia have heard of or have been referred to CBT-I by their VA healthcare providers. This suggests that, despite the VA's national roll-out of CBT-I, Veterans with GWI are not the target population for CBT-I. Although CBT-I has been studied in a number of disorders comorbid with insomnia, we contend that examining CBT-I in the context of GWI is important because: 1) insomnia is common in Veterans with GWI, 2) untreated insomnia can lead to significant medical and psychiatric morbidity; 3) there is still no evidence-based treatment for GWI nearly 25 years after the end of the Gulf War. Furthermore, our proposal to modify CBT-I for telephone delivery, which studies have found to be as efficacious as face-to-face CBT-I, is significant because it will extend this effective form of behavioral sleep therapy to the Veterans with GWI who have physical and/or functional impairments that may limit their ability to participate in treatments that require regular clinic visits. The proposed study will employ a two-arm randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of telephone- delivered CBT-I for sleep and non-sleep GWI symptoms in 64 Veterans with GWI according to the CDC and Kansas case definitions and insomnia disorder according to DSM-5 research diagnostic criteria. Half of the Veterans will be randomized to CBT-I and half to a treatment-as-usual control group. Veterans randomized to the control group will have the option of receiving telephone-delivered CBT-I upon completion of the study. The primary outcomes will be effect sizes based on within-group comparisons of pre-to-post-treatment change and maintenance of treatment effects at 6 months in the group randomized to CBT-I. In light of the RAC's 2014 recommendation that the first priority of federal Gulf War illness research must be the identification of effective treatments to improve the health of Gulf War Veterans, the proposed trial may be an important first step towards identifying a non-pharmacologic treatment with relatively low burden and few known risks that could benefit some of the estimated 175,000 Veterans with GWI injured during their military service."
"9322522","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  B7-1/CD80 is known as a bidirectional regulator of T cell activation and tolerance. We previously reported an unanticipated novel role for B7-1 in podocytes as inducible mediator of podocyte injury and proteinuria in humans and animals. B7-1 can be targeted by blocking antibodies such as Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig), which is currently used for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Our novel data obtained with this grant suggest that the anti-proteinuric action of CTLA4-Ig is independent of its inhibitory action on T cell costimulation but stems from a direct effect on podocytes. Our novel data further suggest that the upregulation of B7-1 in podocytes actively contributes to the pathogenesis of proteinuria by altering podocyte structure and function. Most importantly, they offer a rationale for the use o Abatacept as anti-proteinuric treatment. Here we propose to test our central hypothesis that induction of B7-1 expression in podocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of proteinuria by blocking talin mediated ?1 integrin activation in podocytes. We further hypothesize that Abatacept/CTLA4-Ig and possible Belatacept prevent proteinuria by blocking B7-1 signaling in podocytes. To test this hypothesis we propose two Specific Aims. The first Aim will define the mechanistic role of B7-1 and the effects of its blockade on podocyte- matrix adhesion. Specific Aim 2 will assess the anti-proteinuric therapeutic potential of B7-1 blockade in mice. If our hypothesis is correct, the work proposed here will have broad significance in the long-term, because it will firmly establish the rationale for a prospective clinical study of B7-1 blockade in patients with proteinuria, including cases of recurrent and non-recurrent FSGS. This should in the long-term enable us to develop novel therapies that tackle proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis by blocking B7-1 signaling in podocytes."
"9307959","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF affects multiple organs, including lungs, pancreas, intestine, liver, sweat glands, gallbladder and the male genital tract. Airway infection and inflammation currently cause most of the morbidity and mortality. Although several therapies have improved the lives of patients, current treatments are inadequate and CF remains a lethal disease. Our knowledge about the pathogenesis of the disease, its progression, and the state of the neonatal lung is inadequate. These gaps in our knowledge have hindered attempts to develop better treatments and preventions for CF lung disease. A major impediment to addressing these issues has been limitations of current animal models. Although mouse strains carrying null and missense CFTR mutations have made enormous contributions, CF mice do not develop the airway or pancreatic disease typically found in humans. We recently generated CF pigs that replicate many of the key features of human CF disease including intestinal obstruction, exocrine pancreatic destruction, micro-gallbladder, vas deferens abnormalities, focal billary cirrhosis, congenital airway structural abnormalities, and airway and sinus infection with time. The goals ofthe Animal Core will be to (1) Provide Program investigators with CF and non-CF pigs; (2) Help Program investigators successfully accomplish the aims of their Projects. The Animal Core will function seamlessly through already established interactions with the Project Leaders, Morphology Core, Imaging Core, and the Administrative Core. The success ofthe Animal Models Core is ensured because ofthe commitment, experience, and expertise that the personnel bring to the Core."
"9310045","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Follow-up through Middle School of a Randomized Study of Public Prekindergarten  Project Summary (30 lines) The experimental evidence for positive effects of prekindergarten programs comes from studies of preschool programs that are more intensive than the current public prekindergarten models and which were not implemented on the same scale as typical contemporary public pre-k. Though it is not widely recognized, there are in fact no well-controlled experimental studies of typical public prekindergarten programs with longitudinal follow-up that would reveal whether such programs produce the expected long-term effects. This application proposes a follow-up through middle school of a large randomized control trial of a state-funded public prekindergarten program, specifically the Tennessee Voluntary Pre-K Program (TN-VPK). TN-VPK serves children eligible for the federal free or reduced price lunch programs, requires a licensed teacher and an aide in each classroom, a maximum class size of 20 children, and a state-approved curriculum. This application proposes a follow-up from 4th grade through 8th grade of 3008 children who were randomly assigned to participate or not in TN-VPK. Data were collected annually from the state database for all children and individually for a subsample of 1076 children with parental consent. The findings of the TN-VPK study to date have shown what other longitudinal studies of more intensive early childhood programs have generally found: a wide range of positive outcomes immediately after program participation and mixed effects over a longer term. The effects on achievement measures often fade out, but behavioral/non-cognitive effects such as lower grade retention, higher graduation rates, decreased delinquency, and the like begin to emerge. The procedural aims of the research proposed in this application are to (a) follow the full randomized sample (N=3008) through middle school with annual data collection on achievement and behavioral/non-cognitive outcomes from the Tennessee state education data system, and (b) collect additional more extensive data annually from the children and their parents and teachers for a subsample of approximately 700 children. During middle school the instructional material becomes more challenging, children are required to take greater responsibility for their learning, and problem behaviors often emerge, including many of the behavioral/non-cognitive effects others have found to be influenced by early childhood. The major analyses required to address the specific aims of this research fall into three categories: (a) estimation of the main effects o TN-VPK participation on late elementary and middle school outcomes; (b) exploration of the extent to which TN-VPK effects on some of those outcomes (self-regulation, school engagement, peer relations) that are evident by the end of the elementary grades mediate the effects on achievement, other academic outcomes, and problem behavior outcomes at the end of middle school; and (c) investigation of the extent to which TN-VPK main effects and/or mediated effects on the various outcomes are moderated by the quality of the schools attended or demographic characteristics of the students."
"9360352","Project Summary Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. A fully effective vaccine would be a huge addition to our armamentarium. The most promising vaccine candidate to date, RTS,S, a subunit vaccine composed of a portion of the sporozoite's major surface protein, CSP, has shown limited efficacy that wanes significantly after the first year. Though this falls short of community established goals, RTS,S provides a substrate upon which we can build to create a more efficacious vaccine. The studies outlined in this proposal aim to elucidate the interactions between host and parasite at the inoculation site with the goal of improving future vaccine design. Sporozoites are inoculated into the skin of the mammalian host as mosquitoes search for blood. Few sporozoites are injected, making this a bottleneck for the parasite. After their inoculation, sporozoites are actively motile in the skin, and must find and penetrate blood vessels to enter the circulation. Our studies demonstrate that the majority of sporozoites take 20 to 120 minutes to exit the dermis and only a small proportion succeed in entering the blood circulation. Once in the circulation, sporozoites go to the liver and enter hepatocytes within minutes. Sporozoite passage through the dermis is an understudied phase of malaria infection: Yet, the low numbers of inoculated sporozoites together with the discovery that the parasite is extracellular for the longest period of time in the skin, suggest that this is a time of extreme vulnerability. My laboratory has been studying the dynamics of sporozoite transmission for several years and we are now using quantitative intravital imaging to better understand the requirements for successful exit from the dermis. In Aim 1, we will perform intravital imaging studies with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, quantitatively analyzing its motility and blood vessel interactions, in both mouse skin and human skin xenografts. Comparative analysis with rodent malaria sporozoites will identify conserved and species- specific aspects of dermal exit and define metrics that predict successful exit from the dermis. These studies will also enable the development of an in vivo platform to screen vaccine candidates with P. falciparum sporozoites. Previous studies in mice and in RTS,S immunized humans have shown that CSP-specific antibodies correlate with protection, however, the location and mechanism(s) by which these antibodies impact sporozoites are not known. In Aims 2 and 3, we will perform intravital imaging and infection studies with rodent and human malaria sporozoites to determine: a) whether antibodies targeting the two leading sporozoite vaccine candidates have their its greatest impact in the skin; b) the degree to which functional antibodies rely on their ability to inhibit sporozoite motility versus their ability to opsonize sporozoites and direct their destruction by innate immune cells and c) whether fast gliding and cell traversal enable the sporozoite, at least in some cases, to escape the innate host response and the inhibitory activity of antibody. We feel confident that the knowledge gained from these studies will inform the design of future malaria vaccine candidates."
"9486101","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to create a massively scalable toolkit to enable large, multi-center Patient-centered Information Commons (PIC) at local, regional and, national scale, where the focus is the alignment of all available biomedical data per individual. Such a Commons is a prerequisite for conducting the large-N, Big Data, longitudinal studies essential for understanding causation in the Precision Medicine (1) framework while simultaneously addressing key complexities of Patient Centric Outcome Research studies required under ACA (Affordable Care Act). Our proposal is solidly grounded in our experience over the last 25 in harnessing clinical care data to the research enterprise. In creating PIC we propose to focus on: 1. Enable the identification and retrieval of all data that pertain to individal health by creating a data sharing architecture that is capacious enough for all relevant data types and that enables patient and institutional autonomy to be respected. 2. Test fully-scaled implementations of the proposed architecture early in the development process, with the active involvement of a committed user community that seeks to use allowed us to refine our designs to facilitate subsequent robust dissemination and adoption. 3. Provide commodity workflows that can be used to 'clean' and complete the often noisy and sparse data gathered in the course of observational studies. 4. Embrace decentralization while enabling the construction of a nationally or regionally-scaled patient-centered information commons. 5. Encourage the selection of standards through the tools that enable the construction of patient-centered information commons. 6. Employ diagnostic classification and prognostication as figures of merit to measure how well a patient-centered information commons adds the understanding of patient populations. In addition to the research and development agenda we have also taken on the development of educational opportunities for end user community to become more familiar with the methods and challenges of data science."
"9333401","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danton Char. This K01 will provide the support for him to acquire the necessary training, practical experience and knowledge to become an independent clinical investigator in the ethical, legal and social implications surrounding the implementation of genetics/genomics to the clinical care of critically ill infants and children in the perioperative environment, particularly the ELSI issus that relate to the care of children with complex heart disease (CHD). Within the time period of this award, his goal is to capitalize on the knowledge he's gained from his clinical training as a pediatric cardiac anesthesiologist and his training in clinical research to reposition himself as a ELSI researcher for this fragile patient population. To achieve this goal, Dr. Char will use this award to obtain training and competence in qualitative research methods, genetics and bioethics and to gain mentored experience in developing and implementing an independent ELSI research project. He has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Mildred Cho, who is the Principal Investigator at Stanford's Center for Integration of Research on Genetics and Ethics; a co-mentor, Dr. David Magnus, Director of Stanford's center for bioethics; and two additional advisors, Dr. Sandra Lee, an anthropologist who conducts research on the integration of genomics into medicine and Dr. Euan Ashley, Director of Stanford's Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, who's research is focused on the interpretation of whole genome sequencing to improve the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. We have virtually no knowledge about how clinical genomics will affect critical care. Using both qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess clinician and parent attitudes on the potential impact of whole genome sequencing (WGS) on the care of critically ill children with CHD, this project proposes to pursue 3 aims: (1) How clinicians caring for critically ill children with CHD anticipate/perceive the impact of WGS on care choices; (2) How the perception of WGS by parents/caregivers of critically ill children with CHD is affected by different potential clinical uses of WGS in these children; (3) To observe directly ELSI issues that emerge with the pilot implementation of WGS to the care of critically ill children with CHD."
"9294177","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal for this project is to advance our understanding of developmental disorders of the brainstem and cerebellum, brain structures derived from the embryonic midbrain and hindbrain, which we refer to collectively as mid-hindbrain malformations (MHM). These disorders affect a minimum of 1 per 6-7000 live births, and likely far more as these numbers do not account for cerebellar abnormalities associated with preterm birth or with autism. Further, cerebellar malformations are known to co-occur with several more common developmental disorders including autism, mental retardation and some types of early life epilepsy. With this renewal, we propose to continue using our large and growing cohort of human subjects with MHM to define the genes, pathways and biological mechanisms underlying these developmental disorders. We will use the most recent genomic technology - massively parallel (NextGen) sequencing of targeted gene panels, whole exome sequencing (WXS) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) - combined with older methods to find the causes of both rare and common MHM. In Aim 1, we will continue to search for genes underlying rare single gene causes of MHM that will demonstrate the most important molecular pathways, including pathways that contribute to more common disorders such as autism. As an example, we have identified the first missense mutation of the AUTS2 gene (previously linked to autism) in a child with MHM. In Aim 2, we will turn to the more challenging but also more important problem of Dandy-Walker malformation, the most common MHM in humans. This specific malformation demonstrates substantial causal heterogeneity and has proven difficult to solve with older technologies, making whole exome and genome sequencing approaches essential. Aims 1-2 need to be supported by ongoing subject recruitment, as studies of comparable disorders such as mental retardation and autism have benefited from large numbers of subjects. In Aim 3, we propose to test the biological function of genes and networks identified in Aims 1-2 using new CRISPR/Cas technology to efficiently generate new mouse models of proven and strong candidate MHM-associated genes. For example, we are now generating the first mouse models of Auts2. We expect that these studies will contribute rapidly to more accurate diagnosis and counseling, and over time will lead to development of specific treatments for a subset of these disorders. We predict that studies of mid-hindbrain development will have broad significance for human developmental disorders generally, providing compelling evidence for a connection between cerebellar development and other classes of developmental disorders."
"9391407","Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in practice. This cardiac arrhythmia can be sporadic in occurrence and varies in frequency and duration among individuals. However, AF that remains undetected and untreated can result in a poor quality of life, hospitalization, stroke, and death. New, easy to use mobile health (mHealth) methods for detecting AF in the community are needed to facilitate timely detection and treatments aimed at better symptom and clinical management and ultimately improved outcomes.  mHealth is a promising platform for self-management of diseases like AF because of the widespread use of mobile technologies, especially among minorities, and the sophistication of mobile electrocardiogram (ECG) software that allows users to record and transmit ECGs to distinguish between a normal rhythm and AF. However, longitudinal data indicates that mHealth use declines over time. Little is known about factors that are associated with sustained engagement with mHealth, yet it is important to understand these factors to optimize the efficacy of mHealth through increased adherence. This has the potential to improve the health outcomes of those living AF. Preliminary studies suggest that individual user characteristics, such as age and disease status, may play a role in sustained engagement; however, this concept has not been thoroughly explored.  We aim to take a personalized approach to understanding factors associated with sustained engagement with ECG mHealth technology. In this mixed-methods study, we plan to use participants enrolled in the iHEART trial, an ongoing NINR-supported randomized controlled trial of individuals with AF. We will focus on participants randomized to the iHEART intervention because they will use ECG mHealth technology for six months. Sustained engagement in this study is voluntary use of the ECG mHealth technology per iHEART protocol (at least twice daily for six months). iHEART research coordinators prompt participants to transmit ECGs when forgotten for one week. Preliminary data indicates that approximately half of iHEART participants are not engaged because they require weekly prompting.  We will test differences in trajectories of ECG mHealth technology use over the six-month period between engaged and unengaged users using individual growth models. Predictors and moderators of sustained engagement will come from an adapted model of technology acceptance and use that uses and accounts for unique user characteristics, and can be measured using ECG and survey data collected during the iHEART trial. We will conduct focus groups with the iHEART mHealth ECG participants (intervention group) to gain deeper insight into these factors from the user perspective. This project has the potential to provide valuable insight on factors that are associated with mHealth engagement in a high risk AF population."
"9386178","PROJECT SUMMARY The mammalian brain is formed by billions of neurons which communicate at specialized chemical junctions called synapses. Individual neurons connect to form functional circuits which are required for proper learning and memory, and disruption of neuronal circuitry underlies the debilitating symptoms experienced by patients suffering from neurological disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Although proper formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits is essential for a high quality of human life, the process by which a given neuron finds the correct synaptic pair, and how these synapses are maintained and modified over time is poorly understood. Recent work from our labs and others have identified astrocytes, the most abundant CNS glial cell type, as a major regulator of synaptic development. Astrocytes are both pro-synaptogenic (e.g. loss of astrocytes results in decreased synaptogenesis) as well as anti-synaptogenic (e.g. astrocytes engulf and prune synapses). These important functions of astrocytes in regulating synapse number suggest that astrocytes may regulate broader circuit formation, though this hypothesis has not been fully investigated.  Characterization of astrocyte-neuron dynamics within a behaviorally-relevant circuit has not been performed, probably because it requires in vivo manipulation of a defined pair of synaptically-coupled neurons and the associated astrocytes. Given the enormous complexity of the mammalian nervous system, these types of experiments are not yet feasible in mammals. Excitingly, it is now possible to perform these studies in the Drosophila nervous system due to the recent development of tools for astrocyte manipulation from the Freeman lab, and identification of neural circuits governing larval locomotion in the Doe lab. As a co-mentored postdoctoral fellow within the Doe and Freeman laboratories, I will merge these new tools to have the unique ability to visualize and genetically manipulate individual central synapses, which I will couple with targeted manipulation of the associated astrocytes to define the role of astrocytes in synapse formation, maintenance, and function. For all studies, I will use recently identified transgenic lines that label defined synaptic pairs: the excitatory cholinergic synapses between E2 and SA1 interneurons, and the inhibitory, GABAergic synapses between A31k interneuron and RP2 motor neuron. Astrocytes will be visualized using anti-Gat immunofluorescence or expression of UAS-myr::Cerulean under alrm-GAL4.  In my first aim, I will couple astrocyte ablation experiments with mutant analyses to test the necessity of functional astrocytes in the development (formation) of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In my second aim, I will use an optogenetic strategy to measure the activity (function) of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in response to changes in astrocyte function. Finally, in my third aim, I will manipulate neuronal activity (through constitutive activation or silencing of defined pre-synaptic neurons) and test the hypothesis that neuronal activity influences both astrocyte morphology and function. In sum, these experiments will define the in vivo role of astrocytes in the formation, function, and maintenances of excitatory and inhibitory synapses within a behaviorally-relevant, sensorimotor circuit."
"9361323","Chronic pain represents a significant public health concern, affecting over 100 million adults, and accounting for over $600 billion US annually. Current treatments for chronic pain lack efficacy, and opioid treatments have led to a significant misuse, addiction, and secondary public health crisis. We have shown that endogenous pain modulation, in the form of ?placebo? manipulations have a now well-defined neural underpinning, suggestive of descending pain modulation within and perhaps from the brain to lower nervous system. Our work has identified placebo as a potentially acceptable intervention for patients with chronic pain either as a method to enhance existing treatments, or perhaps as a stand-alone treatment. To date, the contribution of spinal cord mechanisms to placebo analgesia has been largely speculative. We propose to investigate specific hypotheses about both brain and spinal cord mechanisms, and their interactions to a model of placebo analgesia through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). The neural imaging of the spinal cord is an innovative new approach heretofore not feasible for the investigation of placebo mechanisms. We will combine this new approach with our previously published, and well articulated placebo manipulation and experimental design that will allow us to investigate the relative contribution of brain and cord mechanisms in placebo analgesia. We will employ both traditional fMRI, as well as functional connectivity analyses to investigate relationships among a priori regions of interest in the brain and the spinal cord. Our innovative research design, previously employed with only brain imaging, will allow for the investigation of more centrally dependent mechanisms, vs. those that are more peripheral nervous system dependent. Our team of investigators has all the necessary expertise in chronic pain, pain processing, quantitative sensory testing, neuroimaging, and experimental design to successfully accomplish the aims proposed in this application. We have repeatedly shown our ability to successfully recruit participants for the proposed design, and have successfully employed all the procedures, either in peer reviewed publications, or as demonstrated in our preliminary studies. One critical finding from our previous work has shown that the acceptability of placebo interventions is the empirical support and understanding of the mechanisms of placebo. Thus, in addition to developing a complete understanding of the mechanisms of placebo that might results in new treatment approaches, being able to describe these mechanisms to the public, pain practitioners, and to patients will increase the acceptability of them in clinical practice, thus improving pain treatment."
"9509932","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal of Gene-Environment Interaction in Adolescent Alcohol Use (R01AA015416), a new investigator research grant that used data from a longitudinal, population-based Finnish twin study to characterize the extent and nature of gene-environment interactions on substance use and externalizing behavior across adolescence. Our analyses demonstrated that etiological factors impacting substance use and externalizing behavior in adolescence vary profoundly as a function of the environment. In this competing renewal, we propose to use data now available on the twins in the young 20s (range 21-27 years) to characterize gene-environment interplay across the transition to young adulthood. The young 20s is a period of critical change as new environments become developmentally relevant (e.g., romantic partnerships, continuation vs. cessation of education, joining the workforce, having children). It also represents a critical time for the development of risky alcohol use behaviors and the onset of problems. This application, prepared by a team of investigators from Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Helsinki, and Indiana University, has three specific aims. The first aim is to use twin data to characterize gene-environment processes (both gene-environment correlation and interaction) on substance use and externalizing behavior in young adulthood. The second aim is to conduct a series of exploratory analyses aimed at understanding how gene-environment interaction effects identified in twin data can inform our understanding of GxE effects associated with measured genes. We will test whether environments that moderate latent genetic risk in the twin analyses also moderate the association between specific individual genotypic risk and outcome. The third aim is to test the generalizability of identified gene environment interaction effects in a second, independent sample, the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development, with phenotypic data collection across a parallel age range from adolescence to young adulthood, and GWAS data. Together, these analyses will advance our understanding of how genetic and environmental influences come together to contribute to substance use patterns during the high-risk young adulthood developmental phase."

"9281683","Project Summary/Abstract for µCT Imaging Core   The development of high-resolution micro-CT (µCT) during the past two decades has revolutionized the  quantitative assessment of calcified and X-ray dense tissue morphology. With the capability of non-destructive,  three-dimensional (3D) visualization of tissue structure, µCT has largely supplanted traditional  histomorphometry and become a gold standard for calcified tissue density and microstructure evaluation for  many measures. Due to the low intrinsic X-ray contrast of non-mineralized tissues, traditional applications of  µCT in musculoskeletal research have been limited to mineralized tissue. However, the development of  contrast-enhanced imaging methods has greatly broadened applications of µCT to include musculoskeletal  soft tissues as well. These cutting-edge image-based quantification methods not only enable characterization  of soft-tissue morphology, but some also yield insight into tissue composition, such as glycosaminoglycan  (GAG) density, which is associated with soft-tissue function and mechanics. Another important advance in the  past decade is in vivo µCT imaging of living small animals. Research of musculoskeletal tissue injury and  repair has been progressively utilizing animal models of human disease. Unlike many assays that require  sacrificing the animal to extract tissues for analysis, in vivo µCT enables longitudinal evaluation of changes in a  particular animal non-invasively over time. This new imaging strategy minimizes the number of animals  required while enhancing statistical power. With these developments, µCT can now provide a deep and  quantitative understanding of the genetic influences on the skeleton, as well as remodeling events in hard and  soft tissues during repair, treatment, and with altered loading scenarios. Further, a µCT modality for clinical  imaging of calcified tissue microstructure, called high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT), has  recently been developed. This technology inaugurated a new era of non-invasive quantitative skeletal imaging,  and has become a powerful tool for clinical research of musculoskeletal disorders. The overall objective of the  µCTIC is to offer a wide range of µCT imaging approaches to evaluate musculoskeletal tissue injury and repair,  and to provide training and consultation for new projects and collaborations utilizing these assays. The Specific  Aims for the µCTIC are: 1) To provide guidance and expertise on the use of µCT imaging for musculoskeletal  research through educational enrichment programs and one-on-one interactions, 2) To provide a range of µCT  imaging resources, expertise, and services for the study of the structure, function and physiology of the  musculoskeletal system in laboratory animals and humans, 3) To develop new µCT imaging-based techniques  that will be applicable to musculoskeletal research, and 4) To provide funding for the development of new  projects and collaborations and to develop preliminary and/or feasibility data for investigators."
"9322539","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Apolipoprotein-B (apoB) containing lipoproteins, as marked by plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG), are causal, heritable risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI), the leading cause of death worldwide. New strategies to lower apoB- containing lipoproteins and MI risk are needed and studying inherited human genetic variation can lead to therapeutic targets that reduce MI risk. Through population-based sequencing and genotyping studies we and others are deriving systematic catalogues of all protein-coding DNA variants present in tens of thousands of individuals characterized for plasma LDL-C, TG, and MI status. However, most protein-coding variants discovered through these approaches are neutral, i.e., they have little or no effect on the function of the protein encoded by the gene. As such, attempts to associate protein-coding variants with LDL-C, TG, or MI face a tremendous signal to noise problem where the signal from functional alleles is overwhelmed by the noise from neutral alleles. Therefore, the critical barrie facing human genetic studies is distinguishing alleles causal for disease from nonpathogenic variants. To overcome this challenge, we propose a systematic cell-based functional genomics approach that: 1) establishes cell-based assays to measure apoB biology; 2) tests the effect of specific genes and variants on cellular assays; and 3) analyzes association with either lipids or MI risk after weighting alleles based on their functional significance in these cellular assays. We hypothesize that the combination of genetics with systematically- acquired functional data in cells can pinpoint new genes responsible for not only altered LDL- C or TG but also MI risk. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 - To robustly establish systematic overexpression, knockdown and complementation for testing multiple genes and variants in parallel for apoB-relevant functions in cells; Aim 2 - To scale up the application of our technology to test 120 genes with the goal of identifying additional novel LDL-C and TG genes; and Aim 3 - To exploit our technology to decipher which LDL-C and TG genes also confer risk for MI. This proposal addresses a fundamental challenge to modern genetics (to distinguish functionally-relevant from neutral variants in an individual's genome) by applying novel technology (systematic cell-based functional characterization of genes and genetic variants) to a significant unmet health need (improved treatments for MI)."
"9279254","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Coronary heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is the leading cause of death in the United States. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a common and particularly severe form of AMI for which timely access to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is essential to good patient outcomes. In an attempt to improve outcomes for STEMI patients, STEMI regionalization systems have been established at the local and state level across the United States to quickly route or transfer STEMI patients to a hospital with PCI capability. However, no studies of this relatively new healthcare system have been able to show if and how regionalization has improved access and mortality at the community level, as prior work has been limited by studies done in single-hospital settings, the evaluation of only certain process outcomes, and the lack of inclusion of a control group to account for secular trends in improved mortality.  Our goals in this proposal are 3-fold: (1) to determine to what extent regionalized STEMI systems are associated with improvements in both access and outcomes, (2) whether vulnerable communities benefit equally within the same system, and (3) how distance and time differentially affect these outcomes. To accomplish these goals, we propose an innovative and definitive approach to study California, a state that provides a natural experiment of STEMI regionalization, as 47% of its population has resided in counties that have regionalized at different times over the study period. We will use a difference-in-differences approach and link non-public patient discharge data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development from 2006 through 2012 (?90K STEMI patients) with a database designed by the PI of regionalization status of each county over the same period. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which overall access (defined by admission to PCI-capable hospital), treatment (receipt of PCI), and health outcomes differ for STEMI patients in regionalized vs. non-regionalized communities. We hypothesize that the change in probability of being admitted to a PCI-equipped hospital and of receiving PCI will be appreciably higher in counties experiencing regionalization than non-regionalized counties and that health outcomes will improve. In Aim 2, we will determine the extent to which disparities in access, treatment, and outcomes have changed for STEMI patients in regionalized vs. non-regionalized communities. We hypothesize that STEMI patients who belong to traditionally underserved populations will have larger improvements in these metrics post-regionalization relative to the reference population. In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which changes in access, treatment, and outcome differ for STEMI patients according to distance and time horizon following regionalization. We hypothesize that STEMI patients living farther away from regional PCI centers will benefit differentially more than those living closer to regional PCI centers, and benefits of regionalization may not be seen until 1-2 years post-implementation."
"9316349","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major impediment to recovery after central nervous system (CNS) injury is the failure of axons to regrow effectively. A variety of extrinsic and intrinsic factors contribute to this problem. Extrinsic factors include inhibitory proteins found i and around the injury site such as those from the glial scar as well as those associated with intact or damaged myelin. Regarding intrinsic factors, a key finding motivating this work is that Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons can respond to peripheral injury with changes in gene expression that promote CNS regeneration, even in the inhibitory environment around the injury site. In contrast, CNS neurons typically fail to regenerate axons through such inhibitory regions. This implies that CNS neurons have inherent molecular differences that limit CNS regenerative capacity. The recent discovery of PTEN, SOCS3, KLF4 and KLF7 as important intrinsic regulators of CNS axon regeneration validates this hypothesis. However, the small fraction of CNS axons able to regenerate after injury, even in animals in which these genes have been manipulated, indicates that additional regulators remain to be discovered. The present proposal is to use high throughput technologies to identify genes regulating CNS regeneration by examining two related hypothesis about intrinsic factors. The first is a direct continuation of the hypothesis driving the preceding grant; i.e., that DRG neurons express RNAs that are expressed at significantly lower levels in CNS neurons and allow DRG axon regeneration. The second is that DRG neurons that have experienced a conditioning peripheral lesion express RNAs that allow regeneration and are missing (or very lowly expressed) in lesioned CNS neurons, such as the corticospinal neurons. Aim 1 will identify these molecular differences using RNA-Seq combined with bioinformatics approaches. These methods are effective at identifying rare and potentially novel isoforms, allowing identification of targets that are important but may not be abundant or previously identified; examples include miRNAs and specific transcription factor isoforms. Candidates will be tested using phenotypic analysis in vitro. Aim 2 will use viral vectors to transduce corticospinal tract neurons and test candidates from Aim 1, alone and in combination, using a pyramidotomy model of axonal growth. These experiments will provide novel information about the genes expressed in DRG neurons that allow them regenerate in the injured CNS. The identification of these targets and the testing of multiple candidates both in vitro and in vivo should lead to potential treatments not only for SCI, but also for other CNS disorders such as traumatic brain injury and stroke."
"9331743","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this consortium is to establish tools that can be used as biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective assays of social impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials. Specifically, we aim to accelerate the development of effective treatments for social impairment in ASD by validating (a) outcome measures that will be sensitive and reliable assessments of response to treatment and (b) electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used to reduce heterogeneity of samples via stratification, indicate early efficacy, and/or demonstrate target engagement. The consortium includes five Collaborating Implementation Sites (?Sites?) to conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool (3-5 years) and school-aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with IQ ranging from 50-115. Children will be assessed across three time points (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks, T3: 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver, and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (DAAC) will oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for data collection, processing, and analytics. We propose well-justified acquisition standards, many developed by field leaders in this Core, and innovative analytics within an infrastructure designed to facilitate multi-site research. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Manuals of Procedures (MOPs) will ensure clear, replicable acquisition protocols and post-processing analytic approaches to assess EEG and ET as sensitive indicators of clinical status, as stratification biomarkers for ASD, as sensitive and reliable indicators of change, and in relation to LB- based measures of social-communicative behavior and caregiver/clinician assessments. The DAAC will work together with the Sites and the Data Coordinating Core (DCC) under the oversight of the Admin Core and in coordination with federal and private partners in this collaborative agreement to: 1) design and implement experimental protocols to ensure standardized data acquisition; 2) design and implement rigorous, scientifically valid, and replicable data processing of and artifact removal from data sets; 3) design and implement statistical analyses for biomarker evaluation, including: (a) selecting, implementing, and deriving EEG and ET biomarkers and LB measurement variables with good performance metrics (construct validity, test-retest reliability, stability, and discriminant validity); (b) examining the relationship and sensitivity among EEG and ET biomarkers, LB measures, clinician/caregiver assessments, and independent measures of clinical status; (c) evaluating longitudinal change in ET, EEG, and LB measures to identify if these measures will be sensitive measures for intervention trials."
"9263744","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for renewal of a research training grant in cardiothoracic surgery that has been continuously funded since 1994. It is anticipated that in the next ten years there will be a shortage of cardiothoracic surgeons. To meet the future needs it is essential that we train an increased number of academic surgeons. An essential element is training these individuals to be independent investigators. Therefore, the overall aims of the program are to provide a stimulating environment and research training for academic cardiothoracic surgeons. The specific goals are to:1)attract the most innovative, inquisitive, diverse, and motivated candidates; 2) provide them with the highest possible level of training in the basic and clinical research in cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology and pathology; and 3)foster critical thought to prepare the trainees for an independent academic career and leadership role. The strength of the program is its interdisciplinary approach to scientific proble solving in which clinically recognized problems are studied in animal models of human disease at the integrative, cellular, and molecular levels, which can then be translated to clinical solutions. A key component of this training program is the faculty, which includes 22 faculty members with over $25 million of NIH support and extensive experience with research mentoring. They represent 4 separate departments with a history of collaborative research. Over the last 30 years, the laboratory has trained 94 US postdoctoral research fellows. Of these 63 (68%) are in academic medicine. Six are division chiefs or department chairpersons, and one is a principal investigator at the NIH. The NIH T32 training grant has provided key support for this training. We have also trained 103 foreign research fellows and 56 (54%) of them are in academic medicine. Prior to the start of the present NIH training grant only 7% of our trainees were female and 3% were from underrepresented minorities. In the last 10 years, 31% of trainees have been female and 19% have been minorities. This T32 is essential element of our research training and we request support for four postdoctoral trainees.

"9357699","Aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of the brain, the BRAIN initiative calls for ?improvement of existing non-invasive neuromodulation? techniques. There is presently great interest in transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), which is deployable, well tolerated, and carries the promise of targeted neuromodulation. Computational models of tDCS predict individual brain current flow for a given electrode configuration (?montage?), and predict that optimized targeting montages can achieve more focal cortical stimulation. Through three innovations, this proposal removes existing barriers limiting access to computational models that will allow researchers to individually tailor electrode montages for desired cortical targets so as to optimize clinical outcomes and address specific research hypotheses. First, a decade of technical innovation in automated image segmentation and high- throughput current flow modeling will be enhanced and encoded in cloud-enabled open-source. Second, state-of-the-art MRI mapping of tDCS current distribution will validate and refine model methods. Third, stand-alone and web-based modeling client software will be deployed with computationally demanding steps implemented on servers. Only as a result of algorithmic optimization can the modeling process be divided into two steps: a cloud-based computationally intensive processing on servers, and then simulations taking just seconds by researchers using client software on conventional PC. These innovations result in a process that previously required extensive expertise and labor, super-computers and numerous iterations instead being reduced to a single step, requiring seconds on a conventional PC. In addition, we will supply the MRI protocol for in vivo mapping of tDCS current flow. In an exploratory aim, MRI mapping will test modeling predictions on deep structure targeting with tDCS. Directly responsive to the RFA, the outcome of this proposal is a toolbox for the optimization of tDCS spatial precision to enhance  the rigor of  tDCS research aimed  at understanding the  brain and for  treating disease. Our approach is unique in integrating the scalability, rigor, and transparency of  opens-source (server side) with highly assessable GUI control software (client side), while being exceptionally robust (e.g. non-ideal scan quality) and flexible (e.g. conventional pad or High-Definition electrodes)."
"9394176","Project Summary/Abstract Associative fear learning, the underlying cause of disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), involves the pairing of a stimulus with an aversive outcome. This pairing produces robust fear responses to the conditioned stimulus. Odor memories, such as those formed during olfactory fear learning are acquired quickly, are long lasting, and are apparent as early as the olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli, which constitutes the first site of central nervous system olfactory sensory processing. This makes the OB an ideal place to investigate mechanisms underlying sensory processing and plasticity as they relate to fear learning. Herein, we present pilot data establishing that pairing odor presentations with foot shock induces behavioral fear and enhances glomerular responses to the conditioned stimulus (CS) in awake, behaving transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent calcium indicator. Similarly, odor-foot shock experience induces fear and enhances glomerular responses to neutral, unconditioned odor stimuli, a process known as stimulus generalization in which fear is transferred from the CS to neutral, unconditioned stimuli. Furthermore, sensory representations of the CS and neutral odors undergo transformations increasing the representational similarities, possibly leading to behavioral generalization. However, the time course of learning-induced transformations in sensory processing and the neural networks underlying generalized behavior and glomerular alterations is still unknown. By combining behavioral methods with awake, behaving wide-field calcium imaging, we will elucidate when associative olfactory fear learning modulates the processing of sensory information at the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and the role of the neural networks responsible for encoding the stimulus-fear association in these transformations, as well as how this relates to generalization of olfactory fear at the behavioral level. We will test the hypothesis that glomerular enhancement to the CS begins during acquisition, while generalized enhancements to odors not paired with shock occur during consolidation, and that activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the putative center of fear learning, is responsible for generalization. To characterize the time course of sensory transformations following learning, mice will be subjected to imaging trials during olfactory fear conditioning and comparisons of the CS and neutral odor-evoked glomerular responses will be made before and at different time points after training. Then a separate cohort of mice will undergo fear conditioning while the BLA is inactivated and both behavioral expressions of fear and training-induced glomerular response alterations will be quantified to assess the impact of BLA activity on behavioral and physiological generalization. Together, these experiments will characterize the biobehavioral adaptations of the OB throughout acquisition and consolidation of associative fear learning. Furthermore, these experiments will provide insights into underlying mechanism of behavioral fear generalization with potential clinical implications in PTSD as well as other sensory processing mechanisms."
"9369686","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis Program focuses on the interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment that are determinants of the potential of tumor cells to invade surrounding tissues, penetrate blood vessels, and ultimately enter and grow in distant tissues. Studies are directed to deciphening the signaling pathways and mechanical interactions among monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and carcinoma cells, and each of their supporting stroma, which contribute to the metastatic phenotype. The goals of the program are to: (1) Dissect the role the microenvironment in tumor progression and metastasis, in particular, the contribution of macrophage subpopulations to the various phases and elements of tumor progression; 2) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of growth factor and cytokine action in regulating cell migration, dissemination, angiogenesis and invasion of distant sites by primary tumor cells; 3) to assess the role of surface molecules, such a cadherins and membrane surface oligosaccharides, in tumor progression; (4) to characterize the biochemical and structural properties of molecules that regulate cytoskeletal proteins involved in tumor cell and macrophage motility through the development of (i) fluorescent biosensors of the activity status of pathways involved in regulating cell migration in vivo and (ii) photo-switchable proteins for quantitative long-term tracking of distinct groups of cells photomarked in the primary tumor and (5) to translate these findings into correlative studies with human tissues that are predictive of metastatic potential and risk, and that identify therapeutic targets. New imaging technologies are developed in the Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center that provides this program with unique tools that are made available to the broader AECC community through the Analytical Imaging Shared Resource. Intrinsic to the experimental approach is the development of novel mouse transgenic models with fluorescently-labeled cellular lineages. The research by members of this program is integrated by a major shared focus on breast cancer, although other tumor types are studied as well. Research in this program is supported, in part, by a program project grant which reflects, and furthers, the collaborative research of members of this program. There are currently 24 members from 11 departments, of whom 10 are new to the program, supported by 22 NCI grants ($4.1M Direct) and 18 other peer-reviewed cancer-relevant grants ($3.5M Direct). Since the last CCSG review there have been 239 cancer-relevant research papers by members of this program of which 23% represent intraprogrammatic, and 28% represent interprogrammatic publications."
"9315080","The long-term health of pulmonary tissue is inextricably linked to the sustainability of the protein fold and its function that is tightly coupled to the energetic health of the cell. This is achieved by the emerging paradigm of protein homeostasis or proteostasis, a collection of integrated ATP-dependent biological pathways that generate and maintain the proteome. Proteostasis balances protein biosynthesis, folding, translocation, protein complex assembly and/or disassembly and clearance with the challenges imposed by endogenous and exogenous folding stress in response to the local physical environment and aging. We suggest that changes in the proteostasis network (PN) in response to normal aging and environmental insults that accrue with age challenge the folding health of the aging lung. In Core B, we propose to quantitatively measure proteostasis in the lung epithelium to understand `resilience', the physiology that reflects the resistance of younger lungs to environmental challenges, `reserve', the inducible buffering capacity of the lung that protects against daily/chronic challenges, and `frailty'- the physiologic changes that underlie the enhanced susceptibility to loss of healthspan, all of which contribute to the clinical/financial burden of aging for the individual and the healthcare system. In Specific Aim 1, Core B will establish a rigorous understanding of the response of the proteome and proteostasis environment to normal aging and in response to the influenza A infection in young and old mice. This will provide a baseline to address the normal aging and viral perturbed folding/aging health questions outlined in Projects 1-3. Core B will achieve an understanding of the changing proteostatic health program during aging by systematic application of mass spectrometry (MS) to quantitatively characterized the proteostasis environment of the lung throughout the normal and challenged lifespan of the mouse through application of label-free Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT), tandem mass tagging (TMT) MS and Signal Ion Reaction (SRM) technologies. The studies in Aim 1 will be integrated with the use of newly developed biosensor imaging technologies in Aim 2 that measure the global state of protein folding health in the alveolar epithelium and muscle in a systematic and quantitative fashion. Biosensors allow us to follow in real-time the state of folding health throughout a mouse lifespan using the quantum recording capabilities of the Caliper CIVIS-K. The imaging technology is based on new and emerging proteostasis principles that are expected to strongly impact our understanding of the normal healthspan of the alveolar epithelial environment and muscle and their response to stress challenges such as influenza A. Whereas Aim 1 rigorously quantifies the granular features of the proteostasis program during aging, Aim 2 images live how the proteostasis program functions as an integrated unit to protect the lung in youth, activities we proposed are compromised during aging. Core B will contribute to the efforts of each of the Projects 1-3 by performing analyses that integrate mechanistic Project Aims designed to address proteostatic frailty during aging."

Each VP will be at CAPS for six weeks for three consecutive summers.  In the first summer, the program will help VPs develop their ideas into feasible programs of research and design and implement a pilot study funded by the program. During the academic year between the first and second summers, they will collect pilot data. During the second summer, they will analyze the pilot data and begin an NIH grant proposal. Following the second summer, VPs will present their pilot results at a conference and draft manuscripts for publication and continue to work on their grant proposal drafts. In the third summer, VPs will complete their proposals and submit them to NIH. The MPPRT program will leverage the unique environment at CAPS to provide tailored research education and mentoring, assist program participants to become successful independent investigators, and help retain these outstanding scientists, many of whom are from underrepresented groups, in the research pipeline."
"9381317","ABSTRACT Identifying and understanding the mechanisms whereby key hepatocyte-derived danger signals drive the fibrogenic response to liver injury remains a current challenge to make progress in this field of research. Our recent studies revealed that high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is up-regulated, oxidized and secreted largely by damaged hepatocytes. Therefore, since hepatocyte-derived HMGB1 can communicate injury to neighboring cells, specific isoforms could target hepatic stellate cells, the key pro-fibrogenic cell type in the liver, to elicit scarring.PreliminaryresultssupportingthisapplicationshowthatinductionofHMGB1expressioncorrelates with fibrosis stage in patients and mice. Importantly, hepatocyte-derived HMGB1 undergoes unique post- translational modifications in response to oxidant stress. While fully reduced followed by oxidized or disulfide HMGB1 significantly rise at peak fibrosis; yet, sulfonate HMGB1 appears mostly during fibrosis resolution whereas the other isoforms decline. Hmgb1 ablation in hepatocytes (Hmgb1?Hep) protects from fibrosis progression. Administration of oxidized HMGB1 enhances liver fibrosis more than reduced HMGB1. In contrast, injection of sulfonate HMGB1 lowers collagen-I and induces stellate cell apoptosis, critical for fibrosis resolution. Moreover, ablation of the HMGB1 receptor for advanced glycation end-products (Rage) in stellate cells blocks the HMGB1-mediated collagen-I increase in vitro and RAGE neutralization or ablation in stellate cells (Rage?HSC) prevents scarring in vivo. While we demonstrate that the oxidized HMGB1 isoforms are mostly produced by damaged hepatocytes, their specific contribution to fibrosis progression and/or resolution is still undefined. Our central hypothesis is that the redox-sensitive dynamic changes in hepatocyte-derived HMGB1 isoforms signal via RAGE-dependent mechanisms to drive the stellate cell pro-fibrogenic phenotype and fate, therefore contributing to the progression and/or resolution of liver fibrosis. In Aim 1, to determine the HMGB1 isoforms? affinity and potential competition among them for RAGE, we will: 1) study the binding ability and kinetics of each HMGB1 isoform to RAGE with surface plasmon resonance; 2) identify the precise amino acid residues from each HMGB1 isoform that interact with RAGE by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; and 3) prove the ligand-receptor interaction using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In Aim 2, to identify how the HMGB1 isoforms signal via RAGE-dependent mechanisms to drive the stellate cell pro-fibrogenic phenotype and fate, we will use complementary in vitro systems and in vivo approaches. Fibrosis progression and resolutionwillbemonitoredbymagneticresonanceelastographyandconventionalparametersofliverinjury. Next, the signals transduced by each isoform in stellate cells via RAGE to up-regulate collagen-I and drive the cell fate will be identified with a proteomics approach followed by in vitro validation; then, the key signaling pathways identified will be confirmed in vivo. Our long-term goal is to dissect the role of the redox-sensing hepatocyte-derived HMGB1 isoforms as potential therapeutic targets to prevent and /or resolve liver fibrosis."
"9482628","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of chemicals, many of which are toxic and carcinogenic. How these chemicals interact to cause the human health effects of tobacco smoke and products is not well-understood. To decrease the toxicity and carcinogenicity of tobacco products and smoke, it is important to identify which of the many tobacco constituents to target for reduction. Lowering the levels of one type of chemical may not reduce the overall carcinogenic properties of the tobacco product if interactions amplify the effects of residual levels of the known human carcinogens. Given the complexity of the mixtures and the lack of information regarding how individual components of the mixtures act together to trigger cancer, we will explore the interactions between combinations of two chemicals that are likely to have synergistic tumorigenic effects. The goal of this project is to characterize the potential interactions between known human carcinogens (NNK, NNN, or BaP) and volatile components of tobacco smoke (acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde) in established rodent tumor models as outlined in the following specific aims: Aim 1. Determine if acetaldehyde can influence the carcinogenic properties of NNN in a rat esophageal tumor model. Aim 2. Determine if inhaled aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein) can modulate the carcinogenic properties of NNK in the A/J mouse lung tumor model. Aim 3. Determine if inhaled aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein) can modulate the carcinogenic properties of BaP in the A/J mouse lung tumor model. In each aim, we will explore the influence of each aldehyde in combination with NNN, NNK, or BaP on tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity and tumor size to determine if reduction of both carcinogen and aldehyde is necessary to reduce harm, or if reductions in one group of constituents would suffice. Urinary metabolite and DNA adduct biomarkers will be measured to determine if the levels of these biomarkers are influenced by the co-exposure. These studies will provide important missing information about the ability of volatile compounds to influence the tumorigenic activity of established tobacco carcinogens"
"9302449","Movement of intracellular compartments to their correct locations at precise times is a fundamental property of all cell types. For example, pigment cells, intestinal epithelia, lymphocytes, and neurons, require that specific organelles be targeted to precise locations at the proper time. In each case, myosin V molecular motors play key roles in organelle transport. Long-range movement of organelles occurs on microtubules via kinesin and dynein motors. Notably, the late steps in transport require transfer from kinesin to a myosin V motor, followed by movement on actin to a terminal destination. Regulation of detachment of organelles from myosin V is also critical to their proper localization. Our overall goal is to uncover mechanisms whereby myosin V regulates cellular organization. Similar to specialized cell-types in higher eukaryotes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae targets organelles to specific locations at precise times. We discovered that in coordination with the cell-cycle, a portion of the yeast vacuole is targeted from the mother cell to the bud. We further discovered that this movement requires the myosin V, Myo2. Moreover, we and others dis- covered that most intracellular movement in yeast occurs solely on actin and requires Myo2. Our recent progress provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that studies of yeast Myo2 will inform our under- standing of mammalian myosin V motors. We identified a conserved binding site for Rab GTPases, and an independent site dedicated to the exocyst subunit Sec15. The Rab GTPases and exocyst are conserved proteins that are required for secretion. That each ofthe sites on Myo2 is conserved strongly suggests that what we learn about how yeast Myo2 attaches and detaches from membranes will be directly applicable to human myosin Va, Vb and Vc. We proposed to use the yeast system to determine the mechanisms that govern myosin V-based transport. Our aims are to: 1) Determine whether binding of individual Myo2 adaptor proteins are enhanced or inhibited by other Myo2 adaptor proteins. 2) Determine whether the direct interaction of Myo2 with Ypt31/Ypt32, Sec4 and Sec15 plays roles beyond the attachment of Myo2 to secretory vesicles. 3) Determine mechanisms that regulate the detachment of myosin V from cargoes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Intracellular transport of organelles by myosin V motors is crucial to normal cellular function, and animal physiology. Defects in myosin V based transport cause selected human diseases including neurological disorders. Our overall goal is to determine the mechanisms that regulate myosin V-based transport."

"9296145","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The generation and survival of all organisms depends on the faithful execution of cell division. A complete understanding of the regulation and controls over cell division is critical to elucidate the mechanisms that govern self-renewal, proliferation and development. A key event in the cell cycle is the precise partitioning of every pair of duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells. Defects in segregation lead to aneuploidy, the state where entire chromosomes are gained or loss. Aneuploidy is a hallmark of most tumor cells and has been postulated to be a major factor in the evolution of cancer. It is also the leading cause of spontaneous miscarriages and hereditary birth defects in humans. The proposed work will lead to an understanding of the mechanisms that ensure accurate chromosome segregation and thus maintain genomic stability and prevent human disease. Chromosome segregation requires forces generated by spindle microtubules that are translated into chromosome movement through interactions with kinetochores, the highly conserved structures that assemble onto centromeric chromatin. Accurate segregation requires kinetochores to maintain load- bearing attachments to the ends of microtubules that are continually growing and shrinking. Kinetochores must also biorient and attach to microtubules from opposite poles. When there is a defect in biorientation, error correction systems destabilize improper attachments. In the next funding period, this proposal will address outstanding issues in the field about the mechanisms that mediate kinetochore-microtubule attachment and the regulation over kinetochore biorientation. Together, these studies will be a means toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms of segregation in all eukaryotes."
"9308674","Project Summary/Abstract  Healthy human intestines contain over 1000 different bacterial species and 1014 bacterial cells - roughly ten times the number of human cells in the body. Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is thought to result from an inappropriate inflammatory response by the immune system against bacteria in our intestines, or in the case of celiac disease, against food constituents. An important mechanism of maintaining immune tolerance to food and commensals in the intestines is the development of peripheral CD4+ regulatory T cells (pTregs).  Dendritic cells in the intestinal lamina propria are essential for acquiring antigens from the gut lumen and stimulating the differentiation and proliferation of pTregs. We have identified a gut dendritic cell transmembrane protein, CD101, that is specifically expressed on a subset of DCs involved in pTreg cell development. Moreover, we have preliminary data showing that CD101 plays an important role in the proper differentiation of pTregs in the gut. This proposal will extend these intriguing preliminary findings on the role of CD101 in the differentiation of pTregs. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether global loss of CD101 expression impacts differentiation of different T cell subsets in the intestine, including pTregs, Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells. We will examine the numbers of T cell subsets within the gut both at homeostasis and inflammation as well as examine the differentiation of peripherally transferred clonal naïve T cells in CD101 deficient mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether loss of CD101 on dendritic cells is sufficient to impair pTreg differentiation in the intestines. In Aim 3, we will test whether cytokine production by dendritic cells, localization of dendritic cells, antigen uptake by dendritic cells, and direct modulation of dendritic cell-T cell interactions and signaling are impaired in CD101 knockout mice. These results may determine the importance and mechanism by which CD101 influences pTreg differentiation and may lead to the development of novel therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases of the intestines."
"9315076","Project Summary This PPG will test the hypothesis that a loss in the reserve of the lung epithelial proteostasis network is the cause of age-related lung frailty. This highly integrated effort brings together scientists with a broad spectrum of expertise focused on this hypothesis with a goal of understanding the function of the proteostasis networks in the lung during aging in the unchallenged and influenza A-infected lung. The long term goal of this project is to use our understanding of the changes in proteostasis that develop over the lifespan to prevent the development of lung frailty and improve lung reserve in our aging population. The Project and Core leaders will generate parallel datasets including novel proteostatic imaging data, proteomic analysis of proteostasis networks in the lung and muscle tissue, and careful physiologic phenotyping of the severity of lung and skeletal muscle injury. These data will fuel discoveries of the molecular underpinnings of proteostatic frailty in the aging lung, suggest novel pathways for therapy, and provide the research community with new tools to image and quantify the function of proteostatic networks in the lung. Resources to support these interactions will be achieved through the collaborative structure of the Program Projects and the Cores. The Administrative Core bear the primary responsibility for coordinating these interactions through five interrelated specifics aims. Specific Aim 1. To support communication between the Project Investigators, the Core Leaders, Collaborating investigators, the Internal and External Advisory Committees and the Institutional Cores. Specific Aim 2. To provide a structure for the sharing of materials and dissemination of information between the Project Investigators, Core Leaders and their Collaborators. Specific Aim 3. To provide financial and regulatory oversight to the Project and Core Leaders and coordinate their interactions with Institutional Core Services. Specific Aim 4. To disseminate the discoveries made by the program project investigators through publications, presentations and the sharing of reagents and techniques to other institution and other investigators. Specific Aim 5. To foster an environment of collaborative interdisciplinary research and mentoring of students, post-doctoral fellows and investigators. The members of the Administrative Core will promote a collaborative, synergistic and interdisciplinary research program to fuel discoveries in the proteostasis networks of the aging lung."

"9302486","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for the use of innovative methodologies in the behavioral and social sciences has been widely noted. The past two decades have seen continued recognition that more innovative and community-engaged approaches to research and interventions are needed to address the social and environmental determinants of population health and more specifically racial and ethnic inequities in health. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is one such approach to community-engaged research. Increased funding support for CBPR is in keeping with the mission statement of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the research capacity- building priorities delineated in the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan 2009-2013, and select research goals of the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR). As the need for and opportunities to expand CBPR increases, so does the need to enhance capacity in innovative methods for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) to use this approach. Not only is CBPR an innovative approach in and of itself for many researchers conducting BSSR, there are also several specific innovations within the context of a CBPR approach that are particularly relevant to the mission of NIH. These innovative methods include the integrated use of mixed methods (combining qualitative and quantitative methods), and innovative research designs that complement randomized controlled designs. Although numerous educational materials on CBPR have been developed in recent years, there are few opportunities for both early-career and established researchers to engage in a co-learning process facilitated by experienced academic-community faculty teams. Further, there is a need to promote the diversity of the BSSR workforce, including increasing participation of researchers from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed research education program, Community-Based Participatory Research: Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies in the Behavioral and Social Sciences (the Enhance Program), is to enhance knowledge and skills in the use of innovative methodologies in CBPR, in partnership with the communities involved, to examine and address health inequities. The proposed Enhance Program will be carried out by the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center (Detroit URC), a CBPR partnership established in 1995 to understand and address factors that contribute to health inequities in Detroit. The two- pronged approach of the Enhance Program is: 1) to develop, implement, and evaluate an intensive short course in innovative methodologies in CBPR for conducting behavioral and social sciences research; and 2) to enhance and integrate learning from the short course through a series of follow-on educational activities, an applied CBPR project, mentoring, and development of a network of diverse scholars for career development and innovation in BSSR using a CBPR approach to promote health equity. An evaluation will be conducted to assess and enhance program effectiveness. The curriculum and other materials will be widely disseminated."
"9335386","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many national and international public and private initiatives are forming to collect and share data on a large scale for research and clinical use. Collectively, these efforts may lead to the creation of a medical information commons, a networked environment in which diverse sources of health, medical, and genomic data on large populations become widely shared resources. The success and value of such a commons will depend on development of policies and practices for effective governance that address barriers to data sharing and are developed with informed input from patients and members of the public whose data may populate it. In an NHGRI-funded study (McGuire R01HG006460), a diverse group of experts ranked reluctance of some institutions to share data as the most important, yet least politically tractable policy challenge among 17 posed in a modified Delphi process. The objective of this proposal is to engage expert stakeholders to inform policy decisions about effective governance for data sharing, while using deliberative methods to obtain informed public input to ensure that the values, rights and interests of individuals whose data may populate the information commons are represented. In Aim 1, we will work with a multi-disciplinary expert advisory committee and con- duct a systematic landscape analysis of existing and emerging data initiatives to summarize common approaches and identify alternative models. In Aim 2, we will conduct qualitative interviews with expert stake- holders to solicit feedback on existing models and alternative approaches to key policy challenges. In Aim 3, we will use intensive deliberative methods, Citizen Panels, to solicit informed input about key policy issues, and proposed models to address them, from patients and members of the general public. This contribution will be significant because it will provide critical stakeholder input to develop the necessary foundation for a sustainable ethical and legal framework for efforts to advance public and private sector data initiatives. The approach is innovative by engaging a diverse and representative group of stakeholders, including those involved with and potentially contributing to these data initiatives, to identify policy challenges and deliberate models for effective governance. The work is feasible in our hands because our team of established investigators have expertise in ethical and policy issues related to large-scale data sharing and a track record of success working together on large collaborative projects addressing ethical and policy issues in genomics."
"9379030","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cyanobacteria are among the most ancient organisms on Earth and have evolved chemical weapons for defensive purposes, which we are exploiting for anticancer drug discovery. Our past research has exemplified that marine cyanobacteria contain compounds with exceptionally potent activity and/or possess unusual or first-in-class inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action. However, cyanobacteria are also notorious for producing toxins detrimental to human health and other general cytotoxins. Our proposal addresses main issues in natural products drug discovery, including appropriate sample selection and prioritization for those compounds with promising therapeutic potential and cancer selectivity through innovative dereplication strategies and unique complementary in vitro cellular and in vivo organismal assay sets directed towards key cancer-related pathways. Targeted pathways are related to growth factor receptor activity and angiogenesis, resistance and metastasis, all of which are major areas of concern in cancer research. We have developed new chemical, biochemical and genetic tools to specifically probe novel mechanisms of action that we recently discovered and to identify modulators of these pathways. First, we will carry out field collections of marine cyanobacteria and will subject their extracts to taxonomy- and LC-MS/MS based dereplication strategies in combination with cytotoxicity assays. Prioritized cyanobacteria will be cultured and fraction libraries generated. Second, we will implement a rational screening strategy for selective cytotoxins by assessing differential cytotoxicity of fraction libraries using various suitable human cell-based models. Specifically, we will screen for agents with selective activity against colon cancer cells over the corresponding normal cells, in a mechanistically-unbiased approach. More targeted, we will screen for antiangiogenic agents that exert their activity through a mechanism we recently validated, involving simultaneous downregulation of receptors and growth factors. Through the use of our newly created unique isogenic screening system we then aim to discover novel dual inhibitors of the transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2, which have promise for combination therapy with anti-angiogenic agents. Prioritized fractions will be subjected to bioassay-guided isolation and structures will be determined. Third, we have discovered and characterized a novel mechanism to prevent metastasis and developed suitable zebrafish in vivo models to screen for anti-invasive agents that modulate tumor suppressor E-cadherin expression and localization to the cell membrane when applied as single agents or in combination with a synergizing cyanobacterial compound we already discovered. Anti-invasive properties of compounds will be assessed in a new zebrafish tumor model at the single-cell level by monitoring cell dissemination, invasion and metastasis. Fourth, we will mechanistically characterize the identified selective agents to pinpoint the molecular changes induced in the cancer cell and to determine potential direct targets."
"9307961","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF affects multiple organs, including lungs, pancreas, intestine, liver, sweat glands, gallbladder and the male genital tract. Airway infection and inflammation currently cause most of the morbidity and mortality. Although several therapies have improved the lives of patients, current treatments are inadequate and CF remains a lethal disease. Our knowledge about the pathogenesis of the disease, its progression, and the state of the neonatal lung is inadequate. These gaps in our knowledge have hindered attempts to develop better treatments and preventions for CF lung disease. A major impediment to addressing these issues has been limitations of current animal models. Although mouse strains carrying null and missense CFTR mutations have made enormous contributions, CF mice do not develop the airway or pancreatic disease typically found in humans. We recently generated CF pigs that replicate many ofthe key features of human CF disease including intestinal obstruction, exocrine pancreatic destruction, micro-gallbladder, vas deferens abnormalities, focal biliary cirrhosis, congenital airway structural abnormalities, and airway and sinus infection with time. The Imaging Core has two main objectives: (1) Provide scientific support, expertise, and resources for acquisition of image datasets and subsequent analysis; and (2) Help Project Leaders successfully accomplish the aims of their Projects. State of- art image acquisition technology and analysis tools are readily available at the University of lowa for these Projects. The Imaging Core will function seamlessly through already established interactions with the Project Leaders, Morphology Core Director, the Translational Lung Imaging Research Program, and the lowa Comprehensive Lung Imaging Center."

"9321981","Project Summary/Abstract The objective of the MIDUS Daily Diary Project is to determine how short term fluctuations in daily stress processes impact longer-term health and well-being throughout midlife and later adulthood. Specific aims are: (1) To assess changes in multiple aspects of daily stressors and daily well-being across three occasions spanning 20 years; (2) To investigate how daily stress processes disrupt diurnal rhythms of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase; and (3) To enhance data from the MIDUS cognitive project by adding new assessments of everyday cognition: unconstructive repetitive thinking (intrusive thoughts) and memory failures. These aims will be addressed by conducting the third wave of longitudinal data collection from participants who participated in the previous MIDUS I & II Diary. The longitudinal sample will consist of 1000 individuals selected from the MIDUS random digit dialed (RDD) participants and 200 participants from the African-American Milwaukee sample. The collection protocol will continue to use an 8-day telephone diary study of daily stressors and well- being combined with multiple assessments of saliva (4 occasions × 4 days) to ascertain salivary cortisol and a new biomarker for this project: salivary alpha amylase (sAA). The MIDUS Daily Diary Project will continue to incorporate the rich measures (sociodemographic, personality, cognitive) obtained in other MIDUS projects in our analyses to study how they relate to changes in daily stress processes.

"9313310","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Heart failure remains a major public health problem and effective therapies are limited. Recent work by our group and others has suggested that caveolins, structured proteins involved in numerous cell functions including cell growth and hypertrophy may be novel targets for heart failure therapy. Work in our laboratory has shown that the muscle specific subtype of caveolin, Caveolin-3 (Cav-3) is a critical molecule in protecting the myocardium from myocardial stress. In addition, we have shown recently that cardiac myocyte-specific overexpression of Cav-3 (Cav-3 OE) produces increased survival and enhanced cardiac function in the transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model of heart failure. The precise mechanisms involved in the attenuation of heart failure by Cav-3 remain to be elucidated and are the focus of the current unit. Caveolae are a specialized subset of lipid rafts enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids and caveolins. Caveolae and caveolins are now known to produce critical interactions between the sarcolemmal membrane and cytoplasmic organelles including mitochondria in cardiac myocytes. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical element of heart failure progression. Caveolins have been found in mitochondrial membranes, however the role of caveolins and their effects on mitochondrial function have not been investigated. We have developed exciting novel preliminary data that show 1) an intimate relationship between caveolae and mitochondria that is increased by myocardial stress, 2) the presence of Cav-3 within the inner mitochondrial membrane of  mitochondria, 3) the overexpression of Cav-3 in cardiac myocytes increases Cav-3 within mitochondria and improves mitochondrial function, and 4) targeting Cav-3 specifically to mitochondria produces improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress in cardiac myocj1:es. Based on these compelling preliminary data we will test the hypothesis that Cav-3 can alter the progression of heart failure via modulation of mitochondrial function. We will use state of the art molecular biology, imaging technology, electron paramagnetic resonance technology and physiological techniques in cardiac myocytes and clinically relevant models of heart failure to focus on mechanism and produce important preclinical data to support the potential use of caveolins as novel therapeutics for heart failure patients."
"9313937","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main purpose of the Biological Sciences Training Program in the Department of Psychiatry at Yale is to train postdoctoral fellows in biological and behavioral sciences relevant to mental illness and health. To attain this goal, the program recruits two groups of postdoctoral trainees: 1) psychiatrists, generally after completing two or three years of clinical residency, and 2) individuals with a Ph.D. degree in a basic science. To help fill a nationally recognized need, the aim of the program is to both increase the number of research psychiatrists with a grounding in basic biological sciences and to develop the interest of basic scientists in clinical problems as well as in interdisciplinary aspects of thir own basic research. Thus, the overall aim is to promote cross-fertilization between basic researchers and individuals who are experienced clinically. Extensive research collaboration between training program faculty members further contributes to interdisciplinary experience of the trainee. It is expected that trainees coming out of this program will be able to bridge the gap between basic and clinical neuroscience in psychiatry.  There are 29 faculty members in the program consisting of both basic and clinical researcher scientists. The number of postdoctoral training slots requested is five, the same number as the current grant. The program typically involves training for approximately 2 years in one primary discipline but usually includes direct or collaborative interactions with other disciplines. Laboratory training is offered in the followig fundamental areas of research: neurochemistry, molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomics, electrophysiology, systems neurobiology, and behavior. Clinical research training is offered in behavioral assessment, genetic analysis, biological measurements, and imaging techniques. In addition to specific research training, there are courses in Clinical Neuroscience and Neuropharmacology as well as seminars and regular Workshops in which Fellows present ongoing research to the entire group of faculty and trainees.  The training proposal is directly relevant to the research objectives of NIMH by fostering the training of researchers to elucidate the neurobiology of mental disorders and maladaptive behavior. Thus, basic and clinical research is carried out in areas related to anxiety (e.g., panic and post- traumatic stress disorder), obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, affective illnesses (depression and bipolar disorder), and substance abuse. The basic research conducted by the faculty and trainees during their time at Yale and later in their careers will lead to identification and development of novel and more effective therapeutic strategies."

"9312315","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aggressive behavior is a complex social behavior that is influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors. The cost of violence in the US alone is estimated to be $70 billion annually. It is important to understand the mechanisms of aggression to help alleviate this socio-economic burden. In addition, a variety of diseases are characterized by abnormal aggression and little is known about the causes of these behavioral abnormalities, which has hampered the development of successful therapies.  We propose to study the transcriptional regulation of aggression in specific neuronal circuits controlling aggression using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We will focus on a mechanistic dissection of a conserved transcription factor, Tailless (Tll) (known as Nr2e1 in mammals) with shared binding sites, binding partners and targets in flies and mammals. We recently showed that Drosophila Tll and its conserved co- repressor, Atrophin (Atro), regulate aggression by affecting the activity of a group of neurosecretory neurons in the adult fly brain. We show that Tll controls the release of neuropeptides from these neurosecretory cells and that this is required for increased aggression. These findings further support evidence in the literature that suggest that these neurons have structural, developmental and functional similarities to the hypothalamus, a region critically involved in aggression regulation in mammals. Our studies therefore suggest the existence of an evolutionarily ancient transcriptionally controlled set of neurosecretory cells governing aggressive behavior.  In this proposal we will use the large neurobiological and genetic toolkit available in Drosophila to analyze the mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of aggression in flies. We will dissect the neuropeptide-based mechanism that is necessary and sufficient for the regulation of aggression in the PI and we will examine the connection with Tll. To do so, we have developed a new transposon-based tool to study gene-specific expression, allowing functional manipulation of the cells expressing the gene of interest. This tool will be useful for many researchers in the community as it can be applied to many genes in the genome. Finally, we will examine two binding partners of Atro, the co-repressor of Tll that also affects aggression through the neurosecretory cells of the PI and that physically interacts with Tll. One of the binding partners of Atro is encoded by the ortholog of a disease gene mutated in a human syndrome that is characterized by abnormal aggressive behavior. The mechanism of the behavioral abnormalities in these patients is completely unknown as is the case for most of the diseases associated with excessive aggression. Our proposed experiments will help elucidate the role of this gene in aggression.  Together the experiments in this proposal will begin to unravel the mechanisms that underlie transcriptional control of aggression in flies. Given the conservation of this molecular pathway, our proposal will open a new direction in the field that will shed light on this complex behavior."
"9307831","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Erythropoiesis is a dynamic process governed by quantitative changes in the relative levels of transcription factors (TFs), their specific isoforms and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Due to the current paucity of quantitative data on the proteins that constitute the transcriptional regulatory network, current models of erythropoiesis are based primarily on mRNA measurements and do not typically consider changes in the protein levels of specific TFs, their isoforms or PTMs. This significantly limits th understanding of erythropoiesis and other transcriptionally regulated processes such as ß-globin expression, ultimately impinging on the capacity to correct hemoglobin disorders. The long-term goal is to decipher the transcriptional network that controls erythropoiesis in health and disease. The objective of this proposal is to build a network model of erythropoiesis based on dynamic changes in TF protein levels during erythroid differentiation of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). The central hypothesis is that the relative protein levels of TFs is a critical parameter in the establishment of proper gene expression programs at each stage of differentiation, and that erythropoiesis is driven by graded changes in the relative amounts of specific combinations of TFs. The rationale is that integration of the dynamic and quantitative nature of the proteome into the transcriptional network of erythropoiesis will result in a model with improved predictive power, which will serve as a benchmark for healthy erythropoiesis against which to compare erythroid-related disease states, and will facilitate the identification o pharmacological agents to restore normal erythropoiesis. Two specific aims have been designed: 1) Model the erythropoiesis transcriptional network based on measurements of dynamic changes in the protein levels of transcription factors; and 2) Identify novel changes in abundance of nuclear proteins and phosphoproteins during erythropoiesis. Under the first aim, a novel targeted mass spectrometry approach developed by the applicants will be used to measure absolute levels of TFs at multiple stages during ex vivo erythropoiesis of HSPCs derived from healthy donors. Under the second aim, an unbiased proteomic approach will be used to identify previously unappreciated proteins that undergo quantitative changes in their levels and/or phosphorylation status during ex vivo erythropoiesis of HSPCs from healthy donors. The approach is innovative because it uses novel mass spectrometry approaches to systematically identify and quantify TFs that regulate erythropoiesis in primary human cells. The proposed research is significant because it will illuminate complex regulatory processes that control erythropoiesis. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to guide the design of new therapeutics to re-establish proper ß-globin expression in ß-thalassemic patients."
"9306701","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Program Project, Bridging physical and cultural determinants of postpartum pelvic floor support and symptoms following vaginal delivery uses mixed methods research to study the influence of intra-abdominal pressure, physical activity and strength on pelvic floor support and symptoms and the cultural context in which women experience those changes. Up to 1 in 7 women undergoes surgery for pelvic organ prolapse or urinary incontinence in her lifetime. Despite the high prevalence and high cost of treating these disorders, urgently needed prevention strategies are scare, reflecting the current state of knowledge. Supported by an exceptional institutional environment and a robust research infrastructure, this Program Project is uniquely positioned to address its primary hypothesis that understanding factors associated with pelvic floor support and symptoms after the first vaginal delivery will lead to developing and testing novel prevention strategies. In this mixed methods research, the core group of 11 investigators from 4 University of Utah colleges will build on the rich tradition of excellence at the University of Utah in research involving pregnant or postpartum women, bioengineering, exercise science, qualitative research, and pelvic floor disorders, to tackle together problems that continue to plague research in pelvic floor disorders. The scope of this project is relevant to the portfolio of the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch within NICHD, which specifically includes pelvic floor disorders. The aim of this Program is to lay the groundwork for humanistic evidence-based interventions that mitigate the impact of vaginal delivery on deteriorations in pelvic floor support and symptoms with an eye toward early detection, prevention of future bothersome pelvic floor disorders, and provision of culturally sensitive clinical care and self-care resources. The Program will also promote career development of multi-disciplinary trainees in pelvic floor disorders and serve as a resource for future research collaboration in the prevention of pelvic floor disorders. To accomplish this aim, the Program structure includes 3 Cores, Administrative (A), Biostatistics (B) and Clinical Coordination (C), which in turn will support 3 Projects: Project 1: Intra-abdominal pressure and postpartum pelvic floor support and symptoms; Project 2: Physical activity, inactivity, and fitness: Impact on postpartum pelvic floor support and symptoms; and Project 3: The cultural context of postpartum pelvic floor support following vaginal delivery: a comparative ethnographic analysis of Mexican-American and Euro-American women. The Program creates a synergistic team of committed researchers and weaves their skills, ideas, and resources into an optimal environment in which to make discoveries that will improve the health of women."

This extreme genetic diversity makes it difficult to design an HIV-1 vaccine that can elicit broadly protective immunity. Vaccines that elicit diverse HIV-1-specific immune responses represent a potential strategy to overcome the challenge of HIV-1 sequence variation. The hypothesis underlying this strategy is that the greater and more diverse the immune responses, the greater the likelihood that there will be a match to the transmitting HIV-1 strain. Currently, we do not know the optimal design of a global HIV-1 vaccine to elicit diverse immune responses. The objective of this K23 Career Development Award is to define HIV-1 vaccine regimens that elicit the greatest diversity of immune responses following immunization. To accomplish this objective, we will use novel cutting-edge immunologic assays to measure how changes in antigen delivery and composition impact the breadth and depth of HIV-1-specific antibodies and T cell responses in humans. Each aim of this K23 award focuses on a different potential vaccine strategy for increasing immune diversity, including a vaccine that combines viral vectors and proteins for HIV-1 antigen delivery (Aim 1), novel mosaic HIV-1 antigens bioinformatically engineered to optimize coverage of global HIV-1 sequences (Aim 2), and a new replicating viral vector for expressing HIV-1 antigens (Aim 3). The Specific Aims are as follows:  Specific Aim 1: To evaluate whether immunization with vectored HIV-1 Env antigens (ALVAC-HIV) plus  Env protein (AIDSVAX B/E) elicits greater diversity of Env-specific antibodies than immunization with either  vectored Env or Env protein alone in humans.  Specific Aim 2: To assess if mosaic HIV-1 antigens (MVA-Mosaic) elicit greater diversity of Env-specific antibodies and Gag-specific CD8+ T cells than multi-clade HIV-1 antigens (MVA-Natural) in humans.  Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the diversity of serum and mucosal Env-specific antibodies in humans vaccinated with an oral, replicating Ad26 vector expressing mosaic HIV-1 Env (rcAd26.Mos1ENV). The findings from this K23 award have the potential to greatly inform HIV-1 vaccine design. Through the above Specific Aims, we will identify which HIV-1 vaccines elicit the greatest diversity of HIV-1-specific immune responses, and will be able to craft novel HIV-1 vaccine regimens that include combinations of our most optimal candidates. In this way, we aim to advance the development of an effective global HIV-1 vaccine."
"9332138","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Sensory abnormalities characterize a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), for example, sensory overload is one of the most frequently reported symptoms. Abnormal regulation of sensory information flow (sensory gating) is also observed in schizophrenia and ADHD, and is thought to contribute to overall cognitive dysfunction across all these conditions. Despite its central importance, little is known about the neurobiology of sensory gating, and even less is known about its failure in disease. This proposal aims to address this critical gap. The neocortex is requires for higher level sensory processing, but early processing and transmission of sensory information is performed by the thalamus. We and others have found that thalamic sensory input is controlled by the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a shell of GABAergic neurons surrounding thalamic relay nuclei. The TRN is composed of individual subnetworks, each controlling thalamic flow in a modality-specific manner. Recent clinical data have shown thalamic and TRN dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders. Given the critical role for TRN in sensory processing, we expect perturbations in its circuits to pathologically augment cortical sensory input, explaining several clinical symptoms. In sleep, TRN dysfunction may result in increased sensory-related arousals, while in attention irrelevant inputs may become much more distracting. As such, a `leaky thalamus' may have profound consequences on behavior and cognition across disorders. In this proposal, we will test the leaky thalamus framework by manipulating thalamic inhibition in mice while monitoring the impact on sensory function and related behaviors. In addition, we will investigate the therapeutic potential of reversing thalamic inhibition deficits in models of human neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9387608","Summary  Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are crucial drivers of chronic inflammation and potent suppressors of immune responses. Aberrant expansion and dysregulated functions of MDSCs contribute to the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases involving chronic inflammation. MDSCs are recognized as an important therapeutic target for these diseases, and Intensive efforts are currently directed at developing therapies to inhibit the expansion of MDSCs and to block the functions of MDSCs. Identification of new regulators of MDSCs is thus critical for the development of such novel therapies. This exploratory proposal aims to elucidate the roles and signaling mechanisms of a novel emerging regulator of MDSCs, TRAF3, a signal transducer of a variety of immune receptors. By examining a new mouse model that has TRAF3 specifically deleted in myeloid cells (M-TRAF3-/- mice), we recently found that TRAF3 inhibits chronic inflammation and infection likely through controlling the expansion of MDSCs. In strong corroboration of our findings, increasing evidence indicates that a number of TRAF3-employing immune receptors directly regulate the expansion and/or suppressive activities of MDSCs. Despite its likely importance, the direct roles of TRAF3 in MDSCs remain unknown. We will address this significant gap in knowledge in the current proposal. Based on our new findings and preliminary results, we will test the central hypothesis that TRAF3 and TRAF3-dependent signaling pathways directly control the expansion and suppressive functions of MDSCs, thereby inhibiting chronic inflammation. To address this, we propose complementary in vitro and in vivo studies to decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying TRAF3-mediated regulation of MDSCs. Importantly, we will identify the intrinsic signaling pathways of immune receptor(s) that play dominant roles in the TRAF3-dependent processes in MDSCs. Our long-term goal is to gain new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of MDSC physiology as well as MDSC-mediated chronic inflammation and immunosuppression in disease pathogenesis. Such knowledge will pave the way towards developing innovative therapeutic strategies to manipulate TRAF3 signaling pathways in MDSCs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, cancers, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infectious diseases."
"9312278","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a grant renewal for studies on formulations of high molecular weight agents, such as proteins and nucleic acids. For the past 29 years, this particular grant has been central for our drug delivery research. We believe the impact of our NIH funded research in this area has been significant and that our work has helped provide some of the fundamental concepts necessary for the clinical development of controlled release of macromolecules and for localized drug delivery. Examples of such delivery systems are Lupron Depot, Gliadel and Nutropin Depot. In writing our last competing renewal grant proposal we felt that much of the fundamentals of peptide and protein release had been established and that the greatest impact could come from extending our research nucleic acid delivery. Our studies in this area have led to a greater mechanistic understanding, and have resulted in 35 peer-reviewed papers, including in such journals such as Science and Nature. The major barrier to the success of gene therapy in the clinic is the lack of safe and efficient DNA delivery methods. Modified viruses, while effective at transferring DNA to cells, suffer from serious toxicity and production problems. In contrast, non-viral systems offer a number of significant potential advantages, including ease of production, stability, low toxicity, and reduced vector size limitations. From our studies we have discovered that optimal intracellular delivery to different tissues in the body requires different materials. Therefore, we propose to develop combinatorial libraries of new materials with the specific goal of generating clinically useful, non-viral methods for gene therapy. Lung cancer will be used as a model disease. We propose to explore two complementary approaches: 1) developing lung-tumor cell specific DNA delivery systems for the anti-tumor therapy and 2) developing anti-lung cancer DNA vaccines by targeting and activating native immune cells. Our specific aims are: 1. To develop next-generation biodegradable polymers for use as efficient and non-toxic vectors for lung cancer and DNA vaccines. 2. Development of cell specific DNA delivery systems for lung tumor and dendritic cell targeting. 3. To test the in vivo gene delivery efficiency of biodegradable vectors composed of PEI- and PBAE- based polymer and that of their electrostatic ligand coated ternary polyplexes in normal and lung cancer mouse models. 4. To examine potential of PEI- and PBAE- based vectors for their use as DNA vaccines."
"9277331","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Workplace wellness is a rapidly growing, $6 billion industry in the United States. Nearly all firms with 200 or more employees that offer health benefits also offer a wellness program. To encourage take-up, the Affordable Care Act allows employers to financially reward participation in workplace wellness programs by up to 50 percent of the cost of health insurance coverage. Yet, there is little rigorous evidence available on the effectiveness of workplace wellness, partly because the voluntary nature of these programs means that participants may differ from nonparticipants for reasons unrelated to the causal effects of the wellness program. In this project we seek to overcome this barrier by implementing a randomized control trial of workplace wellness. We will also provide the first analysis of the distributional effects of these programs. This will allow us to determine whether or not they effectively shift costs onto the unhealthy, which can occur if these programs differentially attract healthy employees. We will implement our randomized experiment on a large university campus. It will consist of an initial survey and health-risk assessment, followed by a set of optional wellness activities such as weight-management and recreation classes. A second survey and health- risk assessment will take place one year later. We will experimentally vary the financial incentives and wellness program subsidies offered to participants. We will also assign some employees to a control group that neither receives a health-risk assessment nor participates in wellness activities. In Aim 1 we will compare participation among individuals who receive large incentives to individuals who receive small incentives to document how those incentives affect the level of participation. In Aim 2 we will compare preexisting health measures among those same individuals to estimate how incentives affect the composition of participation. In Aim 3 we will compare outcomes among the participants to outcomes among the control group to estimate the causal effect of workplace wellness on employee health and well-being. Finally, in Aim 4 we will compare the effectiveness of financial incentives with that of wellness program subsidies. The primary contribution of our project is the use of a randomized controlled trial to establish causal estimates of the effect of workplace wellness programs on health, medical utilization, and well-being, and to provide the first measure of the distributional effectsof these programs."

"9304811","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ENCODE projects have generated large high-quality functional genomic datasets which have the potential to dramatically impact our understanding of the specific mechanisms and general principles of the function of cell-specific regulatory elements. We propose to develop an SVM-based computational model to predict enhancers from these datsets and resolve their fine- scale structure. We will utilize an integrative approach to investigate these fine scale features which combines novel computational development, statistical analysis of ENCODE datasets, systematic scoring of human sequence variation, and high throughput validation to improve our understanding of how DNA sequence features and variation contribute to regulatory function. Based on our previous work using k-mer features to predict mammalian enhancers from genomic DNA sequence, we propose improvements in the treatment of sequence features which facilitate statistically robust estimation of long k-mer features and improved spatial resolution. This approach does not rely on previous biological knowledge, and uncovers the sets of novel TFs and cofactors which specify their cell-specific activity. We will train this model on ENCODE DNase-seq and ChIP-seq data and catalogue the regulatory elements in the available human cell-line and mouse datasets. In addition, this model makes specific predictions of the contributions of individual features to enhancer activity, so we propose to experimentally test this set of predictions by directly quantifying the impact of mutation of these elements in a luciferase reporter system. Finally we will evaluate and experimentally assess the predicted impact of specific human SNPs in a set of targeted cell lines. This project should contribute significantly toward a predictive model of regulatory element function and an understanding of how sequence variation impacts disease."
"9304771","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is aimed at studying signaling-dependent neuroadaptations that occur in response to ethanol in subpopulations of neurons within the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). The DMS plays a central role in goal- directed behaviors and addiction, and we found that voluntary and passive exposure of rodents to ethanol activates the tyrosine kinase Fyn specifically in the DMS. We further discovered that in response to ethanol, activated Fyn phosphorylates the NR2B subunit of the NMDARs (GluN2B) resulting in increased synaptic activity of NMDA and AMPA receptors (NMDAR/AMPAR). Finally, we showed that the Fyn-signaling pathway in the DMS plays a crucial role in mechanisms underlying ethanol-drinking behaviors. Neurons in the DMS express either dopamine (DA) D1 or D2 receptors (D1R, D2R) that form the direct Go and indirect No-Go pathways. Thus, DA is thought to have different and possibly opposite effects on D1R and D2R neurons. D1Rs are coupled to G protein ?s (Gs), which activates cAMP/PKA signaling, whereas D2Rs are coupled to Gi, which inhibits cAMP/PKA. We found that Fyn activation depends on cAMP/PKA, and that in vivo administration of a D1R agonist but not D2R agonist activates Fyn signaling in the DMS, and specifically in D1R DMS neurons. Together, these data suggest the DA activates a signaling pathway consisting of D1R/Gs/Fyn/GluN2B/AMPAR in D1R neurons. Ethanol increases DA levels in the striatum, and we hypothesize that ethanol activates Fyn signaling specifically in D1R neurons in the DMS to facilitate neuroadaptations in the direct Go pathway that drive ethanol drinking behaviors. We also hypothesize that remote activation of Gs signaling in D1R DMS neurons is sufficient to produce similar Fyn-dependent cellular and behavioral neuroadaptations. These hypotheses will be tested in vivo using transgenic mice that express Cre in D1R or D2R neurons, and will utilize innovative molecular and chemico- genetic approaches to manipulate single genes (Cre-FLEX), and to remotely activate Gs signaling using the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) method in specific subpopulations of neurons. Aim 1 and Aim 2 will determine whether Fyn-dependent adaptations induced by ethanol occur in D1R, but not D2R, neurons in the DMS, and whether Gs DREADD activation in DMS D1R neurons is sufficient to produce similar outcomes. Aim 3 will investigate the contribution of Fyn signaling in D1R DMS neurons to ethanol drinking behaviors, and whether Gs DREADD activation of Fyn in D1R is sufficient to produce ethanol seeking and drinking. Combining Molecular and Systems Neuroscience methodologies, we will unravel cell- type specific signaling adaptations that underlie the development and maintenance of ethanol drinking and seeking behaviors."

"9303339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the US population aging, it is important to find novel dental biomaterials that will promote periodontal regeneration, and translate these to clinical practice. As both a dentist and materials scientist, the applicant is in a position to brige the gap between biomaterials development. and their application in patient care using nanotechnology, tissue engineering and clinical knowledge. The purpose of this award is to provide the principal investigator extensive training in cellular and molecular biology, skeletal biology, and translational research with an emphasis on periodontal tissue regeneration. The experiments in this application have been designed to incorporate new methodologies, and will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of experts who will provide the required training to advance Dr. Bottino's scientific technical and analytic skills. The principal investigator's ultimae goal is to become a productive and independent clinician-scientist who can secure federal funding to sponsor an independent research program. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that a multilayer membrane capable of stimulating the regeneration of various tissue types in a location specific manner, through the addition of calcium phosphate and fibroblast growth factor-2 (CaP/FGF2) and FGF2, will lead to alveolar and periodontal tissue regeneration in the appropriate locations. The literature indicates that no single implantable biomaterial can consistently guide the coordinated growth and development of multiple tissue types, especially in very large periodontal defects. Thus, there is a critical need to develop regenerative therapies to promote oral and craniofacial tissue regeneration and reconstruction. The specific aims of the proposed research are (1) To use an in vitro assay model to maximize the tissue-specific regenerative capacity of the multilayered implant surface layers, (2) To assess the effectiveness of CaP/FGF2 on bone regeneration in an alveolar defect using an in vivo canine model, and (3) To assess the effectiveness of the multilayered implant to regenerate soft and mineralized tissues in a location-specific manner using an in vivo canine model. The principal investigator has devised a comprehensive career development plan that includes formal coursework, laboratory guidance to cover intensive cell and molecular biology training, as well as in vivo techniques combined with a diverse set of bone/periodontal tissue regeneration related analyses under the supervision of his mentoring team. Collectively, the K08 award has the capacity to provide the resources and training needed to give the applicant the foundation and critical theoretical and practical means to become a highly qualified clinician-scientist who can translate his knowledge of biomaterials to clinical practice."
"9321059","Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system (CNS). CNS myelin formation/repair consists of two closely-related sequential events: OL differentiation from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and axonal (re)myelination by already differentiated OLs. Defects of these two events result in abnormalities of CNS myelin formation such as in periventricular leukomalacia and inability of myelin repair such as in multiple sclerosis. Our long term goal is to study the underlying mechanisms regulating CNS myelin formation/repair. The expression of the Wnt effector transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7l2, a.k.a. TCF4) in multiple sclerosis lesions is one such promising mechanism.  A well-studied role of TCF7l2 is transcriptionally mediating Wnt/?-catenin signaling in Wnt activated cells such as colorectal cancer cells. Previous studies from others and our own laboratory have shown that genetic activation of canonical Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway inhibits OL differentiation (review Guo et al., 2015).Therefore, it has been proposed that TCF7l2 inhibits OL differentiation acting through Wnt/?-catenin signaling. However, we recently reported that conditionally disrupting TCF7l2 by Cre-loxP genetic approach inhibits neonatal and early postnatal OL differentiation without perturbing Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway (Hammond et al., 2015). Based on our genetic data, we propose an alternative hypothesis that TCF7l2, acting through non-Wnt pathways (Aim 2), is a multimodal positive regulator of CNS myelin formation (Aim 1) that can be manipulated to promote CNS myelin repair after myelin damage (Aim 3).  In Aim 1, we will specifically ablate TCF7l2 in already differentiated OLs to determine its role in subsequent axonal myelination and myelin lipid synthesis. The experiments in this Aim will reveal a previously unrecognized novel role of TCF7l2 in CNS myelination independent of upstream OL differentiation. In Aim 2, we will use in vivo and in vitro genetic approaches to test the hypothesis that TCF7l2's function as a gene repressor plays an essential role in CNS myelin formation. This project will unveil a novel link between TCF7l2 and an oligodendroglial autocrine pathway that inhibits OL differentiation and myelination. Our paradigm- shifting data make it necessary and important to revisit and reevaluate the therapeutic potential of TCF7l2 during CNS myelin repair which has been proposed as an inhibitory factor in human multiple sclerosis. In Aim 3, we will use lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer to test the alternative hypothesis that enforced TCF7l2 expression promotes OL differentiation and CNS myelination in demyelination animal models. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance our mechanistic understanding of CNS myelin formation and of novel role of TCF7l2, and will change our conventional view of inhibiting TCF7l2 to enhance CNS myelin repair."
"9357662","Abstract Numerous psychiatric disorders can plague the development of children. Each of these disorders manifests as a distinct pattern of clinical, behavioral, etiological, neuroanatomic, and neurofunctional characteristics that challenge the management of the individual patient, as well as the development of successful intervention and prevention strategies. In the area of neuroimaging, a substantial number of studies have been performed and published in the literature; while each study produces a wealth a clinical and imaging data, most of the detailed knowledge information in the manuscript (detailed findings, methods, raw and derived data, etc.) remains an untapped resource due to limitations of the current publication format related to standards of human and machine-readable knowledge expression. Following upon the successful development of numerous data sharing resources and mandates, this proposal seeks to develop the tools necessary to liberate the detailed knowledge expressions form the publication, enhance our ability to query, drive inference and act upon these published knowledge elements via the Child Psychiatry Portal, and embark on a research plan that highlights the utility of these combined data resources to solve specific problems in the child psychiatry domain related to reproducibility of findings and amplification of RDoC constructs. Successful execution of this program of social, technical and biological study will move the field forward by providing additional methods for all investigators to fulfill their NIH obligation to participate in open, reproducible science. As such, this fosters a bolder ?discovery- mode? data interrogation designed to capture the richness of the neuroimaging data landscape and provide better directed hypotheses for future study into diagnosis, prediction, monitoring of therapeutic intervention."
"9380807","The systematic characterization of gene function, and the understanding of how gene dysfunction leads to disease states, is one of the largest challenges in biology today. The number of genes multiplied by the number of cellular states in which they are expressed emphasizes the need for scalable, comprehensive, unbiased, and robust techniques for perturbing genes to ascertain their functions. CRISPR-Cas9 technology represents the most promising tool yet described for experimental manipulation of the genome, and a central focus of Core C is the development, pressure testing, and deployment at-scale of this technology. Core C will support Research Projects 1 and 2 in this U19 proposal, ?Defining regulators of immunity to acute infection using CRISPR screens.? Specifically, we will work with the computational core (Core B) and the individual investigators in each of the two Research Projects to curate a set of target genes for screening in mouse models (Aim 1). We will generate pooled libraries of gRNA for each project using optimized design algorithms that maximize the efficiency of the reagents, enabling the use of small numbers of gRNAs per gene and thus the screening of more genes. These libraries will then be produced as lentivirus for delivery into cells. We will then work with the mouse screening core (Core D) to determine optimal screening conditions for each of the individual projects (Aim 2). Core D will execute the in vivo screens and provide genomic DNA samples to Core C for processing and analysis. Core C will PCR the gRNA inserts, sequence the product via Illumina, and use customized software to deconvolute the sequencing reads. Finally, Core C will combine information from multiple gRNAs targeting each gene to define a hit list for each screen, using the STARS algorithm. This hit list is the starting point for systematic network analysis by Core B. Following primary screens, Core C will support the customized creation of individual reagents necessary for focused follow-up (Aim 3). This support includes the design and production of individual gRNA reagents, creation of customized vectors, and implementation of alternative perturbational technologies, such as CRISPRa, CRISPRi, ORFs, and RNAi. Together, these three aims will accelerate the research of both Research Projects and enable deep functional knowledge across multiple models of immunity."
"9380804","The overarching goal of this U19 Program is to use forward genetic screens in mice to advance our understanding of immune responses to pathogens. This U19 Program is driven by our recent development of a genetic screening platform that uses pooled, in vivo CRISPR-mediated loss-of- function genetic screens to identify genes that positively or negatively regulate the fate and function of immune cells. We will couple this novel approach with single-cell gene profiling and systems-level computational modeling of innate and adaptive cells during acute infection to nominate candidates to perturb functionally in genetic screens. We will then test thousands of potential regulators in pooled CRISPR-Cas9 based forward genetic screens in mice, and validate novel candidate regulators in mouse infection models and human cells. Our proposed U19 Program consists of 2 highly interactive Projects, supported by 4 Cores. Project 1 (Haining/Kuchroo/Sharpe) will conduct forward genetic screens to identify genes that regulate the fate and function of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells responding to acute infection. Project 2 (Hacohen/Kagan) will conduct screens to identify genes that control DC activation in response to pathogens, pathogen components and T cells. Administrative Core A (Sharpe/Haining) will provide administrative and scientific coordination, and implement our Pilot Project program. Data Management and Bioinformatics Core B (Regev) will develop, apply and disseminate cutting-edge methods and tools for single cell RNA-seq analysis of immune cell responses and for selecting and ranking candidate genes for genetic manipulation in CRISPR screens. Core B will also establish and maintain a public portal and software pipelines for sharing data, analyses and methods. CRISPR Library Core C (Doench) will design and generate custom single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries needed to conduct forward genetic screens and to validate candidate regulators. Core C will also analyze genomic DNA from cells obtained pooled screens, performing sequencing and sequence deconvolution to identify sgRNAs that caused the phenotype of interest. Mouse Perturbation Core D (Sharpe/Haining) will provide a uniform platform to execute CRISPR-Cas9 screens and validation experiments in mouse infection models. The use of standardized experimental methods and computational tools by the cores will make it possible to compare and integrate results in different settings and disease models. We expect that our in vivo forward genetic screens and systems level single-cell genomic analyses will identify the central molecules, pathways and mechanism that guide innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. These findings will lay the foundation for new vaccination strategies for infectious diseases and therapies for allergy and autoimmunity."
"9392612","The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) created an unprecedented environmental exposure to WTC aerosolized dust and gases that contained known and suspected carcinogens including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated furans, dioxins and asbestos. In our sentinel study of cancer incidence following WTC exposure, we reported a modest excess of cancer cases in the WTC-exposed Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) firefighters compared with US population rates and rates in non-WTC-exposed firefighters despite a relatively short follow up period of 7 years (Zeig- Owens et al, Lancet, 2011)(1). Longer follow up of WTC exposed firefighters revealed a trend towards higher incidence of multiple myeloma and leukemias in these cases. We continue to prospectively follow the entire FDNY cohort of firefighters for cancer incidence and have built a biorepository of samples consisting of fractionated blood components and serum from 3000+ WTC exposed FDNY subjects and non WTC exposed firefighter controls. Using this cohort we have conducted preliminary studies in 781 WTC exposed firefighters that demonstrate a significantly higher prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy (MGUS), a precursor for multiple myeloma. Interestingly, we observed a higher rate of light chain disease that is specifically linked to chronic immune stimulation. Furthermore, we have conducted genome sequencing of a cohort of WTC exposed firefighters revealing a higher incidence of genomic instability in these cases and suggesting potential risk for development of myeloid neoplasms such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Based on these data, we now propose to comprehensively determine the prevalence of hematologic malignancies and premalignant conditions in WTC exposed firefighters. Aim 1 will determine the prevalence of myeloma and its precursor state, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) by use of serum proteomic analyses. Aim 2 will determine the prevalence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and its precursor lesions in this cohort. CLL is associated with environmental exposures and we have shown that CLL is preceded by a monoclonal B- cell lymphocytosis (MBL) that can be detected by flow cytometry (Landgren et al, NEJM, 2009)(2). Cryopreserved mononuclear cells from WTC exposed firefighters will be examined for presence of MBL/CLL and specific immunoglobulin chain rearrangements. Aim 3 will determine the prevalence of MDS by evaluation of mutations using next generation sequencing. Myelodysplasia is a preleukemic neoplasm that is associated with genotoxic exposures. Based on our preliminary data demonstrating increased single nucleotide variants in WTC?exposed firefighter samples, we propose to conduct deep sequencing to detect MDS/myeloid leukemia associated mutations in a cohort of firefighter and control samples. Early detection of hematologic malignancies would enable potentially disease altering therapeutic interventions for most of these cancers, which are often incurable when detected at late stages."
"9283541","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the function of the mammalian olfactory bulb. The map of the input to the bulb that results from odorant stimulation is well known (e.g. Wachowiak and Cohen, 2001) but there is no analogous map of the output of the bulb (carried by the mitral/tufted cells). A comparison of the input and output maps would define the function(s) carried out by the bulb. That information is needed to make sense of the roles of the many different types of bulb interneurons. It is proposed to measure the output map by specifically labeling the mitral/tufted neurons with a Fluorescent Protein (FP) voltage-sensor using transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase in the mitral/tufted neurons; FP voltage sensors will be expressed either by injecting AAV1 virus that carries a floxed version of the sensor. To observe the mitral/tufted cell signal from many glomeruli we would use wide-field or 2-photon fluorescence imaging focused on their glomerular tufts.  A second aspect of understanding the function of the olfactory bulb is to determine the roles of its diverse interneuron types (e.g. Parrish-Aungst et al, 2007). We recorded the odor responses of olfactory bulb interneurons and tried to relate these responses to the activated glomeruli. The results were ambiguous because every odorant activated many glomeruli and thus one could not be certain of the relationship between glomeruli and responding neurons. We then used transgenic mice that express channelrhodopsin-2 in only one olfactory receptor neuron type and activated these receptor neurons by pulsed illumination of the olfactory epithelium. This results in input to a single glomerulus which avoids the confound of widespread glomerular activation. We mapped the response to activation of one glomerulus than then found that higher intensity stimulation sometimes led to lateral effects on nearby glomeruli. We plan to study the cellular basis of this lateral inhibition. There has been a dramatic improvement in the signal size of FP voltage-sensors but the constructs with the largest signal have relatively slow response time constants (t=10 and 50 msec) (Jin et al., 2012). Developing a fast FP voltage-sensor with a large signal would benefit the proposed measurements from mitral/tufted cells and would also be useful to the wider community carrying out optical measurements of brain activity. There are now several fast FP voltage-sensors but they have relatively small signal sizes. It is proposed to make a thorough study of the effect of location of one member of a FRET pair on signal size in an attempt to find sensors with large and fast signals. Voltage sensitive dyes have been used extensively in the study of epilepsy and action potential propagation during cardiac arhythmias (e.g. Matiukas et al, 2006; Mironov et al, 2006). Both kinds of measurements would benefit from the cell-type specificity provided by FP voltage sensors."
"9506040","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of our T32 grant entitled is to rigorously train clinically oriented post-doctoral scholars from both adult and pediatric backgrounds in clinical investigation focused on prevention and treatment of kidney disease. The training program strives to supplying the workforce with outstanding clinical investigators in adult and pediatric nephrology who will lead the field in discovery of new treatments and preventive strategies for the expanding population of adult and pediatric kidney disease patients throughout their careers. The training will be provided through four structured modules, supplemented by elective coursework, seminars, and individual mentoring. The first module provides a 2-year mentored primary research project, supervised by a T32 faculty member and a 3-faculty Scholar Oversight Committee created individually for each scholar. This T32 places a strong emphasis on training in epidemiology and biostatistics, which will assist scholars regardless of their primary focus within clinical investigation. Thus, in the second module, all scholars will complete the UCSD CREST program; a highly rated and successful two-year Master's program in clinical research that is specifically designed to train clinically oriented scholars in research methods. Understanding the key aspects to measurement, including topics such as precision, limits of detection, and different platforms of measurement are key tools in clinical investigation. Moreover, skills to test the kidney's ability to metabolize and clear compounds will be necessary if scholars are to deliver new treatments to kidney disease patients. Thus, the third module is designed to provide the scholar hands-on experiences with in vivo pharmacology and measurement methods in both animal models and in humans. Finally, success in investigative careers requires skills in scientific writing, grantsmanship, and leadership; structured training i these areas is often overlooked. Thus, the fourth module will provide structured training in these areas. In proposing a new T32, we have specifically designed this grant with a modest request of post-doctoral fellow positions. We request 2 slots in year 1 and 3 slots in subsequent years. One in every 3 scholars will be trained in pediatric nephrology. Recognizing the importance of strong commitment of our faculty to a new T32, we have prioritized the quality and breadth of expertise of faculty, rather than quantity of faculty. The faculty was selected based on their commitment to clinical investigation, commitment to mentorship, and breadth of expertise in all aspects of clinical investigation spanning from physiology and pharmacology in animal models to clinical trials in humans. The scholar and faculty are supported by the great wealth of expertise of the larger faculty at UCSD which will be used to supplement needs of individual scholars. In aggregate, we propose an innovative, supportive environment for outstanding training in all aspects required for successful careers in clinical investigation in adult and pediatric nephrology."

"9305071","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks continued and increased support for graduate training in genetics and genomics in the Duke University Program in Genetics and Genomics, a unique program that is degree granting and currently encompasses 110 faculty and 82 students and bridging basic and clinical departments in the School of Medicine and the College of Arts and Sciences, including a diverse array of faculty. The program includes faculty and students in the Departments of Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Immunology, Medicine, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics (MGM), Pathology, Pediatrics, Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, and Radiation Oncology in the Medical Center and from the departments of Biology and Chemistry in the School of Arts and Sciences. Research foci span traditional and molecular genetics, model systems (bacteria, yeast, drosophila, nematode, and zebra fish), plant biology, human genetics, developmental biology, population genetics and genome sciences. Students apply directly to the program for graduate training at Duke, most from undergraduate programs in the biological or physical sciences. Admissions are based on GRE scores, GPA, letters of recommendation, research interests and experience and an interview at Duke. During the first program year, students attend courses, rotate in labs and meet with the first year advisory committee. At the conclusion of the first year, students choose a lab and thesis advisor, and ultimately receive their degree via the program or, alternatively, through the host department. Since 2002, and the coinciding with the completion of the first draft of the Human Genome reference sequence assembly, the genetics program was expanded to include genome sciences in a joint program that is now called the Duke University Program in Genetics and Genomics (UPGG). Our seminar series, called The Tuesday Seminar Series, has been expanded to the full academic year with additional support coming from various genomics centers and institutes at Duke. We have launched and established the Distinguished Lecturer Seminar Series to complement the genetics and genomics seminar series, and this program has run annually for the past seven years and brought a cadre of exemplary visionary speakers to speak with our faculty and student body. We have also instituted a program retreat organized and conducted by the students that has been held annually over the past seven years, and which has contributed considerably to promote a community of inspired and engaged scholars. The program is administered by the Director (Douglas Marchuk), Co-director (Beth Sullivan), Director of Graduate Studies (Allison Ashley-Koch), Admissions Director (Simon Gregory), and the Executive Committee. Currently the NIH provides support for 10 new students per year and Duke University via the Deans support five new students per year. Here we seek to expand the NIH supported portion of the training grant to a total of 12 new students per year."
"9308956","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The objective of the Environmental Toxicology and Epidemiology Program (ETEP) is to train future leaders in environmental health sciences (EHS) who accelerate improvements in public health. This program is based on the premise that transformative research in EHS requires scientists with specialized knowledge who engage in multidisciplinary research.  This program focuses on translational applications to human disease prevention with training that bridges environmental mechanistic toxicology (basic research) and molecular epidemiology (population-based research) (i.e., T3 translational research).  The investigators' focus emphasizes the application of molecular tools such as biomarkers of toxicant exposure/response, genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics to conduct mechanistically-oriented research in laboratory models and human populations. The proposed training continues their highly successful program, moving into our 32nd year of NIEHS support. Pre-doctoral trainees specialize in environmental epidemiology or mechanistic toxicology, and take a foundation course and an advanced course in the non-specialization area (i.e., epidemiology trainees take toxicology courses and vice versa). In addition, there is a common core curriculum that consists of a bioinformatics course and a course in professional communication and development. The investigators request 8 pre-doctoral and 3 postdoctoral positions (at levels 0, 1 and 2) in this submission, increased from 6 pre-doctoral fellowships and continuing 3 postdoctoral fellowships from the last cycle. The expected duration of trainee support on this training grant is two years, though the expected total duration of pre-doctoral training is 4-5 years. Pre-doctoral and postdoctoral trainees will be encouraged to submit Individual NRSA Fellowship applications (F31 or F32, respectively). Alternatively, postdoctoral trainees may be encouraged to submit K99/R00 application. Qualified applicants must demonstrate motivation for careers in EHS mechanistic toxicology or mechanistically-oriented epidemiology research. Pre-doctoral trainees must have a baccalaureate degree with relevant scientific coursework preparation and will be enrolled in a Ph.D. program in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences, which has a distinguished history of graduate training in toxicology. Postdoctoral fellows must have the Ph.D., M.D., DVM, or other appropriate doctoral degree. The program addresses most of the themes and strategic goals of the NIHES 2012-2017 Strategic Plan, and aims to advance the mission of the NIEHS to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives."
"9396386","PROJECT SUMMARY Reward-learning and the guidance of motivated behavior relies on the brain's ability to bind reward signals with contexts and stimuli in a long-lasting manner. The neural underpinnings of this process are thought to involve the remodeling of synaptic connections between multiple brain regions. The Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), a structure within the ventral striatum, is critical in controlling motivated behaviors and supporting reward learning, and this region is the site of numerous pathological alterations underlying addiction to drugs of abuse and compulsion disorders. Output from the NAc is mediated by medium spiny neurons (MSNs), inhibitory projection neurons which fall into two populations that project to opposing downstream targets. Local GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) are thought to control the output of these MSNs, but basic properties of their connectivity remain a mystery. The excitatory inputs which contact interneurons and drive their firing are unexplored, and little is known about their control over the two MSN subclasses. Given the wealth of knowledge regarding the importance of local interneuron circuits in cortical areas, it is critical to understand the GABAergic microcircuit in the NAc. Additionally, the NAc is a site of immense plasticity, allowing for both reward learning and the pathological scenario of drug addiction. This region has long been known to play a critical role in addiction-related behaviors, and recent studies have revealed synaptic plasticity mechanisms involving glutamatergic inputs to MSNs. Given their ability to regulate the activity of both types of MSNs, PV+ and SOM+ interneurons are well-suited for a potential role in both controlling the overall activity patterns of this region as well biasing the relative output of the two opposing projection pathways. Thus, these cells likely play a pivotal role in the development of both drug-related and reward-motivated behaviors. This proposal will explore inhibitory striatal circuitry in three aims. Aim 1 will identify and characterize the glutamatergic inputs that drive GABAergic interneuron populations. Aim 2 will examine the inhibitory control of different MSN subtypes by local interneurons. Aim 3 will test how this circuitry is impacted by repeated exposure to cocaine. Together, this work will provide crucial insight into NAc circuitry and how this network is modified by drugs of abuse to contribute to drug-seeking behaviors."
"9306909","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this longitudinal study, we examine an entire incoming cohort of first year students at a large public university, which allows us to compare both underrepresented minority (URM) and non - (underrepresented) minority (NURM) students who do and who do not begin university with an interest in biomedical research careers as they proceed through their first three years at university. Based on self - regulation theory, we propose that self-regulation skills will substantially predict success in biomedical research (persistence in science career intentions/major and performance) above and beyond standard/identified academic/cognitive and institutional factors for both URM and NURM students. Our design will allow us to examine aspects of self-regulation as predicting URM success (performance and persistence) over time to determine if there are differences between URM and NURM with intentions to a career in biomedical research and those with other majors. We will also take a developmental perspective, examining differential predictors of leaks in the pipeline within each of the first three years of study. Specifically, we aim to (1) Characterize th levels and changes in levels of self-regulation skills of URM and NURM in biomedical research-bound students relative to minority and non-minority students in other majors; (2) Determine whether self-regulation predicts success (i.e., academic performance & persistence) for URM and NURM students in the biomedical sciences, over and above already-identified predictive individual (e.g., self-efficacy) and institutional characteristics/experiences (e.g., research mentoring). (3) Determine whether time moderates the effects of self-regulation, along with the already-established individual and institutional factors on persistence and performance over time. And (4) As an exploratory aim, examine the extent to which URM and NURM biomedical science students participate in support and interventions that may facilitate development of self-regulation skills, generating important information for development of subsequent intervention strategies. Results from this study will also provide valuable information on targets that are highly amenable to intervention development. In particular, we will be able to identify where in the college pipeline different aspects of self-regulation (along with social/cognitive and institutional/experiential) variables lead to resilient persistence and strong academic performance, which will point to the different types of self-regulation strategies most appropriate for particular types of students at particular points in their college careers. In addition, we wil examine the extent to which different types of support programs students partake of predict their success as well as changes in their self-regulation skills to provide additional insights into the types of self-regulation interventions that may be most helpful to URM students. We anticipate that these results will lead directly to more effective interventions that will promote increased URM success in biomedical careers."
"9304952","ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY Request for 5-year extension of Al - 36929 under MERIT award Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous Gram-positive bacterium that can cause serious food-borne infections in pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised or older adults. From the initial site of Infection in the intestine, the bacteria are able to spread systemically while avoiding the antibody-mediated arm of the hose immune response. These bacteria grow directly in the cytoplasm of infected host cells and move rapidly throughout and between infected cells using a form of actin-based motility. This remarkable ability allows the bacteria to spread from the intestinal epithelial cells into circulating macrophages, which then carry the bacteria throughout the body and are thought to mediate their spread into distal tissues including the liver, the brain, and the placenta (in pregnant women). The intracellular actin-based motility of L. monocytogenes has served as an important model system for understanding the molecular and biophysical mechanisms of eukaryotic processes driven by actin polymerization, including whole-cell crawling in the immune system and in cancer metastasis. Through our interdisciplinary work involving biochemical reconstitution of motility, biophysical measurement of force-generating processes operating at the bacterial surface, molecular genetic dissection of the bacterial and host contributions to motility, and mathematical modeling of this complex process, we have developed a very detailed understanding of the intracellular motility phase of the infection cycle. In our current work, we are expanding our interdisciplinary analysis to other steps in the infection, including host cell invasion, bacterial growth and surface polarization, and cell-to-cell spread. The L. monocytogenes surface protein, ActA, is expressed in a polarized fashion and interacts with host cell cytoskeletal factors to induce the polymerization of an actin comet tail structure that pushes the bacterium through the host cell cytoplasm. The interactions between ActA and host cell cytoplasmic factors have been well-studied, but the behavior of ActA itself is less explored. This is a very large intrinsically disordered protein, whose size is such that it should not be able to diffuse through the nanometer-scale pores in the thick, cross-linked Gram-positive bacterial cell wall. Nevertheless, it does extend through the wall while remaining anchored in the membrane. Very recently, we have developed a conceptual breakthrough that can explain quantitative features of ActA translocation as an entropy-driven process. Our new model is highly relevant for surface presentation of other virulence factors in Gram-positive organisms. Over the next five years of this ongoing project, we propose to use L monocytogenes as a genetic system to identify bacterial genes involved in determination of the physical properties of the cell wall (such as thickness and pore size) that govern entropy-driven protein secretion, and expand our analysis to other Gram-positive virulence factors that are structurally related to ActA, particularly in Staphylococcus aureus. For our studies of invasion and cell-to-cell spread, we are focusing on interactions between L. monocytogenes and the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, as these cells should represent a critical barrier to systemic dissemination of the bacteria. The most likely mechanisms of bypassing the barrier properties of the endothelium include: direct infection of endothelial cells, infection of endothelial cells via cell-to-cell spread from infected circulating immune system cells, and transmigration of infected immune cells across an uninfected endothelium. In tissue culture, we have been able to replicate each of these processes, and have used systematic siRNA screening to identify host cell factors uniquely involved in each step. These initial results have yielded many surprises, and have demonstrated that invasion of endothelial cells is mechanistically distinct from invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. Over the next five years, we propose to continue and expand our molecular dissection of these processes and test the role of the molecules we identify in mouse models of L monocytogenes infection."
"9301067","While myotonic dystrophy (DM) is classified as a muscular dystrophy, it is a progressive multi-systemic disease that has significant effects on central nervous system (CNS) function. These CNS manifestations include mental retardation and autistic behaviors in congenital DM and hypersomnia, executive dysfunction and cortical atrophy in the adult-onset form. Studies on the molecular basis of DM have revealed a novel disease mechanism, RNA-mediated pathogenesis, that involves the expansion of microsatellite C(C)TG repeats in two unrelated genes and the synthesis of toxic C(C)UG expansion RNAs. These pathogenic RNAs interfere with the normal alternative splicing functions of the CELF and MBNL proteins resulting in the persistence of, or reversion to, fetal isoforms in adult tissues. To determine if this RNA-mediated disease model is relevant to CNS dysfunction in DM, we have recently generated Mbnl2 knockout mice which recapitulate characteristic pathological features of the DM brain including abnormal REM sleep propensity and spatial memory deficits. In this proposal, we will first test the MBNL2 sequestration hypothesis for DM relevant CNS pathogenesis by demonstrating that transfer of MBNL2 from its normal RNA targets to C(C)UG repeats occurs in the DM brain. Next, we will determine if Mbnl2 knockout mice model the full range of DM CNS features and link specific mis-splicing events to characteristic disease manifestations. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that interactions between MBNL genes are disrupted in the congenital disease. These studies will provide novel animal models of adult-onset and congenital DM for future disease mechanism studies and the development of therapies that target the DM brain."
"9278255","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is a major weapon in our fight against cardiovascular disease (CVD), the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Nurse researchers have made significant contributions to knowledge discovery in the science of CVD prevention and management interventions to improve cardiovascular health. To ensure that knowledge discovery continues, we need more training programs to attract and prepare promising nurse scientists to careers in cardiovascular health research, especially to function as leaders and members of interdisciplinary research teams. This interdisciplinary approach is fundamental to prepare the next generation of nurse scientists for careers in manipulating, analyzing and interpreting Big Data to advance cardiovascular health research and individualized health initiatives. There also is an urgent need to increase the number of nurse scientists at younger stages in their careers. This application requests support for pre-doctoral interdisciplinary research training for nurse scientists to build investigative careers directed at improving our understanding of behavioral, biologic and genomic mechanisms associated with cardiovascular health, illness, risk, and the investigation of interventions designed to prevent or control CVD risk factors and promote cardiovascular health. Through a combination of didactic coursework, directed research residencies, interdisciplinary co-mentorship, skill-building workshops, journal clubs, research seminars, and independent research projects, fellows will develop competencies to conduct state-of-the-art research. Fellows will have the opportunity to select senior research mentors from five research clusters: 1) intervention science; 2) research methodology; 3) biologic science; 4) social science; and 5. Big Data science. This training program benefits from the participation of experienced, enthusiastic, committed faculty from the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, and Public Health, who are involved in active, funded research programs in cardiovascular health; the availability of interdisciplinary course offerings and research experiences targeted to achieve competencies in the areas of cardiovascular research; and a strong history of productive NIH-funded interdisciplinary research and training efforts. The specific aims of this training program are to: 1. Provide fellows with the in-depth core knowledge and skills to conduct rigorous research in the area of CVD prevention and management, including the requisite knowledge and skills to effectively access, organize, analyze and integrate Big Data; 2. Provide intensive research experiences with expert mentors conducting research in the prevention and management of CVD and relevant methods; 3. Utilize resources throughout the University to assure training across disciplines to develop creative, successful clinical investigators who can lead and participate in research within interdisciplinary teams: and, 4. Increase the number of and strengthen the preparation of early career nurse scientists participating in research."
"9319951","Critical impediments currently exist regarding how clinical trials are conducted which include inconsistent (or absent) training, as well as passive learning techniques used for developing the clinical research workforce. Our group lead efforts to identify clinical research competency domains related to clinical research; however a curriculum mapped to these domains and objective competency based assessments for these domain-specific competencies don?t exist. Therefore there exists a critical need to develop, demonstrate, and publically disseminate competency-based training for clinical research personnel involved in executing clinical trials throughout the CTSA consortium. To do this, we will build upon our efforts to harmonize multiple core clinical research competencies into a set of single, role-based standards (developed in Phase II of the Enhancing Clinical Research Professionals? Training & Qualification [ECRPTQ] project supported by NCATS) that serve as the framework for developing a competency-based curriculum, demonstrating its use, and disseminating this training across CTSA hubs. Our proposal entitled, Development, Implementation and AssessMent Of Novel Training in Domain-based Competencies (DIAMOND), has the objective to develop an online educational portal (DIAMOND portal) for competency-based educational offerings and assessments and to demonstrate integration of this curriculum into CTSA clinical trial education programs at DIAMOND hubs and partner sites in ways that promote the more effective, efficient, and safe execution of clinical trials; allowing for dissemination to a broader audience. Our rationale is that use of competency-based educational offerings and validated observational assessment rubrics will ensure consistency in how clinical research personnel are trained to standards that optimize the quality and efficiency of clinical trial execution. This project addresses a significant issue in clinical trials research as scientific ?answers? derived from interventional clinical trials are only as good as the quality with which the study is executed and are dependent on a highly competent study team to execute the research procedures. Therefore, translation of novel drugs, devices, and interventions into improved human health requires a well-prepared, competent workforce of clinical research professionals who effectively and efficiently conduct trials. The innovative development and demonstration of mapped competency based assessments through the DIAMOND portal will then be freely disseminated to all CTSA hubs and beyond, which we hypothesize, will eventually improve clinical trials execution, potentially resulting in accelerated health outcomes. Ultimately, DIAMOND will facilitate improved knowledge and capacity of the clinical research workforce within the CTSA consortium and strengthen clinical trials research quality by enabling NCATS? vision for an efficient and effective clinical trials network between the CTSA hubs and overall consortium."
"9506074","Project Summary The way in which brain structures interact to process sensory information from the environment dictates sensory perception. Understanding the relationship whereby one sensory structure modulates information within another is critical to the way by which sensory systems, as a whole, process and encode sensory stimuli. In the mammalian olfactory system, secondary olfactory structures (also referred to as `cortical' structures), including the `primary' olfactory piriform cortex (PCX) and olfactory tubercle (OT), receive olfactory information directly from olfactory bulb (OB) sensory neurons. A unique feature of the PCX is its extensive and highly plastic association fiber system, whereby PCX pyramidal cells innervate a number of structures. The PCX association fiber system is considered essential for the ability of the brain to learn about recent olfactory experiences. Anatomical and electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that PCX association fibers innervate the OT, a subdivision of the ventral striatum, with privileged access to the basal ganglia. Whether, and if so how, the PCX modulates odor coding within the OT is entirely unknown. Further, it is also unknown if PCX input into the OT is subject to experience-dependent plasticity. Understanding the function of this pathway will yield important information into how the primary olfactory cortex (the PCX) may shape the function of a striatal structure which is greatly implicated in the neurobiology of motivated behaviors (the OT). In the proposed research, I will test the overall hypothesis that PCX inputs into the OT lead to an increase in both OT spontaneous and odor-evoked neural activity that is strengthened by olfactory learning. Both Aims will utilize opto-physiological techniques in two separate olfactory behavioral tasks to determine mechanisms whereby PCX neurons and/or PCX association fibers themselves modulate odor information processing in the OT. In Aim 1, I will determine the influence of PCX neuron and/or PCX association fiber excitation on the encoding of odors in the OT of awake animals. In Aim 2, I will use a combination of olfactory psychophysics and opto- physiology to demonstrate the modulation of association fiber strength into the OT by olfactory learning. Overall, the results of the proposed project will elucidate fundamental principles by which olfactory structures interact to modulate odor information processing in behaviorally-relevant manners."
"9308701","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver fibrosis is a devastating outcome of numerous liver diseases associated with xenobiotic exposure, and accounts for approximately one million deaths annually owing to liver failure and certain cancers. Patients with liver fibrosis would most likely benefit from therapies aimed at maximizing activity of endogenous anti-fibrotic pathways, such as natural killer (NK) cell activation, in order to delay the onset of liver failure. Increase activity of the blood coagulation cascade and conversion of soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin polymers in liver are prominent features of liver fibrosis in humans and experimental xenobiotic-induced liver fibrosis in mice. Although frequently implicated as pathologic, an increase in tissue fibrin deposition is not synonymous with increasing fibrotic changes (i.e., collagen deposition). Indeed, the exact role of fibrin polymer deposition in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis is largel unknown. Our strong preliminary analysis supports the novel concept that fibrin polymer has an inhibitory effect on fibrosis development in the liver. Identifying the precise role of fibrin polyers in liver fibrosis is critical, because this could reveal specific functions of fibrin polymers as putative therapeutic targets to treat liver fibrosis. Our strong preliminary studies suggest that fibrin polymers inhibit xenobiotic-induced liver fibrosis in mice by engaging specific cellular integrin's. The central hypothesis framing these studies is that fibrin polymers inhibit liver fibrosis by engaging the integrin aMß2 on resident liver NK cells to enhance their expression of anti-fibrotic mediators. Our approach includes genetically-modified mice expressing fibrinogen proteins with specific functional mutations, a unique primary NK cell culture system to study in vitro cell activation by fibrin, and a novel small molecule that allosterically enhances aMß2-dependent cell adhesion to fibrin polymers. The investigative team comprises experts in toxic liver injury and fibrosis, coagulation and fibrinogen biochemistry/function, and novel mouse models. Specifically, in our proposed studies we will: (Aim 1) Determine the mechanism by which fibrin inhibits experimental liver fibrosis; (Aim 2) Determine the mechanisms whereby fibrin enhances NK cell activation in vitro; and (Aim 3) Determine the contribution of the fibrin-NK cell axis to experimental liver fibrosis in vivo. The insights gained will significantly advance the current understanding of coagulation in liver fibrosis and highlight putative targets and novel therapeutic strategies to inhibit liver fibrosis. Potential strategies could include mechanism-based translation of drugs targeting specific non-hemostatic functions of fibrin that could reduce fibrosis without simultaneously inducing a bleeding risk."
"9336858","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Gulf War illness (GWI) is a complex multi-symptom illness which causes as much disability as other major medical diseases such as cancer and chronic heart failure. Previous clinical trials (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise) for GWI have sought to improve disability by increasing activity regardless of symptom presentation. These previous trials for GWI have shown limited efficacy and poor adherence. An innovative treatment approach is to target a specific component of GWI, namely problem-solving ability, known to be associated with disability. Impairment in problem-solving ability affects over 70% of Gulf War Veterans (GWV) with GWI and is prospectively related to 1.5 times greater risk of disability. This impairment is also related to poorer adherence to medical regimes, making it difficult for GWV to manage other aspects of GWI. Thus, rehabilitation of problem-solving deficits is a critical target to treat a complicated syndrome like GWI. Despite this, there are no established treatments to compensate for problem-solving deficits among GWV. We are proposing to treat the problem-solving deficits of GWI using a state-of-the-art evidence-based approach to cognitive rehabilitation, Problem-Solving Therapy. Problem-Solving Therapy teaches patients skills to overcome factors impacting problem-solving. Because Problem-Solving Therapy teaches patients strategies to address real-life problems it leads to reductions in disability in other populations. This is the first trial of cognitive rehabilitation therapy for GWI. We propose a mult-site randomized controlled trial of telephone-delivered Problem-Solving Therapy versus telephone-delivered Health Education. We will use a 12 session established Problem-Solving Therapy intervention with a structured five step sequential approach to teaching problem-solving. Disability will be measured by the overall composite score from the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 which reflects two dimensions of disability: activity limitations and participation restrictions. In order to increase the representativeness of our sample, we will recruit 258 GWV from three VA sites: New Jersey, upstate New York, and Massachusetts."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   A key objective of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) strategic plan is to better understand the impact of co-occurring conditions in youth with ASD. Chronic childhood trauma is a major risk factor for physical and mental illness as well as many leading causes of death, yet it has been understudied in youth with ASD. Research has been impeded by a lack of instruments designed or validated to account for the different ways in which youth with ASD may experience and respond to trauma. The overarching goal of this award is to provide the applicant with the tools and skills necessary to become an independent investigator with a unique research program devoted to improving our ability to recognize, characterize, prevent and treat - through community settings - the adverse consequences of trauma in ASD populations. Three research aims are also proposed to develop and validate two measures: (1) a brief questionnaire and (2) a semi-structured interview of potentially traumatic events and related symptoms in ASD. Aim 1: a literature review, Delphi poll of experts and qualitative study of youth with ASD (14-22 yrs) and parents (N=20) will be used to develop both measures. Aim 2: psychometric properties (e.g., construct and predictive validity, convergent/discriminant validity) of the trauma questionnaire as well as predictors/outcomes of trauma will be assessed in in 800 cognitively-able youth (14-22 years) with ASD recruited online (n=725) and locally (n=75). Aim 3: comprehensive evaluations with local participants from Aim 2 (n=75) will assess the psychometric properties (e.g., criterion, convergent/divergent validity; inter-rater reliability) of the trauma interview as well as the criterion validity and retest reliability of the questionnaire. Consistent with NICHD's scientific vision of improving community-based healthcare options for individuals with developmental differences, these measures will support the applicant's longer-term research goals of estimating the prevalence and effects of trauma in ASD as well as testing and implementing high-impact screening and prevention programs. The applicant is a clinical psychologist with expertise in the assessment and treatment of co-occurring anxiety and ASD. Under the principal direction of Dr. Newschaffer, a leader of ASD public health science, and an expert team of co-mentors and consultants, she will broaden her training in psychiatric comorbidity and measure development and gain skills in the conduct of epidemiologic and community health and prevention research. Training (with mentors/consultants listed) will incorporate mentorship, coursework, and supervised research and clinical activities in (Goal 1) the assessment and treatment of child trauma and ASD (Berkowitz; Deblinger); (Goal 2) measure development and validation (Robins; Mazefksy, Lecavalier); and (Goal 3) public health and epidemiologic research methods (Newschaffer; Shattuck; Lankenau). These experiences will allow the applicant to integrate clinical science and public health strategies to understand how individuals with ASD experience and cope with trauma and develop broadly implementable guidelines for the ethical assessment and management of these difficulties."

The proposed studies will widen the spectrum of relevant autoantigens and diseases as well as provide opportunities to reduce cost and expand applications. While our recent findings have strengthened the evidence for the primary role of T-cells autoreactive to (pro)insulin in advanced human islet autoimmunity, we still lack robust T-cell biomarkers that could clearly reflect activity of autoreactive T cells, especially at the earliest stages of islet autoimmunity or during immunomodulation to prevent progression to diabetes. Improved assays for islet autoantibodies and autoreactive T-cells, and better understanding of their relationship and potential genetic determinants, will enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of T1D and improve prediction of progression from subclinical to clinical disease. Specific Aims of this project include: 1.Multiplex and optimize novel non-radioactive assays to a wide spectrum of islet and non-islet autoantigens.  A. Develop a novel system for simultaneous measurement of IAA, GADA, IA-2A and ZnT8A and validate  the multiplex assay in a large population of patients with T1D and LADA.  B. Add non-islet autoantigens to the optimal multiplex islet autoantibody assay to develop a robust  screening tool for multiple autoimmune phenotypes 2. Develop molecular based, non-cellular T cell biomarkers that do not requiring living T cells and can be assessed using whole blood samples.  A. Determine common V-genes preferentially used by T1D- associated TCR sequences.  B. Determine public TCR sequences in individuals with anti-islet autoimmunity and clinical T1D by deep  sequencing specific V-genes 3. Explore sequential development of the pre-T1D autoimmune phenotype including multiple iAbs and public TCR sequences (identified in Specific Aim 2.B) in 90 children prospectively followed from birth for development of islet autoimmunity and T1D and in 90 HLA-DR-DQ -matched controls."
"9278931","Project Summary / Abstract The overarching aim of this pre- and post-doctoral training program is to develop specialists who are able to conduct basic research at levels ranging from the molecular to the cognitive/clinical, on the biological mechanisms underlying the etiology, treatment and prevention of alcohol (ethanol) use disorders. Twenty-two members of the graduate faculty of the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) serve as preceptors for predoctoral students and postdoctoral research fellows in two graduate programs at OHSU?Behavioral Neuroscience, and the Neuroscience Graduate Program. Major research interests represent five areas of common interest: (1) genetic bases for ethanol responses and risk, (2) learned and unlearned determinants of ethanol reward, (3) neurobiological bases for the rewarding, aversive and neuropathological effects of ethanol, (4) neuroadaptive mechanisms associated with repeated and/or developmental ethanol exposure, ethanol dependence and sensitization, and (5) effects of ethanol on memory and cognition. In addition, comparison to the effects of other drugs of abuse is of significant interest. Technical strategies reflect four levels of analysis: I. Behavioral pharmacological/pharmacogenetic, II. Neurochemical/neurophysiological/ neuropharmacological, III. Cellular/molecular biological and IV. Cognitive neuroscience/social, including human/clinical level. Coordinated research efforts within the Portland Alcohol Research Center (PARC) and the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA) have strengthened training by unifying investigators and creating multidimensional research projects. Training includes firm curricular grounding in the basic sciences, specific pharmacological training in ethanol and other abused drugs, and extensive and continuous participation in research. Six predoctoral trainees per year, beginning with 0-2 years of graduate experience, will be supported by the training grant for 2-3 years, and then by individual National Research Service Awards or their mentors' resources. Three postdoctoral trainees per year with 1-3 years of postdoctoral experience will be supported by the training grant for 2 years. We have a well-developed plan for improving the diversity of our trainees and all trainees are expected to complete an initial intensive course in the Responsible Conduct of Research, as well as continuing education in this area. Ample opportunities exist for our trainees to be involved in public education and outreach."
"9302620","It is increasingly recognized that gut flora and gut barrier function play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of several forms of liver disease including ALD. Gut-derived endotoxins normally penetrate the gut epithelium in only trace amounts due to tightly regulated intestinal barrier function. However, endotoxin leakiness is increased under pathological conditions, including alcohol abuse. The barrier function of intestinal epithelium Is provided in part by paracellular apical junction complexes, including tight and adherens junctions, and by a mucus layer.  In our initial systems biology approach to ALD, we found that intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) was by far the most altered (~50-fold down regulated) protein in the liver following chronic alcohol feeding in rats, and subsequent studies also showed marked down regulation of ITF mRNA and protein in the intestines of alcohol fed mice. ITF plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of intestinal mucus barrier and enhancement of rapid intestinal repair restitution. Formation and restitution ofthe barrier is also dependent on uninterrupted mucosal blood flow. Intestinal epithelial cells are positioned between an anaerobic lumen and a highly metabolic lamina propria forming a steep physiologic oxygen gradient. Increased hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF) signaling represents a major adaptive response to hypoxic stress by upregulating a variety of gene products, such as ITF and mucins, to form an integrated epithelial barrier. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that chronic alcohol administration decreases intestinal HIF-2a, ITF and tight junction protein expression resulting in increased endotoxemia and ultimately liver injury. Moreover, supplementation with a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), increased intestinal HIF-2a and ITF expression, decreased endotoxemia and attenuated alcohol induced liver injury. We hypothesize that alcohol exposure causes detrimental metabolic changes favoring intestinal oxidative stress, inflammation, and alterations of HIF responsive signaling with decreased ITF, leading to intestinal barrier dysfunction, blood endotoxemia and ALD. We postulate that probiotic supplementation will attenuate alcohol-induced intestine and liver injury, in part by increasing HIF-mediated expression of mucus protective factors such as ITF in the intestine. We test our hypothesis with 4 specific aims using in vitro, animal, and human studies approaches. Our ultimate goal is the development of new therapies for ALD. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Alcohol overuse/abuse induces organ injury in multiple organs. This translational research project will examine the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of probiotics on the intestine and the liver in an experimental mouse model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and in mild human alcoholic hepatitis (AH)."
"9293300","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The application of high-throughput technologies in biomedical research has become widespread and requires specialized skills to effectively design experiments analyze large datasets and integrate new data with existing large datasets. These technologies are increasingly being applied in environmental health sciences to provide comprehensive and timely mechanistic knowledge on how the environment affects human health. With the increased application of these technologies, more researchers need training to conceptually develop, properly design and implement comprehensive, large-scale big data studies. Accordingly, our proposed program in Population-Scale Genomics Studies of Environmental Stress has the long-term goal of training a network of Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) practitioners in the application of modern sequencing technologies, computational approaches and biostatistical methods. The program couples three annual training workshops with networking tools aimed at keeping participants trained, engaged and connected. Workshops will feature a faculty of prominent researchers to provide the training necessary to maximize the application of these technologies. Each workshop will feature novel datasets of model organisms that participants create and analyze to link gene-environment interactions with the fitness of individuals. Hands-on training in a number of bioinformatics tools will be provided. Within this inquiry-based framework, faculty will lecture on a diverse set of topics including ecological genomics, experimental design, genome sequencing and population genetics. Workshops will include a module on responsible conduct of research. The proposed program builds upon our existing Environmental Genomics Course at MDI Biological Laboratory that was first established in 2010. To our knowledge, it is the only course of its kind in the U.S. that provides a highly interactive, hands-on research experience for researchers interested in studying gene-environment interactions using natural populations. The proposed workshop training is modeled after our 2014 Environmental Genomics Course and forms the foundation with which to build a network of expertly trained BD2K practitioners. The proposed BD2K practitioner network will ensure long-term benefits for program participants especially as new technologies and analysis methods arise in this rapidly changing field."
"9310043","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cilia are thin hair-like projections that form on the surface of cells and help cells sense and respond to their environment. These structures are found ubiquitously throughout the body and defects cause a variety of diseases, collectively referred to as ciliopathies. In the lung, cilia are critical for defense of the epithelium against damage, and dysfunction of cilia ultimately leads to chronic respiratory disease. The aim of this proposed work is to determine the mechanism of cilia formation in the lung following cell fate specification, focusing on two proteins, Yes-associated protein (Yap) and Trim32. Classically described as a transcriptional effector of the Hippo pathway, Yap is recruited to the apical domain of ciliated cells at the base of cilia, and this proposal will explore a non-canonical role or Yap in regulating the cytoskeleton at that location. The requirement for Yap at different stages of cilia formation and maintenance will be determined through in vivo and in vitro assays using an inducible loss of function approach. We have identified Trim32, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been shown to target actin and has also been implicated in Bardet Beidl ciliopathies, as a Yap interacting protein. The activity of this protein and its requirement for Yap-directed ciliogenesis will be examined through gain and loss of function experiments in vitro. Collectively these studies will advance our understanding of cilia formation in the lung epithelium and improve our ability to combat ciliopathies and their detrimental impact on human health."
"9304056","Core C Abstract: Long-acting nanoformulated antiretroviral therapy (nanoART) is poised for bench to bedside clinical translation. However, hurdles remain to see nanoART as a significant part of the therapeutic armamentarium. This includes, but is not limited to, evidence for improved dosing, tissue biodistribution and pharmacodynamics (PD). All require support from readily available and affordable rodent models of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection for PD and pharmacokinetic (PK) and antiretroviral efficacy tests as performed on non- human primates. To these ends, the Core C animal model core will provide humanized mice for efficacy evaluation and rhesus macaques for PK and tissue distribution testing and pilot efficacy studies. The purpose is to assist researchers with animal experiments (Projects 2 and 3 and Core B). These will include assessments of viral and immune parameters, tissue dissections and when relevant, biopsies of lymph nodes and rectal tissues. All will be processed, in collaborative experiments, for molecular, virologic and biochemical studies. The goal of the humanized mice component is to assess direct antiretroviral efficacy and HIV eradication experiments of selected and drug formulation combinations. Based on the program needs specific formulations will contain GSK744 and GSK8232, an integrase and maturation inhibitor, respectively, or mixtures of both. Alternatively, prodrugs of 3TC, abacavir, maraviroc, and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir will be used, in part, as combination therapy. These nanoformulations or their combinations will be tested for their abilities to reduce residual virus or eradicate HIV when administered with indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase inhibitors in platform development. Humanized mice will be employed for metabolomics and molecular imaging studies in order to provide rapid assessments of drug success or failures as they can assess tissue homeostasis and predict end organ disease. Non-human primates will be made available, specifically for drug PK, tissue distribution and toxicological studies. Tissue distribution will be assessed in bioimaging experiments (Project 3) by ligand-targeted magnetite nanoformulations and linked back to PK and PD tests as contained in Projects 1, 2 and Core B."
"9335770","This proposed U01 study will build on our past findings to determine the extent to which marked reductions in alcohol consumption over 4-weeks via contingency management (CM) improves cognitive performance, brain functions and pathophysiology, and HIV-associated health outcomes. HIV-associated neurocognitive dysfunction continues even with antiretroviral treatment, and even mild cognitive impairment is associated with detrimental health outcomes in older HIV+ adults. Alcohol consumption may affect the brain directly or indirectly via liver toxicity and systemic inflammation. Our past findings indicate that current heavy alcohol use is more strongly associated with cognitive/brain dysfunction among HIV+ adults than lifetime consumption, suggesting that these effects may be reversible with reductions in drinking. Towards this objective, we propose to enroll 180 HIV+ adults with heavy drinking, and then use CM with financial incentives and a wearable alcohol biosensor to maximally reduce alcohol consumption from baseline (T1) to 4-weeks later (T2). We will then conduct a motivational interview to determine perceived benefits and obstacles to drinking reduction, and conduct a final assessment 1 year later (T3), at which point persons may or may not have resumed heavy drinking. We will conduct state-of-the-art neuroimaging, cognitive, and behavioral assessments at each timepoint, and then continue to track long-term drinking and HIV outcomes in our companion Cohort (U24). The Specific Aims of this proposal are: 1) to demonstrate improved cognitive performance and brain function (fMRI) after 4-weeks of CM-induced alcohol reduction among HIV+ adults, followed by worsening of these effects 1-year later if heavy drinking resumes; 2) to demonstrate that cerebral metabolic (MRS) and neuroinflammatory (DTI-free water) markers will also improve with CM-induced alcohol reduction and worsen if drinking resumes post-CM; and 3) Determine whether perceived benefits and challenges to drinking reduction identified during motivational interviewing (MI) predict drinking reductions or relapse one-year post-CM. We will also determine whether changes in cerebral pathophysiology (MRS, DTI-FW) correspond with changes in cognition, brain function (fMRI) and serum inflammatory and liver biomarkers. In addition, we will determine which neuroimaging and baseline clinical factors are associated with long-term drinking and clinical outcomes (e.g. HIV viral suppression, liver comorbidities). In the context of this study, CM and MI are being employed as an experimental manipulation and data collection opportunity, respectively, rather than as clinical interventions per se. The A-B-A design will enable us to clearly identify whether alcohol effects on cognition and the brain are reversible, and to identify optimal strategies to promote short-term and long-term alcohol reduction in HIV+ adults. This U01 project is closely linked to the Administrative U24 (SHARC), which supports the Florida Cohort that is the source of potential participants for this study, and our Behavioral Science and Biostatistics Core (U24) that will help implement and monitor the CM, MI, and alcohol biosensor procedures."

"9211409","SUMMARY  Mammalian aging is accompanied by functional defects in a wide range of tissues that contain pools of stem cells. Age-dependent stem cell deficiencies may underlie defects in tissue physiology during aging. Exciting recent studies have revealed that a number of age-dependent defects in stem cells could be `rejuvenated' by specific interventions, including for example heterochronic parabiosis. The program has identified epigenetic changes that occur during stem cell aging. Thus a central question is whether rejuvenating interventions also rejuvenate the epigenetic and transcriptional state of old cells, and could this knowledge help `epigenetically reprogram' cells from an older state to a younger state.  This Rejuvenating Strategies Core proposes to explore epigenetic changes in different types of adult stem cells simultaneously isolated from young and old mice in response to four rejuvenating strategies administered to old mice and young controls: heterochronic parabiosis, exercise, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and fasting/dietary restriction. The stem cells that will be simultaneously isolated following these interventions include stem cells from muscle, brain, and blood. Specifically, the Core will perform the following: 1 House wild-type mice from the NIA's Aging Mouse Colony for simultaneous analysis of aging and  rejuvenation of epigenetic changes in stem cells by the three laboratories of the Program Project; 2. Implement four rejuvenation strategies ? heterochronic parabiosis, exercise, rapamycin, and fasting/dietary  restriction cycle ? to young and old mice; 3. Ensure that the logistics of the rejuvenating interventions and simultaneous stem cell isolation from the  same cohort of mice is in place for all three labs in order to allow meaningful cross-comparisons between  different tissue stem cells that are the focus of the Program Project.  This Core will couple the exciting concept of rejuvenation strategies to cutting-edge stem cell isolation and epigenomic studies. Having common aged cohorts, controlled experimental designs for rejuvenation interventions, and simultaneous collection of different stem cells from the same animals will enhance success and allow cross comparison. Characterizing the epigenetic changes that occur during stem cell aging and rejuvenation will be a key step in implementing `epigenetic reprogramming', with the goal of enhancing tissue function during aging and delaying the onset of age-related diseases."
"9336860","The Assessment Core has four main objectives that support proposed and future clinical trials and epidemiological studies: (1) to create uniformity of instrumentation and measurement and to employ state-of- the-art measures with sound psychometric properties; (2) to ensure measurement of outcome and predictor variables that are relevant and sensitive to the active duty military ethos and culture as well as Veterans' experiences; (3) to train and to provide oversight and supervision of Independent Evaluators (IEs), to adjudicate diagnostic decisions for clinical trials when necessary, to conduct inter-rater reliability evaluations of taped PTSD interviews, and to shape IEs over time to obviate drift; and (4) to work with the Data and Epidemiological Cores to create a data dictionary and to manage and leverage the omnibus multi-study dataset. Our team has specialized expertise in the assessment of war-trauma (Litz, 2007; Litz & Schlenger, 2009; Steenkamp et al., 2010; Stein et al., 2012) and has extensive experience measuring risk and resilience in the military over the life-course (Baker et al., 2012; Dickstein et al., 2010). The infrastructure created under STRONG STAR is well-equipped to effectively oversee the measurement and assessment needs for STRONG STAR-CAP. To date, we have selected outcome and predictor variables that are state-of-the-art and that provide content coverage across multiple domains while respecting Service Members' and Veterans time-and- effort constraints. We were especially mindful of the latter and chose briefer options whenever possible. Ronald Acierno at the Charleston VA Medical Center/Medical University South Carolina has organized an informal research Consortium consisting of approximately 10 non-NCPTSD investigators located at VAs throughout the US (see Table 5) who are committed to partnering with the Assessment Core and the STRONG STAR-CAP. All of the investigators have current VA, DoD, or NIH funding to support their PTSD research. A primary interest of this group is to help ensure that a set of Common Data Elements (Kaloupek et al., 2010) are collected across all DoD and VA STRONG STAR-CAP-affiliated studies (e.g., common psychological construct domains, biomarkers, etc.). They have titled their effort the Coalition of VA/DoD PTSD CAP Study Site Partners for Common Data Elements."
"9331740","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this consortium is to establish tools that can be used as biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective assays of social impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials. Specifically, we aim to accelerate the development of effective treatments for social impairment in ASD by validating (a) outcome measures that will be sensitive and reliable assessments of response to treatment and EEG and (b) eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used to reduce heterogeneity of samples via stratification, indicate early efficacy, and/or demonstrate target engagement. The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool (3-5 years) and school aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with IQ ranging from 50-115. Children will be assessed across three time points (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks, T3: 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status. This battery measures key facets of social-communication in ASD using well-validated paradigms appropriate for this developmental and cognitive range. Five Collaborating Implementation Sites (?Sites?), all highly experienced in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the methodologies proposed here in both typical and atypical development, will contribute equally to recruitment, screening, diagnosis, testing, and longitudinal assessment. The Data Coordinating Core (DCC) will provide a secure informatics infrastructure to streamline communication and data flow throughout the consortium to ensure organized, secure data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National Database for Autism Research and NIH/NIMH Data Repositories. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (DAAC) will oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for standardized data collection, processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core will oversee the operations of the Sites, the DCC, and the DAAC to coordinate with federal and private partners in this cooperative agreement to: 1) Compare whether LB measures versus clinician and caregiver assessments of social impairment are more sensitive indicators of clinical status; 2) Evaluate whether this set of ET and EEG measures, individually or in combination, has potential utility as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable measures of change in clinical trials, assessing viability in terms of: construct validity; test-retest reliability, consistency, and stability; discriminant validity ; convergent validity; and sensitivity to change; 3) Collect blood (DNA) samples from subjects and parents of ASD subjects for future genomic analyses and share raw, processed, and analyzed data to create a community resource accessible for use by all qualified investigators."

"9302580","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how animal and human behaviors are generated by the circuits of the brain. Progress towards this goal has relied in part on the ability to record the activity of neuronal populations. To record densely from a local circuit, one of the most widely-used techniques is calcium imaging. Calcium imaging by two-photon microscopy currently allows investigators to record from hundreds of neurons simultaneously; while a major improvement over past approaches, it is nevertheless a small fraction of the total number of neurons in almost any local circuit. The difficulty of determining which neurons first compute a particular decision or pattern of activity is, in my view, the most important technical barrier to a comprehensive understanding of how neuronal circuits drive behavior.  Recently, we developed a method, called Objective-Coupled Planar Illumination (OCPI) microscopy, to perform fast fluorescence imaging of whole tissue volumes. Instead of collecting data from one pixel at a time, it uses a thin sheet of light to collect entir images at once. OCPI microscopy has allowed us to record from approximately ten thousand neurons simultaneously at high speeds and signal-to-noise ratio. For our scientific work on the olfactory system, OCPI microscopy has revealed what the sensory periphery detects, how chemical stimuli are encoded, the spatial arrangement of circuits in the brain, and even how different individuals perceive the world.  Here I propose to extend the domain of applicability of OCPI microscopy. In aim 1, we will develop new methods to see deeper into the living brain. In aim 2, we will develop procedures to tag individual neurons based on their physiological properties. In aim 3, we will develop and share algorithms to process the terabyte-sized datasets produced by OCPI microscopy. These aims will allow OCPI microscopy to address new questions and to be disseminated widely throughout the neuroscience community."
"9384551","ABSTRACT Many patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D) suffer from repeated injury and nonhealing linked with T2D damage to nerves and nerve function. T2D impedes macrophage (??) functions needed for repair of wounded skin, nerves, and other tissues. Four novel findings from our pilot studies are the basis of this project: 1) We have identified PLAMN2, a novel PLAMN (prohealing lipid autocrine/paracrine of ??s & nerves). 2) PLAMN2 is produced by peripheral neurons but not by ??s alone. PLAMNs are deficient in T2D insensate-neuropathic wounds of humans and mice. 3) PLAMN2 is a novel neurotrophic ligand of a specific receptor, inducing T2D ??s into neurotrophic phenotype highly expressing nerve growth factor. 4) Sustained release PLAMN2 from lysine-based nanoparticles (sPLAMN2) restore the sensation to noxious stimuli and closure rate of the T2D wounds. Thus, sPLAMNs likely overcome the problem of the short life of PLAMNs. These pilot data suggest that PLAMN deficits contribute to T2D impairment in reinnervation, and PLAMNs are at least partially responsible for roles of nerves in skin healing. Our goal is to decipher new mechanisms and explore the therapeutic potential of PLAMNs that restore T2D wound reinnervation and healing. Aim 1: Test hypothesis 1 that the optimal sPLAMNs can offer sustained compensation for days for T2D-caused PLAMN deficits. Aim 2: Test hypothesis 2 that sustained compensation of PLAMN deficits rescues T2D wound re-innervation and induces and maintains a neurotropic phenotype of M?s that release nerve trophic factors needed for reinnervation. We will determine: 2A) outcomes of PLAMN compensation on nerve regrowth, survival, and sensory function in T2D wounds; 2B) PLAMN-induced phenotype switch and production of nerve trophic factors by M?s in T2D wounds and of patients with T2D ulcers; 2C) roles of key nerve trophic factors in mediating PLAMN functions; and 2D) role of endogenous ??s in PLAMN neurotrophic functions. 2E) We will enhance the translational value of findings in 2A-2D by verifying the link between PLAMNs and reinnervation, ?? features, and neuropathic status in T2D patients? wounds. Aim 3: Test hypothesis 3 that skin nerves contribute to wound healing by releasing PLAMN2 and PLAMN-precursors to regulate the interplay between nerves, ??s, and wounds via PLAMNs and PLAMN-induced nerve trophic factors and signaling; and that these pathways are impaired by T2D. We will determine: 3A) how nerves contribute to PLAMN formation and how T2D impairs this, including the roles and mechanisms of key PLAMN forming enzymes and ?? subtype, using T2D-denervation and co-culture of neurons and ??s; 3B) rescue of T2D wound healing by sustained compensation of deficits of nerve-promoted PLAMNs; 3C) the mechanisms in restoring healing, including the contribution of PLAMN-induced nerve trophic factors and the regulation by PLAMN2-receptor axis. Impact: This project will define novel mechanisms, explore the therapeutic potential of PLAMNs in restoring T2D wound re-innervation and healing, and advance knowledge and technical capability in the field."

Since its inception in 1975, the mission of the CMBTP has been to rigorously train outstanding early career scientists to address fundamental biological problems using molecular and cell-based mechanistic approaches and to prepare them for leadership positions in scientific research and science-related careers. The CMBTP crosses departmental and campus geographic boundaries to provide students with extensive experimental and intellectual training in a broad range of research areas that emphasize basic biological questions with human health implications. For 2013-2014, there are 36 predoctoral students in years 2-3 currently supported by the CMBTP. The program is overseen by Program Director, Susan Baserga, and an Executive Committee consisting of 7 faculty members representing a cross-section of the 4 main participating departments: Cell Biology, Genetics, Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB), and Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry (MB&B). Ninety- eight faculty participate as trainers and provide an impressive collection of expertise and a diverse array of research opportunities. Students enter by applying for admission to one of two Tracks of the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) program: Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology (BBSB) and Molecular Cell Biology, Genetics & Development (MCGD). Graduate students remain associated with their entry Track for their first year in graduate school as they take courses and complete laboratory rotations. Starting in 2013, Yale University began full support (stipend, tuition and health benefits) for first year students. At the end of their first year, students choose a laboratory and affiliate with a Ph.D.-granting academic department. At the same time, graduate students of high caliber and an interest in cellular and molecular approaches follow a new formal application process to apply to the CMBTP. Graduate students are sponsored by the CMBTP in years 2 and 3 after which they remain involved in CMBTP activities until graduation. Ph.Ds. are awarded upon submission and presentation of a dissertation. Time-to-degree is less than 6 years and the completion rate is 90%. Many of our students garner national predoctoral fellowships. Each of the 4 main participating departments now require submission of a first-author original research paper, though with flexibility. Also new to the CMBTP this granting period is the requirement of using My IDP for self-reflection and to prompt discussion with mentors and peers, an increased frequency of CMBTP Career Workshops and the first day- long Biomedical Career Fair, organized by the graduate students themselves. The CMBTP also sponsors a Research-in-Progress series and a student-organized annual Symposium. The CMBTP is beyond doubt successful as the majority of our graduates go on to leading positions in academia, biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, non-profit foundations, science policy or scientific writing and editing."
"9378038","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insulin resistance is defined as the decreased ability of insulin to perform its biological function in fat, liver and muscle. The insulin resistance observed in skeletal muscle is particularly important as this tissue, under normal physiological conditions, is the main site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, which is an underlying feature of a number of diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the role of epigenetic factors in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance is less understood. Epigenetic modifications encompass both DNA methylation and histone modifications, and can be described as heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in nucleotide sequence. DNA methylation (and histone modifications) of the genome may provide a potential link between the genetic and environmental factors observed in insulin resistance.  While epigenetics refers to the study of single genes or sets of genes, epigenomics, which simply means 'above the genome', refers to more global analyses of epigenetic changes across the entire genome. The overall goal of the experiments included in this proposal is to determine global patterns of changes in DNA methylation in metabolically well-characterized insulin sensitive and resistant volunteers and to determine whether these changes can explain alterations in gene expression and protein abundance in the insulin resistance associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Specifically, we will use these findings to determine whether changes in DNA methylation could explain a reduced response to muscle contraction in insulin resistant individuals. These findings will allow us to determine whether changes in protein abundance we have observed in insulin resistance occur in conjunction with changes in methylation of the promoters of the genes coding for these proteins.  This study brings a transdisciplinary team of investigators together to address critical gaps in our understanding of global epigenetic markers, specifically DNA methylation, in understanding the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in both skeletal muscle and whole blood tissues."

Trainees are selected based on their aptitude and commitment to a  research career. The duration of the training period is three years to ensure an in-depth training experience.  The cornerstone of the curriculum is the participation of each trainee in a specific research project under the supervision of a designated preceptor and guided by a progress committee composed of 2-3 other members of  the training faculty. Potential projects run the gamut from clinical to basic research in 3 primary areas of emphasis: 1) type 1 diabetes, 2) type 2 diabetes, and 3) bone and mineral metabolism. Within these areas, trainees have the opportunity to work with mentors in several basic science departments as well as those in  Pediatrics and Medicine. Close interaction among preceptors and trainees within each programmatic area and  within several multidisciplinary and interdepartmental research centers administered within the Endocrine  Section further enrich the training experience. Multiple educational opportunities including two degree-granting  (MS, PhD) programs are available to trainees through the CTSA-funded Yale Center for Clinical Investigation.  Instruction is also provided through organized lectures, research seminars and journal clubs. The application  requests an additional training slot per year for a total of 6 stipends. This is based on our decision to fully  integrate Yale's pediatric and internal medicine training programs in diabetes and metabolism and, therefore,  not to seek renewal of the pediatric T32 (DK63703). It is also based on our ongoing track record of attracting an outstanding applicant pool, the high level of research productivity of our training faculty, the expanded  research opportunities provided by our diverse faculty and the continued shortage of physician-scientists in  both medicine and pediatrics dedicated to research careers in diabetes and metabolic diseases."

"9431570","Arthralgia broadly impacts quality of life because of joint dysfunction and associated pain. Current therapeutics improve management of the arthritic joint but may not satisfactorily address the associated pain. The K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis produces a long lasting, but reversible inflammation of the joint in mice accompanied by an early onset allodynia that surprisingly persists long after the resolution of inflammatory indices. In the early phase of the model, pain behavior responds to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and agents that block spinal sensitization (e.g. Gabapentin), while in the post-inflammatory late phase, pain only responds to the latter agents. This behavioral profile is accompanied by a persistent activation of dorsal horn microglia and the appearance of activation transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a marker of afferent injury in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), in males and females, suggesting a transition in both sexes from an inflammatory to a neuropathic phenotype. Unexpectedly, the female, despite evidence of nerve injury, does not display a comparable late phase pain state. Pharmacological studies and studies with mutant mice have revealed several issues. 1) Transition to a neuropathic phenotype is modulated by spinal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and T and/or B cells evidenced by resolution of pain in relevant knock out strains. In females that lack T and B cells, resolution of allodynia is largely unaffected. 2) Our work indicates that TLR4 signaling, largely through MyD88 is associated with concurrent activation of proinflammatory (TNF) signaling in males leading to a persistent post inflammatory neuropathic pain state. 3) TLR4 also signals though TRIF and interferon (IFN), which we found to attenuate the algesic effects of TLR4-MyD88 signaling. We speculate that this component accounts for the lack of a late phase allodynia in the female. 4) Based on current evidence, we argue that with persistent, but reversible inflammation, sprouting and neuroma like structures in primary afferents and postganglionic sympathetic efferents occur at the peripheral terminals of the joint and the dorsal root ganglion of the K/BxN male and female. This sprouting is driven by TLR4, which activates inflammatory cells and DRG satellite cells to release growth factors, which trigger/sustain sprouting and promote migration of nerve fibers into the DRG and spinal cord. 5) Involvement of spinal TLR4 in pain processing was suggested to be male specific, and females to preferentially use adaptive immune cells (T/B lymphocytes). We believe however, that both sexes use adaptive immune cells and TLR4 signaling, but to varying degrees. The effects of sex on this transition and the underlying sprouting have not hitherto been characterized. Specifically, these studies using the K/BxN model in males and females will characterize time dependent changes in pain, sprouting (afferent and sympathetic in DRG and ankle), inflammatory cell migration into DRG and spinal cord, glial activation and the role played by sex, TLR4 signaling and T/B cells in these endpoints."
"9331738","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this consortium is to establish tools that can be used as biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective assays of social impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials. Specifically, we aim to accelerate the development of effective treatments for social impairment in ASD by validating (a) outcome measures that will be sensitive and reliable assessments of response to treatment and EEG and (b) eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used to reduce heterogeneity of samples via stratification, indicate early efficacy, and/or demonstrate target engagement. The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool (3-5 years) and school aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with IQ ranging from 50-115. Children will be assessed across three time points (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks, T3: 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status. This battery measures key facets of social-communication in ASD using well-validated paradigms appropriate for this developmental and cognitive range. Five Collaborating Implementation Sites (?Sites?), all highly experienced in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the methodologies proposed here in both typical and atypical development, will contribute equally to recruitment, screening, diagnosis, testing, and longitudinal assessment. The Data Coordinating Core (DCC) will provide a secure informatics infrastructure to streamline communication and data flow throughout the consortium to ensure organized, secure data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National Database for Autism Research and NIH/NIMH Data Repositories. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (DAAC) will oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for standardized data collection, processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core will oversee the operations of the Sites, the DCC, and the DAAC to coordinate with federal and private partners in this cooperative agreement to: 1) Compare whether LB measures versus clinician and caregiver assessments of social impairment are more sensitive indicators of clinical status; 2) Evaluate whether this set of ET and EEG measures, individually or in combination, has potential utility as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable measures of change in clinical trials, assessing viability in terms of: construct validity; test-retest reliability, consistency, and stability; discriminant validity ; convergent validity; and sensitivity to change; 3) Collect blood (DNA) samples from subjects and parents of ASD subjects for future genomic analyses and share raw, processed, and analyzed data to create a community resource accessible for use by all qualified investigators."
"9338010","The major psychoses (SZ, SAD, BDP), when defined by clinical phenomenology alone, overlap extensively on neurobiological, biomarker, co-morbid, symptomatic, and genetic characteristics. Our field may benefit from transformational re-conceptualizations of disease seen in other areas of medicine when biological variables are considered in disease definitions and identification. This approach in psychiatry will depend on: (i) use of welldefined disease domains, (ii) large samples that capture clinical heterogeneity and support statistical approaches, and (iii) ability to acquire quantifiable laboratory measures to inform re-conceptualization of disease characteristics. The 5-site B-SNIP focus is psychosis, an ideal clinical phenotype for this purpose. BSNIP1 recruited over 2500 volunteers and performed dense phenotyping across multiple levels of analysis (cognitive, psychophysiological, brain imaging, social and clinical). The overall data described a continuum of phenotypic alterations across the DSM psychosis diagnoses (BDP, SAD, SZ) with little evidence of diagnostic specificity. In an attempt to use these dense phenotypic characteristics to define biologically based subgroups, we re-grouped probands using biomarkers and a multistage multivariate analysis procedure. We identified 3 psychosis ?Biotypes? based on core phenotypic features. Biotypes showed unique differences across external validators that were not used in the initial construction of the categories. B-SNIP2 will replicate and extend BSNIP1 using enhanced proband number, biomarker panel, and sophistication of multivariate statistical approaches. We will accomplish our goals within the context of two specific aims. SA(1) Construct a ?Psychosis Biomarker Database? (PBD): Recruit 3000 new psychosis probands and 600 healthy volunteers and collect data including clinical, psychosocial, electrophysiological, ocular motor, imaging and blood biomarkers. Core biomarkers (used for Biotype definition) and external validators (used for verifying neurobiological distinctiveness of Biotypes) will be collected as specified. Genetic characteristics of the participants will be obtained in collaboration with the Broad Institute. SA(2) Contrast and test taxometric approaches to categorizing psychosis: Evaluate the ability of different toxonomic structures to define psychosis subgroups, based on data in the PBD: (i) DSM, (ii) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on clinical variables, (iii) B-SNIP1 Biotypes, (iv) B-SNIP2-generated biotypes based on biomarkers, and (v) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on both clinical variables and biomarkers. Beginning with traditional DSM diagnostic criteria as the taxonomy and testing (i)-(v) we will use linear, quadratic and nonparametric discriminant function analysis applied to external biomarker validators to examine the association between the traditional diagnostic system and the biologicallyderived classification (imaging, psychosocial and genetic external validators). We will be able to determine the strongest taxonomic approach based on biological characteristics. We seek a rational classification of psychotic disorders that will be successful in identifying novel disease targets and treatments approaches."

"9377578","PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is a non-pharmacologic, complementary and integrative health mind and body intervention that is widely used to treat chronic pain. However, the mechanism of analgesic action of SMT is not understood. Information is particularly sparse with respect to neuropathic pain, which exerts devastating personal and socioeconomic burdens. Pharmacological agents are the mainstay of symptoms management for neuropathic pain, but relief is weak and temporary, often associated with major adverse outcomes. For example, there is an epidemic of opiate addiction, abuse, and overdose. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we have developed an innovative rat model of a frequently used non-thrust SMT technique, low velocity variable amplitude spinal manipulation (LVVA-SM). Our preliminary data in a well-characterized rat model of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain (spared nerve injury) indicate that LVVA-SM (10 min, 0.16Hz, 20° flexion, at the L5 vertebra) administered with our custom-made motorized device decreases behavioral signs of chronic pain (hindpaw mechanical allodynia). Our long-term goal is to determine the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this anti-allodynic effect of LVVA-SM. This R15 application proposes to leverage a multidisciplinary collaboration to characterize LVVA-SM-induced anti-allodynia (Aim 1) and then to determine whether this is mediated by endogenous activation of cannabinoid receptors in the spinal cord dorsal horn (Aim 2), an important site of nociceptive transmission. The project is directly relevant to the chiropractic profession's interest in taking an evidence-based approach to treating chronic pain and strengthening Palmer College of Chiropractic's research environment. The goals of the R15 program are strongly aligned with Palmer's research mission, namely to conduct meritorious research on SMT and provide an opportunity for students to learn about biomedical research through mentored hands-on participation. If successful, this project will provide clinicians with potentially translatable data that will improve the rationale for and the efficacy of SMT."

"9279124","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in blood glucose control, the continually rising incidence of diabetes leads to an ever- increasing burden of disease complications. Major limitations to treatment include inability to bioengineer beta cell replacement for both type 1 and 2 diabetes, as well as to monitor and image the development of the disease, and to engineer repair of diabetic tissues. Such advances depend on innovations and discoveries throughout the physical and biological sciences, and the ability to bring these advances to the relevant clinical problems. The following examples describe current relevant challenges that are intimately dependent on advances in basic and translational sciences. (1) Progress in cell therapy and tissue engineering promises major breakthroughs in repair of diabetic tissues, but model systems as well as noninvasive imaging of potential replacement cells will be needed to ascertain delivery to target sites. (2) Novel and hybrid imaging systems need to be developed, including microscopic and macroscopic approaches such as PET and optical or photoacoustic imaging are needed to gain deeper and finer assessment of tissue pathologies. (3) Nanoparticles with multimodality imaging capabilities and drug payloads need to be optimized and moved into clinical trials. To transform diabetes outcomes, these and other challenges must be met by interdisciplinary teams of engineers, physicists, computer scientists, biologists, and physicians working together at the interfaces between biology, technology, and medicine. This program seeks to enable these processes, in order to bring advances in technology and engineering to bear on the challenges of research and translation to improved therapeutic outcome, by training a new generation of researchers with strength in physical science and engineering, and with intimate exposure to and involvement in relevant areas of biomedical research. Dually mentored pre-Doctoral and post-Doctoral researchers will develop and apply novel imaging, modeling (both computational and experimental) and engineering approaches to key questions in diabetes and associated pathologies."

This training program builds on an established program with a strong track record of meeting the NIEHS mission to train the next generation of scientists to protect public health by connecting scientific advances to environmental exposures and consequent disease processes."
"9320713","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer."

"9385226","PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol use and risk for alcohol-related harm is prevalent in adolescence and young adulthood (i.e., age 12- 25), and this is also a critical time in human brain development. In response to RFA-AA-17-004, this application proposes the Administrative Resource (AR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence second phase (NCANDA-2), located at UC San Diego. The overarching consortium goals are to determine the predictors and effects of heavy alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood in a demographically representative sample of adolescents. This consortium was designed to synergize the diverse scientific expertise and research experience of the investigators at each site. This consortium reflects seven applications: NCANDA - Administrative Resource (UCSD) and NCANDA - Data Analysis Resource (SRI), and five cross-national Research Project Sites, located at Duke University (Duke), Oregon Health Science University (OHSU), University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), SRI International (SRI), and UC San Diego (UCSD). Recruited at ages 12 through 21 across the five sites, a high-risk enhanced community sample of 831 subjects completed a baseline assessment and three annual follow-up assessments in an accelerated longitudinal design. NCANDA-2 will continue to follow this cohort through the typical age of lifetime peak drinking, using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, behavioral interviews, biospecimen collection, and technology- enhanced assessment in the natural environment. Examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in self-regulation and reward response, and appear vulnerable to neurotoxic effects of alcohol. Five aims specified in the RFA will be systematically tested with a focus on adolescent substance use and neuromaturational trajectories. Each Research Project Site collaborates with another site on 1-2 additional aims. UCSD, OHSU, and Duke are examining brain recovery in heavy drinkers over 4 weeks of monitored abstinence. Pitt and SRI collaborate to study relations between heavy drinking, sleep characteristics, and brain development. We are examining the influence of heavy drinking on inhibitory dysfunction and the extent to which this mediates cognitive performance, using longitudinal fMRI connectivity analysis during anti-saccade (Pitt, Duke) and Stroop match-to-sample (SRI and UCSD) tasks. With the additional development-specific longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain, and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder or other adverse life outcome."
"9277346","ABSTRACT ? RESOURCE CORE (RC) 3 The goals of the Biostatistics and Data Management Core [(BDMC, henceforth termed Research Core (RC)-3)] are to provide: 1) biostatistical support and expertise; and 2) centralized research information services to ensure ready access and superior data quality to the OAIC. The Core will greatly facilitate data sharing and integrated analyses within the OAIC. Importantly, RC3 develops and implements services not available elsewhere at UTHSCSA. Instead, it will capitalize on the aging-related biostatistical and informatics expertise of the Core team. RC3 provides three innovative and value-added features. (1) To further improve biostatistics support specifically applicable for aging research, Dr. Gelfond (Core Leader) will develop new statistical methods related to survival analysis, latent trajectory models, and comparative genomics in collaboration with OAIC investigators. Dr. Gelfond has substantial experience in directing and developing statistical analyses as well as collaborative experience with key OAIC supported faculty. These new methods are motivated by and required for optimal analyses of the developmental and pilot project data. All these methods will have broader applications in aging research. (2) The Core supports an innovative informatics Developmental Project (DP3) that will identify cohorts within the local community that can be well-suited for clinical trials focused on aging research. Additionally, DP3 will provide access to extensively and appropriately phenotyped de-identified data from UTHSCSA-affiliated clinics that will be available for retrospective studies. (3) The Core will utilize novel collaborative models, developed by the Core Leader, which will promote efficient operations and help track research productivity outcomes, such as publications and funded proposals. The RC3 has four achievable Specific Aims: 1) Provide all biostatistical support and expertise for the OAIC, including study design and planning; protocol development; creation of new analytical approaches; interpretation of study results; and preparation of reports, manuscripts, and presentations; 2) Provide OAIC projects and investigators with state-of-the-art research informatics tools for development of cohorts for trials with aging outcomes, de-identified data to support pilot data for clinical trials development, and tools for efficient clinical trial data collection and management; 3) Contribute expertise, didactics, and hands-on training for analyses of data specific to aging research, as well as education and mentorship of OAIC trainees; and 4) Ensure the success of the Core, continually assess Core utilization and quality, assess research standards and Core outcomes, and leverage assessments for Aims 1, 2, and 3."
"9342890","PROJECT SUMMARY In mammals, the circadian oscillator has emerged as a critical orchestrator of metabolism and energy homeostasis. Importantly, circadian dysfunction due to environmental factors commonly found in modern lifestyles (jet lag, rotating shift work, artificially-extended photoperiod, western diets) has been linked to weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. An important connection between the circadian clock and energy metabolism occurs at the level of epigenetic control. However, how the clock bears upon genomic regulation of energy homeostasis through epigenetic mechanisms is not fully understood. In particular, the effects that chronodisruption and western-style diets have on the function of epigenetic regulators and the mechanisms by which they, in turn, contribute to the development of metabolic disease remains unknown. We previously described the JmjC-class lysine demethylase JARID1a as a non-redundant component of the circadian oscillator. Recently, we have observed that liver-specific ablation of JARID1a results in disruptions to glucose metabolism. This proposal uses a combination of novel tissue-specific genetic murine models, light-dark schedule and dietary manipulations, molecular biology techniques, and genomic approaches to characterize JARID1a as a novel epigenetic link between chronodisruptive environmental variables and metabolic dysfunction. Based on preliminary data, this proposal tests the central hypothesis that JARID1a is an epigenetic link between the circadian clock and genomic regulation of glucose metabolism through opposing modulation of the transcription factors CREB and ChREBP, and whose dysfunction disrupts glucose homeostasis. In our first aim, we interrogate the impact of a high-fat diet, fatty acids, fasting, acute feeding, chronodisrupted light schedules, and metabolic signaling pathways on JARID1a function. In our second aim, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which JARID1a regulates energy metabolism through opposing control of two important regulators of glucose homeostasis: the transcription factors CREB and ChREBP."
"9304046","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limitations in disease outcomes for HIV/AIDS are influenced by poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and inadequate drug penetrance into viral reservoirs (gut, lymph node and central nervous system). The need for lifelong daily regimens, pill fatigue, co-morbid diseases, substance abuse and inherent drug toxicities often affect adherence to drug regimens. When suboptimal adherence occurs, it results in accelerated rates of human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) mutation and consequent disease progression. We posit that the emergence of long-acting nanoformulated ART (nanoART) can positively impact these limitations. In order to move our work beyond the laboratory bench to clinical use, we propose a series of next step investigations to firmly establish the cell-based carriage system for nanoART that began four years ago. Such a system for drug delivery has been demonstrated to be a highly efficient means to generate ART depots that limit tissue and cell toxicities positively affecting immune and viral parameters. These were now demonstrated for Cabotegravir, a long-acting injectable integrase inhibitor made by GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals that is being tested in phase II investigations for a once every two-month dose. We posit that this and other antiretrovirals can be packaged into targeted nanoparticles to both improve drug biodistribution, dose frequency and concentration for up to six months. Indeed, preliminary data supports this contention and its promise seen in animal models of HIV/AIDS. These include rodents and rhesus macaques. We posit that such a drug delivery system can inevitably revolutionize ART treatment and potentially eliminate conventional therapeutic regimens. To such ends, we have built a highly integrative and cross-disciplinary research program. We have shown previously that a single dose of targeted nanoART can produce high-sustained tissue and plasma drug levels in the reticuloendothelial system (RES; lymphoid tissues, liver and brain). Notably, such formulations have shown long-lived drug depots in monocyte-macrophages within the RES. NanoART can be taken up within minutes by circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages and released in tissues over a period of months. Our partners in the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Pharmacy (Project 1. T. Bronich and Core B, Y. Alnouti) will be joined with UNMC College of Medicine Departments of Radiology (Project 3, M. Boska) and Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience (Project 2, H. Gendelman; Core C, L. Poluektova and H. Fox), and The Scripps Research Institute (Project 3, G. Siuzdak) to optimize the formulations and better appreciate its toxicology profiles. This can  now be facilitated through integrated cell biologic, pharmacologic, virologic, and molecular testing to translate the technologies to the patient bedside (Core A, H. Gendelman, R.L. Mosley and J. McMillan). The research takes advantage of the newly minted Nebraska Nanomedicine Production Plant with broad resources in medicinal and polymer chemistry, molecular bioimaging, and pharmaceutics."

Such studies are made possible by the unique medical-records linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) infrastructure, through which complete information (inpatient and outpatient) on medical care of OC residents is available. We will further strengthen our interpretation of results from these large cohort studies by directly measuring bone density and microstructure as well as performing comprehensive assessments of additional risk factors for fractures in the relavent population groups being studied in each Aim. In Aim 1, we will focus on updating the fracture risk in a common age-related comorbid condition, heart failure (HF), given recent data suggesting that HF patients on ?-blockers (which recently has become the standard-of-care) may, in fact, now be protected against low bone density and fractures. By performing a comprehensive evaluation of fracture risk in individuals with chronic HF in the era of widespread ?-blocker therapy, we will address the central theme of this PPG, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) control of bone metabolism, and complement the work being performed by the other Projects in this PPG, which are evaluating the detrimental effects on bone of increased sympathetic activation (also an underlying mechanism for HF) and potential beneficial effects of ?-blockers (which antagonize sympathetic activation) on bone metabolism. In Aim 2, we will expand on our prior work by now performing a systematic examination of all comorbid conditions in older OC residents in order to improve fracture risk assessment. Using innovative analytic techniques, we will describe the emergence and interrelation of multiple comorbidities with aging and test whether specific fractures are preceded by different comorbidity clusters, and specifically examine how they may affect bone density. These population-based studies will fill important gaps in our knowledge and provide novel insights on age-related fracture risk."
"9316498","The main goal of the Research Development Core (Core B) of the proposed UAB Nathan Shock Center (NSC) is to identify, attract and support promising junior investigators in the field of energetics, healthspan and basic aging biology. A secondary goal is to attract established investigators from allied biomedical disciplines to the field. The Core pursue these goals by: (1) advertising broadly for proposals for Pilot and/or Feasibility (P/F) studies in comparative energetics of aging from investigators from a diversity of disciplines; (2) developing a review system that ensures optimal use of the UAB NSC's research cores; (3) promoting interdisciplinary activities that leverage resources from a range of fields at UAB; (4) providing mentoring and support for the Pilot/Feasibility grant awardees; (5) identifying P/F proposals exploring promising areas of research or seeking to address controversial areas in the basic biology of aging; (6) regularly evaluating the performance of the P/F program and making adjustments in policies and procedures as needed; and (7) facilitating synergy and collaboration among awardees and other basic aging researchers. The Core proposes a targeted P/F granting program with the intent of translating these projects into the external funding via the NIA, NIH or other funding mechanisms. Core grants will provide both funding and subsidized access to the resources of the research Cores of the UAB NSC. The Core leaders and the Center Director will also provide a structured mentoring program to ensure that junior investigators are provided with intellectual and strategic support from projection inception through publication and application for external funding. An important area of funding will be the development of innovative approaches with exceptional promise to advance energetics, healthspan and aging research. A novel aspect to Core B will be the establishment of a Named New Investigator (NNI) each year. NNI selection is based on the standard NIH peer-review criteria plus the expected impact of the research in the field of aging and energetics The Grant funding will leverage institutional and UAB-NSC resources to publicize and communicate grantee results across academic disciplines and to a broad range of audiences (see Research Strategy, Administrative Core). These activities will support the professional development of junior faculty beyond research competence alone. The effectiveness of Core B will be evaluated by grantees and their mentors and by tracking the publications, grants and awards associated with funded projects."
"9315084","Project Summary Influenza A pneumonia is the most common cause of death from an infectious agent in older patients. While the lung is the primary target of the influenza A virus, the resulting illness is characterized by dysfunction in multiple organs. Skeletal muscle weakness is an important manifestation of the systemic consequences of influenza A virus infection (IAV) and is manifest in approximately half of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit with respiratory failure. This weakness can persist for years after hospital discharge and it is a major contributor to morbidity. We present preliminary data suggesting that endocrine signals released from the injured lung both induce and protect against skeletal muscle dysfunction during influenza A infection. We hypothesize that the frailty of the proteostasis networks in the muscles of aged mice shifts this balance, resulting in enhanced skeletal muscle dysfunction. Thus, we propose via three interrelated aims, to elucidate the signaling pathways regulating skeletal muscle degradation and proteostasis during influenza A pneumonia: in Specific Aim # 1, we propose to determine whether influenza A infection causes disruption in muscle proteostasis via IL-6, STAT3, FOXO3 and atrogin1 dependent degradation of skeletal muscle; in Specific Aim # 2, we propose to assess whether in aged mice influenza A infection causes AMPK activation and thus inhibition of mTOR which leads to impaired proliferation/differentiation of satellite cells and recovery and in Specific Aim # 3, we will determine whether modulating the chaperone response can improve muscle function in aged mice. We have conducted experiments for each of the specific aims, and the preliminary data support the feasibility of this proposal. Completion of the proposed research will provide novel, clinically relevant information regarding the effects of influenza A infection on myoproteostasis. This novel information is of biologic and clinical relevance and should lead to the design of innovative approaches to improve proteostasis and skeletal muscle function in older patients with influenza A infection."
"9369689","The Stem Cells, Differentiation and Cancer Program evolved from the former Cell Growth and Differentiation  Control Program with the inclusion of scientists from the former Immuno-oncology program that study B cell biology  and lymphoid malignancies. The program was further strengthened by the formation of a Stem Cell Institute at  Einstein with the recruitment of four cancer stem cell investigators. There are three major research themes that  partially overlap: the myeloid leukemias, lymphoid malignancies and stem cell biology, with a continued emphasis  on regulation at the transcriptional level. While there is a focus on hematological malignancies, the stem cell  research extends to hepatic, neural, and mammary stem cells. Dr. E. Richard Stanley is leader of this newly  configured program. The appointment of Dr. Amit Verma, physician scientist, as Co-Program leader and the  establishment of a Hematological Malignancies Working Group has catalyzed translation and increased the  number of correlative and therapeutic clinical studies. The goals of this program are: (i) to understand the  molecular events that occur during the normal differentiation of stem cell progenitors into their mature counterparts;  (ii) to identify the aberrations that occur in transcriptional programming that result in the malignant phenotype with a  special, but not sole, focus on the hematopoietic malignancies; (iii) to identify molecules that are novel therapeutic  targets, indicators of aggressiveness of disease or reporters of response to treatment; (iv) to translate laboratory  research findings into correlative and, ultimately, therapeutic trials and to enhance the effectiveness of clinical  regimens with existing and new chemotherapeutics and biologicals; and (v) to encourage those Program members  who share a common interest in stem cells, cellular programming, and their relationship to cancer to collaborate  with each other and with the members of other programs. Human tissue research has been facilitated by the  acquisition of two FACS Sorter Biosafety systems dedicated to this program, a Human Pluripotent Stem Cell  Center for the development and analysis of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells that comprises a  stem cell preparation unit, a cell sorting and xenotransplantation unit, and a stem cell bioinformatics unit. There are  currently 31 program members of whom 30 are primary; nine are new recruits to Einstein. Research is supported  by 12 NCI grants ($2.66M DC) and 28 other cancer-relevant peer reviewed grants ($5.35M DC). Since 2008, there  have been 364 cancer-relevant publications by members of this program, of which 16% represent intra- and 17%  represent inter-programmatic collaborations."
"9395470","ABSTRACT A fundamental outstanding question in cellular development remains how epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are coordinated during development and their role in disease. Genome structure and topology, local chromatin landscape, and non-coding RNAs all contribute to epigenetic transcriptional regulation. Moreover, alterations in these elements or factors can perturb gene expression and promote disease pathogenesis, as shown for B cell lymphoma (Koues et al, Immunity 2015). While the general principles of these mechanisms are widely accepted, the specific identity and interplay of these elements at individual gene loci is largely unknown. Therefore, the proposed studies will define regulatory interactions at a single locus containing two genes that are essential for normal immune function and, when deregulated, promote auto-immunity or cancer. FAIM3 (TOSO, FCMR) is an IgM receptor expressed in innate and adaptive immune cells, and PIGR encodes the IgA receptor and secreted IgA in mucosal epithelial cells. Importantly, preliminary studies show that regulatory elements and a lncRNA in this locus are deregulated in B cell lymphomas and leukemia. By elucidating the regulatory mechanisms that control expression of these genes in a cell-specific manner, the key elements necessary for lineage specificity and how these regulatory mechanisms are corrupted in lymphoid cancers will be revealed. Aim 1 will define the genomic organization and 3-dimensional structure of the locus. In addition, Aim 1 studies will determine the contribution of regulatory elements to maintaining this structure and transcriptional control of FAIM3, PIGR, and neighboring genes. Aim 2 will elucidate the transcription factors that serve as key regulators of FAIM3 and PIGR and determine how genetic polymorphisms and mutations alter this regulation through perturbation of transcription factor binding. Aim 3 will characterize a novel long non-coding RNA, confirming its full sequence, verifying its exonic structure, and determining whether it contributes to the transcriptional control of FAIM3 or PIGR. Upon completion of these studies, the regulatory elements and mechanisms that control the cell-specific expression of FAIM3 and PIGR will be defined, as will how these genes are altered in lymphoid cancer. The impact of these studies will reach beyond a single gene locus, by providing a window into the intricate interplay of epigenetic and genetic mechanisms of gene regulation and deregulation in normal development and cancer."
"9344645","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in light and electron microscopy, along with new probes and labeling methods for cellular and molecular imaging, are driving a revolutionary expansion in biomedical research activities that involve exploration of complex biological systems. These new capabilities in instruments and methods are providing nearly seamless views across multiple scales of resolution of biological specimens.  At the same time, researchers are increasingly generating extremely large and diverse datasets of enormous value, which are driving renewed demand for software and tools to facilitate aggregation, curation, refinement, and spatial and semantic assembly of these data. A key consumer of these data is the computational modeling and simulations community, which requires more accurate in-silico representations of supramolecular complexes and organelles in the context of complete cells and cells deployed in tissues to better model the impact of molecular changes found in diseases on the functioning of a cell.  Building on prior success, we propose to continue to support, maintain, and extend the capabilities of the Cell Centered Database, which we have recently renamed the Cell Image Library (CIL). The CIL is a cell- centered community repository for storing, managing, and sharing multi-scale microscopy data encompassing cellular networks, cellular and subcellular microdomains, and their macromolecular components. The CIL is comprised of software for researchers to upload, organize, process, and share project data prior to publication. It also provides a searchable, public-facing website for users to disseminate their results and openly distribute their data for reuse by others.  Our extended development plans include integration of computational workflows to facilitate generation of fully segmented, 3D structural models ready for meshing, discretization, and use in assembling more complete, realistic, and accurate models for simulations. We will also harden and extend our unique capabilities for supporting large data, in particular massive individual 3D datasets, to enable biomedical researchers to not only store, but to process and visualize their data at scale with tools that are easy to use and easily accessible."

"9294956","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of disease, with an especially high burden in infants. Disease severity is variable; it can range from mild upper respiratory tract infections to debilitating bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, respiratory collapse, and death. While nearly all children will be infected by the age of 3, our ability to tret RSV is very limited. The treatment options are primarily supportive to prevent respiratory failure or major organ dysfunction. Widely available, cost-effective preventative options are also lacking. The only FDA-approved prevention for RSV infection is palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the RSV fusion protein. While effective, this therapy is prohibitively expensive for general use. Due to the frequency and severity of infection, the development of new therapeutics is of high importance. Many of the hallmark clinical features associated with severe disease may actually be due to inappropriate immune responses to the virus. Therefore, successful rational design of new therapeutics and preventative treatments is dependent upon a more comprehensive understanding of the immune response to RSV. Specifically, both mucus production and increased airway responsiveness, primary culprits in airway obstruction and respiratory failure, are mediated by interleukin 13 (IL-13) signaling. A major source of IL-13 is T helper 2 (Th2) cells. During RSV infection, mature IL-13-producingTh2 cells begin to populate the lungs around one week post infection. However, preliminary data show significant IL-13 accumulation in the lungs as early as 4 days after infection, suggesting involvement of additional sources of IL-13. In other pulmonary disease models that are characterized by mucus production and airway responsiveness, such as asthma, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) have been implicated as a major early source of IL-13. Preliminary data demonstrate a 10-fold increase in the total number of lung ILC2s 4 days after RSV infection. Lung ILC2s can be stimulated by the cytokine interleukin 33 (IL-33) signaling through its receptor ST2. Preliminary data show significant, early increases in IL-33 protein and mRNA in the lungs after RSV infection. Collectively, these data strongly suggest a role for IL-33-stimulated ILC2s in contributing to airway dysfunction during RSV infection. Experiments using mice deficient in either IL- 33 or its receptor ST2 will be used to determine the effect of this signaling axis on ILC2 proliferation and IL-13 expression. Additionally, the capacity of RSV-infected human airway epithelial cells to produce IL-33 will be determined to provide a direct translational component to this work. Finally, experiments using various depletions of Th2 and/or ILC2s will be performed to evaluate the ability of ILC2s to contribute to mucus production and airway responsiveness. These proposed studies will determine a previously unknown role for IL-33 and ILC2s in RSV-induced airway dysfunction. This knowledge will be paradigm-shifting in the field of RSV immunology and will suggest new targetable pathways for RSV therapeutics."
"9348397","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability for children in the U.S. Disability after TBI is higher among children with no or government insurance, poor family functioning and lower levels of parental education. In a preliminary study, we documented disparities in long term disability after TBI for Hispanic children; Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children experience significantly larger reductions in health related quality of life, participation in activities, and ability to communicate and care for themselves 3 years after injury. It is unclear if use of rehabilitation services and/or cultural and language barriers contributed to the documented differences. We propose a three-phase research plan to compare patterns and determinants of utilization of rehabilitation services and its association with disability outcomes between Hispanic, NHW and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children. We will also develop and pilot-test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. The long term goal of this K23 award is for the candidate to develop as an independent researcher in the area of patient outcomes in vulnerable populations and pediatric trauma disparities research. The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Washington. The candidate proposes a five-year training plan with the support of faculty mentors who have expertise in injury outcomes research, community based participatory research, qualitative methods, and intervention trials in minority communities. The University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center provide excellent institutional support and resources for this award. The research involves three studies. Study 1 will compare use of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services between Hispanic, NHB and NHW pediatric patients with TBI, and its association with disability. Study 2 will compare predisposing enabling and need factors for use of outpatient rehabilitation services between the three ethnic groups. Study 3 will develop and pilot-test a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers fr use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. These studies will expand our understanding of the potential reasons for disparities in the provision of care for children with TBI. It will clarify the role of Hispanic ethnicity in the receipt of rehabilitation care and highe risk of disability after TBI, independent of socioeconomic and minority status. It will lay the groundwork for a multicenter study to evaluate a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic families, which can also serve as a model for other vulnerable populations."
"9319289","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Biophysics Training Program (BTP) at Yale is to equip pre-doctoral trainees with the practical skills and intellectual development necessary to perform a lifetime of research with impact across a range of vital, biomedical topics. These topics are rooted in the interests of a set of faculty linking the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry (MB&B). Our 33 trainers are joined by a shared fascination in developing biological insights at the molecular level with particular attention to structure, energy and dynamics. The milieus under which insights are developed range from synthetic model systems to whole animal studies with published cross talk that spans this range. Our students benefit from world-class expertise in structural biology, optical and magnetic spectroscopies, physical chemistry, computational chemistry and cryo-electron microscopy. The structure of our program and the skills of our Mentors develop in our students rigor, independence and creativity. We aspire and succeed in producing adventurous graduates who push at the frontiers of Biophysics to become the next generation of leaders in their fields. The importance of biophysics to biomedical research has grown and become increasingly dynamic. This is evident at Yale and specifically in this proposal by our greatly increased number of faculty mentors who also hold appointments in, for example, Pathology, Genetics, Pharmacology, Physics, Mechanical and Chemical Engineering. Admissions of trainees to the MB&B Department now take place through a newly formed umbrella cross-departmental track, the Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology (BBSB). This track was forged in recognition of the presence of Biophysical excellence among mentors in many departments and has greatly increased our student pool. The pool of trainees coming to the two departments of this program have backgrounds that span biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, synthetic and physical chemistry, physics and mathematics. Students fulfill curricular requirements in their first year and perform three lab rotations. These requirements are augmented with qualifying exams that compel a student to independently define a research project and defend it orally to a faculty panel. The dissertation is then given oversight by a committee of three faculty mentors who hold regular formal meetings with the trainee. We propose support for our students in their second and/or third year of graduate school after the dissertation focus becomes clear. The BTP establishes programmatic identity and greatly facilitates interactions between the two departments by several routes. This includes shared curriculum elements, rotations and joint activities such as monthly student research talks, hosting of visiting eminent speakers and a newly established retreat/symposium. These provisions, combined with the strong intellectual and material resources of the trainers, enable the BTP to produce world-class graduates."
"9285874","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) and hemorrhagic stroke are a particularly fatal form of stroke and an important cause of long-term disability. This is especially true when they affect children and young adults. Effective treatments for hemorrhagic stroke are limited, and so ICH prevention is paramount for reducing the impact of this debilitating condition. However, preventative therapies often require an understanding of the pathogenic mechanism underlying ICH. Genetic studies have successfully defined the etiologies of some forms of ICH, however there is still a tremendous unmet need in determining the underlying causes of most forms of CVD. We have discovered that mutations in type IV collagen alpha 1 (COL4A1) cause a broad spectrum of highly penetrant cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs), including peri-natal stroke, congenital porencephaly, leukoencephalopathy, cerebral microbleeds, intracranial aneurysm, and ICH. In addition to multiple reports of COL4A1 mutations causing dominantly inherited CVD, our recent data suggest that 5-10% of patients suffering from sporadic ICHs have mutations in COL4A1 or its paralog COL4A2. Thus, according to American Heart Association estimates, mutations in COL4A1 and COL4A2 could cause up to 12,000 new cases of spontaneous ICH in the United States each year and 300,000 cases worldwide. Here we use novel genetic models of CVD to identify distinct roles for COL4A1 in vascular development and maintenance. Using genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches we will directly test the regulation by COL4A1 of fundamental cell- signaling pathways that are critical for normal vascular development. Finally, we will use novel pre-clinical models of human CVD that we have generated to identify therapeutics that may be developed for use in patients and that may reduce their risk of suffering debilitating or fatal ICHs."
"9316406","SUMMARY - HEALTHSPAN AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT CORE The Healthspan and Functional Assessment Core (Healthspan Core) supports the overall mission of the San Antonio (SA) Nathan Shock Center to enable research that will expand our understanding of mechanisms of aging and of age-associated disease, in order to accelerate the development of novel strategies and the identification of (pharmacological) targets to extend healthy life extectancy. The Core provides services to the scientific community on the selection, design, and performance of a wide array of functional assays in mice, rats, and now also in naked mole-rats and marmosets, to elucidate mechanisms that control age-related changes in function at the tissue, organ, and whole body levels in the context of normal aging and in relation to age-related diseases. The Core measures bioenergetics and metabolism, mitochondrial function, body composition, exercise function/tolerance, cardiovascular function, muscle strength/contractility/fatigue, locomotor and neuromotor function, and cognitive/brain health in mice, rats, naked mole-rats and marmoset models, and tests/validates and develops innovative measures of resilience and frailty in both mice and marmosets. Since its creation in 2010, the Healthspan Core has served 21 investigators, many repeat users, and contributed to 50 publications and 19 funded plus 6 pending grant proposals. Examples of discoveries made with support from the Healthspan Core include the first demonstration of mechanisms of maintenance of cardiac function during aging in naked mole-rats; a genetic demonstration of the inverse relationship between insulin sensitivity and longevity in mice; the first studies demonstrating beneficial immune, cognitive, and vascular effects of TOR inhibition by rapamycin, the first drug proven to extend lifespan in mammals; and the first demonstration that rapamycin can be administered efficaciously to marmosets. The Healthspan Core will build on its successful track record, supported by the expertise of investigators who have led the Core since its inception. The Specific Aims of the Healthspan Core are: 1) To assist investigators with the design of experiments and the selection of tests to measure age-associated functional changes; 2) To carry out functional assessments, data collection and analyses; 3) To test and validate measures of frailty in mice and develop novel resilience/frailty measures in marmosets; 4) To expand the impact of the Core through education of researchers on concepts and tools of the field and through hands-on training. The Healthspan Core will contribute to the Center's mission to facilitate transformative research in aging biology through a comprehensive research platform that is unique in the aging research community, able to longitudinally study and integrate longevity (lifespan), physiological (healthspan), pathological, and molecular phenotypes. By the end of the funding cycle, we expect that the Core will have significantly contributed to the identification of novel molecular and cellular mechanisms that influence aging, consequently enabling the development of novel strategies and (pharmacological) targets to extend healthy lifespan."
"9264579","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In our proposed study, SBHW-PREDICT (The role of PRoteomics, gEnetics, and Directed Imaging using CT), we will assess whether identification of at-risk individuals, using imaging markers, a biomarker profile or a combination of the two, improves reclassification and discrimination over traditional risk factors, particularly in those wth either a family history of coronary heart disease (CHD) or higher genetic predisposition for CHD. We have used data from 1312 participants of the first NIH-funded study of predictive value of CAC, the South Bay Heart Watch (SBHW) study, to calculate plaque density. In preliminary analyses, we have found that higher plaque density is related to lower incidence of CVD events in this cohort. In the proposed study, we will use serum and cell samples collected at baseline, 20 years ago, from the SBHW and retrospectively assess outcomes using administrative data from Medicare and the National Death Index to address the following aims and objectives: 1) Using Medicare Claims and National Death Index data assess prognostic value of baseline CAC, as well as coronary calcium density for long-term (20 year) CHD event rate; 2) Using serum and cell samples collected at baseline, assess whether a multi-biomarker approach using circulating markers from different biological pathways would have additional reclassification value over traditional risk factors; 3) Determine whether compared to family history a CHD genetic risk score is more predictive of events; and 4) Determine whether a genetic score modifies the prognostic value of an imaging marker (CAC) or a multiple biomarker score or a combination of the two in those at higher predisposition (based on either family history or genetic score) for CHD versus those at low genetic risk. The experience of our multidisciplinary research team, unique 20 year follow-up period after baseline CAC, linkage to Medicare claims data and Death Index data, genetic and biomarker profiles using frozen serum and cell samples, and follow-up of the original cohort survivors are major strengths of this proposal. Results of thi project will assess the utility of a complementary genetic marker, multi-biomarker, and imaging approach to risk assessment."
"9328764","Project Summary / Abstract In this R13 application we request support for a new Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on ?Neurobiology of Drug Addiction,? which will take place in July 2017 in Hong Kong, China. The objectives of this GRC are to foster open discussion of novel research developments, build new collaborations, and propel the next generation of scientific advances in addiction research. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following four specific aims at the meeting: 1) Provide an international forum to brainstorm about cutting edge, multidisciplinary research at the forefront of drug addiction; 2) Introduce breakthrough neuroscientific techniques that facilitate the understanding of brain mechanisms driving compulsive drug use and relapse; 3) Promote interactions among young and senior investigators, and exchange of ideas that will shape the future directions of addiction neuroscience; 4) Foster development of the next generation of addiction researchers by encouraging the participation of students and postdoctoral fellows who are committed to addiction research. The conference focuses on presentations and discussions at the frontiers of addiction research. The scope of the lectures will be confined to basic and clinical studies involving addictive drugs (including alcohol) and the nervous system, and will focus on mechanisms of compulsive drug use and relapse. The meeting will also break down barriers to progress by uniting investigators with synergistic and complementary expertise in areas ranging from molecular mechanisms to translational clinical research. The conference will provide a forum to address the latest developments in addiction research in an open and highly interactive GRC format, which includes formal talks interspersed with ample discussion time, poster sessions, and informal discussion periods that cultivate communication and collaborations. This conference setup differs from that of other meetings in the field, and will provide a unique opportunity for close interactions among investigators at all stages of their careers and among investigators with different research approaches and cultural perspectives. Concerted efforts to support participation of students, postdoctoral fellows, young investigators, and under-represented minorities will nurture the growth of the next generation of addiction researchers. We envision that the Neurobiology of Drug Addiction GRC will significantly advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying drug addiction and stimulate the development of effective therapeutic approaches for addiction treatment."
"9336968","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Available treatments for schizophrenia are not effective in treatment of all major symptoms associated with the disease and induce a number of dose-limiting adverse effects. Thus, there is a critical need to develop novel therapeutic agents for treatment of schizophrenia that have broader efficacy and fewer adverse effects. During the initial funding period of the Vanderbilt NCDDG for discovery of novel treatments for schizophrenia, we made tremendous progress in discovery of drug candidates for novel targets and partnering with pharmaceutical companies to advance these agents to clinical development. In addition, we built on previous clinical studies suggesting that selective activators of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor have potential for treatment of cognitive disturbances and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. We optimized novel highly selective M1 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and have extensively evaluated these compounds in animal models of cognitive function and in pre-GLP safety studies. We have identified VU0467319 as a highly optimized M1 PAM that possesses an excellent balance of properties required for selection as a clinical development candidate. We now propose continued support of the Vanderbilt NCDDG to advance VU0467319 into first in human studies and to rigorously establish the doses required to achieve activation of M1 in healthy human volunteers. Project 1 will develop and validate a new translational biomarker for M1 PAM activity that can be used as a surrogate for target engagement and dose-finding studies in early clinical development. Project 2 will provide scale-up synthesis of VU0467319 and other compounds and provide backup clinical candidates to respond to findings with VU0467319 during GLP safety assessment. Project 3 will focus on IND-enabling studies to open an IND to allow clinical evaluation of VU0467319. In Project 4, we will perform safety assessments of VU0467319 in healthy human volunteers and employ the biomarker developed in project 1 to establish the doses required to achieve adequate CNS activity in humans. In addition, project 4 will provide a preliminary assessment of effects of VU0467319 on cognitive function in humans. These studies will provide a fully validated clinical research tool for future clinical studies to fully evaluate the efficacy of a highly optimized M1 PAM in schizophrenia patients."
"9382468","PROJECT SUMMARY During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals reporting binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation spanning into the mid-20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. In response to RFA-AA-17-003, this application proposes a Research Project Site of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence second phase (NCANDA-2) to determine the predictors and effects of heavy alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. To achieve this, the Pittsburgh site of NCANDA-2 will continue to follow a cohort of 125 Pittsburgh-area (n=831 across all 5 sites) participants (ages 12-21 at baseline first visit) to acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use during adolescence on the adult brain. NCANDA-2 will use multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, behavioral assessment, biospecimen collection, and ecological momentary assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to neurotoxic effects of alcohol. In addition, the Pittsburgh site will collaborate with the SRI sites to study sleep-related predictors and effects of alcohol use in a subgroup of adolescents. Pittsburgh will also collaborate with the Duke site to collect the Rewarded Antisaccade fMRI task to evaluate changes in the reward and cognitive control systems in relationship to alcohol use. Sex differences in development, alcohol use patterns, impact of alcohol use on the brain, and sex-differentiating psychosocial factors (e.g., depression symptoms) will be considered in analyses. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain, and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder."
"9307590","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the investigation of the mechanisms behind gene regulation and its impact on diseases, two lines of research have been largely separately carried out in recent years. On the one hand, gene regulatory networks and protein interaction networks have been under extensive study, especially in systems biology, where genetic variation is usually ignored. On the other hand, mutations, indels (insertions and deletions), and copy number variants have been identified for many diseases in genome-wide association studies. It is therefore of immense interest to understand how genetic variation influences disease through gene regulatory networks. To construct these networks, at least three key pieces of information are important: gene expression, transcription factor binding, and genotypes (especially at expression quantitative trait loci; that is, eQTLs). In particular, the later two enable causal inference in the network construction, although how to use them in a probabilistic and rigorous way has not been systematically explored. With my extensive experience in Bayesian statistics, I aim to develop statistical models and efficient computational strategies, drawing on recent advances in graphical models and causal inference, to construct causal regulatory networks involving genetic variation and TF binding. I will use breast cancer as a disease model and apply the proposed methodologies to different subtypes. Topological features of the inferred regulatory networks may suggest potentially different mechanisms in breast cancer subtypes. With the proposed research, I will not only develop general analysis methodologies to integrate various types of high-throughput genomics data and provide open-source software, but also establish their relevance to disease studies. With solid training in theoretical and applied statistics, as well as extensive experience collaborating with experimental biologists and working with a variety of biological data, I aim to make the transition from a statistician to a computational biologist and to become an independent investigator. I aspire to be not only an expert in developing sophisticated and rigorous statistical models and supplementing these models with efficient algorithms, but also a scientist capable of generating and testing my own hypotheses, either by myself or in collaboration with experimental biologists. The proposed K99/R00 award, involving one year of the mentored phase and three years of the independent phase, would greatly facilitate this transition, providing the unique opportunity for me to gain not only experience in genomic research in human, but also skills and experience in the wet lab, such that I can conduct some experiments on my own and eventually run an independent lab that focuses on computational research but also allows for experimental exploration."
"9349482","Project Summary / Abstract  The primary objective of this project is to study disease mechanisms of newly identified genes for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) using a combined in vivo and in vitro molecular genetics approach. VUR is one of the commonest congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in children. It is characterized by reflux of urine from the bladder into the kidney and is commonly associated with abnormal renal tract development, including defects in ureteric bud (UB) outgrowth and ureterovesical junction formation, and abnormal ureter development and peristalsis. Despite the high incidence of VUR in children, the genetic/molecular basis and disease mechanisms of VUR remain largely unclear. ROBO2 is one of few VUR/CAKUT genes that cause VUR phenotype in both human and animal model with many identified disease- causing mutations. Our recent studies show that mutations in SLIT2 and SRGAP1, two components of ROBO2 signaling pathway, can also result in CAKUT phenotype. However, the pathogenesis of SLIT2-ROBO2 signaling in VUR and CAKUT patients remain unclear. To test disease mechanisms and establish causality for ROBO2 mutations in human VUR, we will perform functional studies to determine if ROBO2 mutations disrupt interactions with known CAKUT-causing genes/proteins and if ROBO2 mutation knock-in mice also develop CAKUT and VUR phenotype (Aim 1). Since a recent study shows that ROBO2 controls UB outgrowth by regulating the separation of early Wolffian duct and nephrogenic cord, we will also study SLIT2 and SRGAP1 knockout mice to determine if they also play a role in early Wolffian duct and nephrogenic cord separation and if loss of SLIT2-ROBO2 signaling causes renal mesenchymal cell adhesion and migration defects (Aim 2). ZEB2 is a transcription factor that plays an import role in maintaining mesenchymal cells and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition via a BMP/SMAD/ZEB signaling network during development. Because we have recently found that deletion of ZEB2 gene can result in VUR phenotype in patients and ureter specific knockout of Zeb2 in mice causes abnormal ureter development, hydroureter, hydronephrosis and renal failure, we will also examine the role of Zeb2 in early ureteral mesenchymal cell development and determine if loss of Zeb2 in mouse ureter disrupts ureteral smooth muscle function and peristaltic machinery leading to VUR (Aim 3). Collectively, this research proposal will help us to understand disease mechanisms of newly identified VUR genes and define their molecular functions during urinary tract development. Results from this project will provide new knowledge in the molecular pathogenesis of VUR and assist us to identify novel therapeutic strategies for human VUR."
"9359571","ABSTRACT The primary focus of our training program at the University of Kentucky (UK) is to provide intensive and interdisciplinary basic science research training to qualified individuals in the various surgical disciplines to prepare them to become independent scientists and incorporate state-of-the-art techniques learned during their training period into a successful academic career. Moreover, these trainees will be prepared to be active participants in multidisciplinary teams which are required for the optimal treatment of the complex cancer patient. Our two-year training program represents a collaboration between the Markey Cancer Center (MCC) and the academic clinical departments at UK and benefits greatly from the experience and collegiality of the program and associate directors who have worked together for many years and have led other successful training programs for clinician-scientists and basic researchers. The primary training faculty is composed of both basic and clinical-scientists who are collaborative and multidisciplinary; each primary faculty mentor is a recognized expert in his or her field and has a long record of research productivity in the training of young investigators from the US and abroad. The diversity of our training program is further enhanced by the inclusion of seasoned adjunct faculty mentors who will provide additional clinical and biostatistical expertise. Also, we have designed a ?pipeline? mechanism to provide the time and instruction for promising junior faculty members to further hone their mentoring skills so that they can become effective primary mentors in the future. In addition to an intensive research experience, the trainees take formal courses (eg, grant writing skills, ethics and biostatistics) and are mentored in the fine points of preparing abstracts, scientific papers and presentations, and writing successful grant applications. Furthermore, the trainees participate in regularly scheduled MCC, departmental and Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) seminars and lectures. All of our trainees are required to complete coursework for a Master's degree in Clinical and Translational Science (CTS). In addition, the option of obtaining a PhD is available and encouraged (of note, two former trainees have successfully completed requirements for their PhD degrees and one current trainee is enrolled in the program). The requirement to successfully complete either a Master's or PhD further adds depth and breadth to the program and increase interactions with other scientists on campus through the required supervisory or thesis committees. We are concerned with the alarming decrease in the number of clinician- scientists; this decrease is most apparent in the diminishing number of those in the various surgical specialties. We are passionate, motivated and committed to the training of future academic surgeons."
"9369681","The goal of the AECC Cancer Biospecimen Acquisition and Biorepository Resource (CBABR) is to provide a centralized unit that meets the best practices of the NCI for high quality biospecimens for cancer research. The CBABR oversees the procurement of malignant, benign, diseased and uninvolved (normal) tissues from both solid and hematological tumors for use by AECC and other investigators. The CBABR has been organized through the consolidation of multiple federated cancer associated Institutional biobanks into a cohesive cancer oriented tissue acquisition and storage biobank that is the nucleus for prospective sample collection. The CBABR is a joint effort of AECC, the Einstein CTSA and other NIH funded centers at Einstein and is supported by several Institutional initiatives including a universal opt-in consent process in use by Einstein's clinical partner, Montefiore Medical Center, dedicated staffing for tissue acquisition in cooperation with Montefiore Surgical Pathology, Clinical Research Informatics support linking samples to medical and research records, and dedicated secure storage space utilizing the most advanced energy efficient freezer technology. A web-based application has been developed that allows investigators to determine if tissue exists in the CBABR with necessary phenotypic characteristics for their studies. The CBABR focus has been on head and neck cancer, breast, colon, lung, cervical and ovarian, neuroendocrine tumors, and hematological tumors. It currently houses 67,704 samples, including 5,704 samples collected since the institution of the new CBABR in late 2011, all of which are available for use by investigators. The CBABR process encompasses patient informed consent at initial cancer evaluation, planned universal opt-in  consent procedures, patient medical and health information that is annotated to the biospecimens,  centralized management of specimen collection, processing and storage, and multiple levels of security and  protection of the resource through the parent CTSA biorepository including 24/7 monitoring and alarmed  redundant backups. A CBABR Scientific Review Board (SRB) has been constituted to evaluate scientific and  technical merit of applications for use of biospecimens that reports to the AECC Protocol Review and  Monitoring Committee (PRMC) to approve and, when necessary, prioritize proposed tissue usage.  Mechanisms for requested collaborations from outside investigators have been established as well. An  institutional initiative will track the informed consent process and perform follow up queries on contributors to  the CBSR to assess patient knowledge and satisfaction."
"9342981","The over-riding purpose of our proposal for BUILD funds is to increase the number of URM and  disadvantaged students into biomedical careers. We recognize that persistence in biomedical-related  disciplines is a problem that most higher education institutions face; however, the literature suggests that  attrition rates are larger for URM and disadvantaged students. Students that attend our BUILD institutions  usually have excellent academic records and many begin their freshman year at the college or university  with goals of a career in science-related disciplines especially in health or health care. However, many  exceptionally bright and high achieving students, especially URM or economically disadvantaged students  may lack the tools, persistence and mentoring necessary to effectively persist in a college environment and  thus many are inadvertently allowed to drift and become emotionally disengaged. We want to significantly  decrease this loss and also to cultivate and develop their talent to go on to a successful biomedical career.  URM students from urban environments often graduate from high school with inadequate knowledge and  skills and as a result, their chances of persisting in biomedical programs are diminished. A key component  to ensure the success of the BUILD scholar's persistence in biomedical fields will be the requirement that all  BUILD scholars start in the Summer Bridge program. This program will immerse students in intensive and  directed instruction on a variety of topics intended to prepare them for the rigors of higher education. Our  program design draws heavily on information we have learned from successful programs in each of the  partnering institutions. During the academic year, BUILD scholars will be exposed to active learning core  courses based on the RCN model. To this end, we will develop a program that couples academic  programming with mentored research experiences to their enhanced persistence and career success.  Through research immersion, mentoring by peers, faculty and post-doctoral students, structure academic  programming, student enrichment and support activities, induction into learning communities, we believe we will increase the graduation rate of our BUILD scholars to 75%."
"9281778","The Electrophysiology and Animal Behavioral (EAB) Core will serve the Center by determining whether  synaptic plasticity and behavioral phenotypes in fragile X syndrome (FXS) model mice are corrected  by the genetic and pharmacological manipulations described in each project. Examining the  electrophysiological aspect of brain function is especially important because synaptic transmission and  cellular biophysical properties underlie every aspect of CNS performance in vivo, and plasticity of synaptic  function is one of the basic building blocks of neurodevelopment, learning, memory and positive/negative  behavioral changes of any sort. Moreover, disruption of cellular physiology and synaptic function is clearly a  basis for many forms of neurodevelopmental, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Examining the  behavioral consequences of genetic mutations that cause human neurodevelopmental disorders such as  FXS in mice is important not only for understanding the abnormalities caused by the mutations, but also as a  means to test whether genetic and pharmacological manipulations can correct and reverse the behavioral  abnormalities. Finally, because we are at a watershed moment in understanding the basic molecular biology  and role of translational control mechanisms in the function of the CNS, the capacity to study synaptic  function and behavior will increasingly become a critical component of many investigators' research  programs that are focused on how de novo protein synthesis impacts long-lasting changes in brain function."

"9361855","PROJECT SUMMARY Rural areas of Northern New England suffer from disparities in health status, health care access and clinical outcomes that lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Compounding this problem, rural providers and populations are seriously under-represented in clinical trials and health services research activities. Improving population health depends on successful translation of findings from basic science to clinical research, and subsequently to broader adoption through implementation science and public policy. This translational spectrum requires strong connections to clinical practice, not only as a testing ground for innovative ideas, but also as an environment in which real-world problems can be identified, characterized and brought forward as targets for research. The broad goal of the Rural Health Research and Delivery (RHRD) Core is to develop and support a partnership between academic institutions and rural practices in Northern New England to successfully carry out clinical and translational research. To achieve this goal we will engage in a series of activities designed to: 1) create a bi-directional partnership between academic centers and rural practices in order to stimulate research ideas, facilitate clinical and translational research, and test strategies to improve health; 2) develop the infrastructure to support research in rural practices; and 3) enhance research capacity through improved data access, data standardization, and, in collaboration with the Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics Core (CRDEB), provide training and access to state-of-the art observational and clinical research methodologies. These aims will be supported by strategies to engage rural practices in the research enterprise and in relationships with academic research partners in a team science and cooperative extension model approach. This includes the creation of innovative new research professional positions in Maine and Vermont, Practice-based Research Catalysts, who will facilitate communication and relationship building between academy and community, and will support the development and implementation of research projects. We will also develop formal and informal opportunities for researchers from academic centers and public/community health professionals to meet and work with rural clinicians, and collect qualitative data from rural clinicians and their practice organizations to understand the potential benefits and perceived barriers of participating in clinical and translational research. Finally, we will expand Northern New England providers' participation in the Observational Health Data, Science and Informatics platform, an innovative community of clinicians, researchers and data scientists committed to improving data comparability and robust research methodologies for observational and other clinical research. The activities of the RHRD core will involve collaboration with all of the other cores in this proposal. In particular, there will be activities in partnership with the CRDEB, Pilot Projects, and Professional Development Cores."
"9282286","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary A. Long-term Goals and Objectives of the Program The Occupational Health Psychology (OHP) graduate training program at the University of Connecticut is designed to recruit and train highly qualified and diverse graduate students from psychology, public health and nursing to become Ph.D. researchers capable of conducting multi-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary research focusing on the behavioral aspects of occupational health. Occupational trends (e.g., downsizing, contingent labor, longer work hours) have propelled the need for studies on occupational health psychology, which concerns the broad range of exposures and mechanisms that affect the quality of working life and the responses of workers, such as how individual psychological attributes interact with job content and work organization as well as organizational policies and practices. OHP research and practice explores interventions targeting the work environment and the individual to create healthier workplaces and to improve the capacity of workers to protect their own safety and health, while maximizing their effectiveness and wellbeing. As such, OHP fits many of the strategic goals of the NIOSH Total Worker Health initiative. B. Key Elements of the Training Program Trainees learn how to contribute to the OHP knowledge base and become highly capable researchers, who study and implement new ways of maintaining and promoting worker health and safety. The OHP concentration is integrated within the Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology doctoral training program. As such, the training program follows a scientist-practitioner model in which trainees complete 12 credits of prescribed coursework, three credits of applied field/lab research, master- and dissertation-level research, and participate in faculty research labs. All trainees complete a graduate seminar that covers principles of behavioral science, ergonomics and epidemiology and requires development of a multidisciplinary research proposal; this course is taught by core OHP faculty and an epidemiologist from the School of Medicine. In addition, trainees complete a required epidemiology course and two elective graduate courses in psychology and/or public health. This combination of course content and applied research training is designed to equip trainees with the necessary skills to address today's occupational health problems, and enable them to introduce new concepts of work organization and workplace design for enhancing worker health and productivity, realizing the true potential of trans-disciplinary occupational health research to meet both regional and national needs. C. Trainees: We recruit primarily from and also for the Psychology Department's I/O doctoral program in an effort to add extensive OHP training to trainees' more general doctoral requirements. UConn's I/O program is the only one of its kind in the New England states, making it possible to recruit stellar students for this training. The training program take approximately 5 years to complete, during which master- and dissertation-level research is completed, as well as additional research to enable trainees to be competitive in a tight job market. Trainees get jobs in academia, industry, consulting firms and governmental agencies. We support approximately 10 trainees annually (two supported with full-time, year-long stipends; the remaining with travel support for conference attendance). Students outside the I/O program can complete the 15-credit program for the Graduate Certificate in OHP, but are not eligible for grant support."
"9303454","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) now allow the reliable mapping of functional and structural maturation in the human brain to derive analogs of height and weight growth charts. Such norms would allow early detection of pathologic process before clinically significant symptomatology onsets. Unfortunately, the datasets needed to develop comprehensive growth curves for brain function and structure do not yet exist, as technology has outpaced the collection of high quality longitudinal imaging data.  Here, we propose to generate and share a large-scale, community-ascertained, structured multi-cohort, longitudinal sample from ages 6.0-20.5 yrs. This open access resource will allow the developmental trajectories of brain function and structure, as well as relationships with phenotypic measures to be delineated. We will generate at least 192 quality-controlled longitudinal datasets, evenly divided across 12 one-year age cohorts (6.0-17.9 yrs old at enrollment). Each dataset will contain 3 time-points separated by 15 months, with time-of-day and menstrual cycle phase controlled. State-of-the-art multiband imaging will be used to collect resting state functional MRI (R-fMRI) scans alternately optimized for temporal and spatial resolution. Multiband imaging will also enable the acquisition of 137-direction diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in less than 7 minutes - thereby minimizing motion confounds. Arterial spin labeling perfusion measures will also provide additional quantitative information. Dimensional cognitive, behavioral, psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic, and metabolic phenotyping will be included. Genetic samples will be obtained and shared via the NIMH Genetics Repository. Given the paucity of data regarding the reliability of imaging measures in pediatric populations, we will also obtain retest scans for each participant within 2 weeks of their initial scan session.  Careful determination of reliability is a prerequisite for determination of eventual clinical applicability, and especially pertinent in pediatric populations where risk of artifact and physiological variations are greatest. The proposed work builds on the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS), a cross-sectional sample of brain development, maturation and aging spanning ages 6-85 years, currently funded to recruit and assess 1000 community-ascertained participants using multiband imaging-based R-fMRI, DTI, and deep phenoytyping. Building upon the NKI-RS effort will minimize startup costs, infrastructure and design needs, and maximize the focus on follow-up data collection. Consistent with the NKI-RS protocol, anonymized datasets will be shared weekly on a prospective (pre-publication) basis via The 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP)/ International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI) (www.nitrc.org). Additionally, any analysis methods and software developed in the course of the project will be made fully available on publication."
"9346088","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT More than 75% of the global burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) is carried by the low-income developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa, where incidence at birth can be as high as 4.2% for SCD and 23.7% for sickle trait. SCD is particularly lethal to young children, accounting for up to 15% of under-5 mortality in countries with the highest prevalence of the disease. Data from pilot programs in Africa demonstrate that most of these deaths can be prevented with inexpensive treatments (e.g. penicillin prophylaxis, pneumococcal immunizations, malaria bed nets, and education about the importance of seeking medical attention for fever) ? provided SCD could be diagnosed early in life. In our Phase I work, we have successfully developed a simple and inexpensive paper-based test for the diagnosis of SCD in infants and young children >6 months old. Our test enables the diagnosis via visual interpretation of the stain pattern produced on chromatography paper by a droplet of blood mixed with hemoglobin (Hb) solubility buffer. The current version of the paper-based SCD test kit is completely equipment- and electricity-free, requires only a 10µL blood sample, costs <$0.15 per test, can be completed in 35 min, and is unaffected by severe anemia, high HbF, elevated ambient temperature or humidity. It has a limit of detection of <20% HbS, and was able to detect the presence of any HbS (sickle cell trait or disease) in patient samples with 94% sensitivity and 97% specificity in a pre-clinical study in a resource- limited setting (n = 226, Cabinda, Angola). In our laboratory, the test was able to diagnose SCD with 93% sensitivity and 94% specificity (n = 55). In Phase II, we propose to develop a complete, self-contained diagnostic kit, and to demonstrate its diagnostic accuracy in a pivotal clinical trial across multiple sites in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We will first evaluate the feasibility of using a prototype kit for diagnosing SCD in the target patient population of children presenting with acute illness to Hospital Provincial de Cabinda. We will also collect input on design and usability of the test?s components and instructions from the site personnel, to inform parallel development of the finished, marketable diagnostic kit. We will then work with our contract manufacturing partners to develop a version of the diagnostic kit that is optimized for mass production, regulatory trials, and subsequent marketing. This iterative process will be continually informed by research and development in our laboratory, the usability data from the Cabinda site, and advice from our marketing and distribution partners. Finally, we will demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of the finished, marketable SCD test kit in a pivotal clinical trial in sub-Saharan Africa. We have, to date, identified 5 well- qualified clinical sites ? Morogoro (Tanzania), Bamako (Mali), Lusaka (Zambia), Ibadan (Nigeria), and Cabinda (Angola) ? each highly-interested in participating in our trial. We will work closely with our Steering Committee and the FDA to finalize the design of the proposed trial."
"9390707","Project Summary Accurate diagnosis and early identification of infants or children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is essential to initiating early intervention leading to improved outcomes for affected children. However, children with FASD are most often not diagnosed until many years after birth. As a result, many years of appropriate and beneficial intervention or treatment are missed. Given the high prevalence of FASD in areas of the world where the disorder has been studied, earlier and more accurate recognition of children with FASD is of high public health importance. Building on the existing Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) longitudinal cohort study in Ukraine, we aim to fill this critical gap in knowledge in two ways. First, we will develop a panel of three prenatal/early infancy biomarkers that can predict FASD. These biomarkers include maternal and infant microRNA expression profile, maternal and infant cytokine expression profile, and an early infancy measure of neurobehavioral performance. Second, we will develop risk/resilience prediction models based on the developmental trajectories of children enrolled in the cohort. These models will identify the characteristics of a prenatally exposed infant/child at a given age that are predictive of the child's later growth and performance. This work will support earlier identification of affected children and can help to determine appropriate early allocation of resources for intervention and treatment to those children most likely to benefit. Furthermore, our findings may suggest novel approaches to biological and environmental targets for treatment and intervention. We will also work collaboratively with other investigators in the CIFASD Consortium to interactively address the overall goals of the Consortium in improving diagnosis and treatment of FASD."
"9326877","Tumor stiffness has been implicated as a driving force in tumor progression and metastasis. Matrix stiffness has been shown to alter the phenotype of breast epithelial cells from growth-arrested in soft conditions to malignant and invasive in stiff conditions. However, it is unknown whether invading cells retain `memory' of stiff environments after dissemination from the primary tumor, and if so, by what mechanism. This proposal aims to determine the extent and basis of mechanical memory of stiff microenvironments in mammary epithelial cells. Using a novel 3D model in which matrix stiffness can be tuned independently of ligand density, polarized, growth arrested mammary acini can be generated in soft gels while stiff gels give rise to malignant, invasive phenotypes. After culture in either soft or stiff conditions, the gel stiffness will be altered to determine the reversibility of the phenotypes initially established. These experiments will demonstrate whether mechanical memory exists for breast epithelial cells or in cancer contexts in general. Next chromatin accessibility and transcription factor occupancy will be assessed genome-wide using a transposition-based assay (ATAC-seq) suited for low cells numbers required for 3D culture. Epigenetic modifiers will be screened based on candidates identified from epigenomic data to identify the molecular mechanism driving stiffness-induced chromatin remodeling. Successful completion of this proposal will reveal, for the first time, the extent of mechanical memory in a cancer context, and the epigenomic landscape of cells in 3D culture."
"9321983","Abstract ? Project 3 ? Neuroscience Project The Neuroscience project will collect psychophysiological and MRI data from 300 MIDUS 3 respondents to derive measures of emotional reactivity and recovery in response to standardized positive and negative emotional stimuli. In addition, measures of resting state connectivity, structural MRI, and white matter connectivity measured with diffusion tensor imaging will provide additional indices of brain function and structure. Collectively these neuroscientifically-based measures will provide a unique opportunity to examine the neural pathways through which psychosocial factors are transduced and impact psychological function, health and well-being as we age. Among the several innovative features of this project, facial EMG will be acquired in the scanner to provide real-time, continuous, objective measures of emotional reactivity and recovery that will be used in conjunction with the imaging measures. Based upon findings from MIDUS 2, we predict that prolonged responding in the ventral striatum in response to positive incentives will be associated with higher levels of well-being and with lower levels of cortisol and with a biomarker and gene expression profile indicative of increased resilience. Functional connectivity between the different sectors of the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala and ventral striatum in resting state functional MRI are predicted to be associated with individual differences in well-being and with peripheral measures of stress biology. Increased functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and these subcortical zones is predicted to be associated with a more resilient profile. Structural variations in key circuits will also be examined in relation to psychosocial factors and peripheral biology. The neuroscience project provides key measures of the neural bases and correlates of key emotion-related processes that are central to well-being and health and will enable MIDUS to provide a mechanistic account of how psychosocial factors are transduced and in turn impact neural circuits and peripheral biology in ways that modulate mental and physical health."

The BCM main campus is located in the Texas Medical Center, which is the largest medical center in the world. The Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at BCM was established in 1982 and has created an academic culture defined by and supportive of collaborative research and teaching. Supported by NIH, PCORI, NEH, the Greenwall Foundation, the Milbank Memorial Fund, the Ford Foundation, and other private foundations, the Center's faculty have engaged in collaborative research that has resulted in more than 550 publications in the peer-reviewed literature, 150 chapters in medical and scientific textbooks, 100 chapters in scholarly monographs, and 35 edited or authored books. Ms. Guerrini is a graduate of Harvard Law School (JD 2001) and the University of Virginia (BA 1998), and she is currently a graduate student at University of Texas School of Public Health (MPH expected 2016). She was a practicing intellectual property attorney before transitioning to academia and has served as a full-time instructor in law schools in New York and Chicago. Ms. Guerrini recently completed an intellectual property fellowship at Chicago-Kent College of Law. She has published in academic law journals and this spring will have additional articles published in the peer-reviewed literature. Ms. Guerrini has served as an invited presenter or moderator at multiple legal conferences and colloquia, including the Supreme Court Intellectual Property Review, PatCon, the Law and Society Association Annual Meeting, the Chicago Intellectual Property Colloquium, and the Licensing Executives Society (US & Canada) Annual Meeting. Although Ms. Guerrini's academic and professional experiences to date have provided her a solid foundation in normative analysis and empirical methods, she will benefit from additional training to achieve her long-term career goals. These goals include becoming (1) an independent investigator and leader in the study of ELSI issues related to emerging models of biomedical research and (2) an expert in the conduct of qualitative and experimental studies to collect data that will inform health policies. To achieve these goals, Ms. Guerrini has proposed focused training in the following areas: theoretical and applied ethics; qualitative research design and data analysis; and conjoint analysis design and data analysis. The proposed plan also includes advanced instruction in genomics. The training will consist of formal coursework in ethics and genomics at Baylor College of Medicine and formal coursework in qualitative methodology and statistics at University of Texas School of Public Health, in addition to intensive training in conjoint analysis methodology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This coursework and the proposed research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Dr. Amy L. McGuire of BCM and co-mentors Dr. Sheryl A. McCurdy of University of Texas School of Public Health and Dr. John F.P. Bridges of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In addition, Dr. Richard Gibbs of BCM and Ms. Sharon Terry of Genetic Alliance will advise on the project as needed. The proposed research concerns the question of ownership claims and interests in the outputs of genomic research conducted in a collaborative ?citizen science? context. The internet is providing opportunities for citizen scientists to participate in the design and conduct of studies, and these initiatives are increasingly prevalent in the field of genomics, where web-based portals are collecting genetic sequencing data and connecting individuals to genomic studies requesting varying levels of involvement. It is unclear, however, whether genomic citizen scientists have legitimate claims to the outputs of that research?i.e., the findings, written products, and discoveries that are the results of the studies that they support. This research will identify gaps in practice, policy, principles, and preferences relevant to ownership interests in genomic citizen science outputs to provide a normative and empirical foundation from which to develop best practices and policies that will promote public trust and engagement in biomedical research."
"9307975","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aortic aneurysms are common pathologies often associated with tear (dissection) and rupture of the vessel wall. Despite substantial research effort, therapeutic options to prevent death from ruptured aortic aneurysm remain limited. In contrast to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is frequently caused by mutations in proteins that promote arterial tissue integrity and homeostasis. Characterization of pathogenic mechanism of aortic aneurysms in genetically altered or experimentally manipulated mice has identified both common and unique disease determinants, in addition to raising some controversies. Unresolved issues relevant to the development of new therapeutic strategies include the mechanisms of improper signaling by angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1r) and by TGF? in the dilating aorta. We propose to use a monogenic mouse model of TAA to address these key issues with the long-term goal of identifying new biological targets for drug therapy. The premise of our studies rests on strong preliminary evidence indicating that wall stress is a primary activator of persistent AT1r signaling and that the homeodomain­interacting protein kinase 2 (Hipk2) is an unsuspected stimulator of TGF? hyperactivity activated by AT1r­induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. We therefore hypothesize that progressive hemodynamic load on a biomechanically impaired aorta triggers stress signals that are sensed and mediated by AT1r via ROS to augment TGF? activity in part through Hipk2 action. We will test our hypothesis by monitoring TAA modifications in MFS mice with different genetic and pharmacological manipulations of the AT1 and AT2 receptors (Aim 1a and Aim 1b); by analyzing the molecular responses of healthy and mutant aortic strips to ex vivo stretching (Aim 1c); by elucidating the pathogenic contribution of Hipk2 to TAA formation in relationship to improper AT1r and TGF? signaling (Aim 2a); by supporting the in vivo findings with molecular and biochemical analyses of Hipk2 dysregulation in mutant vascular smooth muscle cell cultures (Aim 2b); and by validating mouse derived evidence of Hipk2­related molecular abnormalities in aortic tissue specimens isolated from MFS patients (Aim 2c). The proposed work is expected to shed new light on the structural, molecular and mechanical determinants of aortic aneurysms and identify potential drug targets to blunt arterial disease. As such, our work is predicted to advance basic scientific knowledge, improve clinical care and guide translational applications for this life-threatening group of arterial disease conditions."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Boston University School of Medicine's new SEPA project, entitled CityLab and Urban Squash: A New Pathway to Achieve STEM Success, specifically addresses the SMRB's imperative that NIH's pre-college STEM activities need a rejuvenated integrated focus on biomedical workforce preparedness with special considerations for under-represented minorities. Approximately one-third of CityLab's participants are under- represented minority (URM) students, but we now have a unique opportunity to build a program that will reach many URM students and position them for undergraduate STEM success. We have partnered with urban squash education organizations in Boston (SquashBusters) and New York (CitySquash and StreetSquash) that recruit URM/low SES students to participate in afterschool squash training and academic enrichment programs. We have also partnered with the National Urban Squash and Education Association (NUSEA) to disseminate the new program- first from Boston to New York and later through its national network of affiliated squash education programs. In order to bring this project to fruition, Boston University is joining forces with Fordham University in New York. Fordham is home to CitySquash so these organizations provide an ideal base for the New York activities. The proposed project will enable us to demonstrate feasibility and replicability within the 5 year scope of this grant. Our shared vision is to develop a national model for informal precollege biomedical science education that can be infused into a myriad of similar athletic/academic enrichment programs. The squash education movement for urban youth has been highly successful in enrolling program graduates in college. Since the academic offerings of the squash education programs focus on English Language Arts and Mathematics, their students struggle with science and rarely recognize the tremendous opportunities for long- term employment in STEM fields. This project will bring CityLab's resources to local squash programs in a coordinated and sustained engagement to introduce students to STEM, specifically the biomedical sciences. Together with the urban squash centers, we will build upon the hands-on life science experiences developed and widely disseminated by CityLab to create engaging laboratory-based experiences involving athletics and physiology. The specific aims of the proposed project are: (1) to develop, implement, and evaluate a new partnership model for recruiting URM/low SES students and inspiring them to pursue careers in STEM and (2) to examine changes in the science learner identities (SLI) of the students who participate in this program and establish this metric as a marker for continued engagement in STEM. With the involvement of the two urban research universities, three local squash education programs, and NUSEA, we see this new SEPA initiative as a unique way to pilot, refine, and disseminate an after- school/informal science education program that can have a significant impact on the nation's production of talented STEM graduates from URM/low SES backgrounds."
"9312681","DESCRIPTION: Despite a long list of organ systems adversely affected by aging in HIV, the lung remains relatively understudied, and combined effects of aging and HIV on the lung are unknown. Development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be accelerated in HIV despite antiretroviral treatment (ART). Average age of HIV+ individuals with COPD in our cohorts is 51 years compared to 61 years in our HIV- controls (p<0.001 adjusted for smoking). Lung disease may be a novel HIV-associated non-AIDS (HANA) complication related to aging, but rigorously controlled studies have not been performed. Aging in HIV is linked to cellular senescence and maladaptive inflammation. Senescence of lung and immune cells has been implicated in COPD in persons without HIV, but has not been investigated in HIV COPD. Our preliminary data demonstrate 1) increases in senescent and activated systemic T cells, 2) telomere shortening in blood lymphocytes, and 3) increases in peripheral and lung cytokines in HIV COPD; therefore, we hypothesize that aging is important in HIV COPD. Distinct phenotypes are increasingly being recognized as critical in understanding COPD pathogenesis. Our work indicates that HIV+ individuals commonly have different COPD phenotypes. Over 70% of outpatients manifest at least one abnormality with certain abnormalities associated with a greater burden of respiratory symptoms and with mortality. The relative importance of aging and inflammation in these phenotypes has not been examined, and peripheral biomarkers of phenotypes are unknown. Overall goals of the proposal are to evaluate the impact of aging on lung function in HIV, to test the novel hypothesis that COPD in HIV is a manifestation of immune cell and lung cell aging, and to determine peripheral biomarkers of aging and inflammation in HIV COPD. We will test these hypotheses with the following aims: Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that aging modifies the risk of pulmonary dysfunction in HIV+ individuals.  Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that immune cell and lung cellular aging are increased in HIV COPD.  Aim 3. To establish the significance of patterns of peripheral inflammatory cytokines (the inflammome) in HIV-associated lung disease. We will recruit HIV+ and HIV- participants from ongoing cohorts with enrichment of individuals over the age of 50. We will examine pulmonary function changes over time and the relationship of pulmonary function to peripheral and pulmonary markers of senescence and inflammation. We are uniquely positioned to investigate lung aging in HIV as we have established cohorts of >600 HIV+ and HIV- participants with thorough physiologic characterization and biological samples. The proposal will fill the gap in knowledge of pulmonary effects of physiologic and cellular aging in HIV and is directly responsive to PA-12-175 (Multidisciplinary Studies of HIV/AIDS and Aging). Results will enhance understanding of pulmonary aging and translate into improvements in prevention and management of HIV pulmonary disease."
"9402296","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This renewal application seeks NICHD support for 5 first-year and 5 second-year positions in the Pediatric Scientist Development Program (PSDP), a career development pathway for pediatric fellows from which 192 physician-scientists have graduated since 1987. The objectives of the program remain unchanged since its inception: (a) to recruit pediatric fellows whose outstanding potential for a successful investigative career can be developed in an intensively mentored setting and (b) to expand the pipeline of superbly trained pediatric physician-scientists, who will catalyze cutting-edge discoveries in child health and lead the pediatric departments of the future. Unique aspects of the PSDP include its North American scope for recruitment of fellows and mentors, its intensive focus on career development during fellowship, its supra-institutional governance under the aegis of the Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs (AMSPDC), its emphasis on research environments outside departments of pediatrics, and its approach to mentoring that encompasses research mentors, PSDP advisory committees, and pediatric department chairs. Advisory Committees include a Steering Committee, which sets programmatic policy; a Selection Committee to interview PSDP candidates; and an independent Program Evaluation Committee measures the program?s effectiveness in ensuring fellows? success. A centerpiece of the PSDP is the annual career development curriculum that convenes PSDP fellows, advisory committees, and all US and Canadian pediatric department chairs at the AMSPDC meeting. PSDP graduates have served as PIs on 335 NIH RPGs, of which 53% are currently active. Based on total awards of NIH RPGs with PSDP graduates are PIs, the return on NICHD investment is 8.8 fold. Innovations for 2017-2021 include a) leveraging NICHD funding by incorporating departmental support for up to 5 third-year fellows who will be appointed as instructors with 75-80% protected research time and b) expanding our career development curriculum with adult-learning educational modules that emphasize the fellow-to-faculty transition and team science, presented on site at AMSPDC and through web-based case-based studies. The PSDP has implemented a comprehensive strategy to expand the boundaries of child health research, to develop the research careers of rigorously trained pediatric physician-scientists, and to produce the next generation of investigative leaders in pediatrics."
"9270538","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acquired resistance and poor tumor response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors is a significant challenge for effective treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Therefore, further identification and characterization of molecular mechanisms associated with HNSCC tumor response to EGFR inhibition could lead to improvements in drug efficacy and HNSCC patient survival. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) production has been shown to promote tumor progression and invasiveness in HNSCC. However little is known about the effect of EGFR inhibitors (EGFRIs) on IL-6 production. The candidate has observed a profound increase in toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-6 signaling in HNSCC cells resistant to the EGFRI erlotinib compared to erlotinib-sensitive HNSCC cells. These observations led the candidate to the proposal that chronic EGFRI treatment may induce the production and secretion of IL-6 in HNSCC tumor cells via TLR activation, leading to reduced drug efficacy, tumor progression and acquired resistance to EGFRIs. Additionally, prior work in our laboratory has found that EGFR pathway inhibition induced hydrogen peroxide production via activation of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which has been reported to increase IL-6 expression. Given these observations, EGFRIs may stimulate pathways involving TLRs, NOX4 and IL-6, leading to an inflammatory response in HNSCC tumor cells. The current proposal tests the hypothesis that the antitumor effects of EGFRIs are reduced in HNSCC via NOX4-mediated oxidative stress and TLR-mediated activation of IL-6 signaling in vitro and in vivo. Aim 1 will examine the role of NOX4-mediated oxidative stress in the mechanism of action of EGFRIs in HNSCC in vitro; Aim 2 will determine the contribution of TLR signaling in the mechanism of action of EGFRIs in HNSCC in vitro and in vivo; and Aim 3 will determine if IL-6 pathway blockade would enhance the efficacy of EGFRIs in HNSCC tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The candidate expects that the successful completion of this application will highlight the significance of TLR, NOX4 and IL-6-mediated inflammation in EGFR-based chemotherapy and contribute in a meaningful way to a new biochemical rationale for the use of IL-6 pathway inhibitors in combination with EGFRIs for the treatment of HNSCC."
"9312744","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle):  The overall goal of this Project is to identify cellular proteins that are required for Ebola virus replication. Ebola  viruses pose significant risks to human health and national security. The 2014 outbreak in Western Africa  infected more than 28,000 people and caused more than 11,000 deaths (per WHO statistics). Although  vaccine candidates are showing promise in clinical trials, no clinically approved drugs are available and basic  information about Ebola virus replication is lacking. Like all viruses, Ebola virus depends on cellular proteins  for its replication. This dependence creates a potential ?Achilles heel? that may be exploited to develop new  approaches to treat Ebola virus infections. By studying Ebola virus-host cell interactions, we gain insight into  the mechanisms of action of viral proteins and the strategies that the virus uses to interface with its host.  However, relatively few host factors of Ebola virus replication have been reported and no systematic, genome-  wide analyses have been performed. To address this gap, we will apply complementary technologies to  develop high quality maps of Ebola virus-host cell interactions. In Aim 1 we perform a high content, genome-  wide RNAi screen under BSL4 conditions with wildtype Ebola virus to identify novel host factors required for  Ebola virus replication. The capacity to perform such a screen is unique to the research team. Since the host  factors identified in the siRNA screen could act directly or indirectly to affect Ebola virus replication, in Aim 2  we propose to identify cellular proteins that bind to Ebola virus replication proteins. Complementary protein-  protein interaction discovery technologies (yeast two-hybrid assay and co-affinity purification plus mass  spectrometry) are used to develop a more comprehensive Ebola virus-host cell protein interaction network than  could be achieved with any single approach. Since the sequences of Ebola virus strains differ between  outbreaks and the impact of these genetic changes on host cell interactions is not known, we systematically  compare host cell binding partners of a 2014 outbreak strain to those of Ebola Zaire (1976). Host cell factors  from Aims 1 and 2 are integrated with existing large-scale data sets in Aim 3 to develop strain-specific Ebola  virus-host cell protein interaction networks. To create a more complete understanding of regulatory effects of  the virus-host interactions, we will enrich the network in indirect transcriptional interactions using high-  throughput RNA-seq profiling of a subset of host factors selected from Aims 1 and 2. Our research team is well  qualified to accomplish the goals of this Project, having expertise in high-throughput screening of BSL4  viruses, virus-host cell protein interactions, RNA-Seq profiling, and network-based bioinformatic analyses. Host  factors will be tested for their effects on virus infection in Projects 1 and 3, and characterized by biophysical  and structural methods in Core B and Project 2. Together these studies will develop the most comprehensive  analysis of Ebola virus-host cell interactions to date. The data is integral to the mission of this Program and is  expected to stimulate hypothesis-driven experiments in broader Ebola virus research community.  0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12) Page Continuation Format Page"
"9304852","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R-25 application proposes a competitive renewal of a multi-site, interdisciplinary mentoring program in the field of child psychiatric intervention prevention, and services (CHIPS). The CHIPS program targets post-doc trainees and entry-level faculty preparing to write their first NIMH career development or project grant in the area o intervention, prevention or services for child psychiatric disorders. It combines a one-week summer institute with a minimum of one subsequent year of intensive mentoring, additional web-based videos learning on important topics related to these goals, and mentor-guided expansion of the trainee's professional network. The overarching goals of this program are to: (1) recruit and retain promising early career scientists to child and adolescent mental health intervention, prevention, and services research; (2) increase their success rate and decrease the time to successful acquisition of external funding; and (3) prepare researchers who can conduct research that spans the boundaries of intervention, prevention, and services research and that is informed by advances in translational and developmental science. The one-week summer institute strongly emphasizes experiential exercises and mentoring. It is focused on helping trainees acquire the full range of skills needed to prepare their next grant application. The CHIPS faculty have a record of successful mentoring and together span the breadth of intervention, prevention, and services research, and thus can promote the development of a broader training perspective to program participants than any single training site. Over the course of this renewal we will move current and additional didactics to a flexible web-based system to make the content widely and freely available. Because our Institute approach concentrates on mentoring individual trainees by focusing on their next grant application, helping them gain the skills necessary to write a competitive grant, we will experiment with multi-way video conferencing approaches to see if this aspect of our individualized training can be more economically replicated by telecommuting rather than travel."
"9295068","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tauopathies consist of a group of diseases, including frontotemporal dementias and the most common form Alzheimer's disease, and are characterized by the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and extensive neurodegeneration. Tau is normally localized to the neuronal axons where it binds and stabilizes the microtubules. Aberrant Tau phosphorylation leads to its dissociation from the microtubules followed by aggregation and redistribution to cell bodies and dendrites. In addition, Tau has been shown to be secreted, and this mechanism has been implicated in the prion-like transfer of Tau pathology. Accumulating evidence has implicated impaired autophagy-lysosome pathway in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Recently, the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) was discovered as a master regulator of cellular clearance through coordinated expression of autophagy and lysosomal target genes. We found that TFEB is highly efficacious in ameliorating phospho-Tau/NFT pathology, neurodegeneration, and behavioral deficits in rTg4510 Tau transgenic mice while exhibiting no adverse effect on wild-type mice; TFEB is effective when introduced both before and after the onset of neuropathology. Besides the autophagy-lysosome pathway, substantial evidence also supports a non-cell-autonomous role of TFEB in cellular clearance through neuronal exocytosis and astroglial-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, we hypothesize in this proposal that TFEB promotes lysosomal exocytosis and subsequent astroglial uptake of Tau, and that TFEB-mediated glial uptake of extracellular Tau prevents cell-to-cell transfer of the NFT-like pathology. We are equipped with sophisticated mouse models and innovative approaches that allow us to address these questions in vitro and in vivo at the subcellular, cellular, and network levels. At the completion of the proposal, we wil have gained mechanistic and functional insights into the poorly defined role of astrocytes in Tau clearance and the interplay between neurons and astrocytes in mediating Tau pathogenesis."
"9297176","Two major findings in the previous funding period will be pursued in the proposed 5-year extension period.  First, we showed that a single experience with operant self-administration of ethanol produces a robust  dopamine response on the second day of ethanol consumption, but not the first, and this accompanies an  increase in ethanol consumption. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that it is the central effects of ethanol that  the rats experience that leads to the behavioral and neurochemical changes. This will be done by limiting a  group of rats so that they self-administer a dose of ethanol <0.25 g/kg. In addition, we propose to further  characterize the time course of persistence of the behavioral and neurochemical response to a single  exposure to operant ethanol self-administration. We predict that both the consumption and accumbal  dopamine response will decay in a parallel manner which would be consistent with our interpretation that the  dopamine response is part of a reward prediction system in the brain. A final part of this aim will be to do  tract tracing to try to discover an anatomical basis for the subregional specificity of the dopamine response  during consumption. Aim 2 will focus on the prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. Previous work  indicated that the dopamine increases in the prefrontal cortex in rats that had been trained for one week to  operantly self-administer sucrose or sucrose/ethanol solutions. We now propose to examine whether these  responses In the prefrontal cortex develop after a single exposure to ethanol or sucrose. Furthermore we  propose to extend the studies to measure norepinephrine in cortical dialysates, another important  monoamine in the cortex. Also, we plan to study the orbitofrontal cortex, an area involved in decision making  that has recently been found to be affected by ethanol. Aim 3 will be a new direction, i.e., examination of the  role of a neuroimmune factor, MCP-1, in ethanol self-administration. Both the agonist and antagonist will be  infused into the ventricles and the acquisition of operant self-administration will be measured as well as the  escalation of drinking after induction of physical dependence using a vapor chamber model."
"9308870","This application continues support for the Training Program in Cancer Biology launched in 2011 to train postdoctoral and predoctoral trainees for careers in cancer research.

A fuller mechanistic understanding of cancer biology will lead to progressively more effective cancer diagnosis, therapy, and prevention. A major goal of the Training Program is to maximize our opportunity to apply emerging fundamental scientific insights to clinical outcomes by training exceptionally talented and highly trained physician- and PhD-scientists who will translate between the laboratory bench and the bedsides of patients with cancer. The Training Program provides a rigorous educational curriculum in basic cancer research and the immersion of trainees in the nurturing structure of individualized, integrated, multidisciplinary mentoring. Participating Faculty are selected based on their published scientific achievements and track record of funding in cancer research, interest in translational cancer research and experience in mentoring trainees. Trainees will gain an appreciation for productive translation between lab and clinic by participating in research and didactic sessions with interactive teams of lab and clinical researchers. A range of cutting-edge technologies and shared resources that facilitate specialized research activities supports all investigators. The Training Program builds on the Cancer Biology Track within the Molecular Medicine Program of the Graduate Program in Life Sciences, which provides students with a solid grounding in the multidisciplinary aspects of basic, translational and clinical cancer research, yet allows them the flexibility to specialize in their area of interest in the labs of selected UMGCC faculty.

"9288225","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. More adults are affected by stroke each year than Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Hemorrhagic strokes represent the most severe subtypes of stroke. An estimated 40-50% of hemorrhagic stroke victims will die. Half of this mortality occurs in the first two days aftr the stroke making prevention of paramount importance. Familial aggregation and heritability studies strongly support the existence of genetic risk factors for non-lobar and lobar ICH independent of hypertension and apolipoprotein E status.  The Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors for Hemorrhagic Stroke (GERFHS) and the Genetic Risks for Medication-Related Hemorrhagic Stroke (GOCHA) studies have led numerous advances in our understanding of the genetic epidemiology of hemorrhagic stroke and ICH in particular. Both studies were independently funded to perform genome wide association studies of ICH. Having completed enrollment, genotyping, analysis and finally meta-analysis, the studies have identified a genome-wide significant association with non-lobar ICH. The identification on Chr 1q22 overlies the identical region identified by the CHARGE consortium as association with the closely related phenotype of cerebral white matter disease. The finding overlies the polyamine modulating factor 1 (PMF1) gene, a novel location that was very unlikely to have been independently identified through candidate gene studies. Although PMF1 was initially identified as a cell growth regulator, it is the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolic pathway of polyamine metabolism. Of particular interest to ICH and deep white matter hyperintensity and possibly to vascular cognitive impairment and small vessel ischemic disease, polyamines have been found to disrupt the blood brain barrier. We now propose to follow-up this seminal finding with deep sequencing of the candidate regions and gene expression studies over the regions in a collection of 500 non-lobar ICH cases and 300 frequency matched controls plus 700 publicly available controls. Unlike major genetic studies of the past decade, follow-up studies of specific regions (rather than genome-wide studies) require smaller sample sizes and a highly favorable cost. If successful, the current proposal will identify one of the first new risk factors for non-lobar and lobar ICH in a generation. These findings may have broad ranging impact on related phenotypes of vascular cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke."
"9304786","Project Summary The nervous system is precisely wired, and this precision underlies the structure of the neural circuits, and their function. In the central nervous system of vertebrates, and in neuropils of invertebrates, unmyelinated axons are organized into fascicles (or bundles) that form en passant (along the length of the axon) synapses with conjoining axons. The organization of the fascicle limits the contact sites that a given axon makes with potential postsynaptic partners, thereby restricting the position and identity of en passant synapses between neurons. How fascicles are organized in vivo to result in precisely organized neuropils and circuits is a fundamental question in developmental neuroscience. Key fasciculation proteins such as FasII/N-CAM and Cadherin have been identified, but the specific mechanisms that regulate and instruct fascicle formation are unclear. Furthermore, it is unclear how fascicle organization results in accurately formed neuronal circuits and neuropils. This gap remains in part because it has been challenging to examine the dynamic development and organization of fascicles in vivo at single neuron resolution. In this proposal, I will address this knowledge gap by studying the development of the Caenorhabditis elegans nerve ring (the nematode brain). The nerve ring is a neuropil consisting of 185 fasciculating neurons that are precisely positioned during embryonic development. To image the development of the nerve ring we custom-designed a light-sheet microscope capable of continuously imaging the entire 8-hour development of the C. elegans nerve ring at sub-cellular resolution. Combing the genetic and cell biological tools available in C. elegans with our enabling light-sheet microscope, I will identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that organize fascicle development in vivo to specify the precise formation of neuronal circuits. Neurodevelopmental genes formerly identified in C. elegans are conserved across evolution. Therefore, I foresee that this work will reveal conserved mechanisms of fascicle development in metazoans that could be biomedically relevant for understanding the underpinnings of neurodevelopmental diseases."
"9390289","Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors."

"9428063","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New selective chemical reactions are essential components to advance biology and medicine. The most powerful and efficient chemical reactions commonly use catalysis to control reactivity and selectivity. The discovery of new catalyst concepts with broad utility beyond established reactivity can greatly impact biomedical research by providing unconventional and efficient access to compounds with biological activity. The long-term goal of our catalysis research is to develop new Lewis base-catalyzed transformations with direct application to the syntheses and investigation of bioactive molecules. Our development of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as catalysts will continue to uncover new approaches and generate important new concepts of organocatalysis. Our central hypothesis is that new discoveries in the field of carbene catalysis will significantly advance chemical synthesis, bioorganic chemistry and medicine. The specific goals of this proposal are: (1) Develop new cooperative carbene catalysis processes. N-heterocyclic carbenes (Lewis bases) have been discovered to be compatible with Lewis acids to enhance selectivity and reactivity. The combination of Lewis acids, hydrogen bond donors or transition metal complexes with NHCs will provide new opportunities for chemical synthesis; (2) explore azolium-based activation for substitution reactions; (3) investigate carbene catalysis-driven total syntheses. While there has been an explosion of new NHC catalyzed reactions, few target syntheses have employed any of these new reactions as a key step. We will use an NHC-catalyzed intramolecular Michael reaction as the key step in the synthesis of arnamial and related natural products. In addition, a trans-annular NHC-catalyzed lactone formation will be pursued as the main approach to synthesize repin, a potent cytotoxin. Our research in generating new reactivity using organocatalysis will establish new approaches for the efficient synthesis of molecules. This research will also provide important knowledge about nucleophile-catalyzed polarity reversal reactions and cooperative catalysis. These findings will ultimately lead to the development of a powerful collection of stereoselective and related strategies that are useful for medically relevant synthesis and thus further the mission of NIGMS."
"9471964","Vocal communication relies on the production and perception of stereotyped signals that carry particular messages. Bioacousticians studying animal communication and linguists studying human speech have used a unique simple classification scheme for these information-bearing sound elements: phonemes in speech and call categories in animal calls. Although appealing from a computational perspective, classification of communication sounds into a fixed number of phonemes or call types fails to capture all of the complexities of the vocal signaling used by humans or animals. At the same time, this core view has guided past neuroscientific research, including ours: auditory neuroscientists and neurolinguists have searched with mixed success for high-level auditory neurons or regions that are selective for call types or phonemes and invariant to variations of sounds within these groups. One of the sobering lessons of this past research is that we have yet to find a cortical map representing phonemes or call types. In addition, the non-linear transformations yielding invariant and selective responses for certain phonemes/call types remain to be described. For this project, we propose to explore a broader hypothesis of auditory signaling and perception and explore its neural correlate. Our hypothesis is that signaling is organized in an information hierarchy that is best represented as a tree classification scheme. This hierarchical organization of information is found in the acoustics, in the behavioral responses and in the neural representations and computations performed by the auditory system and association areas. We propose to test this hypothesis and reveal the neural representations of communication signals using songbirds as a model system. In this collaborative proposal, we will 1) develop a novel wireless device that will combine array neural recordings, physiological measurements and acoustical recordings, 2) study the hierarchical organization of a complete repertoire as revealed by the acoustical structure of calls, 3) measure the physiological and behavioral responses to these communication sounds, 4) measure the neural representation for these communication sounds and 5) model this communication system using our hierarchical information hypothesis as a guiding principle. This analysis will elucidate not only the nature of the meaning in communication signals but also how the sound to meaning transformations are performed by the brain."
"9355227","Severe worry, a transdiagnostic symptom particularly pernicious for the health of older adults, is associated with increased risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and with increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events. Severe worry, defined as intense, uncontrollable worry associated with interruption in functioning and reduced quality of life, is surprisingly prevalent in the community, with 20% of older adults reporting severe worry. While there are no studies regarding the lifespan incidence of severe worry, we can draw inferences based on the incidence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), for which up to half of the cases are late-onset. These data suggest a particularly heavy burden of severe worry loaded in the second half of life, pointing toward an increasing role for the neuropathologic changes of aging. Identifying neural mechanisms for late-life worry is a crucial step for understanding why worry crops up in the latter part of life, and for eventually improving treatment. Our team has made significant headway in this regard. Through her K23 award, which was focused on the neuroanatomy of late-life GAD, the PI has shown that neural markers of worry differ across ages. Preliminary results indicate that older worriers have impaired functional connectivity both at rest and during worry reappraisal. In addition to documenting age-related brain pathology, our preliminary findings may explain why current treatment choices, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, which relies on worry reappraisal to interrupt the worry loop, have proven less effective in reducing worry severity in older adults and may actually be counterproductive. However, the examination of the neural architecture underlying worry has garnered relatively little attention, especially with regard to the mechanism underlying essential processes such as worry induction and reappraisal. This project will test a mechanistic model anchored in systems neuroscience and aimed at characterizing the functional neuroanatomy of severe worry in older adults. We focus on the roles of three canonical brain networks: 1) the network subserving the ?resting? state, a time when many worriers would worry naturally [the Default Mode], 2) the network involved in the detection of environmentally salient, often threatening information, ideally allowing us to anchor the neural features of worry in the RDoC's threat reactivity categories [the Salience Network], and 3) the network active during cognitive efforts to reappraise worry [the Executive Control]. We will characterize the specificity of this model for aging, by testing the moderating effect of brain aging, as measured by white matter disease. The phenomenological layout of worry from everyday reactions to stress to anxious perseveration, together with the distribution of worry across various disorders, makes this investigation fit ideally within the RDoC framework. We plan to recruit a stratified sample of 160 participants (age 50 to 85) representing a wide range of worry severity. As NIMH moves away from DSM categorical disorders, identifying the neural basis of pathological transdiagnostic features, such as worry, will be of increasing importance for developing targeted interventions. 1"
"9313309","PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instructions): Adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6) has favorable effects on the failing heart. However, AC6 has two shortcomings that, if resolved, would provide an optimal therapeutic transgene. First, AC6's large size prevents its expression in adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, which would enable longer-term expression. Second, AC6's propensity to increase intracellular levels of cAMP is a potential impediment. Recent data from our laboratory indicate that the beneficial effects of AC6, in large measure, are independent of cAMP generation. The elimination of the amino terminus and the two transmembrane domains (M1 & M2) of AC and subsequent fusing the two cytoplasmic domains (C1 & C2) with an 8 amino acid linker yields a C1C2 protein. C1C2 has an intact catalytic domain, but is disengaged from membrane-associated ?-adrenergic receptors (?AR), and therefore less responsive to ?AR stimulation. Our preliminary data indicate that increased expression of C1C2 in cardiac myocytes mimics the beneficial effects of AC6 on Akt activation and ATF3 expression, has favorable effects on cell survival, and improved function of the failing heart. Moreover, C1C2 is sufficiently small to be inserted in an AAV vector with a regulated expression cassette, and will be better suited for targeting to specific microdomains owing to its smaller size. Hypothesis C1C2 expression - independently ?-adrenergic receptor stimulation - will have beneficial effects on the failing heart. The following 5 Aims will examine the mechanism of action and effects of C1C2 on heart function.  Aim 1 To determine the mechanisms by which C1C2 has beneficial effects on cardiac myocytes. Aim2 To determine if cardiac-directed expression of the optimal C1C2 construct will have favorable effects on normal heart function and have minimal deleterious effects even after prolonged high-level cardiac expression.  Aim 3 To determine if cardiac-directed expression of C1C2 will improve function of the failing heart.  Aim 4 To determine whether cardiac gene transfer of an AAV vector enabling regulated expression of an optimal C1C2 can safely improve function of the failing mouse heart.  Aim 5 To determine whether cardiac gene transfer of an AAV vector enabling regulated expression of an optimal C1C2 can safely improve function of the failing pig heart, perform biodistribution and toxicology studies, and file an IND for initiation of a clinical trial."
"9369683","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Bioinformatics Shared Resources (BISR) has undergone substantial change since the previous CCSG renewal in response to the changing technologies and accompanying informatics demands that have emerged during this period. The BISR has evolved from a facility largely focused on the development and management of databases and data storage/retrieval from various analytical sources (largely custom NimbleGen and Affymetrix microarrays) to one that is focused on addressing the challenges of massivelyparallel sequencing. In its current configuration, the BISR brings together multiple units at the AECC and the College to focus on the bioinformatics needs of investigators that utilize a variety of high-throughput genomic and epigenomic platforms, in particular massively-parallel sequencing, in their research. The components of the Bioinformatics Shared Resource include: (1) High-performance computing which was developed to meet the storage and processing needs of investigators based upon the sizes and complexities of data sets generated. High-performance computing has dedicated systems administrators, supporting relational database services and specialized high-performance computing resources, (ii) Computational genomics, (iii) The novel Wasp System software developed to receive, process, and provide initial analyses and presentation of data. Wasp has been designed not only to meet the data management needs of massively parallel sequencing but has been built with the flexibility that will allow adaptation to other types of datasets as they emerge in the future. The Bioinformatics Shared Resource works with Clinical Research Informatics to ensure that molecular data are fully interoperable with those of other AECC shared facilities, creating a virtual database integrating these disparate sources of information for analysis by biostatisticians and others. Clinical Research Informatics also addresses the increasing emphasis on clinical/translational studies by facilitating the development of effective, secure linkages with Montefiore Medical Center clinical data."
"9315675","PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroadaptive changes in gene expression due to repeated ethanol consumption is a major mechanism that underlies the transition from moderate to excessive drinking. Gene expression profiling studies of human alcoholics and ethanol dependent rodents have identified a multitude of ethanol-responsive gene networks. Little is known about how these networks are recruited into a neuroadaptive response. One mechanism could involve ethanol regulation of transcriptional co-regulators that bind and modulate the activity of several transcription factors, thereby orchestrating a diverse neuroadaptive transcriptional network. However, very few studies have identified transcriptional co-regulators in the brain that respond to ethanol and in turn regulate ethanol consumption.  In ongoing experiments we found evidence that the transcriptional co-regulator Lim-only 4 (LMO4) regulates ethanol consumption. LMO4 is expressed in brain regions important for addiction and recent work indicates that it plays an important role in cocaine sensitization and conditioned reward for sucrose. Our initial results show that LMO4 levels in the nucleus accumbens decrease during intermittent, binge-like ethanol consumption, and a gene trap mutation in the Lmo4 gene, which reduces LMO4 levels by 50%, increases the development of excessive ethanol consumption in male C57BL/6J mice.  Given these findings we propose that LMO4 is an ethanol-responsive, neuroadaptive transcriptional co-regulator that regulates ethanol consumption. This hypothesis will be addressed in two Specific Aims: (1) to determine whether LMO4 regulates ethanol consumption in both sexes, and (2) to identify brain regions in which LMO4 acts to moderate ethanol consumption. Should the results show that LMO4 in specific regions of the adult brain regulates ethanol consumption in male and female mice, future studies aimed at determining how ethanol regulates LMO4 and how LMO4 regulates ethanol consumption could shed new light on a fundamental mechanism by which ethanol provokes a neuroadaptive response that leads to excessive drinking."
"9335960","Project Summary Improved survival among human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV-1) infected individuals with the advent of antiretroviral therapy has clearly led to serious increase in the prevalence of noninfectious complications. In this regard, one of the most devastating sequelae is the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in HIV-infected individuals (HPAH). Intravenous drug use (IVDU) accounts for one-third of all new cases of AIDS in the United States and has been identified as the most common risk factor in the individuals diagnosed with HPAH. Our recent findings showing enhanced pulmonary vascular remodeling in HIV-infected lung tissues from IV heroin and/or cocaine abusers and in -infected macaques exposed to morphine indicate that illicit drugs and HIV-1 potentially act in concert to cause pulmonary arteriopathy. Furthermore, SIV-infected morphine treated macaques were found to have increased number of apoptotic endothelial cells in the early stage lesions, whereas complete occlusion by actively proliferating endothelial simian immunodeficiency (SIV) cells was observed in the advanced stage plexiform lesions. This observation was further supported by our in- vitro findings showing enhanced apoptosis followed by significantly increased proliferation of human pulmonary endothelial cells on simultaneous treatment with HIV- transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein and morphine compared to either treatment alone. Based on our recent findings, the hypothesis of our study is that the combined exposure of pulmonary endothelial cells to HIV-protein(s) and morphine results in the induction of autophagy that leads to enhanced proliferation of endothelial cells and severe pulmonary vascular remodeling. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims. In the first aim we will evaluate the effect of HIV- Tat and morphine on the oxidative stress mediated regulation of bulk autophagy in endothelial cells. In the second aim, we propose to delineate the role of autophagy/mitophagy in Tat and morphine mediated enhanced proliferation. Third aim will be focused on in-vivo investigation of PAH and autophagy in HIV-1 Tg rats with or without morphine exposure. These studies are innovative because to the best of our knowledge it will be the first attempt to understand the potential link between the role of autophagy/mitophagy in the morphine and HIV-proteins mediated apoptosis resistant enhanced proliferation. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HPAH and therefore is directly responsive to RFA-HL-14-024 (Basic Research in the Pathogenesis of HIV-Related Heart, Lung, and Blood (HLB) Diseases in Adults and Children)."

"9211589","Project Summary/Abstract American Indian (AI) children have high rates of chronic disease development including asthma, obesity and type 2 diabetes. The intestinal microbiome is a potential common contributor to all of these, yet no research currently exists examining the intestinal microbiome in AI children as a possible link to chronic disease development. This proposal includes several analyses to assess the contribution of race as well as prenatal exposures and early childhood environment to the colonization of the intestinal microbiome as well as possible links to chronic disease risk factors. The microbiome will be assessed both shortly after birth using stored meconium samples and again at three years of age. Longitudinal samples will help to delineate long term effects of prenatal exposures from effects of the early life environment and racial background. In addition to its relationship to exposures, this proposal will also explore links between the intestinal microbiome and risk factors for chronic disease, providing information about possible intervention strategies in at-risk populations. This is especially important for AI children as the risk for development of chronic disease is elevated and current prevention efforts have not achieved a reduction in risk. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop models to better understand how exposures relate to biological markers that can be used for disease prediction and intervention development."

"9282285","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Master of Science in Occupational Health degree - Industrial Hygiene program ((MSOH-IH) was originally founded in 1985 and currently is offered by the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine in the College of Medicine and Life Sciences at the University of Toledo Health Science Campus. This IH Program has been continuously accredited by the Applied Science Accreditation Commission - Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ASAC-ABET) for full (6- year) cycles since1996; with the last cycle approved for the period 2014-2020. The primary goal of the Program is to provide master-level education and training to full- and part-time graduate students and members of the public for the purpose of increasing their knowledge, comprehension, skills and attitudes essential to the advancement of occupational health and safety science, practice and research. This is accomplished via a combination of theoretical, practical and applied (i.e. case-based; problem-based) classroom, laboratory, and field teaching and research activities. The program educates and trains individuals mainly from Northwest Ohio region. In turn, graduates are employed as occupational health and safety specialists in the region. In addition, the program accepts students from outside the region and several alumni are employed in other areas throughout the USA, Canada, and Middle East countries. The Industrial Hygiene program adopted the ABET definition for Program Educational Objectives, that is, what the program graduates will be qualified to practice at the time of graduation and what most graduates will be able to achieve (e.g. certification; advanced degree; job promotion) a few years after graduation. The three Program Educational Objectives for the MSOH-IH program are: (1) AII graduates are expected to be qualified to practice comprehensive industrial hygiene. (2) Most graduates are expected to practice in the field of Industrial Hygiene or related areas of Environmental and/or Occupational Health and Safety and to meet the relevant and appropriate needs of their employers. (3) When eligible, based on degrees and post-graduate work experience (i.e. 4 years post-graduation), most graduates who pursue applicable certification in occupational health and safety (i.e. CIH; CSP; CHMM) will pass. The program is designed to educate and train 15-20 full-time (FT) or part-time (PT) students (~8 FTE) per year, with funding requested for the FT equivalent of 5 NIOSH trainees per year. Because the applicants to our Program are usually employed full-time and our classes are offered in the evenings and Saturdays, the NIOSH originally allowed us to award the scholarships to both FT and PT students. Since the last round of TPG funding (2009-2014) of the Program by NIOSH/CDC, the program has graduated 25 industrial hygienists (25/5=5/yr); 15 of those (60%; 3/yr), FT or PT, have been awarded scholarship from the funding. The program expects 16-17 IH students to be enrolled in the Program during the Fall semester 2014. As documented in this application, the IH program (a core discipline) at the University of Toledo has filled a critical gap in the Northwest Ohio workforce needs. ."

Towards achieving this goal, a unique and novel infrastructure will be established, that uses a collaborative trans-disciplinary, integrated team science approach, to test high impact ideas that will: lay the foundation for a new and comprehensive understanding of mechanisms driving disease; stimulate early and applied research on cutting-edge technologies; and, advance the research enterprise by accelerating the discovery of disease pathways involved in autoimmune diseases. Our AMP RA and Lupus Network Leadership Center (LC) will enable all of these deliverables to be met. The goal of  our LC is to establish a creative, nimble, and highly interactive group composed of leading scientists from  throughout the United States (24 institutions across 14 States) and internationally - each with overlapping  expertise in basic, clinical and translational research; technology invention, development, and  implementation; unique bioinformatics and statistical methodology; and extensive interactions with  biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical industry, disease foundations, NIH, and academic institutions. We have created a distributive model of leadership that takes advantage of the strengths of each of the participating investigators and centers, a model that we believe is necessary to complete the missions set forth in the AMP RFA. We will build a highly-functional infrastructure to meet not just the goals stated in the  RFA, but to enable discoveries to be made that are truly transformative in RA and SLE, and are applicable to  dozens of other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Very importantly, our proposal is not to create a model and infrastructure that will end in 2019, but rather to leverage this model to build a sustainable program that will accelerate discoveries in other disease areas, through funding from NIH, corporate partners, foundations, and philanthropy. The LC includes an LC Research Coordination, Management and Statistics Program (LCMP), a Systems Biology Research Group (SBG), and a Tissue Acquisition Research group (TRG), all of which are integrated and led by qualified faculty."
"9356569","Project Summary Recent advances in pharmacological treatment for cognitive deficits in fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down Syndrome (DS) have been numerous, resulting in a number of clinical trials that will soon proceed to stages of human testing in children and adults. However, treatment studies in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) face a number of measurement challenges, and few studies have been conducted to assess the suitability of neuropsychological measures for use in children with ID. In particular, while several pharmacological agents target the function of the hippocampus and associated memory systems, relatively little work has been completed to validate measures assessing function in this domain. Given that a number of proposed pharmacological agents target the function of the hippocampus, memory will likely be designated as a ?primary? outcome in a number of upcoming trials. This makes memory test validation a critical next step in supporting pharmacological approaches to cognitive interventions in ID. Thus, in the current proposal we plan to further develop and validate a theoretically-informed, comprehensive android touch-screen memory assessment system for use in young children with ID. Across 3 sites (University of Arizona, UC Davis, Drexel University) with extensive expertise in research with ID groups, we will first establish the usability, internal consistency, and form equivalence of the measure in 30 typically developing 3 year olds (Phase 1). In Phase 2, we will test the properties in a group with DS or FXS (n = 30, age 6H18 years) after measure revision and input from consultants and PIs. In Phase 3, we will determine the psychometric properties of the memory assessment in 180 children with DS and FXS (n=90 per group). We will evaluate floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency, validity, and sensitivity to developmental change and ID group effects. To determine the validity of each measure, we will correlate each test with other assessments, including the NIH Toolbox Early Childhood Battery, IQ, adaptive behavior, and parent-reported memory. Comparisons with mental age matched controls (n = 90, ages 3 to 6 years) will determine the sensitivity of the measures to detect group differences and cross-sectional age-related change during a critical period of memory development. The DS and FXS children will be re-assessed at 4 and 24 weeks to assess measurement retest- reliability and stability. As effective measures are required across a wide age range and in individuals with differing background characteristics, we will test how each measure?s psychometric properties may vary based on age and participant?s level of attention. We hope to better understand which subject characteristics might lead to inconsistent performance and define which measures may be effective across the majority of children with these syndromes. Through this work, we will provide evidence to help determine which measures may be strong primary outcomes for clinical trials in DS and FXS. The results of this investigation will provide a methodological advance that will set the field forward toward more consistent and valid assessment of this important domain for intervention studies of drug therapies as well as in behavioral cognitive  interventions."
"9312720","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the physiological abnormalities reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), both clinical studies and studies using animal models and have demonstrated marked impairments in immune competence, including delayed and deficient development of the immune system, depressed or overactive immune responses to challenge, and increased risk for infection and various forms of cancer, with many changes persisting into adolescence and adulthood. Impaired immune function in the alcohol-consuming mother, altered immunity at the fetal-placental interface, and disruption of the finely-tuned bidirectional communication between the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems appear to play a role in the deficits observed in prenatal alcohol-exposed (PAE) offspring.  The present proposal investigates when and how PAE can impact immune function, and will elucidate possible mechanisms underlying PAE's adverse effects on the mother, the fetus, and the interaction between maternal and fetal systems. The role of early life experience in programming the set-point or tone for stress and immune responsiveness to later life challenge will also be investigated. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To investigate the effects of alcohol consumption on neuroimmune function of the pregnant dam and fetus, and their possible link, in mediating alcohol-induced immune impairments in dams and PAE offspring via cytokine analysis (Expt 1A) and fetal microglia responsivity (Expt 1B). 2) To elucidate a developmental neuroimmune profile of PAE compared to control offspring from birth to adulthood to gain insight into how PAE, in the presence or absence of stress during the adolescent period, may differentially alter resting neuroimmune function and set the stage for vulnerability to stress or immune challenge in later life; 3) To investigate the role of early life immune challenge, imposed on an already sensitized organism (PAE), in modulating differential immune and neural outcomes of PAE and control animals following immune challenge in adulthood; 4) To elucidate mechanisms underlying the differential course of inflammation in PAE and control offspring observed previously, and to investigate possible differential effects of stress during adolescence, a sensitive developmental period, in modulating the course of inflammation in adulthood. Our working hypothesis is that fetal programming of stress and immune systems by PAE results in a primed, vulnerable pro-inflammatory-biased organism that is predisposed to increased responsiveness to immune challenge in adulthood. Elucidation of mechanisms underlying neuroimmune deficits in PAE offspring is critical for understanding the nature of the immune abnormalities seen in children with FASD, which will improve clinical care of these children, and ultimately improve their long-term health and well-being."
"9211588","Project Summary/Abstract  American Indian/Alaska Native (AI) undergraduates are drastically underrepresented in higher education, and have been the lowest ethnic group in completion of a bachelor's degree or higher. This is particularly critical in SD, because those who identify as AI alone represent 8.5% of the state's population and only 6.1% of the higher education student population. Even more alarming are the graduation rates, as AI students' 6 year graduation rate is 3.74 times lower than SD Whites. Relatively little research has explored AI students' experiences, particularly of those living in the Northern Plains. The present study works to fill gaps in the literature on tribal college students and the role of social networks on persistence and move both the research field forward while shedding light on how to curb educational disparities.  The proposed project will characterize AI college students' social support networks via social network analysis. Through interviews with AI and White college students (ages 18-25), on their strongest supports in three categories (family, friends, and institutional-level supports), we will map the strengths of these relationships with a blend of personalized and sociometric analysis. Next we will do comparisons of the social networks by institution (public vs. tribal), ethnicity (AI vs. White), and examine the changes in social networks over time. With this information, we will be able to provide a nuanced picture of AI students' strongest supports and how factors differ for AI students attending tribal college and public universities.  Importantly, the second focus of the proposed project is to examine how variations in AI college students' social networks either reduce or exacerbate the risk for drop-out. Using longitudinal data, we will examine various predictors from students' social network maps to predict their social-behavioral and educational outcomes. We will conceptualize important environmental factors such as institutional racial climate using the Ecological Model, and examine the students' outcomes in meeting the four areas of the Circle of Courage Model (belonging, mastery, independence, and generosity).  The impact of this project will be critical to increasing our understanding of the optimal institutional and personal supports for AI college students. It is innovative in advancing scientific understanding of the context of AI college students' transition to college, and will provide a clearer picture of the differences between social support at a tribal and public colleges. With support from the cores and mentoring team, the proposed project has great likelihood of success. The results will have many fruitful future directions for research, as well as the resulting policy implications will be significant towards decreasing educational disparities, resulting in greater health and economic equity for AI populations."

"9316403","SUMMARY - AGING ANIMAL MODELS AND LONGEVITY ASSESSMENT CORE The Aging Animal Models and Longevity Assessment Core (Animal Core) will continue a nearly 20-year history of leadership and innovation in 1) developing and providing new and established aging animal models, 2) administering nutritional and pharmacological interventions, and 3) collecting lifespan and life-history data for investigators in San Antonio and across the nation. It is housed in facilities specifically designed for and exclusive to aging animals and provides exceptional continuity of care and data collection by highly trained staff. Its underlying premise is that animal models aged under conditions that enable maximal longevity and optimal health is the foundation of meaningful aging research. An innovative and unique addition is the offering of two species of exceptional biogerontological interest [EBI]: the naked mole-rat and the marmoset. EBI species provide opportunities to discover mechanisms of exceptional longevity and test interventions in a non-human primate with the ultimate objective of promoting healthy aging in humans. The Animal Core has enabled seminal findings in Geroscience over the last 5 years including a) reassessment of the role of oxidative stress in aging, b) discoveries challenging the paradigm that dietary restriction universally extends lifespan and c) discoveries that rapamycin, acarbose and other drugs extend life and healthspan. These and other advances enabled by this Core underscore its importance as a generator of biogerontologic discovery. The Specific Aims of the Core are to continue enabling biogerontologic discovery by: 1. Breeding, maintaining and aging new and established mouse models to study the mechanisms  of aging and/or age-related disease. 2. Providing aging naked mole-rats and marmosets, two models of exceptional biogerontological  interest (EBI) for discovering mechanisms of longevity and healthy aging. 3. Conducting lifespan studies of genetically, nutritionally, and pharmacologically manipulated mice  to test hypotheses and discover mechanisms of aging and identify potential therapies. 4. Providing diets containing rapamycin and other drugs of biogerontological interest. 5. Educating, training and advising faculty, fellows, and students interested in aging research on  experimental design with respect to the special husbandry requirements of aging laboratory  rodents, naked mole-rats and the marmoset in aging research. The major objective of the SA Shock Center is to facilitate the study of models in which aging is delayed in order to identify underlying mechanisms and therapeutic targets. The Animal Core plays a critical role in this objective. Its facilities, staff and organization enable seamless integration with data collection from Pathology and Healthspan Cores, as well as interaction with the Pharmacology Core when needed. The proposed Animal Core is thus poised, in concert with the other Cores, to continue enabling biogerontological discovery."
"9380809","Protective immunity to infectious pathogens requires the coordinated differentiation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Increasingly powerful and systematic profiling of the transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic changes that occur during this differentiation has identified an immense catalog of genes and pathways that could play a role in regulating T cell differentiation in response to acute infection. The challenge is now to ascribe functions to each of the genes that have been identified as part of the broad reprogramming of cell state that occurs during CD8+ and CD4+ T cell differentiation. This proposal seeks to use loss-of-function Cas9/CRISPR-mediated genetic screens in vivo to systematically identify the critical genes that govern the differentiation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in response to acute infection.  We have developed a genetic screening platform that uses pooled, in vivo CRISPR-mediated loss-of- function genetic screens to identify genes that positively or negatively regulate the development of effector and memory populations. We have already used this platform to conduct pooled libraries with sequencing-based deconvolution to test in parallel the function of over 100 genes in CD8+ T cells responding to acute infection. This proof-of-principle screen successfully recovered known positive and negative regulators of effector differentiation. Building on these initial studies, we now propose to extend this system to identify and validate regulators of T cell response to acute infection in mouse models and human cells in the following aims: Aim 1: Curate candidate regulators from scRNA-seq profiles of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells during acute infection using scRNA-seq profiles. We will use massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq to deeply profile antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells during acute infection and use computation modeling (with Core B) to identify candidate regulators. From this rich dataset we will identify a set of potential regulatory molecules that will be screened in Aim 2. Aim 2: Perform pooled CRISPR screens to identify regulators of CD8+ and CD4+ fate and function. We will use pooled CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genetic screens to survey the function of thousands of genes in regulating differentiation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. We will screen using defined phenotypes that will uncover genes that: initiate and sustain effector and memory differentiation; guide to a memory fate commitment; govern lineage choice; or regulate the acquisition of specific patterns of cytokine secretion. Aim 3: Validate candidates that regulate CD8 and CD4 differentiation in mouse models and human T cells. To validate these candidate regulators we will use an extensive set of cellular immunological assays in vivo and in vitro to probe their function individually using genome editing or conventional knockouts where available. We will complement these studies with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing in primary CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from healthy human subjects to test whether their regulatory role is conserved in human T cells."
"9468257","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Despite standard care, 25%-50% of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) progress to chronic post- thrombotic syndrome (PTS) resulting in significant disability, loss of productivity, and healthcare costs. This is a problem encountered frequently among our numerous Veterans undergoing surgery, anesthesia, traumatic and acute injury, and surgical critical care. Venous valvular reflux from an organized thrombus is the primary cause of PTS. Veins with rapid and complete thrombus resolution have a lower incidence of reflux. We have observed that thrombus resolution is enhanced by increased blood flow and that moderate upper or lower extremity exercise result in increased venous blood flow. Hence, we postulate that a progressive exercise training program in patients with DVT will increase lower extremity venous flow, accelerate thrombus resolution, and decrease the risk of PTS. The primary hypothesis is that increased blood flow across the thrombus (induced by supervised exercise) will accelerate thrombus resolution and decrease PTS. The overall goal is to determine whether exercise can lower the risk of PTS in patients with acute DVT, and to investigate possible mechanisms by which this occurs. We propose a 2-year randomized clinical trial of standard therapy compared to standard therapy plus exercise in patients with acute lower extremity DVT. Aim 1 will test whether a 3-month exercise training program prevents PTS and improves quality of life over 2 years of follow-up. Patients with acute lower extremity DVT (iliac-femoral-popliteal) will be randomized to standard therapy (control group receiving: anticoagulation, compression, ambulation ad-lib) alone, or to exercise plus standard therapy. The study will recruit 164 patients to achieve 80% power to detect a 50% decrease in prevalence of PTS at 2 years, and a decrease in severity of PTS through 2 years of follow-up in the exercise group vs. standard care. Aim 2 will investigate mechanisms by which the exercise program may act to prevent PTS, namely systemic markers of fibrinolysis and thrombus resolution. Aim 3 will investigate alternate mechanisms of decreased PTS that are more direct results of the exercise therapy, namely: improving venous hemodynamics and functional capacity. Collectively, these results will allow us to understand the basis of a novel conceptual model that progressive aerobic and resistive exercise aids in the treatment of DVT and prevention of PTS through mechanisms of enhanced thrombus resolution, fibrinolytic and vascular repair, calf muscle pump action, and functional ability. This will be a novel therapeutic intervention for maintenance and restoration of tissue function after DVT."

"9306931","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS) Renewal 1 of 5 Johns Hopkins Washington County Field Center Principal Investigator (Josef Coresh, MD, PhD). Rationale: Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population and ARIC is uniquely suited to contribute critical information on the vascular, and potentially preventable, contributions to dementia and MCI incidence. Progress: ARIC NCS (Visit 5: 2011-13) measured a battery of cognitive tests on ARIC participants aged 70- 89 and all study goals were met or exceeded, completing 6,538 exams, 2009 MRIs (520 in African-Americans) with a large number of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) cases currently being adjudicated. Early papers were submitted within a month of completion of data collection and promising work is ongoing (~50 manuscript proposals). Collection of cognitive decline in late-life is needed and time sensitive since the cohort is experiencing ~5% annual mortality (mean age 78 years). Design: Follow-up cognitive testing (~30-year f/u, 2015-2018), at ages where cognitive decline begins to manifest across several domains or accelerates, thus providing many additional, diverse outcomes in the ARIC cohort (15,792 men and women ages 45-65 recruited in 1986-1989 and followed with detailed examinations). Outcomes: The late life cognitive outcomes targeted in the renewal differ from the one-time static measures of cognitive performance now available from the ARIC NCS baseline exam.  A. Decline in global cognitive ability, executive function/processing speed, memory, and language -  assessed during in ~4214, ~4 years after V5 (more comprehensive than possible in previous visits  which had a more limited 3 test battery similar to older cardiovascular studies; 2nd visit in oldest subset).  B. Incidence of MCI and dementia - detect ~1,521 dementia 1,134 MCI incident cases using procedures  established after NCS V5 (2011-2013; expanded ARIC's semi-annual calls; response rate ~90%).  C. Progression from MCI to dementia - following the 1,402 MCI cases identified at V5. Aims: We will study a wealth of modifiable vascular risk factors and measures of microvascular disease and atherosclerosis in midlife, many not available in other studies of cognition, for their contribution to late life cogntive decline and physical function. We will study the detailed 3T brain MRI imaging at visit 5 as a risk factor for cognitive decline at older age. We will determine if any of these associations are different in African- Americans, where longitudinal cognitive data are nearly non-existent and vascular burden is high, than in white ARIC participants. We will share these data all ARIC ancillaries (Appendix 4), including detailed genetic and biochemical studies across the lifespan. Summary: This NCS visit (V6: 2015-2018; V7: 2017-2018 in oldest subset) will advance knowledge about the potentially modifiable vascular contribution to cognitive decline in late life and provide the cornerstone for other synergistic ancillary studies by a large community of investigators which would not otherwise be possible."
"9315081","Project Summary The Lung Phenotyping Core, designated as Core C, is a centralized facility that provides primary murine alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages from lungs, as well as satellite cells and muscle to each of the three projects and Core B. Core C also maintains secondary lung cell lines for the PPG. Centralization of the cell culture facilities will ensure that continuous supply of high-quality primary alveolar epithelial cells are available to each of the three projects and Core B. Core C will use advanced flow cytometry capabilities to quantify, phenotype and sort specific inflammatory and parenchymal cell populations from the murine lung. The sorting and isolation capabilities of the Core will allow cell type specific assessment of proteostasis networks via mass spectroscopy (as outlined by Core B). Core C will also isolate muscle satellite cells from mouse skeletal muscles; we have established the optimal culture conditions for cell proliferation and myotube formation of mouse satellite cells. The Core personnel have extensive experience in the isolation of primary alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages from human and mouse lungs, as well as general cell culture techniques. The consolidated cell culture facility provides an economical means of isolating and culturing primary and secondary cells. This translates into reduced overall costs (i.e., personnel, reagents, and animals) and more importantly maintains the quality of the cells used in research. The Core will also provide investigators with well-characterized mouse models of influenza A-induced pneumonia and quantitative measurements of lung inflammation, lung injury, and muscle function will be conducted by Core C according to the research plan outlined in Projects 1, 2, and 3. In addition, Core C will conduct RNA analysis to assess the relationship between specific gene expression and proteostasis using the Northwestern University Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Core Facility. High throughput sequencing technology will be used to study transcriptome dynamics. Additionally, the project investigators have proposed several murine strains, many of which will be bred with cell-type or tissue specific Cre recombinase lines to induce a tissue-specific knockout by Core C. Many of the strains will be used in more than one project, highlighting the synergy and economies of scale achievable by this Program Project."
"9392696","ABSTRACT  The 9/11 World Trade Center terrorist attack was a massive disaster, resulting in long-term physical and psychological trauma to the responders, in particular PTSD and lower respiratory symptoms (LRS), with 10-20% of responders experiencing symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of PTSD a decade later. Our group found that PTSD in WTC responders is closely linked to their respiratory diseases, and PTSD mediated the relationship between WTC exposures and LRS. Genetic vulnerability and gene-environment interactions have been implicated in the etiology of PTSD. In our pilot study of a discovery cohort of N=195 WTC responders, we found significant differences in gene expression between responders with versus without a current WTC-PTSD diagnosis, using whole genome transcriptome analysis. Expression of relevant genes in remitted PTSD cases was intermediary between current cases and non-cases. Importantly, previously implicated genes (FKBP5, NR3C1) were differentially expressed along with several interleukin (IL4, IL2), insulin receptor, B-cell, lymphocytes and PTEN signaling pathways that are linked to inflammatory diseases and to cancers. We tested the resulting expression composite in an independent replication sample of N=87 responders and achieved an AUC of .734. The composite also showed a robust linear association with a self- reported measure of PTSD symptom severity, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) (Spearman r=0.422). These preliminary findings support the potential importance of gene expression research to identify biomarkers of PTSD. The proposed study builds on this exciting pilot work by evaluating association between changes in gene expression with changes in PTSD symptom severity and LRS across an 18-month period. Using our banked blood samples, we will conduct state-of-the-art high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to generate transcriptome profiles from whole blood at an average sequencing depth of 50M reads per sample per time point (for each of the two time points). In Aim 1 of this study, we will investigate the association between changes in gene expression (gene, isoform and splice variant levels) and changes in PTSD symptoms across an 18-month period at gene as well the genetic pathways implicated by these changes; and identify the Gene Expression Signature (GES) associated with change in PTSD symptoms. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether the GES is associated with change in each PTSD symptom dimension (re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, hyperarousal). We expect to find both common and distinct genes/pathways regulating the change in each PTSD symptom dimension. In Aim 3, we will test the directionality of prospective associations between the GES score and PTSD symptom severity, i.e., whether the GES at the first time point predicts PTSD severity 18 months later, and vice versa. In Aim 4, we will evaluate whether the change in GES is associated with change in LRS. We hypothesize that any association observed between the GES and LRS will be mediated by change in PTSD symptom severity, indicating shared biological mechanisms underpinning PTSD-LRS comorbidity. This will be the first longitudinal study to identify the gene and isoform expression signatures associated with change in PTSD symptoms overall, as well as each of four PTSD symptom dimensions and comorbid LRS. An in-depth understanding of the biological processes underpinning PTSD, and identification of its GES carries clinical significance by identifying processes that maintain PTSD and can be targeted for intervention, and will inform treatment development for WTC responders as well as other trauma-exposed populations."
"9264508","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The laboratory mouse is the preeminent animal model system for investigation into the biology and genetics of human cancer. Mouse models have provided key insights into cancer susceptibility, the molecular genetics of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and therapy response in pre-clinical and co-clinical studies. Human tumors engrafted into immune compromised and humanized mice (aka, Patient Derived Xenografts) are playing an increasingly important role in basic and translational cancer biology. The Mouse Tumor Biology (MTB) database is a unique on-line compendium of mouse models for human cancer. MTB provides electronic access to expertly curated information on diverse mouse models for human cancer along with tools for accessing and visualizing associated data from these models (http://tumor.informatics.jax.org). MTB integrates data from peer-reviewed literature and from direct submissions from researchers. Data in MTB are also obtained from other bioinformatics resources including PathBase, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress. The MTB project team has a strong record of supporting the use of the mouse in basic cancer biology and genetics research by providing expertly curated data that facilitates the selection of appropriate strains of mice for cancer genetics research. In this proposal we describe our plans for the continued development of MTB with an emphasis on expanded support for mouse-human comparative cancer genomics and the use of the mouse in translational and pre-clinical work. The major goals for the project renewal include the following: *continue to populate MTB with data on strain-specific patterns of tumorigenesis in inbred, mutant, and  genetically engineered mice, * incorporate new data types and develop new user interfaces for accessing information and data related to  Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models of human cancer, develop new interfaces to support mouse-human comparative cancer genomics, and support the infrastructure of MTB and our user community through ongoing database maintenance,  development of new software components, user support services, and community outreach activities."
"9306710","Project Summary/Abstract ? Project 1 One in four women has moderate to severe symptoms of some type of pelvic floor disorder and up to 1 in 7 undergo surgery for these conditions in her lifetime. Associations between vaginal parity, pelvic organ prolapse and pelvic floor symptoms are well established; for many women, the stage for future pelvic floor disorders is set with the first vaginal delivery, yet we know little about how to maximize recovery following this seminal event. This knowledge gap limits developing strategies to modify risks in order to prevent deterioration of pelvic floor support and symptoms after vaginal delivery. Further research that provides insight into the earliest onset of the pathogenic process is needed. Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), the focus of Project 1, is a direct measure of the forces experienced by the pelvic floor but has rarely been studied except in limited clinical settings. Our group has developed and tested a novel intra-vaginal transducer that measures IAP and wirelessly transmits the data to a small, pager-like data storage device. In this project, we plan to use this system to study how IAP impacts two primary outcomes at 1 year postpartum: 1) pelvic floor support and 2) pelvic floor symptoms. The scope of this project is relevant to NICHD's described mission, to ensure that ?women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes?, and specifically addresses pelvic floor disorders, as emphasized in the portfolio of the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch. This project will use the Primiparous Cohort established by the Clinical Coordination Core to achieve these aims: Aim 1: Determine whether IAP measured at 8 weeks postpartum during a) lifting and b) abdominal muscle endurance testing predicts pelvic floor support and symptoms 1 year postpartum. Aim 2: Determine whether IAP measured for one week during daily life at 6 months postpartum predicts pelvic floor support and symptoms 1 year postpartum. Exploratory Aim 3: Determine whether measures of muscular fitness modify the effect of IAP during lifting on pelvic floor support at 1 year postpartum. Translational aim: Using data from Aim 2 of this Project and Project 2, in which physical activity is measured using accelerometry for a 7 day period at 6 months postpartum, explore the relationships between data obtained from the vaginal pressure sensor and wrist-worn accelerometry."
"9284501","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed study is to systematically survey the molecular functions of newly-described unconventional RNA-binding proteins (ucRBPs). ucRBPs bind RNA in cells, but have not yet been associated with sequence-specific RNA binding. Therefore, they potentially represent a large pool of heretofore-unknown RNA regulators: ~800 ucRBPs have been identified to date. The analyses we propose will (i) determine whether each ucRBP binds specific RNA sequences or specific RNA transcripts; (ii) identify protein partners of the ucRBPs, which may confer specificity, and/or may act as effectors; (iii) apply advanced computational analyses to pinpoint biochemical and physiological functions of ucRBPs from large-scale data sets and the literature, and (iv) will explore the function of a selected subset of ucRBPs in greater detail. Together, these rapid and cost effective analyses will elucidate and validate the functions of ucRBPs, pave the way for mapping new regulatory mechanisms, identify potential functions for many human sequence variants, and will have broad impact on fields ranging from gene regulation to human genetics."
"9338273","Project Summary Fanconi's Anemia (FA) is a genetic bone marrow failure syndrome that presents in childhood. Congenital malformations and increased cancer risk, particularly acute myelogenous leukemia, are additional manifestations of the disorder. Eighteen distinct genes responsible for the FA phenotype have been identified and together constitute the FA/BRCA network which functions to maintain genome stability and ensure stem cell survival. FA is associated with significant morbidity and early mortality and therapeutic options remain suboptimal. In the past funding period this Program Project succeeded in discovering new drug targets and small molecules for FA therapy. All of these candidates have clinical potential and we are on the threshold of new interventions for this severe disease. The key goal of the project in the next funding period is to prioritize a single drug regimen from our small list of candidates and to generate the preclinical data needed for starting a clinical trial. This Program Project will use a multidisciplinary approach to achieve this goal. The clinical disciplines represented include pediatrics, hematology, oncology and medical genetics. The scientific areas of expertise include molecular hematology, xenotransplantation, DNA repair, cell biology and mouse genetics. Project 1 will explore compounds that have already shown promise in FA mouse models such as metformin, p38 MAPK inhibitors, antioxidants and androgens, both singly and in combination. Project 2 will focus on inhibitors of the TGF-? pathway for the treatment of FA. Project 3 will use primary human cells from FA patients to study the compounds from projects 1 and 2. In addition, the regulatory groundwork for a clinical trial will be done. Core B will evaluate compounds in xenotransplant models of human hematopoiesis. Core C will perform a variety of DNA damage assays in support of all projects. Core D is a biorepository and Core A will provide administrative support."
"9309989","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With over 25% of HIV-infected individuals co-infected with HCV, chronic liver disease is one the leading causes of death among persons with HIV. The majority of HIV-HCV co-infected persons continue to drink and alcohol has an adverse effect on the course of chronic HCV infection, causing more rapid progression of liver fibrosis, even at low levels of ingestion. There have been few drinking reduction trials that compare known efficacious interventions in HIV populations, and none targeting the HIV population with comorbid HCV, where the stakes of any drinking are high. Despite dramatic improvements in the treatment of HCV, only a small minority of HIV-HCV co-infected persons receives therapy due to a variety of barriers, most prominently alcohol. Medical authorities generally recommend complete abstinence from alcohol as recent evidence suggests there may be no safe level of alcohol consumption for co-infected persons. Brief behavioral interventions are the only viable approach to reduce drinking across the large and heterogeneous group of HIV-HCV drinkers in real world settings. Two types of brief intervention, Brief Advice (BA) and Motivational Interviewing (MI), have been shown to be efficacious in reducing drinking in non-HIV samples. Our goal is to determine whether offering counseling beyond Brief Advice, namely MI, has greater alcohol reduction effects. In the proposed randomized trial, all 300 HIV-HCV co-infected participants will receive BA delivered by their HIV PCP during a regular HIV visit and will then be randomized to either a 30-minute Motivational Interviewing Intervention with a Behavioral Counselor (MI) or to HIV clinic treatment-as-usual. After this initial meeting, drinking check-in (MI or BA) sessions will then be provided telephonically every three months for 18 months, with a final assessment at 24 months. Our primary outcome is drinks per week. We propose three Aims: Aim 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of MI versus BA in reducing drinking among 300 HIV-HCV co-infected primary care patients; Aim 2: To compare the effectiveness of MI vs. BA on liver outcomes (FIB4, APRI, initiation of HCV treatment); Aim 3: To conduct a cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) of MI versus BA. Efficacious brief interventions focusing on reduction in alcohol use have neither targeted HCV-HIV co-infected persons nor addressed low levels of use. This proposal links alcohol use explicitly to liver disease progression and intervenes with drinking behaviors consistently over time paralleling chronic HCV infection. Both interventions being tested can be readily integrated into a variety of HIV treatment settings and are sustainable, could impact the care of co-infected persons nationwide."
"9302597","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal ethanol exposure is the leading known cause of mental retardation. Growing evidence suggests that excessive cell death is a major component of the pathogenesis of ethanol-induced birth defects. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how ethanol leads to apoptotic cell death in embryos. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of small 18-23 nucleotide non-coding RNA that have been implicated in the regulation of genes involved in apoptosis. We have recently discovered that miR-34a, a pro-apoptotic miRNA and miR-125b, an anti-apoptotic miRNA are involved in ethanol-induced apoptosis in neural crest cells (NCCs). Our long-term goal is directed toward the development of effective strategies against ethanol's teratogenesis; strategies based on prevention of ethanol-induced apoptosis through targeting specific pathways involved in apoptosis. The overall objective of this particular proposal is to establish miRNA as a feasible target for the prevention of ethanol-induced apoptosis and teratogenesis. The central hypothesis to be tested is that miR-34a and miR-125b modulate ethanol-induced apoptosis in NCCs by the regulation of p53 and Bcl2 signaling pathways and that the inhibition of miR-34a or overexpression of miR-125b can prevent ethanol-induced teratogenesis. Our hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data produced in our laboratory. To test our hypothesis, the following specific aims will be addressed: Aim1: To characterize the role of miR-34a and miR-125b in ethanol-induced apoptosis in NCCs. We will determine the effects of ethanol on miR-34a and miR-125b expression in NCCs and in mouse embryos, and the involvement of miR-34a and miR-125b in ethanol-induced apoptosis. Aim2: To test the hypothesis that miR-34a and miR- 125b modulate ethanol-induced apoptosis in NCCs by the regulation of p53 and Bcl2 pathways. This will be accomplished by determining the role of miR-34a in ethanol-induced activation of p53 and suppression of Bcl2 signaling and the effects of down-regulation of miR-125b by ethanol on p53 and Bcl2 signaling in ethanol- exposed NCCs. Aim3: To test the hypothesis that modulation of miR-34a and miR-125b represents a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing ethanol-induced teratogenesis. We will determine whether knockdown of miR-34a or overexpression of miR-125b diminishes ethanol-induced malformations in mouse embryos. The proposed work is innovative, because it focuses on a novel approach, targeting miRNAs involved in apoptosis, to preventing ethanol-induced teratogenesis. The theoretical concept described in this application is also highly innovative because this is the first study attempting to prevent ethanol-induced apoptosis and teratogenesis specifically through the newly recognized actions of miR-34a and miR-125b in apoptosis. The results from this study will be significant, because the insights gained by the accomplishment of these aims will help in elucidating the role of miRNAs in modulating ethanol-induced teratogenesis. They are also expected to yield strategies for preventing ethanol's teratogenesis and to fundamentally advance the field of FASD research."
"9312760","Project 4  Title : RND1-mediated Breast Cancer Suppression  Leader: Filippo G. Giancotti, M.D., Ph.D.  Key Personnel: Young-Mi Kim, Ph.D, Postdoctoral Research Scholar   Surajit Sinha, Ph.D., Postdoctoral Research Scholar  PROJECT SUMMARY:  We have identified RND1, encoding a Rho family GTPase, as a tumor suppressor inactivated in aggressive  breast cancers. Upon silencing of Rnd1, mammary epithelial cells underwent an Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal  Transformation (EMT) and became senescent, implying that they had suffered an oncogenic insult. Expression  of c-Myc rescued Rnd1-depleted cells from senescence and enabled them to form invasive, multi-acinar  structures in 3D Matrigel. Moreover, silencing of Rnd1 conferred tumorigenic and invasive properties upon the  stem-like Comma-1D cells. Conversely, expression of Rnd1 suppressed the ability of the basal-like 4T1 cells to  colonize the lung upon tail-vein injection. Intriguingly, depletion of Rnd1 potently activated oncogenic Ras  signaling and mechanistic studies indicated that Rnd1 suppresses Ras by binding to and activating the atypical  Ras-GAP domain of Plexin B1. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that genetic and epigenetic mechanisms  contribute to inactivate RND1 and thereby activate Ras signaling in a substantial fraction of basal-like and  Triple Negative (TN) breast cancers. Based on these new findings, we propose to further examine the tumor  suppressor function of Rnd1 in cultured cells and mouse models and to develop strategies for the treatment of  Rnd1-deficient breast cancers. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the molecular mechanisms through which  Rnd1 suppresses Ras signaling, EMT, and oncogenesis. Our Preliminary Studies indicate that Rnd1  suppresses Ras signaling and EMT by binding to the insert segment of the split Ras GAP domain of Plexin B1,  which acts selectively on Rap1. To examine the mechanism by which Rnd1 suppresses Ras signaling, EMT,  and oncogenesis, we will use genetic reconstitution with wild type and mutant forms of various signaling  proteins followed by biochemical, phenotypic and functional analysis. Based on the known functions of Rap1,  we will examine if Rap1 promotes Ras signaling by inactivating p120 Ras-GAP as well as by activating BRAF.  In addition, we will explore why loss of Rnd1 produces a dominant effect in mammary epithelial cells  expressing additional Ras-GAP proteins. These studies will be conducted in collaboration with Neal Rosen  (Project 3). In Specific Aim 2, we will examine if genetic inactivation of Rnd1 contributes to initiate and maintain  mammary tumorigenesis and promotes metastasis in mice. Our Preliminary Studies indicate that inactivation of  Rnd1 confers tumorigenic and invasive properties upon Comma-1D cells. To examine if inactivation of Rnd1 is  sufficient to initiate and is necessary to maintain mammary tumorigenesis in vivo or it cooperates with other  oncogenic lesions to mediate these effects, we will make use of a new technology developed by the Lowe  laboratory (Core B: Speedy Mice). Tet-inducible shRNAs will be introduced in ES cells at the Col1 locus by  using a cassette exchange strategy and in then in mice by using tetraploid complementation. Mice carrying  these alleles will be crossed to MMTV-rtTTA mice and the compound mice crossed to MMTV-Myc mice as well  as Tp53+/- mice. In vivo and ex vivo studies will be conducted to study the effect of ablation of Rnd1, alone or in  combination with overexpression of Myc or inactivation of p53 on mammary tumor initiation, maintenance, and  metastasis. In this Aim, we will also examine the role of Id1 as an additional cooperating oncogenic alteration.  These studies will be performed in collaboration with Robert Benezra (Project 2). In Specific Aim 3, we will  develop pharmacological strategies for the treatment of Rnd1-deficient breast cancers. Our Preliminary Studies  indicate that inhibition of MEK suppresses the proliferation, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth of  MCF-10A cells transformed by loss of Rnd1. To examine if inhibition of MEK is a potentially effective  therapeutic strategy for Rnd1-deficient breast cancers, we will conduct preclinical studies on multiple Rnd1-  deficient breast cancer cells. In collaboration with Neil Rosen and Jos? Baselga (Project 3), we will examine  the preclinical efficacy of two novel allosteric MEK inhibitors. Since the effect of pharmacological inhibition of  the Ras-ERK pathway is often limited by release of negative feed back loops, which operate to restrain its  activation, or other resistance mechanisms, we will identify the specific mechanism of resistance operating in  Rnd1-deficient cancer cells and develop pharmacological combinations designed to improve the effect of MEK  inhibitors. Potentially effective drug combinations will undergo testing in xenograft models."
"9320006","Immunotherapy is based on the premise that there are intrinsic differences in the protein  composition of tumor cells that allow the immune system to recognize tumor cells as ?foreign? and  eradicate them. There is increasing evidence that tumors respond to immunotherapy [1], particularly  in scenarios of minimal disease [2- 4]. Because immunotherapy is effective in treating small  amounts of disease, it seems ?obvious? that if one could reduce tumor size with  surgery/chemotherapy, the addition of immunotherapy would eliminate the minimal amount of residual  disease and lead to a cure (i.e. the concept of adjuvant immunotherapy). Unfortunately, dozens of  clinical trials using immunotherapy (usually vaccines) after surgery for a variety of cancers have  been conducted and virtually all have failed [5-7]. As a graduate student, I obtained data  suggesting that debulking surgery fails to eliminate immunosuppressive networks consisting of  cellular and soluble factors at the (i) resection site, (ii) draining lymph nodes and (iii) blood  [2]. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that disruption of post-operative  immunosuppressive networks is necessary to maximize efficacy of immunotherapy.  Using Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) as a model, our proposed research aims to (1) determine  the potential efficacy and mechanisms of a series of clinically available agents hypothesized to  decrease immunosuppressive effects and (2) analyze combinations of immunotherapy, surgery, and  chemotherapy in order to identify the optimal regimen for future clinical trials. MPM is an  excellent choice to study this approach as the disease remains essentially incurable despite  multi-modal approaches (including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) [8] and our group has greater  than 15 years of experience in human immunotherapy clinical trials for MPM [9-14]. The research  will also serve as a training platform for the applicant towards competency in tumor immunology,  mammalian cell techniques, and murine experiments, as well as provide the applicant with mentoring  towards the goal of becoming an independent investigator in translational tumor immunology.  This work will set the stage for the next generation of clinical trials which combines multi-modal  immunotherapy with surgical resection for patients with MPM. These findings will also be applicable  to other malignancies that are treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation."
"9358725","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of next-generation sequencing data in large-scale association studies provides a unique research opportunity. The data contains the information that is required to identify causal disease susceptibility loci (DSL) for many mental health phenotypes and psychiatric diseases. In order to translate the wealth of information into DSL discovery, powerful statistical methodology is required. So far, a large number of rare variant association tests have been proposed. However, they do not incorporate all the important information about the variants. So far, none of the existing approaches takes the physical location of the variant into account. Under the assumption that deleterious DSLs and protective DSLs cluster in different genomic regions, we will develop a general association analysis framework that is built on spatial clustering approaches. The framework will be able to handle complex phenotypes, e.g. binary, quantitative, etc., and be applicable to different study designs, i.e. family-based studies and designs of unrelated subjects. If the DSLs cluster indeed, the increase of statistical power of the approach will be of practical relevance, enabling the discovery of DSLs. In the absence of DSL clustering, our approach will achieve similar power levels as existing methodology. Furthermore, in order to test larger genomic regions for association, we will develop network-based association methodology. The network-based approach will have sufficient power for larger genomic region than existing approaches, and, at the same time, provide an intuitive understanding of the complex relationships between the variants that drive the association, fostering new biological insights. The approach can incorporate complex phenotypes and different design types. We will also use the information about the physical locations of the rare variants to detect population substructure/admixture. Since rare variants are genetically much younger than common variants, approaches that take the physical locations of the variants and their clustering into account will provide a much finer resolution picture of population substructure in sequence data than existing approaches, e.g., EIGENSTRAT. We will use community-detection algorithm for the classification of study subjects in genetic homogenously subgroups. All the proposed methodology will be implemented in user- friendly software packages with existing user-communities, i.e. PBAT, NPBAT and R."
"9320775","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing racial disparity in obesity has reached a critical juncture, particularly among black and white females. Obesity is now being perpetuated across generations. While there is uncertainty about how best to prevent obesity and the related racial disparities, converging lines of evidence support the influence of stress on obesity. We hypothesize that income and race are associated with higher levels of both objective and perceived stress, which in turn are associated with higher rates of dysregulated eating, a behavior posited to result in an increased rate of obesity. Finally, we propose that stress has a direct effect on the level of obesity in the offspring. We propose to model these relationships longitudinally using the National Growth and Healthy Study (NGHS) that enrolled equal numbers of black and white girls and that contains extensive measures of life stress, nonhomeostatic eating, household demographic and socioeconomic indicators and cardiometabolic risk factors for black and white girls initially sampled at age 10 and interviewed annually until age 20. We will extend these data, adding a new wave of data collection for the women who are now 36 and their children. We will interview participants regarding their current levels of stress, household food insecurity, dysregulated eating behaviors such as dietary restraint and overeating, and collect data on dietary intake and physical activity. We will collect measured weight and central adiposity and clinical measures of metabolic syndrome on both the women and their children. Building on the rich source of longitudinal data that NGHS provides, we will model relationships between these factors and weight status from early childhood to adulthood among these women and their children in order to examine the effects of cumulative stress, eating behaviors and obesity on obesity in the next generation. The study aims to test the hypotheses that: 1) stress and dysregulated eating results in an increased rate of obesity, exacerbated by food insecurity; 2) maternal stress and dysregulated eating have a direct effect on the level of obesity and markers of metabolic syndrome in offspring; and, 3) race and income are associated with higher levels of stress and dysregulated eating in women. Our preliminary data suggests that stress leads to excessive weight gain ten years later in the NGHS cohort. We will identify predictors of weight gain trajectories from childhood to adulthood. These constructs have the potential to lead to promising interventions coupled with traditional diet and physical activity components that will help girls and women throughout the life course."
"9316501","The Comparative Data Analytics Core (CDAC) will provide not only high-level customized statistical support for basic science investigators studying aging and energetics in diverse model organisms at UAB, but also a venue for development of de novo methods specially for such research, a nidus for training others at and beyond UAB in such research, and a platform for the dissemination of such methods to the aging research community at large. The core leadership comprises statistical scientists with a 20-year history of studying the interface of aging, energetics and body composition. They bring not only their statistical expertise, but their experience with and zeal for the science of comparative studies at the interface of aging and energetics.  The need for specialized statistical expertise, training, and support in aging research is clear. Statistical analyses of aging research data provide many challenges. Aging research involves longitudinal analyses and modeling the dependency of multiple observations taken over time, and accommodating the missing data which commonly occurs with longitudinal studies. With time-to-event (e.g., survival) outcomes, left, right, and interval censoring add further complexities. Statistical approaches in comparative biology face challenges such as phylogenetic dependence among model residuals, complicating inference.  Non-statistician researchers benefit from the support and involvement of statistical scientists who are deeply involved in the subject matter, who can tailor methods to the situation at hand, who work with the biologists from the beginning as an engaged part of the research team, who can discuss the methods with the biologists and explain the statistical procedures and who can develop new statistical methods for specific needs. To that end, the UAB CDAC offers the following specific aims: 1. To provide statistical support for UAB investigators studying the comparative energetics of aging, including  traditional, specialized, and bespoke methods. 2. To provide statistical support for non-UAB investigators studying the comparative energetics of aging,  including traditional, specialized, and bespoke methods. 3. To conduct high-level statistical investigations of secondary data to answer questions about the  comparative energetics of aging. 4. To develop and evaluate statistical methods needed in the field of the comparative energetics of aging. 5. To provide an organized series of educational offerings on statistical methods for the comparative  energetics of aging which permit dissemination of expertise and knowledge to the broader scientific community. An investment in this core will achieve dividends by catalyzing more informative and rigorous research on aging within the UAB NSC and for the community of aging researchers at large."
"9279211","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of asthma exacerbations are caused by viral infections, and childhood viral infections contribute to asthma pathogenesis. Virus-induced asthma exacerbations continue to account for significant morbidity and mortality, because effective antiviral therapies are not available. In asthma, airway epithelial Interferon-lambda (IFN-?) is deficient, which results in impaired antiviral immune responses. We have shown that viruses activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to suppress IRF1-dependent IFN-?, which results in increased viral infection. In addition, we found that inhibiting EGFR increased IRF1 and IFN-? to suppress viral infection. This result has potential implications in asthma because EGFR signaling is increased in asthmatic epithelium. However, because of possible side effects with existing EGFR inhibitors, we investigated IFN-? to suppress EGFR, and found that IFN-? inhibits EGFR activation. An emerging area of EGFR biology is that this cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor traffics to the nucleus to influence key cell functions, which include calcium (Ca2+) signaling in the nucleus. Preliminary work found that inhibition of nuclear Ca2+ signaling attenuates EGFR suppression of IRF1, which implicates nuclear EGFR-dependent Ca2+ signaling to suppress IRF1. More recently, we found that sputum EGFR expression correlates with asthma severity. Because macrophages are the predominant cell type in sputum, we investigated EGFR signaling in macrophages. Preliminary experiments showed functional EGFR in sputum and PBMC-derived macrophages. In addition, increased EGFR activation suppressed IRF1, which parallels our findings in airway epithelium. Therefore, the hypothesis of this proposal is that EGFR signaling is integral to susceptibility to viral infectionin asthma via suppression of IRF1-dependent IFN-? in both airway epithelial cells and macrophages. In Aim 1, we will use a murine model of virus-induced asthma exacerbations to study the effect of EGFR inhibition on inflammation. A genetic approach will suppress airway epithelial EGFR, and we will study intranasal EGFR siRNA and IFN-?. Aim 2 will investigate nuclear EGFR-dependent Ca2+ signaling to suppress IRF1 and IFN-? using confocal microscopy, constructs, and siRNA that target EGFR trafficking to the nucleus and inhibit nuclear Ca2+ signaling. This will include experiments to study the effect of IFN-? to inhibit nuclear EGFR in airway epithelium. Aim 3 will investigate EGFR signaling in sputum and blood macrophages from asthmatics and healthy individuals, which will include the effect of IFN-? on nuclear EGFR in macrophages. Finally, using a genetic model to remove EGFR in macrophages, we will study the cell-specific contribution of EGFR signaling in the mouse model of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. These studies will elucidate: 1) the effectiveness of EGFR inhibition to suppress inflammation in virus-induced asthma exacerbations, which will provide insights for novel therapies, 2) a new mechanism for nuclear EGFR-dependent Ca2+ signaling to influence antiviral immunity, and 3) the role of macrophage EGFR signaling in asthma, which will expand our current model of EGFR biology."
"9285186","Project Summary/Abstract In obese children, excess fat exerts an unfavorable burden on the respiratory system, particularly during exercise. It is unclear if this burden reduces exercise tolerance, provokes dyspnea on exertion (DOE), or contributes to respiratory symptoms, which could be misdiagnosed as asthma. Obesity-related respiratory symptoms are wrongly labeled asthma in over 50% of cases placing obese children at risk of unnecessary treatment and potentially a reluctance to exercise, which is counterproductive to weight loss. We propose that most of the respiratory effects in obese children are the result of low lung volume breathing, i.e., a reduction in functional residual capacity at rest, and end-expiratory lung volume during exercise. It is also unclear whether moderate weight loss and regular exercise make a significant change in respiratory function, exercise tolerance, or DOE in obese children. This is not to imply that weight loss and regular exercise are not important in the treatment of childhood obesity, but it is unclear if this conventional prescription of modest weight loss and regular exercise yields significant changes in respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and/or DOE in obese children. Conversely, the effects of continued weight gain on respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE are also unknown. The overall objective of this application is to investigate the respiratory effects of obesity in prepubescent children, including obese children with respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed as asthma, before and after 1) a program of weight loss and regular exercise and 2) continued weight gain as compared with normal weight children before and after 1 yr. Our approach will be to examine respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in prepubescent obese boys and girls (Tanner score?3, 8-12 yr), including those misdiagnosed with asthma, before and after 1) weight loss and regular exercise and 2) continued weight gain as compared with prepubescent normal weight boys and girls before and after a control period of 1 yr. We will test the following hypotheses in obese children as compared with normal weight children. Aim 1) Obesity will decrease respiratory function but to a greater extent in obese children misdiagnosed with asthma. Aim 2) Obesity will decrease exercise tolerance but not cardiorespiratory fitness, except in obese children misdiagnosed with asthma where both may be reduced. Aim 3) Obesity will increase DOE but to a greater extent in obese children misdiagnosed with asthma. Aim 4) Weight loss and regular exercise will improve respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in obese children, including those misdiagnosed with asthma, while continued weight gain will worsen respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in obese children, including those misdiagnosed with asthma, as compared with normal weight children before and after 1 yr. These results will have broad and immediate clinical impact on the care of obese children, especially those with respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed as asthma."
"9388697","African American (AA) men exhibit 1.6-fold higher incidence and 2.4-fold higher mortality rates from prostate cancer (PCa) compared to white men. Although much of this disparity remains after controlling for factors related to social determinants of health, very few studies have used this population-based difference to identify molecular mechanisms of tumor aggressiveness. The proposed work addresses the urgent need to interrogate the molecular mechanisms driving the more aggressive PCa biology in AA men across the PCa progression continuum and to modulate such mechanisms for therapeutic application.  Our data from evaluating PCa biopsy tissue from AA and white patients has led to the discovery of alternative splicing as a novel molecular mechanism underlying more aggressive PCa in AA men. Preliminary analysis has indicated that several of these race-related alternative splicing events track with increased growth and more aggressive invasion characteristics of PCa in AA men. Additional preliminary work has demonstrated our capability to generate the first significant collection of PCa patient-derived explants and the first establishment of PCa patient-derived explants from AA patients.  We aim to extend our preliminary findings by 1) determining the pattern and frequency of candidate race- related splice variants across the PCa progression continuum, from localized PCa of varying degrees of aggressiveness to metastatic castration-resistant PCa, and defining the relationship between these variants and PCa cell biology, 2) assessing the effects of expression of particular race-related splice variants on mechanistic and functional biology in population-specific PCa cell lines and developing tools to pharmacologically modulate race-related oncogenic splice variants for therapeutic application using AA and white PCa cell lines and AA and white PCa patient-derived explants generated for this study and 3) defining the biological significance of cis- acting splicing elements and/or trans-acting splicing factors to driving the alternative splicing events specific to AA PCa.  The rationale for and impact of this study are that it will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving PCa disparities and aid in development of novel precision biomarkers for prostate tumor aggressiveness and/or therapeutic agents against aggressive PCa. Such precision medicine interventions will reduce PCa disparities for AAs and will likely have impact on a subset of patients of all races with aggressive PCa. New AA and white PCa bio-specimens, AA and white PCa patient-derived explants and derivative cell lines and splicing-related materials and methods and tools resulting from the proposed work will be available to the nationwide cohort of scientists conducting research on PCa disparities."
"9350384","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate and quantitative single cell sequencing with digital droplet MDA PI: Adam R. Abate Abstract: Accurate single cell genomic sequencing is important for applications ranging from copy number variation analysis in cancer to the investigation of uncultivable microbes. To provide sufficient DNA for sequencing, a single cell's genome must be massively amplified. However, existing methods introduce errors (MALBAC) or result in significant bias (MDA), yielding low-confidence genomes with gaps in coverage. In this proposal, we will develop single cell digital droplet MDA (sc-ddMDA), a method that will combine the uniform amplification of MALBAC with the high copying accuracy of MDA. This project will extend our preliminary results in which we have demonstrated the ability to reliably and uniformly amplify the genomes of just ten bacterial cells. Using novel biochemical and microfluidic methods, we will push the limit to a single cell and will implement automation for high-throughput processing of, ultimately, thousands of single cells. Importantly, we will provide two versions of the technology, one using no specialized equipment accessible to any lab with molecular biology expertise, and a higher-throughput version using microfluidics and robotic automation. Aim 1: Optimize methods to uniformly amplify and sequence the genomes of single cells. Aim 2: Develop high-throughput single cell ddMDA. Aim 3: Implement microfluidic pre-amplification for accurate, high-throughput single cell sequencing."

"9316421","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For some time, researchers have been interested in the value of health research: both basic research on biomedical processes and behavioral/social research focused on health and aging. Estimating the value of medical research has been difficult, however. Data limitations make research challenging, there can be disagreement across or within disciplines on the appropriate theoretical and methodological frameworks to adopt, and few researchers have a broad enough background across the relevant areas to conduct the necessary applied research. We propose to organize a network of primarily US and UK-based researchers who are interested in the impact and design of health research, to gather this group regularly, and to stimulate new research on the value of health research from that group and related others. We will gather people from diverse backgrounds, including many sub disciplines of economics as well as epidemiology, medical research, and other social sciences. The group will be jointly organized under the auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in the United States and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in the United Kingdom. Project activities will consist of regular gatherings of the research network; seed grants for high risk, interdisciplinary projects, especially oriented to younger researchers; and educational activities open to researchers inside and outside of the network."

"9494756","Melanoma is the deadliest skin cancer with yearly increasing incidence and poor prognosis due to failure of both primary and secondary prevention strategies, respectively. Melanoma treatment strategies are often unsuccessful due to patients? intrinsic or acquired drug resistance, highlighting the need for novel, secondary prevention-intervention strategies with thoroughly validated mechanistic targets. Therefore, my career goal is to become an independent, academic melanoma researcher, with a focus in translational science to develop strategies to target melanoma. To ensure this outcome, the enclosed comprehensive research, mentoring, and career development plans will be implemented over the course of the predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowship training periods. My overall hypothesis is that goal-oriented research and career development in my predoctoral and postdoctoral training years will lead me to establish myself as an independent, academic melanoma researcher. The following aims will address this hypothesis: Aim 1: The Dissertation Research Project ? goal, rationale, hypotheses, and progress thus far. Aim 2: The Dissertation Research Project ? work to be completed. Aim 3: The Postdoctoral Research Direction. My predoctoral research is significant because it provides critical knowledge about the differential role of oxidative stress, autophagy, and p62 regulation as survival mechanisms for melanoma development and the potential for therapeutic targeting in melanoma. Further, the research technical skills acquired during the predoctoral phase will positively impact my postdoctoral research training as I learn to evaluate mechanisms of melanoma development, prevention strategies and therapeutic targeting in vivo. The results of my proposed research studies will also positively impact public health by development of therapeutic strategies for melanoma. The proposed career development plan will be instrumental for my training as a postdoctoral fellow and subsequent transition to a research faculty position.

"9352420","ABSTRACT Trypanosoma brucei species inflict health hazards and economic hardship on arguably the most marginalized populations in the world. Some of the best-studied Excavata, trypanosomes also represent important models in many areas of research, including antigenic variation, host-pathogen interaction, developmental reprogramming and mitochondrial biology. This project will elucidate mechanisms by which macromolecular RNA editing substrate binding complex (RESC) stabilizes and delivers mitochondrial pre-mRNAs and guide RNAs into the U-insertion/deletion editing pathway, and coordinates polyadenylation and translation of edited mRNAs. We establish the RESC platform as the RNA binding constituent of the editing holoenzyme and seek to investigate its role in editing reactions, and functions beyond the RNA editing process. To this end, we demonstrate that RESC-associated MERS1 pyrophosphohydrolase and KPAP1 poly(A) polymerase target pre-mRNA 5? and 3? ends, respectively. Importantly, both 5? pyrophosphate removal and 3? A-tailing appear to be critical for pre-mRNA stabilization prior to editing. Conversely, specific module within RESC is suggested to couple the completion of editing with post-editing 3? A/U-tailing and mRNA binding to the ribosome. Collectively, the existing evidence positions the ~25 polypeptide RESC complex as the multimodal nexus of mitochondrial RNA processing. Furthermore, initial investigation of RESC-associated MERS1 complex, RNA polymerase (MTRNAP), and the 3? processome (MPsome) challenges the long-standing model of multicistronic maxicircle transcription and endonucleolytic partitioning of primary transcripts. The proposed experiments will deepen understanding of RNA editing by determining the RESC structure at near-atomic resolution and RNA binding specificities of individual subunits. We will test a broad functional hypothesis that discrete RESC modules coordinate completion of mRNA editing with 3? modification and translational activation. Finally, we put forward a fundamentally novel concept of monocistronic pre-mRNAs that are transcribed from individual promoters and shaped by 5? modification and antisense RNA-controlled 3?-5? degradation. By elucidating the RESC structure, RNA binding properties, and higher-order interactions, and evaluating the paradigm-shifting ?monocistronic hypothesis,? this program will expand the knowledge of critical parasite-specific processes and may provide new drug targets."
"9517149","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks continued support for the Yale research-training program in Diabetes Mellitus and Disorders of Metabolism. This program serves as the core source of support for postdoctoral research training in diabetes and endocrinology at the Yale School of Medicine. A major goal of the program is to provide physician-scientists with the research expertise required to pursue clinical, basic and translational research careers in an academic setting. Physician trainees entering the program will have M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degrees and at least 2-3 years of clinical training in internal medicine or pediatrics. Ph.D. scientists are also recruited into the program since we believe an integrated training experience bringing together adult endocrinologists,  pediatric endocrinologists and endocrine scientists is necessary to prepare our trainees to participate in  modern multidisciplinary research groups. Trainees are selected based on their aptitude and commitment to a  research career. The duration of the training period is three years to ensure an in-depth training experience.  The cornerstone of the curriculum is the participation of each trainee in a specific research project under the supervision of a designated preceptor and guided by a progress committee composed of 2-3 other members of  the training faculty. Potential projects run the gamut from clinical to basic research in 3 primary areas of emphasis: 1) type 1 diabetes, 2) type 2 diabetes, and 3) bone and mineral metabolism. Within these areas, trainees have the opportunity to work with mentors in several basic science departments as well as those in  Pediatrics and Medicine. Close interaction among preceptors and trainees within each programmatic area and  within several multidisciplinary and interdepartmental research centers administered within the Endocrine  Section further enrich the training experience. Multiple educational opportunities including two degree-granting  (MS, PhD) programs are available to trainees through the CTSA-funded Yale Center for Clinical Investigation.  Instruction is also provided through organized lectures, research seminars and journal clubs. The application  requests an additional training slot per year for a total of 6 stipends. This is based on our decision to fully  integrate Yale's pediatric and internal medicine training programs in diabetes and metabolism and, therefore,  not to seek renewal of the pediatric T32 (DK63703). It is also based on our ongoing track record of attracting an outstanding applicant pool, the high level of research productivity of our training faculty, the expanded  research opportunities provided by our diverse faculty and the continued shortage of physician-scientists in  both medicine and pediatrics dedicated to research careers in diabetes and metabolic diseases."
"9293185","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A crucial factor in protection from liver injury, fibrosis and cancer by agents such as alcohol, aflatoxins and viral hepatitis is the enforcement of genomic stability. However, sensors for genotoxicity leading to aberrant DNA repair remain elusive. TGF-ß has been implicated as a critical promoter of genomic stability and tumor suppression; Yet, the framework by which this occurs is not known. We have observed that loss of TGF-ß members ß2SP and Smad3 leads to accumulation of spontaneous DNA damage, alcohol induced liver injury and cancers including those of the liver (HCC). Cell lines, and mouse models (human and mouse) mutant for TGF-ß/ß2SP accumulate DNA damage that is exacerbated by DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C similar to P57 null cells and Fanconi anemia cell lines. Exome and genomic sequence analysis identified a somatic ?2SP mutation in alcohol associated HCC, that results in a functional disruption of TGF-ß signaling. In addition, spectrins have been observed to associate with FANC G and D, DNA interstrand cross links, and Smad3/4 to transcriptionally regulate FANC genes. Our hypothesis is that TGF-ß is a crucial enforcer of genomic stability, and that ß2SP and/or Smad3/4 are key mediators in suppressing liver injury and cancer through modulation of the Fanconi pathway. Recent studies have also shown the key role of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway in counteracting alcohol and acetaldehyde induced genotoxicity in mice. Importantly, the ß2SP mouse mutants phenocopy a fetal alcohol syndrome in a large number of cases and the ß2SP mutants are highly susceptible to alcohol injury. Therefore our secondary hypothesis is that TGF-ß/ß2SP/Smad3 are crucial for protection against aldehyde genotoxicity. Inactivation of the TGF-ß pathway results in alcohol toxicity, cirrhosis and HCC. To obtain further insights into the role of ß2SP/Smad3 in DNA repair, alcohol/reactive aldehyde toxicity, and neoplasia, we propose the following: AIM 1. Determine the role of ß2SP and Smad3 in the DNA damage response, and whether ß2SP and ß2SP/Smad3 loss plays a causal role in downregulation of the Fanc/Brca pathway, impairment of the Fanc/Brca DNA damage response and interstrand cross link repair. AIM 2. Examine whether mouse mutants ß2SP, ß2SP/Smad3 and Smad3 crossed with Aldh2 null mutant mice result in a progeny that show (a) enhanced susceptibility to spontaneous tumor development as well as ethanol teratogenicity (b) whether the hepatocytes and MEFs derived from such crosses undergo progressive DNA damage. Potentially these studies will generate a robust model for alcohol induced liver toxicity. AIM 3. (a) Determine whether the TGF-ß pathway and DNA repair genes Fanc/Brca are prognostic factors in cirrhosis progressing to HCC, and (b) Identify novel genetic loci that predispose to HCC. c) Expand to fine mapping. Significantly, studies proposed under this application should provide the scientific community with a new understanding of the instrumental regulators in alcohol induced liver injury and neoplasia."

"9301065","Repeat-Associated Non-ATG Translation in DM1 and DM2 (Project 1)- Ranum    Well-established rules of translational initiation have been used as a cornerstone in molecular biology to understand gene expression and to predict the consequences of disease causing mutations. For myotonic dystrophy (DM) and other microsatellite expansion disorders, repeat expansions (e.g., CAG or CTGs) located in predicted coding- and non-coding regions are thought to cause disease by protein gain-, or loss-of- function or RNA gain-of-function mechanisms. In 2001, we showed that myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by an intronic CCTG*CAGG expansion in CNBP. The apparent non-coding locations of the DM1 and DM2 expansion mutations and the accumulation of RNA foci in both disorders helped to establish that CUGEXP and CCUGEXP RNAs cause dominant RNA effects. While substantial data support RNA gain-of-function contributions to DM, recent discoveries, which fundamentally change our understanding of how disease-causing mutations are expressed, must also now be considered. First, much of the genome is bidirectionally transcribed, including the DM1 CTG'CAG expansion. Therefore, in addition to DM1 CUGEXP transcripts, mutant DM1 CAGEXP transcripts may also play a role in disease. Second, we recently discovered that the canonical rules of translation do not apply for CTG?CAG repeat expansions and that CAG and CUG expansion transcripts can express homopolymeric expansion proteins in all three frames without an AUG start codon. This Repeat-Associated Non-ATG (RAN) translation is hairpin dependent, occurs without frameshifting or RNA editing and is observed in cell culture and DMpatient tissues. We propose to test the overall hypothesis that RAN translation contributes to DM disease pathogenesis. Our specific aims are to test the hypotheses: 1) that novel polymeric expansion proteins expressed by RAN translation accumulate in DM1 and DM2 brain and contribute to CNS pathology; 2) that RAN proteins are toxic independent of RNA gain of function effects; 3) that RAN translation can be blocked in vivo."
"9315937","A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases."
"9369685","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Experimental Therapeutics is the programmatic home for basic and clinical investigators involved in a broad spectrum of studies in cancer therapeutics. The goals of the program are: (1) to develop novel agents for the treatment of cancer based upon targets identified in this and other programs, (2) to improve the activities of established classes of drugs by structural modification and/or enhanced understanding of their pharmacological properties, (3) to develop more effective clinical therapeutic regimens within the context of disease-focused working groups. Preclinical drug development continues in the areas of transition-state inhibitors, novel microtubule-stabilizing agents, and a diverse spectrum of immunotherapeutics. Two transition-state inhibitors are now in clinical trials, one advanced. A third is moving forward to the clinic. A monoclonal antibody (moab) to melanin linked to 188-rhenium completed Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Other moab-radionuclides are being developed targeting cervical and pancreatic cancers. An agent for the prevention of the dermatitis due to EGFR inhibitors recently entered a Phase II clinical trial. The spectrum of agents studied has broadened to encompassing aptamers, high-affinity antibodies, agents to block apoptotic pathways or targeted to surface glycans. Research in biologicals is focused on co-inhibitory elements within the immune synapse with the objective of developing agents that modulate tolerance, research activities supported by the expanding capabilities in protein production, synthetic chemistry, x-ray crystallography, NMR, and mass spectroscopy with bioinformatics and systems and computational biology support. Disease-focused working groups encompassing basic and clinical investigators have been expanded in breast, gynecological, lung, and head/neck cancers and in the hematological malignancies. Neuro-oncology and neuroendocrine tumors groups were recently formed. Recruitment of clinical and translational researchers has been enhanced by a recently funded Paul Calabresi Career Development Award for Clinical Oncology Scholars. Access to patients for clinical trials has been enhanced at the affiliated Montefiore Medical Center by the creation of the multidisciplinary Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care and the recruitment of a cadre of clinician investigators. AECC members play important roles in ECOG-ATRIN, GOG, COG, and the AIDS Malignancy Consortium. There are currently 54 members from 23 departments, supported by 10 NCI grants ($2.6M Direct) and 21 other peer-reviewed cancer-relevant grants ($10.2M Direct). Since the last CCSG review there have been 537 cancer-relevant research papers by members of this program of which 29% represent intraprogrammatic, and 27% represent interprogrammatic publications."
"9313723","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proteins in synapses are the fundamental regulators of synaptic plasticity, which ultimately controls the neural circuits that underlie behavior. A major advance in our understanding of how synaptic connectivity is linked to animal behavior comes from transcranial two-photon imaging of dendritic spines in living animals. However, despite the advances made by two-photon microscopy, most experiments have been observational. Researchers lack the ability to directly manipulate the protein content at specific synapses and spines, hindering their efforts to decipher the roles of synaptic proteins in learning, memory, behavior, and disease. In this application, we describe a novel method to use two-photon irradiation to control protein synthesis in a spine- specific manner in awake animals. This method is called LIPS: light-induced protein synthesis. LIPS utilizes a light-responsive mRNA encoding a protein of interest. This mRNA is designed so that it is not translated under normal conditions. However, upon two-photon irradiation of a dendrite or spine, a light-activated protein is recruited to the 5'UTR of the mRNA, resulting in localized translation. Thus, LIPS will allow protein synthesis to be achieved with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution in the brains of live animals. In order to develop a simple and robust optogenetic technology to allow researchers to study the role of essentially any protein on synaptic function, the specific aims of this application are (1) To generate and optimize RNA aptamers that recruit light-activated forms of two Arabidopsis phytochromes: Cry2 and PhyB. These experiments will result in the generation of the first light-regulated RNA-protein interactions; (2) To optimize LIPS in cortical neurons. To make light-regulated mRNAs, we will incorporate these aptamers into specific mRNAs. We will then optimize a two-photon irradiation protocol for controlling protein synthesis in dendrites and spines in live animals; (3) To use LIPS to dissect the role of FMRP and FMRP domains in spine remodeling. The experiments in this aim are designed to investigate the role of FMRP in regulating dendritic spine dynamics at the level of individual dendritic spines in the cortex of live mice. Here we will use LIPS to directly interrogate how varying the level of FMRP in spines correlates with spine turnover and we will determine if LIPS-mediated restoration of FMRP in Fmr1 KO dendrites results in restoration of spine stability. Together, these experiments will provide insight into how FMRP controls spine remodeling in living mice. In summary, LIPS provides unprecedented spatiotemporal control of protein expression within a neuron. LIPS will transform two photon studies by enabling researchers to control the protein composition of spines and dendrites and monitor the effects of specific proteins on processes like dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity."
"9211587","Project Summary The Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST), or Pine Ridge Indian Reservation of South Dakota, has implemented the OST CHOICES Program to prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP). However, while OST CHOICES was successfully implemented with adult American Indian women, a needs assessment with the OST community identified the critical need to prevent AEP among American Indian youth. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the OST CHOICES Program among rural, American Indian teen females. To accomplish this, we will first utilize community input to revise and adapt the OST CHOICES Program curriculum for use with female American Indian adolescents aged 14-18 (SA 1). The target population will be involved in several rounds of formative qualitative work, leading to usability testing. The development of ?CHAT? (CHOICES for AI Teens), the revised OST CHOICES curriculum for female American Indian adolescents, will be based on input from the community and target population. We will pilot test CHAT with female American Indian adolescents at-risk for AEP, including utilizing technology-based follow-up data collection methods (SA 2). A subaim is to utilize an ecological framework to identify if early identification of American Indian girls for AEP prevention is a worthwhile investment. The impact of this project is the development of a transdisciplinary, community-based program to prevent AEP with female American Indian teens, an area of great need but with few current efforts. We will evaluate the flow of the full program and preliminary impact of the intervention, leading to preliminary data appropriate for testing within an R01-level, randomized controlled trial. Finally, we will expand current clinical practice by utilizing an ecological framework to impact not just AEP risk but also teen pregnancy risk and substance use behaviors."
"9307892","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic Neuro-Endocrine Role in Depression and Type 2 Diabetes.  Depression confers a 60% increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and an increased risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS). The increased T2D risk in depressed patients is present independently from antidepressant therapy. Our central hypothesis is based on the idea that neuro-endocrine dysfunction in depression confers risk for T2D/MetS, and that common factors contribute to depression-T2D/MetS association. Stress plays a major role in depression. Under stress, the HPA axis releases corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) to stimulate via the CRH receptor (CRHR) adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion from the anterior pituitary, leading to increased cortisol levels. Stress response dysregulation is associated with depression. Resistance of the CRH system in the brain, leading to hypercortisolism, may contribute to depression and T2D. Hypercortisolism and altered feedback inhibition are typical HPA abnormalities in depression, MetS and T2D. As depressed patients have significant hypercortisolism and inappropriately normal levels of plasma ACTH and cerebrospinal fluid CRH, considering their hypercortisolism and compared to control subjects, CRH and ACTH receptor dysfunctions are possible. Hypercortisolism increases glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance, free fatty acids, visceral obesity, blood pressure, and reduces insulin secretion, thereby contributing to MetS/T2D. Our specific objectives are to understand whether the HPA axis receptor genes associated with the stress response may contribute to the depression-MetS/T2D co-morbidity and/or to metabolic and psychological associated traits. The genes of interest are corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor genes (CRHR1 and CRHR2) and the melanocortin receptor genes (MC1R-MC5R).  Specific Aim I: To determine the role of the HPA axis receptor genes (CRHR1, CRHR2, MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R) in T2D/MetS and associated traits within the Italian population;  Specific Aim II: To determine the role of the same genes in depression and associated traits within the White USA families from the NIH repository.  Significance: We challenge the accepted paradigm that T2D and MetS are only metabolic disorders, and that depression is purely a mental disorder, as they are all, at least partially and/or in a subgroup of patients, associated with hyperactivity of the neuro-endocrine cortisol pathway. Our study will lead to identify early on subjects at risk for depression and T2D/MetS and to prevent these disorders implementing lifestyle and behavioral-cognitive changes. Innovation: Performing linkage/association tests not only in a group of patients with T2D/MetS or depression, but also with the associated traits contributing to these diseases, is a powerful innovative strategy for gene identification. The linkage strategy will help identify rare variants as major disease players. The complex gene variants model, the multi- locus model and the gene imprinting model are innovative. We integrate human genetics and clinical phenotyping of disorders not usually studied jointly. We pioneer the joint study of the HPA axis receptors in T2D/MetS and depression in humans. These risk genes may multiply T2D/MetS and depression risk."
"9304947","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an internist trained in infectious disease and HIV epidemiology, whose research is focused on HIV and HCV infections. Since joining the faculty at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 2000, I have developed a nationally recognized clinical translational research program focused on understanding the associations of HIV infection and HCV infection with adipose tissue changes, and metabolic and inflammatory perturbations, including hepatic steatosis (or fatty liver disease). My currently supported research includes: 1) an R01 that establishes a cohort of mainly 300 men with HIV and HCV monoinfection, HIV/HCV coinfection and those with neither infection to determine the effects of visceral adiposity, HIV, HCV and their metabolic    and inflammatory consequences on fatty liver disease (VAHH Study); and 2) a U01 in a large prospective cohort of women with and at risk for HIV (Women's Interagency HIV Study [WIHS]) that has a core goal to determine the contribution of HIV, host immune mechanisms, behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors to organ injury. Data from the Study of Fat Redistribution and Metabolic Change in HIV infection (FRAM) also is available to me. Within this framework, I propose to expand my research agenda to: (1) investigate the contribution of HIV, HCV, and their metabolic and inflammatory consequences to long term outcomes including liver disease progression measured using novel non-invasive techniques, as well as osteoporosis and vascular disease; (2) determine sex differences in the association of HIV, HCV, and their metabolic and inflammatory consequences with long term outcomes (by pooling the detailed outcomes data collected from WIHS women and VAHH and FRAM men and women) and how the menopausal transition may further alter these relationships in women compared to men; and (3) use the results to define sex-specific mechanisms that will enable interventional studies that take into account sex effects in the pathogenesis of these outcomes in    HIV-infected and HCV-infected persons. With access to the broad range of rigorously collected measurements from these three cohorts (including measurement of liver fibrosis by ultrasound based transient elastography, hepatic steatosis and visceral adipose tissue by MRI, bone mineral density by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry scans, and carotid intima media thickness by ultrasound), I propose to expand my mentoring program to mentees with an interest in HIV and HCV infections from a multitude of disciplines including infectious diseases, hepatology, endocrinology and metabolism, cardiology, and radiology. The ability to bring in mentees from disciplines outside of infectious diseases will further enrich my research program. I plan to also seek additional training in professional leadership and how to build a structured and sustainable mentoring program in order to develop the next generation of clinical investigators in HIV and HCV research, and to ensure that they will ultimately become skilled mentors themselves."

"9313308","The purpose of this Program Project Grant competitive renewal application entitled Discovery & Development of Therapeutic Genes for CHF is to enable a number of scientists at VMRF and UCSD to maintain an efficient, interactive and mutually reinforcing program of basic and translational research to promote the discovery and development of therapeutic genes for congestive heart failure (CHF) and other cardiovascular diseases. The Program will facilitate the transition from discovery to clinical application of new therapeutic genes. This model combines discovery research with practical street-smart preclinical development. Successfully attaining our goals will require separate but highly integrated Projects that contain the proper proportions f discovery research and focused preclinical development, an accomplished translational physiology Core, and an interactive group of VMRF and UCSD physician-scientists in an ideal environment. Our goals are to identify, perform mechanistic preclinical studies, and eventually to launch clinical trials of promising candidate genes. Strengths of our Program include: i) the breadth of our expertise across disciplines relevant to the goals of the NHLBI; 2) the novelty of approaches ranging from bench science to translational studies using high-fidelity animal models of cardiovascular diseases; and 3) our previous success navigating the regulatory pathway from discovery to launching clinical gene therapy trials. Our Program, which is focused on fundamental mechanisms by which the failing heart can be treated (or heart failure avoided), includes three Projects: Project 1 (Dr. Hammond) will develop and test unique AC-related proteins as therapeutic agents for clinical CHF. Project 2 (Dr. Roth) will focus on the impact of cavelolin-3 and mitochondrial function in the pathophysiology and treatment of CHF; and Project 3 (Dr. Dillmann) will use gene transfer to attenuate adverse glycosylation of calcium-related proteins and resolve mitochondrial abnormalities in CHF.

To work toward this goal, she will receive rigorous training that includes 11 courses supplemented by directed tutorials in order to complement her qualitative research skills with proficiency in genetics-related bioethics, informatics pertaining to Electronic Medical Record Health Information Technology, and quantitative data analysis. The research project will allow her to apply the knowledge gained through formal instruction. During the mentored career development award, Dr. Korngiebel will be based in the Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education at the University of Washington School of Medicine, an institution uniquely situated to facilitate training and research in bioethics, informatics, and genetic testin. Using her qualitative skills and the expertise gained through training, Dr. Korngiebel will be responsible for producing the main deliverable of the research project: a computerized Clinical Decision Support tool for Lynch Syndrome testing.  Genetic tests are important tools for identification and mitigation of heritable cancer risk. An example is testing to identify Lynch Syndrome, a condition which confers a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer. The Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention program recommends screening for Lynch Syndrome in individuals newly-diagnosed with CRC as a means to improve health outcomes in both patients and family members. However, this approach's success is dependent on execution of an effective testing process, including a robust follow-up program. In implementing this complex process, health systems must determine informed consent procedures at different steps in the testing process and their responsibility toward family members receiving care in other systems. In this complicated scenario encompassing both genetic test choices and unaddressed ethical issues, a computerized clinical decision support tool can offer a timely means of guiding ordering clinicians through the testing process and follow-up with patients and families. Therefore, the research project will comprise the following aims: 1. Identify through interviews with key content experts and decision-makers the critical health system elements and decision points for adaptation of colorectal tumor testing in two hospital settings within UW Medicine; 2. Identify through interviews and targeted surveys of geneticists and non-geneticists the barriers, facilitators, and priorities for successfully deploying a local clinical decision suport tool for diagnostic genetic tests that leverages the Electronic Medical Record; and 3. Test the decision support tool to evaluate clinical utility and appropriateness through evidence-based usability methods."
"9323815","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex inflammatory disorder causing synovitis and joint destruction. Combinatorial use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as well as the advent of biologic agents has revolutionized therapeutic outcomes in RA. However, 40-50% of patients are refractory to any given therapy. The underlying immune mechanisms that define and predict clinical outcome remain unclear. In part, this is due to the paucity of data on pathways that are activated in the joint of patients at different stages of RA. The University of Pittsburgh has developed a strong collaborative team of clinicians and basic and translational scientists that is uniquely positioned to answer this nee through the Accelerated Medicines Partnership. Specifically, we offer a large cohort of RA patients under care of a single network of Pittsburgh rheumatologists; proven experience in recruiting patients for clinical registries and studies with accompanying sample banking: around one-quarter of our RA cohort are already enrolled in our active, NIH-funded research registry (RACER) through which clinical disease activity, labs, and blood are collected at each clinic visit; a state-of-the-art clinical data management and specimen tracking system; established collaborations to provide surgical samples (orthopaedics, IRB-approved), as well as ultrasound (US)-guided biopsies to be performed by specialists in this technique (IRB in process); expertise in tissue processing to isolate lymphocytes for advanced immune cell analytics; expertise in RNA-Seq, including analysis of human tissues (fresh and formalin-fixed) as well as bioinformatics; established workflow to perform all stages efficiently and rapidly at a single site to optimize data quality and integrity of these valuable samples. In UH2 Research Phase 0, we will establish standardized methods and feasibility parameters for tissue collection, processing, and analysis. Initially we will make use of readily-available synovial tissues from standard orthopaedic procedures such as joint replacement and synovectomy, and then validate these procedures on ultrasound-guided biopsy samples. In UH2 Research Phase I, we will then apply the standardized procedures developed in Phase 0 to determine heterogeneity between patient samples, compare RA versus OA and source of cells (blood vs. tissue, surgery vs. biopsy). These parameters will allow accurate power analysis to determine numbers of patients and types of analyses that are required for Phase II. In UH3 Research Phase II, we propose a controlled clinical study in which RA patients with active disease that have not responded to standard first-line therapy with methotrexate or TNF inhibitor will be randomized to receive biologic therapy. Joint biopsy and blood will be analyzed in relation to clinical outcome, and systems biology applied to determine causal pathway activation in relation to disease activity and therapy response. We also expect to participate in in-vitro and in-vivo validation studies based on pathways identified in Phase I, as well as emerging pilot project data."
"9312302","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome wide association studies are powerful for correlating human genotype to phenotype. These studies are designed to identify the polymorphisms in the genetic code that are most predictive of a phenotype. Rapid advances in genotyping technologies enable comprehensive coverage of the genome, including a majority of intergenic polymorphisms. Interestingly, when included in the association analysis, non-coding polymorphisms are often the most highly predictive of the phenotype. Furthermore, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are inherited together in Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) blocks. As a result, identifying the causative SNP in an LD block mapping to non-coding regions of the genome remains a contemporary computational and experimental challenge in the field of genomics. Although non-coding regions of the genome are not translated into protein, they are in a majority of cases transcribed in RiboNucleic Acid (RNA). Since RNA is a single stranded polymer, it will fold and the higher-order structures it adopts are integral to numerous RNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulatory functions in the cell. In detailed and focused studies of individual transcripts, our team has discovered that disruption of RNA structural features in non-coding regions of transcribed RNAs are causative in at least three human disease states - hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome, retinoblastoma and cartilage hair hypoplasia - and that altered RNA structure determines hepatitis C virus clearance efficiency. The vision of this proposal is to improve our computational ability to predict RiboSNitches (structural features in RNA that are disrupted by a SNP) by improving the accuracy of ensemble suboptimal structure sampling and pseudoknot prediction, and by using chemical structure probing data to characterize allele-specific RNA conformations, both in vitro and in healthy living cells in vivo. Ultimately, this work will substantially improve our ability to predict the causative disease-associated SNP in an LD block mapping to non-coding, intergenic regions of the human genome."

"9384892","PROJECT SUMMARY During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals reporting binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation spanning into the mid-20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. In response to RFA-AA-17-003, this application proposes a Research Project Site of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence second phase (NCANDA-2) to determine the predictors and effects of heavy adolescent alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. To achieve this, the Duke site of NCANDA-2 will continue to follow a cohort of 175 in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area (n=831 across all 5 sites) participants (ages 12-21 at baseline first visit) to acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use during adolescence on the adult brain. NCANDA-2 will use multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, behavioral assessment, biospecimen collection, and multimodal assessments in the natural environment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence and young adulthood, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to neurotoxic effects of alcohol. In addition, the UCSD site will collaborate with the Duke and OHSU sites to study recovery of these abnormalities. Specifically, we will examine the degree to which targeted heavy drinking related neurocognitive and brain integrity deficits remit over 4 weeks of monitored abstinence. Duke will also collaborate with the Pittsburgh site to examine the influence of alcohol use on reward and inhibitory systems with longitudinal analyses of a rewarded antisaccade task to evaluate changes in these systems for youth who increase drinking versus those who do not. Sex differences in development, alcohol use patterns and history, impact of alcohol use on the brain, and sex-differentiating psychosocial factors (e.g., depression symptoms) will be considered in analyses. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain, and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities and resiliencies that may alter adolescents? and young adults? risk for alcohol or other substance use disorder and other mental health and developmental outcomes."
"9380126","Abstract  Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) revolutionized the treatment of urinary stones when first introduced three decades ago. Instead of open stone surgery, acoustic energy could be applied from outside the body to fragment stones in situ. Although widely utilized for treatment of stones, SWL has not fully lived up to its potential. Incomplete fragmentation of stones can result in significant pain (when fragments migrate down the ureter and obstruct urine outflow) and a high rate of residual fragments that need subsequent additional therapy. SWL research has shown the complex role of acoustic cavitation in the stone comminution process. While cavitation has been demonstrated to be an essential component of the fragmentation process, the bubbles produced also interfere with subsequent shockwaves reducing their effectiveness and sometimes causing tissue injury. SWL treatments at extremely low rates (i.e. <30 shocks/min) have been shown in the laboratory to be substantially more efficient and cause less tissue injury because there is sufficient time for most of the cavitation bubbles to dissolve. However, ultra-low rates have not been adopted clinically because of the impractically long procedure times that would be required. We have previously demonstrated that unfocused low amplitude acoustic bursts can stimulate rapid coalescence and dispersion of cavitation bubbles during SWL clearing the pathway for subsequent shockwaves within tens of milliseconds. By this method we can recover the stone fragmentation efficiency and safety of very low shockwave rates at standard clinical rates. Initial studies outlined in this proposal are designed to optimize the bubble coalescence and dispersion process for use with a standard clinical electromagnetic shockwave lithotripsy system. The following studies will then demonstrate safety and improved efficacy on a porcine model such that a pilot clinical trial could be initiated following this work."
"9353846","Enzyme-less DNA base discrimination using solid-state nanopores with high-frequency integrated de-  tection electronics  There is strong demand for third-generation DNA sequencing systems to be single-molecule, massively- parallel, and real-time, while also reducing operating costs and supporting long read lengths. No technologies have yet met this challenge, but the most successful attempts to date have been based on methods which track the real-time operation of single enzyme molecules operating on a strand of DNA. Optical approaches to single-polymerase imaging suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios deriving from the weak photon emission from single fluorophores (< 2500 photons/sec), and thus demand both complex optics and purposely-reduced base incorporation rates (~1 Hz). Nanopore-based detection approaches offer faster detection and have been demonstrated to track polymerase activity at higher incorporation rates (~10-100 Hz), but have struggled with reliability issues and high error rates associated with the still-weak signal levels produced by popular protein nanopores.  These struggles suggest that nanopore-based single-molecule sequencing techniques which do not de- pend on real-time imaging of active enzymes would have several important advantages. First and foremost, they could offer sequencing speeds even faster than a free-running polymerase molecule (which operate at ~100-1000 Hz). Second, removing active enzymes from the detection platform offers more freedom to optimize key parameters such as buffer conditions and temperatures outside the operating range of natural enzymes. Third, sequencing platforms without active enzymes may prove simpler and cheaper to operate, ship, and store. Lastly, nanopores, particularly biological ones, face reliability challenges as electronic devices, experi- encing degradation during use.  In this three-year effort, we focus on the development of a multiplexed solid-state nanopore platform ena- bling a per-pore sequencing rate of at least 105 bases/sec at an error rate of less than 0.1%, leveraging inte- grated electronics and state-of-the-art solid-state nanopores based on ultra-thin membrance and delivering useful signal bandwidths in excess of 10 MHz when required. We expect to be able to delect signal levels as low as 225 pA at signal-to-noise ratios greater than 8 and bandwidth better than 3 MHz, making possible high- speed free-running single-molecule electrophoretic sequencing. This goal is pursued through three Specific Aims: the design of biomimetic solid-state nanopores with sensing geometries driven to single nanometer siz- es (Specific Aim 1), the design of electronics optimized for high-speed multiplexed detection of these na- nopores (Specific Aim 2), and data analysis of the resulting signals (Specific Aim 3)."
"9306893","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth aggression (e.g., bullying, fighting) and serious violence (e.g., shootings, robbery) places a considerable emotional and financial burden on society, making effective prevention a paramount public health concern. While several empirically supported prevention programs have been developed to target elementary school children at risk for exhibiting chronic aggression and serious violence (A-SV) into adolescence, no screening tools have been explicitly designed to identify children in the community who should be enrolled in these programs. As it stands, children are recruited into these interventions based on various ad hoc screening procedures designed to delineate youth with early conduct problems (e.g., defiance, lying, fighting). Recent longitudinal examinations of these screening strategies indicate that they are relatively poor at accurately identifying those children who will exhibit a persistent pattern of A-SV across adolescence. As a result, costly prevention programs are being unnecessarily administered to low-risk children, while a sizable portion of children most in need of violence prevention services are overlooked. To address this issue, the proposed study will use a multi-staged measurement development strategy to create a set of informant-specific (i.e., parent, teacher, youth report) screening instruments explicitly designed to identify children at risk for exhibiting chronic A-SV across adolescence. First, secondary data analysis of four large longitudinal studies will be used to identify the risk factor across multiple domains (e.g., low school bonding, peer deviance) that most accurately and consistently delineate elementary school children at risk for exhibiting A-SV across multiple years during adolescence (~ages 13-20). This will include identifying informant-specific risk factors that help to optimize classification accuracy. Next, state-of-the-art qualitative and quantitative measurement development techniques will be used to create three informant-specific screening instruments that assess the risk factors that best classify children at risk for exhibiting chronic A-SV across the longitudinal studies. A comprehensive item bank designed to assess each risk factor will be created by systematically identifying and extracting items from all relevant instruments that exist in the literature. A Consortium of international experts on youth violence will systematically refine the item set to optimize construct coverage and content clarity, and cognitive interviews with targeted informants will be used to further identify and rectify problematic items. A national sample of 2520 elementary school children will then be recruited to psychometrically refine and validate the violence risk screening tools. Using item response theory and computer adaptive testing methods, an efficient subset of items that minimize measurement error and optimize precision will be selected for inclusion in the final version of the screening instruments. The deliverables from this project will be a set of free, empirically- based, and precise risk screening instruments that can be used in multiple settings to identify children most in need of targeted violence prevention services."
"9304873","Project Summary In many cell types, voltage-gate Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane trigger intracellular Ca2+ release via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the endoplasmic reticulum. In skeletal muscle, a specialized form of this signaling occurs such that CaV1.1 (the principle subunit of the muscle Ca channel, also referred to as the 2+ DHPR) activates RyR1 (the skeletal RyR isoform) via a conformational interaction. A long-term goal of our research is to identify the minimum set of proteins needed for this conformational interaction, and to determine their sites of interaction with one another. Based on previous work and our own preliminary results we know that in addition to CaV1.1 and RyR1, two other proteins are required: a ?Stac? adaptor protein and junctophilin. Varying isoforms of all four proteins (CaVs, RyRs, Stacs and junctophilins) are also expressed in the nervous system and CaVs, RyRs and junctophilins are expressed in heart. Significantly, mutations of CaVs, RyRs and junctophilins give rise to inherited, human disorders of skeletal muscle, heart and the nervous system. Clearly understanding the pathogenesis of such disorders would benefit from a better understanding of how these proteins interact with one another, and a major focus of the proposed experiments is to achieve this understanding. Toward this end, we have developed a number of experimental tools, including a construct encoding only the cytoplasmic domain of RyR1 (?RyR1cyto? containing RyR1 residues 1-4300 but lacking the ~700 C-terminal residues that form the ion conducting pore and anchor RyR1 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum). Additionally, we have established the ability to obtain high level expression of CaV1.1 in non-muscle cells. With these and other results demonstrating feasibility, we propose to use cDNA expression in muscle and non- muscle cells, followed by patch clamping, confocal fluorescence microscopy, biochemistry and electron microscopy to pursue the following specific aims. Aim 1. To use expression in tsA201 cells to define the determinants for interactions between skeletal, cardiac and neuronal isoforms of the Stac proteins, the junctophilins, and RyRs. Aim 2. To exploit the differential methodological strengths of tsA201 and muscle cells for probing the molecular determinants of signaling between CaV1.1 and RyR1. Myotubes will be used to test the Stac isoform specificity for support of EC coupling and to test the role of the DHPR ?1 subunit. tsA201 cells will be used to determine how mutations affect CaV1.1 gating charge movements, and myotubes to probe proximities among constituents of the EC coupling apparatus. Aim 3. To determine whether CaV1.1-RyR1 functional interactions can be reconstituted in tsA201 cells, either partially with RyR1cyto or entirely with full-length RyR1."
"9305776","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks renewal of funding to support and extend a successful interdisciplinary predoctoral program that prepares students with strong backgrounds in quantitative physical sciences to conceptualize, conduct, and direct independent research in molecular biophysics and structural biology. The Molecular Biophysics and Structural Biology (MBSB) graduate program places a strong emphasis on inter- disciplinary, collaborative research in an environment where the practical human health consequences of research are appreciated and contribute to guiding and driving basic research. The training faculty has expanded to 54 independent investigators spread over 14 departments within the School of Medicine and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh, and within the Mellon College of Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Senior researchers have strong records in graduate training, funding, and publications, and the program also includes junior faculty who bring new ideas and technical expertise to the group. The research programs of training faculty emphasize not only characterization of biomolecular phenomena but also development of new methodologies. The relationship between physical methods and biological understanding is a key aspect of the curriculum. Research is focused on core areas at the forefront of biomolecular science, including membrane proteins, protein-protein interactions and oligomeric complexes, nucleic acid structure and protein-nucleic acid interactions, poorly structured protein elements, protein misfolding and aggregation, and small molecule ligand-protein interactions. The training program includes a first-year core curriculum featuring an introduction to biophysical instrumentation and methods, how these are used to address specific molecular questions, an introduction to theory and simulation of biomolecular behavior, and courses on statistical analysis, computer programming and ethics. Students' abilities to synthesize and creatively utilize what they have learned in the classroom are tested in a qualifying exam that requires them to construct and defend a research proposal not related to their own laboratory work. After passing this exam students move on to develop and pursue their thesis project. Students are required to participate in a weekly journal/data club and to attend a Molecular Biophysics seminar series featuring invited local and national speakers. An annual program Symposium is held with invited speakers and student participation through talks and posters. This renewal builds on the successes of the MBSB program and its unique and rich blend of faculty expertise favoring cross-disciplinary and co-mentored thesis projects to prepare students for success in the modern research environment. We are requesting funds to continue support for four traineeships and extend this to the six originally envisioned with the goal of training a new generation of molecular biophysicists and structural biologists who will be leaders in future efforts to understand normal and abnormal human biology at the physical and molecular level."
"9306176","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Valvular heart disease is an important health problem afflicting over 2.5% of the US population and, while surgical repair of native tissue remains the gold standard, the reduced risk of catheter-based interventions has provided the capability to intervene earlier in the disease process as well as in the sickest patients while avoiding the risk of cardiopulmonary bypass and also enabling intra-operative assessment of the repair. The outcomes of transcatheter procedures, however, remain inferior to surgery. For example, in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), moderate to severe paravalvular leaks are a significant problem and have been shown to decrease short-term survival. As a second example, those patients receiving transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of mitral regurgitation required follow-up surgery for recurrent mitral regurgitation substantially more often than those undergoing initial surgical repair. Optimal patient care would combine the benefits of beating-heart interventions with the effectiveness of surgical repair. We hypothesize that the fundamental limitation toward meeting this goal is the ability of the clinician to manipulate tissu at the time of device implantation to optimize device function. In contrast to optically-guided open surgery, catheter-based delivery greatly reduces the interventionalist's capability to visualize and precisely manipulate tissue. To address these limitations, we propose to develop a transapical two-arm robotic catheter platform with integrated cardioscopic imaging for beating-heart valve repair. The use of two coordinated arms will enable tissue manipulation comparable to surgery in which one hand positions tissue and the other hand interacts with it. Cardioscopic imaging in the catheter tip(s) will provide high-fidelity optical imaging of catheter-tissue contac for safe and precise tissue interaction. The transapical approach enables substantially shorter and more controllable instruments while robotic control provides precise steerability for two-handed tissue manipulation inside the beating heart as well as the potential for computer-based force control. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technology against current clinical practice in the context of two important problems, transcatheter aortic PVL closure and mitral edge-to-edge repair, using ex vivo and in vivo animal experiments. The overall impact of the project extends to all beating-heart valve procedures."
"9313356","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient amplifying intermediate neural progenitor cells (INPs) play critical roles in boosting neuronal output from neural stem cells (NSCs) and brain tumor formation. It is fundamentally important to understand how the generation and proliferation of INPs is regulated. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate mechanisms that regulate INP generation and proliferation using the recently identified Drosophila type II neuroblast (NBs, the Drosophila NSC) lineages as a model system. In Drosophila larval brains, self-renewing INPs are generated from the type II NBs but not the classical type I NB. Furthermore, due to additional INP-mediated amplification of NB proliferation, type II NB lineages are extremely susceptible to tumorigenesis. However, why only type II NBs but not type I NBs generate INPs was totally unknown. My recent work identified the first molecule, the evolutionally conserved Ets family transcriptional activator Pointed P1 (PntP1), which is specifically expressed in type II NB lineages and is both necessary and sufficient to promote INP generation. Furthermore, my work demonstrated that PntP1 is the key molecule responsible for the susceptibility of type II NB lineages to tumorigenesis. The objective of this project is to elucidate the function and mechanisms of a potential PntP1 target gene, buttonhead (btd), in regulating INP generation, brain complexity, and brain tumor formation. The central hypothesis is that Btd functions downstream of PntP1 to promote INP generation and increase neural diversity by preventing Pros-mediated premature differentiation of INPs and that Btd contributes to tumorigenesis in type II NB lineages. We will test the hypothesis by pursuing following three specific aims. 1) Determine whether and how Btd functions downstream of PntP1 to promote INP generation; 2) Investigate the role of Btd in generating neural diversity; 3) Define the function of Btd in tumorigenic overproliferation of type II NBs. The proposed project is expected to reveal novel mechanisms that control INP generation, brain complexity, as well as brain tumor formation."
"9332303","Abstract Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affects up to 5% of children in the United States, and is the topic of several NIH directives calling for research initiatives. Most children with PAE are diagnosed with ADHD, although current research demonstrates significant differences in symptom profiles and treatment response between ADHD due to PAE and idiopathic ADHD. This suggests corresponding clinically important differences in brain physiology between PAE ADHD and ADHD not associated with PAE (non-PAE ADHD). The research literature and our preliminary data demonstrate that aspects of executive function differentiate PAE ADHD from non- PAE ADHD. Further, in healthy and brain-injured subjects, metrics of executive function and attention have been correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) in the anterior corona radiata (ACR) - a white-matter tract in which we found lower FA in children with PAE ADHD than in children with familial non-PAE ADHD. In the same group of children, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we also found lower levels of choline-compounds (Cho) in ACR in the children with PAE ADHD than in the children with familial non-PAE ADHD. Thus we propose that low FA and low Cho in ACR may provide objective neuroimaging markers to distinguish PAE ADHD from non-PAE ADHD. Fibers composing the ACR include those connecting the striatum and the anterior middle cingulate cortex (aMCC), a cingulate subregion heavily implicated in ADHD by functional neuroimaging. In our recent RC1, we found lower glutamate (Glu) in aMCC in children with familial ADHD (i.e., one or more siblings with ADHD, no PAE, and no family history of alcohol abuse) than in healthy controls. In PAE in contrast, pre-clinical literature suggests elevation of Glu in the cortex, along with reduction in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We propose that Glu/GABA ratios in aMCC may be an additional biomarker distinguishing PAE ADHD from familial non-PAE ADHD. In this investigation, we propose to use leading-edge MRS techniques (MRSI and MEGA-PRESS) in tandem with state-of-the-art diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to test these brain imaging endpoints (FA and Cho in ACR, Glu/GABA in aMCC) that putatively differentiate PAE ADHD from familial non-PAE ADHD. We will furthermore explore relations between these endpoints and clinically relevant neurocognitive measures of attention and other executive functions. If successful, this proposal may inform the design of and the monitoring of in vivo effects of prospective treatments for PAE, which to date has been poorly tractable. This proposal responds to recommendations of the National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects to improve understanding of the mechanisms of alcohol's action on the brain through neuroimaging and to identify potential biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure and to the NIAAA Strategic Plan for Research which has identified ?developing increasing understanding of the effects of alcohol on neurodevelopment,? as a key public health goal."
"9308692","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Columbia University is uniquely positioned to develop scientists and/or clinicians towards independent research careers in temporomandibular joint disorders and pain (TMJDP). Through strategic recruitment in the past ~5 years, Columbia University College of Dental Medicine (CDM) now has a critical mass of NIH funded, primary and secondary faculty members whose research is directly in TMJDP. In parallel, multiple clusters of key recruitments in medical and engineering schools have yielded cadres of leading scientists in molecular genetics, biomaterials, chemical engineering and bioengineering whose expertise, when integrated with TMJDP, generates powerful and novel approaches. Collectively, our faculty mentors have over 28 NIH R01s that offer both the breadth and depth to trainees that will be recruited on this grant. Prior to this FOA, the CDM has established a track record of career development of multiple junior faculty members, with one example of a dentist/scientist whose work in novel TMJ stem/progenitor cells has received NIDCR K99/R00 funding, in addition to recognition as 1st place Hatton Awardees separately at 2012 AADR and IADR Conferences. This TMJDP training program has built key partnerships and leveraged tremendous resources that are currently available at Columbia. Interdisciplinary research is a particular strength at Columbia, with existing collaborations among dentistry, medicine, engineering, biological science and public health. The long-standing TMJ/Orofacial Pain Clinic (est. 1949) treats a broad range of patients not only in New York City, but also surrounding areas of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Northern Philadelphia, offering a fertile platform for translational and clinical research. Columbia University in the City of New York attracts abundant candidates with diverse academic, clinical, social and ethnic background, including underrepresented minorities, by offering them a broad range of learning opportunities. The overall objective of this K12 proposal is to prepare and develop scientists and/or clinicians into independent research investigators in TMJDP. We will set up a sustainable pipeline of Recruitment, Mentorship and Career Transition (RMCT). We will take a trainee-centered approach, very much along the Columbia tradition to focus on each student by maximizing his/her own learning experience. In response to this FOA, our Internal Steering Committee has performed a SWOP analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) and consulted members of our Internal and External Advisory Panels. Accordingly, we have set the following 3 training tracks: Genetics/Physiology, Bioengineering/Regeneration and Imaging/Biomechanics. Our long-term goal, above and beyond this 5-year grant, is to continue with a successful and sustainable program to develop independent research investigators in TMJDP and other areas of dental and craniofacial research."
"9335339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Albuminuria is the single strongest predictor of kidney function decline and is associated with the presence and severity of cardiovascular disease and predicts mortality. Dysfunction of podocytes is the major culprit of glomerular disease causing albuminuria. The demonstrated role of podocyte TRPC5 signaling in the onset of albuminuria suggests therapeutic benefit in progressive glomerular diseases such as Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a histopathological diagnosis with different pathogeneses including genetic mutations, drugs, viral infections, and most importantly, as the result of metabolic disease, such as diabetes, obesity and hypertension. As it stands, FSGS remains a devastating and largely untreatable disease associated with increased morbidity. We have previously demonstrated that a novel TRPC4/5 antagonist, ML204, is able to protect the kidney filter. However, highly potent and selective antagonists of TRPC5 have not been identified yet. In this proposal, we will improve and optimize our initial lead compound, ML204, and test its ability to reduce proteinuria in rodent models of disease. In order to develop these first-in-class compounds, we will utilize an iterative medicinal chemistry approach and integrated DMPK studies which will allow us to evaluate not only potency and selectivity; but also the in vitro and in vivo DMPK properties of newly made compounds in a timely manner. These selective TRPC5 antagonists not only offer a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis in this proposal, but also, to help advance the field towards a drug development."
"9130599","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Combined Cognitive and Gait Training Problem: Recent research in gait training for chronic stroke survivors showed that gait coordination can be best restored using the following interventions together: exercise, over ground gait training, and body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT). These results are important because, to our knowledge, there have been no other reports of the restoration of gait coordination for those with persistent gait deficits (> 6 months after stroke). However, a remaining problem was that the restored coordinated gait movements measured in the laboratory did not generalize for many subjects to the everyday environment. The known confluence of several factors can cause lack of generalization. First, it is known that dual task performance (walking and cognitive attention task) can degrade both gait speed and attention ability, even in healthy adults. Second, stroke can impair attention. Third, during walking in the everyday environment, attention is required in order to safely process normally occurring stimuli. Therefore, given the success of the new gait training protocol in the lab setting, it is important to address the problems remaining, for the generalization of recovered functional gait (gait speed) and gait coordination to the everyday environment. Purpose: Aim 1 is to test an innovative combination of motor and cognitive training that is designed to restore functional gait (gait speed) and gait coordination to the everyday environment.  Hypothesis I: Combined cognitive and motor training will produce greater gains in gait  speed in the dual task test condition, versus motor training alone. Primary measure:  gait speed, measured under the dual task conditions of walking and dealing with a  visual distraction (obstacles) in the gait pathway. Secondary measures include: gait  coordination, time spent walking in everyday environment, and life role participation  (quality of life). Aims 2 and 3 are t investigate the within-group, separate motor and cognitive changes in response to the respective treatments for each of the two study groups. Methods: For Aim 1, Hyp I, thirty-eight subjects (>6 months post stroke) will be enrolled and randomized to either 1) Gait Training + Cognitive Training; or 2) Gait Training alone. Subjects in both groups will receive treatment 5 times/wk, 3hrs/session, for 12wks. The Gait Training Protocol will include: exercise; body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT); and over ground gait training. For Group 1, the cognitive training will be phased into the daily sessions, by first emphasizing cognitive training alone, and subsequently dual training (cognitive and motor). Aims 2 and 3 measures will include gait measures acquired both with and without a cognitive task, as well as cognitive measures acquired both with and without the gait task. Pre-/post-treatment comparisons will be made within each of the two treatment groups. Clinical Significance: The proposed intervention has the potential to restore safe, coordinated, functional walking in the every day environment."
"9278209","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Membrane fusion underlies hormone secretion, neurotransmission, and all exocytic and endocytic traffic. Its mechanism is conserved from yeast to humans. A current paradigm suggests that membrane proteins termed SNAREs inexorably drive fusion when anchored in apposed membranes as a trans-SNARE complex. While SNAREs are required, genetic studies from yeast to humans show that Rab GTPases, their effectors, SM proteins, and SNARE chaperones are also essential. Our studies of yeast vacuole fusion are providing a new paradigm, illuminating the integrated mechanisms of these other essential proteins and showing that their actions extend beyond regulation of trans-SNARE complex levels. Vacuole fusion studies have progressed from initial genetics through our extensive study of in vitro organelle fusion to proteoliposome fusion, which we have reconstituted with all purified and defined proteins and lipids: SNAREs, SNARE disassembly chaperones Sec18p/Sec17p, the Rab GTPase Ypt7p, a hexameric Rab effector complex HOPS, and lipids which include acidic and bilayer-averse headgroups and specific fatty acyl chains. With a rigorous fusion assay of protected lumenal content mixing, our studies show that fusion is driven by several cooperating factors: bilayer stress from trans-SNARE complex assembly, membrane destabilization by nonbilayer lipids, and bilayer bending through the action of a multisubunit tether. Fusion is blocked by the omission of SNAREs, of nonbilayer-prone lipids, or of tethering factors, even though SNAREs still pair in trans in the latter 2 conditions. Our chemically-defined reconstitution of fusion allows independent variation of SNARE concentration, nonbilayer lipid concentration, and the HOPS and Rab tethering proteins, all while assaying both physical associations and fusion function. Testing and extending this model system is changing our view of fusion. In light of the fundamental role of fusion throughout human physiology, and the central role of human HOPS for cellular infection by Marburg and Ebola viruses and by bacteria such as the pathogen Coxiella burnetii, these studies will be of medical significance as well."

"9312881","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although schizophrenia researchers have a rich history of identifying psychometric confounds in clinical studies, problems continue to plague some areas of the field because these confounds have been addressed using measurement technologies developed in the early 20th century. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), for instance, links between brain activation and behavior elicited through working memory (WM) tasks used during scanning can be obscured by confounds stemming from traditional measurement technology. The central premise of this grant is that applying modern measurement theory to task development is critical for using fMRI to test advanced brain-behavior models of cognitive psychopathology. Accordingly, this project will focus on training and research in psychometric imaging. The award will provide the candidate with support to pursue career development objectives that complement his expertise in advanced measurement theory and technology with training in fMRI with an applied focus on schizophrenia. The first training objective is for the candidate to obtain knowledge and skills needed to conduct schizophrenia research. In Specific Aim 1 he will use this training to show that matching item difficulty to WM ability through neurocognitive computerized adaptive testing minimizes and equates standard errors of ability estimates between patients and controls. This aim will establish an innovative methodology for eliminating the differential reliability confound in schizophrenia research. The second training objective is for the candidate to obtain knowledge and skills needed to conduct fMRI research. In Specific Aim 2 he will use this training to compare blood oxygen level-dependent response in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between schizophrenia and control participants in order to test inverted-U and neural inefficiency brain activation models of WM deficits in schizophrenia. This aim will formally test two widely assumed but unconfirmed theories of cognitive psychopathology in the disorder. The third training objective is for the candidate to develop analytical skills needed to study functional bran networks. In Specific Aim 3 he will use this training to map spatiotemporal activation patterns in fMRI data using state-space modeling in order to explore the theory that patients show more disorganized neural recruitment than controls. This aim will robustly test the brain-behavior theory positing that WM deficits in schizophrenia are associated with poorly organized patterns of neural recruitment-as manifested by an increased number of brain-states and by activation that is uncoupled from performance-using a well-defined and modern psychometric testing approach. The candidate's long-term goals are to provide psychometric imaging consultation to researchers studying schizophrenia and other brain-based disorders and to develop an R01 plan to study advanced neuroimaging and mathematical modeling of cognitive psychopathology in psychotic disorders. This line of research will contribute to public health by identifying potential neural targets for psychiatric treatments aimed at reducing neurocognitive deficits in psychosis."
"9300932","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal-infant feeding style, defined as a mother's approach to regulating infant feeding, is a critical, potentially modifiable mediator linking povery and child obesity. Evidence has documented that poverty-related risks directly impact feeding styles and create barriers to intervention engagement. This suggests the need to address both risks and barriers to improve intervention impact. Pediatric platforms represent an opportunity to address these risks and barriers due to their ability to access low-income families with poverty-related risks beginning in early infancy. The candidate proposes a mentored support period of five years to acquire expertise in developing strategies to improve obesity prevention in the context of poverty beginning during infancy. The candidate is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics with the long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical research investigator. This goal will be achieved through training from expert multidisciplinary mentors from the fields of developmental-behavioral pediatrics, applied developmental psychology, nutrition science and biostatistics, formal coursework and other career development activities. She will gain advanced skills in: 1) applying theoretical frameworks from developmental psychology to patient-oriented research addressing poverty-related risks; 2) state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing maternal-infant feeding interactions; 3) complex quantitative longitudinal data analysis with repeated measures; 4) qualitative research methodologies to identify barriers and facilitators of intervention engagement with low-income families; 5) intervention development and evaluation; and 6) grant writing. The practical application of these goals will be accomplished through three study aims. In Aim 1, Dr. Gross will conduct a secondary analysis of longitudinal data from a large ongoing study of an early obesity prevention intervention to systematically describe the relationships between poverty-related risks and maternal-infant feeding styles and the degree to which these styles impact caloric intake and infant weight trajectories. In Aim 2, Dr. Gross will use qualitative methodologies to inform the conceptualization and development of strategies to address poverty-related risks and barriers that can be incorporated into a behavior change intervention and integrated into a population-scalable primary care-based platform. In Aim 3, Dr. Gross will pilot test these strategies for feasibility of implementation and obtaining preliminary estimates of effect size. The successful execution of this proposal will lead to an R01 application to test the efficacy of an obesity prevention intervention that addresses poverty-related risks and barriers using a population-scalable primary care-based platform to increase responsive maternal-infant feeding styles and reduce early child obesity."
"9306890","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment of prematurity remains an unsolved problem and a top public health priority. There are nearly 500,000 premature births each year and more infants die of preterm-related problems than from any other single cause. Although many of these babies recover with conventional management, the mortality and morbidity of extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, defined as <28 weeks estimated gestational age) is extremely high, with less than 50% surviving without disability. Many of these complications are caused, in part, by our attempts to ventilate the immature lungs and reverse fetal circulation. Although incremental progress has been made in treating premature infants with surfactant and less invasive ventilation strategies, effective treatment options remain an unsolved problem. A major paradigm shift in the post-natal treatment of prematurity would be to simulate the intrauterine environment with a specially designed extracorporeal gas exchange system which maintains fetal circulation and allows growth and development without air breathing; we call this technology the Artificial Placenta (AP). Our long term goal is the clinical application of the AP to improve survival and reduce morbidity in ELGANs. We have developed fetal lamb models which correspond to various stages of prematurity in humans. We initially developed the AP in fetal lambs of 130 day gestation (corresponding to 29 weeks human gestation; saccular stage of lung development) with recovery to air breathing. More recent preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of providing complete extracorporeal support for one week in a 110 day sheep model (equivalent to a 22 week gestation human fetus; canalicular stage of lung development) with hemodynamic stability, excellent gas exchange, normally developing alveolarization, stable cerebral perfusion and maintenance of fetal circulation, all without mechanical ventilation. The goal of this research proposal is to evaluate and refine this system of intrauterine simulation to support fetal lambs from extreme prematurity, at the canalicular stage of lung development, to viable extra-uterine neonatal physiology. To accomplish this goal, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1. to evaluate fetal circulation, hemodynamics, and lung development under variable conditions of airway management and controlled fetal/newborn circulation in the 118 day lamb model. 2. To evaluate brain and systemic bleeding and embolism during AP without heparin and assess cerebral perfusion, function, development, and white matter injury. 3. To maintain the simulated intrauterine environment using the artificial placenta until lung development and circulation can support air breathing, including addressing potential problems with long-term support (infection, nutrition, gastrointestinal function, and metabolic issues)."
"9361852","PROJECT SUMMARY Achieving the goal of the IDeA-CTR Program to improve our nation's health requires that the research establishment recruit and effectively train scientists and physicians to collaboratively conduct cutting edge clinical and translational biomedical research. Accordingly, the mission of the Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network's Professional Development Core (PDC) is to develop robust mentoring programs and novel, effective educational offerings that increase the number and the productivity of those engaged in clinical and translational research in our region. Several important principles will guide the development of the PDC. These will include: (i) a strong focus on developing educational offerings and mentoring programs that take advantage of the diverse strengths of our institutions and their faculty; (ii) the development of specific educational programs and resources that prioritize and actively ?catalyze?, team science, thus enhancing our ability to initiate and manage complex multidisciplinary and multi-institutional translational research projects; (iii) the development of innovative team-based ?mosaic? mentoring models that recognize the complex mix of professional expectations placed on clinical investigators; (iv) a commitment to bringing more practicing clinicians into the investigative arena to take advantage of their clinical expertise and access to potential research subjects; and (v) the recognition that our education and mentorship programs must facilitate a bi-directional flow of ideas and information within our institutions and our region. The PDC will accomplish these goals by addressing the following specific aims: 1) to enhance the capabilities of basic scientists and collaborating physicians to conceive, participate in and manage multidisciplinary and bi- directional bench-to-bedside translational research projects; 2) to develop flexible, but rigorous and coordinated educational and training programs to enhance the research competency and participation of clinicians based within varied practice settings and disciplines and with a diverse set of professional goals; 3) to take advantage of the rich supply of mentors at our differing institutions, so as to develop a novel, team- based, mosaic mentorship model that provides guidance and enduring support to mentees with diverse needs and professional goals in order to actively facilitate their success; and 4) to develop a unique certificate program for training PhD and masters level scientists to become clinical and translational research catalysts or community practice-based research catalysts as a defined career path to enhance the national capacity for conducting clinical and translational research. Achieving these specific aims will strongly enhance our ability to foster collaborative, multidisciplinary clinical and translational biomedical research across Northern New England."
"9304060","Project 3 Abstract: Long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to continuous low-level human immunodeficiency viral infection and end organ disease that includes the central nervous system. This is often seen as subclinical cognitive impairments recorded only by neuropsychological examination. We posit that the long-acting nanoformulated ART (nanoART) developed in Projects 1 and 2 would lead to minimal if no toxicities when recorded by conventional immune, chemical, hematologic, biochemical and histologic endpoints (Project 2). However, what cannot be seen by such parameters are measures of subcellular function (mitochondria), cellular function (energy and membrane metabolism) and tissue structure and function (myelination, neurotransmitter and metabolic aberrations). Changes in these parameters may also be missed by standard behavioral and cognitive tests. To these ends, we wish to take nanotoxicology to yet another level. Here we seek to decipher subtle effects of the virus and nanoART therapy is through brain metabolomics. To accomplish this goal, we have replicated a portion of the behavioral, histological, and neuroimaging abnormalities observed in human neuroAIDS in a humanized mouse model of HIV-1 infection. The model is divergent from others available in that it supports sustained viral replication, results in spontaneous neural disease associated with CD4+ T cell loss and metabolomics change. We will use this model as a platform to determine long-term effects (measured in months) of aberrations in neural function and region specific brain biochemistry with untargeted metabolomics. Identified biochemical pathways will be validated by targeted measures. Such studies will be highly sensitive. Specifically, we will bridge these data sets with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and magnetization transfer magnetic resonance imaging. These linkages will serve to guide translational studies with an eye towards clinical utility. Validation of the experimental results will be made through histopathological tests (with Core C). Validation of magnetic resonance imaging using ligand coated magnetite particles in mouse and monkey experiments will be done through complete pharmacokinetic analyses (performed in conjunction with Project 2 and Core B), and confirmed by produced small magnetite antiretroviral particles and virologic and immunologic assays (with Project 1 and Core C)."

"9348951","Incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder is a major problem for the VA, affecting roughly 20% of individuals serving in OIF or OEF. Women appear to be more susceptible to development of PTSD than men, often occurring in the context of sexual assault (which can occur during military service). Frontline treatment options (e.g., SSRIs) can improve symptoms but do not currently offer a cure. To develop further strategies to this end, it is critical to understand the foundations of the disease process as it develops. This proposal is designed to examine the role of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide, or PACAP, in mediating the development of aberrant physiological and behavioral fear responses following exposure to a chronic stress regimen. Recent studies indicate that polymorphisms in the primary PACAP receptor, PAC1, are linked to PTSD susceptibility in women. Preclinical data link deficits in PACAP to impaired emotional memory and blunted corticosterone stress responses, both of which accompany PTSD. Moreover, our preliminary studies suggest that chronic stress produces a profound and long-lasting deficit in PACAP expression in the prefrontal cortex, a region known to be dysfunctional in PTSD patients. These studies will use behavioral, physiological and genetic approaches to test the hypothesis that prefrontal cortex PACAP inhibits the development of PTSD-related physiological and behavioral deficits caused by chronic stress, identifying it as a potential therapeutic target. Aim 1 will test whether prefrontal PACAP signaling is necessary and sufficient to block the negative impact of chronic stress on behavioral and physiological indices of post-traumatic stress in rats. Endpoints tested include fear conditioning, extinction and extinction recall; fear generalization; anxiety-related behaviors; and hypothalamo-pituitary responses, all of which are disrupted following chronic stress (and in PTSD). Aim 2 will use prefrontal cortex-directed RNA interference and PACAP supplementation to test whether supplementation of PACAP during chronic stress can prevent the development of post-traumatic endpoints, or if loss of PACAP signaling is sufficient to induce aberrant emotional responses in otherwise unstressed animals. Aim 3 will test use electrophysiology and state-of-the-art imaging approaches to test the role of PACAP in mitigating potentially deleterious neuroplastic responses to chronic stress at the cellular level. In all cases, experiments will be performed in male and female subjects, to evaluate the possibility that females may be more sensitive to perturbations in PACAP signaling. These studies will provide important information regarding the prospect of using PACAP supplementation as a PTSD treatment, and determine whether females may be more likely to benefit from PACAP therapy."

"9297188","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The potential of genomics to identify genes important for alcoholism has not been completely realized because ethanol produces a surfeit of changes in gene expression, most of which do not seem to make any meaningful contribution to the ethanol response of interest. A simple and effective way to pan for genomic changes relevant for an alcoholism phenotype would be invaluable. The problem is solved by focusing on genes that show common changes produced by two chemically and metabolically dissimilar drugs, ethanol and benzyl alcohol, which produce cross-tolerance by a mechanism with a shared molecular origin. Genes that respond in the same way to both alcohols will be identified by genomically surveying epigenetic histone modifications and gene expression. These will be functionally tested by mutant analysis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an animal that has ethanol responses remarkably similar to humans. The alcohol response genes will be tested for a functional role in ethanol tolerance and two withdrawal/dependence symptoms - alcohol withdrawal induced hyperexcitability and cognitive ethanol dependence. Parts of this response have already been shown to be conserved in mammals. To directly bridge our work to human alcoholism the data will be collaboratively compared to human alcoholic datasets. The advantage of using Drosophila is that candidate genes can be rapidly and functionally tested by mutant analysis for their role in producing these ethanol responses. In Aim 1, chromatin and RNA will be prepared from the heads of flies treated with ethanol or benzyl alcohol. Epigenetic and gene expression changes common to both drugs will be identified by ChIP-seq to identify changes in histone H3 and H4 acetylation and methylation (H3K36me1 and H3K36me3). These histone marks have tight linkage to changes in gene activity. RNA-seq will be used to monitor changes in gene expression. These candidates and pre-existing candidates from an epigenetic screen will be tested in Aim 2 and 3 by mutant, RNAi, and mis-expression analysis. In Aim 2, candidate genes will be tested for a role in functional tolerance to ethanol sedation. In Aim 3, th effects of mutations on alcohol-withdrawal will be determined electrophysiologically in adults and behaviorally in larvae. Adult flies show alcohol-withdrawal hyperexcitability that increases the susceptibility for seizures. While in ethanol-adapted larvae, the capacity for associative learning declines during withdrawal and is restored after ethanol reinstatement-demonstrating functional dependence. This contribution will be significant because it will define the origins of  functional tolerance phenotype and establish its relationship to dependence phenotypes. The proposed research is innovative because it uses 1) a shared drug response to focus a genomic survey on ethanol-response genes, 2) epigenetic histone modifications to help identify genes that transcriptionally respond to ethanol intoxication, and 3) new behavioral assays that allow us to detect tolerance and physiological dependence in flies. Over its 5 year span, this project will be used to train 2 post-docs, 2 graduate (Ph.D) and 10 undergraduate students."

"9306163","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): (PI Gladfelter, AS) Macromolecules can partition by liquid-liquid phase separation without membrane compartmentalization. We found this mechanism is critical in the large, multinucleate cells of the fungus Ashbya gossypii whose nuclei divide asynchronously in a common cytoplasm and many sites of polarity coexist. Both nuclear asynchrony and polarity rely on spatially organized cytosol and serve as powerful functional measures of regionalized cytoplasm. We discovered that specific mRNA-protein assemblies promote formation of distinct cytoplasmic compartments not delimited by membranes. These assemblies behave as phase-separated liquid droplets that control the localization of mRNAs encoding key proteins (cyclins and formins). One driving force for phase separation is the polyQ-containing and low complexity sequences (LCS) found in two mRNA-binding proteins, Whi3 and Puf2. Our work revealed novel physiological functions for polyQ tracts outside of pathological contexts in generating cellular phase separations. A key feature of our model system is the clear functional read-outs for disruption of cytoplasmic partitioning, enabling us to link biophysical changes in phase-separated compartments to cellular function.    Our proposed work addresses how discrete physiological RNA- protein (RNP) droplets assemble and how their biophysical properties contribute spatial organization to cytosol. We combine quantitative, live cell imaging in cells with in vitro reconstitution and mathematical modeling. We exploit multiple functionally relevant readouts of RNP droplets including cell cycle regulation and polarity initiation. The work spans multiple size scales by addressing the molecular mechanism of droplet assembly from the level of single molecules up to functional roles in translation in whole cells. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Determine how mRNA controls RNP droplet assembly, properties and function; Aim 2. Determine how cytoplasmic signals lead to variable droplet assembly and function; Aim 3. Determine mechanisms by which RNP droplets spatially regulate translation. This fundamental work impacts diverse cell processes, as phase separation of macromolecules is a conserved mechanism of patterning cytosol in distinct cell types. It is hypothesized that many proteins that are linked to toxic amyloid or aggregated states exist in liquid or phase separated states for normal function, and that the liquid state is a step in the assembly path of mature amyloids. Thus, understanding mRNP droplet regulation is important for understanding how cells manage the balance point between physiological and pathological aggregates that are the hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases.

"9492891","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): At birth, the newborn kidneys are functionally immature and exhibit higher vascular resistance and lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared with adults. Renal immaturity put neonates at risk for kidney injury, especially when renal hemodynamics is altered by adverse perinatal events including hypovolemia, asphyxia, sepsis, and renal ischemia. Several areas of neonatal renal hemodynamics remain unexplored. In particular, mechanisms that control neonatal renal vascular tone and pathological alterations that result in hypoperfusion during acute kidney injury (AKI) are unclear. A growing body of evidence suggests that members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels contribute to the intrinsic regulation of vascular tone and organ blood flow. Whether TRP channels control neonatal renal vascular resistance and hemodynamics is unknown. The present application originates from preliminary findings suggesting that the vanilloid transient receptor potential (TRPV) subfamily, member 4 is expressed in neonatal preglomerular renal artery and arteriole myocytes and regulates myogenic vasoconstriction, regional kidney perfusion, and GFR. Data from our pilot studies also suggest that alterations in renal vascular TRPV4 channel expression are associated with kidney hypoperfusion in renal ischemia/reperfusion-induced neonatal AKI. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that activation of vascular myocyte TRPV4 channels contributes to neonatal renal blood flow autoregulation, and that alterations in renal vascular myocyte TRPV4 channel expression and activity amplify kidney hypoperfusion in neonatal AKI. To address this hypothesis, three Specific Aims will be studied using newborn pigs. We will test the hypotheses that: 1. Intravascular pressure activates myocyte TRPV4 channels, leading to membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction in neonatal renal preglomerular arteries, 2. Myocyte TRPV4 channels regulate neonatal renal microcirculation, GFR, and electrolyte homeostasis, and 3. Renal ischemia-reperfusion in neonates upregulates arterial myocyte TRPV4 channel expression and activity, leading to hypoperfusion and a reduction in GFR. This application will identify TRPV4 channels as an important modulator of glomerular functions in neonates."
"9297088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 500,000 Americans have end stage renal disease, in which kidney function is insufficient to sustain life. Organ function can be supplemented by dialysis in these individuals; however the 10 year survival rate for individuals on dialysis is just over 10%. Survival rates are much better for patients receiving a kidney transplant but organ supply does not match demand. Ex vivo organogenesis has the potential both to provide functional tissue for renal replacement therapy and to provide research tools with which we can understand the causes of chronic kidney disease and identify new therapies. Furthermore, defining signals that functionally direct nephrogenesis may identify pathways that can be manipulated to augment the regenerative response of the injured kidney in vivo. Our group is able to promote nephrogenesis in cultures of purified primary nephron progenitor cells derived from human stem cells and mouse embryonic kidneys. However, we have identified two key obstacles that must be overcome if this discovery is to have significant impact on human health. First, we must recreate signaling environments that promote progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in order to obtain sufficient tubule mass for functional analysis. Second, we must devise ex vivo tissue architecture that supports differentiation of arrayed nephrons with vascular connections that are appropriately patterned. The long-term goal of this proposal is to define the tissue architecture and cell signaling microenvironments required to promote the generation of appropriately patterned nephrons in culture. We will investigate signaling mechanisms that are sufficient to promote NPC renewal and differentiation and apply these findings to the development of ex vivo nephron devices using silk protein as a scaffolding biomaterial. Our data show that NPCs efficiently colonize silk and that nephron tubules form in this material. Silk is the material of choice because it is already in clinical use and it is scalale, allowing us to generate structures dimensioned for mouse or human. We will leverage the strengths of the project investigators in kidney and endothelial development as well as bioengineering to develop an integrated, multi-cellular, patterned, functional nephron in vitro. State of the art, innovative technologies will be applied to NPCs differentiated from both human embryonic stem cells and embryonic mouse kidneys. Novel scaffolding and matrix formulations that allow organized 3D organogenesis of tissues in culture will be explored. The investigative group has a 10-year history of collaboration, which is particularly evident in the integrated natur of our preliminary data. We will leverage this program to develop a seamless exchange of engineering and signaling expertise, materials and intellectual innovation between all four laboratories. The program therefore includes a framework for continual scientific exchange including a data tracking website, a bi-monthly schedule of group meetings and face-to-face meetings approximately every 6 months."
"9303332","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual minority (e.g., non-heterosexual) populations experience higher rates of substance use, problematic substance use, mental health disorders, and health related distress and problems. Unique stressors such as discriminatory experiences, expectations of discrimination, internalization of social stigma, and concealment of sexual orientation, collectively termed sexual minority stress, are the primary explanatory model for these health disparities. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on the candidate's demonstrated track record of working with sexual minority populations by developing expertise in bio-behavioral and clinical research to optimize HIV/AIDS prevention in HIV+, substance-using men who have sex with men (MSM). The career development plan includes advanced training in 1) gene expression, 2) clinical research with substance-using MSM, and 3) advanced statistical methods. Aim 1 of the proposed study will examine the direct and indirect pathways (i.e., through stimulant use) whereby sexual minority stress may be associated with gene expression related to functional inflammatory processes among HIV+, methamphetamine-using MSM. Leveraging the infrastructure of an existing randomized controlled trial with HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM (R01-DA033854; Carrico, PI), the cross- sectional associations among sexual minority stress, stimulant use, and the expression of inflammatory genes will be examined. Aim 2 will develop and pilot test a 10 session, individually-delivered, cognitive-behavioral intervention focused on modifying sexual minority stress responses among HIV-positive MSM who engage in episodic and binge patterns of substance use. This intervention development work will culminate in a pilot randomized controlled trial to test whether this novel sexual minority stress intervention (compared to an attention-control condition) can boost and extend the effects of personalized cognitive counseling, a single session intervention that has demonstrated efficacy for reducing substance use among MSM who are not seeking formal substance abuse treatment. Using outcome data from this pilot randomized controlled trial, the potential clinical utility of the sexual minority stress intervention will be examined with respectto reductions in substance use, sexual minority stress, and inflammatory gene expression. Taken together, this research and training plan will lay the foundation for a planned randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of this sexual minority stress intervention for targeting he interrelated epidemics of substance use and HIV/AIDS among MSM."
"9301064","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropathy is a painful and debilitating condition that affects over 15 million Americans. Surprisingly over 30% of patients are labeled as idiopathic even after an extensive evaluation. For those patients with the most common cause of neuropathy, diabetes, glucose control remains the only effective treatment. Unfortunately, greater than 40 percent of patients with diabetes will develop neuropathy despite good glucose control. These observations highlight the need to identify modifiable risk factors for neuropathy that may be the cause of idiopathic neuropathy and the factors that in addition to high serum glucose lead to diabetic neuropathy. Metabolic syndrome components may be these important modifiable risk factors in neuropathy. This syndrome is comprised of multiple cardiovascular risk factors that tend to cluster together. Past observational studies have implicated one or more of these components in the development of neuropathy, but these studies have suffered from significant design limitations. Most studies were only cross-sectional in design and focused only on diabetic populations. Furthermore, these studies did not apply a standardized definition of neuropathy, and case classification was often based on one diagnostic test. In this career development award, we propose to quantify the impact of the metabolic syndrome on neuropathy and to determine which metabolic syndrome components are associated with neuropathy in two specific aims. In aim 1, we will compare the prevalence of neuropathy in a metabolic syndrome cohort with lean controls by utilizing extensive neuropathy phenotyping. In aim 2, we will employ cross-sectional and longitudinal designs to identify which metabolic syndrome components are associated with neuropathy. The cross-sectional design has the advantage of applying clinical neuropathy outcome measures prior to any intervention. The advantage of the longitudinal component is that we can investigate the relationship of the dynamic changes in metabolic syndrome components after a diet and exercise regimen with changes in neuropathy outcome measures. The overall goal of this project is to identify modifiable risk factors for the development of neuropathy that will lead to interventional clinical trials to prevent and/or treat neuropathy. This proposal is essential to my career development. I will become an independent clinical researcher with expertise in neurologic complications from endocrinologic disease states. The biostatistician and epidemiologic formal training and practical experiences will set the stage for successful completion of not only this project, but also of future investigations. The clinical trial component of my career development will allow me to take the results from this study and seamlessly transition into interventional studies that will lead to new treatments for patients with neuropathy. Drs. Eva Feldman and Charles Burant are ideally suited as mentors for this project with their complementary expertise in neuropathy and metabolic phenotyping. The vast resources of the University of Michigan, including the Neuropathy Center, the Investigational Weight Management Clinic, the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research, and the school of Public Health, will significantly contribute to the successful completion of this proposal."
"9307953","Twenty-three years after identification of the CFTR gene, controversies still surround the pathogenesis of airways disease, we lack answers to many crucial questions, current treatments are inadequate, and cystic fibrosis (CF) remains a life shortening and too often lethal disease. A major impediment to progress has been lack of a CF animal model other than the mouse. CF mice fail to develop lung disease, the cause of most CF morbidity and mortality. We have now developed pigs with targeted alterations of the CFTR gene. CF pigs spontaneously develop the hallmark features of CF lung disease, including airway infection, inflammation, airway wall remodeling, mucus accumulation, and airway obstruction. Within hours of birth, CF pigs fail to eradicate bacteria as effectively as wild-type pigs. In this Program three senior and highly accomplished investigators will seize the unique opportunity to use CF pigs to answer key questions about CF lung disease. Together, the three projects will discover how loss of CFTR function affects: a) mucociliary transport; b) the response of airways to viral infection; c) HCO3-  secretion and control of airway surface liquid pH; and d) bacterial killing on the airway surface. The Project Leaders have an outstanding track record of collaboration in CF, and here they sharpen their focus to a common goal. Their research is highly creative and is supported by five cores that provide innovative services and infrastructure.

"9269079","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to improve the safety and efficacy of transfusion of stored blood. There is good evidence that red blood cell storage results in loss of functionality and integrity of red blood cells over time and that this contributes to deleterious effects upon blood transfusion. This project, which is a competitive renewal of a previously funded one, is built around the hypothesis that this storage lesion is largely due to dysregulation of nitric oxide homeostasis in the blood. This disruption is due to increased nitric oxide scavenging by cell-free hemoglobin and microparticles that are released during hemolysis in stored blood and diminished nitric oxide production by the newly discovered red cell nitric oxide synthase. In this renewal we will examine the exact mechanisms of loss of NO bioavailability, as well as down-stream effects of this loss, particularly platelet activation. e will also study interactions that occur in a susceptible host receiving the transfusion. A vast array of clinical, biophysical, molecular biology, and biochemical tools will be applied to characterize the nitric oxide storage lesion in vitro in stored blood as well as in chimeric mice models, a canine model, and in human studies. In addition, therapeutics will be explored in these systems that could restore nitric oxide homeostasis by increasing nitric oxide production."
"9360136","Project Summary  The goal of our R21 project is to develop a powerful platform that will be able to generate and assay millions of combinations of CRISPR/Cas9 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) or other genetic perturbagens. Doing so will clear the way for systematic exploration of genetic interactions in mammalian cells. There are many reasons to develop this high-throughput mammalian genetic technology. Currently there is no systematic method to unravel the assortment of genetic interactions that drive specific cancers and determine the variability of individual treatment responses. Nor is there a robust method to study gene interactions in other complex multigenic diseases such as Parkinson's.  We are motivated by the tremendous advances recently made in yeast and worms that have resulted from systematic discovery of genetic interactions. Genetic interaction maps in yeast have revealed functional relationships within and between protein complexes orders of magnitude beyond those revealed by protein- protein interaction screens. Systematic screening 65,000 pairs of genes in worms led to the identification of a class of highly connected `hub' genes encoding chromatin regulators. The technologies behind these discoveries depend on several high-throughput steps, including a dependable gene knockout or knockdown method, a method to deliver two gene knockouts/knockdowns into the same cell and to monitor which cells receive which combinations, and also a reliable assay to measure relative fitness.  Our major enabling technology for development of a high-throughput system for mammalian cells is the tandem-integration landing pad that allows two plasmids to be inserted next to each other at a neutral location of the genome. Each plasmid contains a DNA barcode that uniquely identifies the associated genetic perturbagen (e.g. sgRNAs). When both plasmids are integrated into the genome, the two barcodes are in close enough proximity to be sequenced together by paired-end amplicon sequencing. We have established this methodology in yeast and have shown that it can generate a library of >108 double barcoded cells via pooled sequential plasmid transformation and integration. The fitness of large double barcode libraries can then be measured using the fit-seq approach that we pioneered: pooled growth and double barcode amplicon sequencing over several time points accurately measures the relative fitness of each double barcoded cell in the pool. In yeast, Genetic interaction Sequencing (GiSeq) promises to be a cheaper and higher-throughput alternative to the commonly used synthetic-genetic array technology. In mammalian cells, GiSeq promises to be a major leap forward over existing technologies: not only will genome-scale interaction libraries become practical, but negligible work will be needed to repeat a screen in a different cells or different conditions.  For this proposal, we will establish the utility of GiSeq in mammalian cells (Aims 1 and 2), and prepare reagents to perform genetic interaction screens in vivo (Aim 3)."
"9312905","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Pain is more than a sensation processed by the peripheral nervous system. Pain engages the central nervous system via multiple cortical and subcortical networks. Neuropathic pain is a chronic pain resulting from damage to the somatosensory nervous system which can cause detrimental changes to physiological, psychological, and behavioral aspects of life. Neuropathic pain alters the structure, chemistry, and connectivity of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in humans. Importantly, circuits comprising the mPFC are essential in processing emotional components of our everyday experiences, and therefore, are implicated in the affective component, or unpleasantness, of pain. A comprehensive understanding is lacking regarding the functionality of pain- relevant circuitry in the mPFC under normal conditions and in animal models of neuropathic pain. Therefore, this proposal seeks to understand the organization and function of both intracortical (local) and subcortical (long-range) synaptic inputs to a major population of mPFC neurons with specific targeting to a key subcortical pain structure: the periaqueductal gray (PAG). The PAG is a link in the primary pain-modulating network essential for endogenous analgesia and autonomic response to pain. Our objectives are 1) to elucidate the local and long-range circuitry of cortico-PAG neurons in the mPFC and 2) to assess the specific mechanisms by which the neural elements of cortico-PAG circuitry are altered by neuropathic pain. To accomplish these goals, we will develop a multifaceted approach involving retrograde labeling, electrophysiology, circuit mapping, optogenetic and behavioral techniques. The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying the neural mechanisms through which neuropathic pain alters circuit function in cognitive and emotional networks of the brain (specifically mPFC-PAG) will produce critical knowledge regarding the affective dimension of pain. Such an understanding can lead to novel strategies for therapeutic intervention. Our findings will contribute new and important insights into cellular and circuit mechanisms for how neuropathic pain alters specific cortical networks essential in the perception and emotional relevance of pain."

Ultimately, this training will prepare researchers to interface across disciplines and will increase the number of well-rounded researchers, significantly advancing the health-related research needs of the nation (the primary objective of the T32 program). The proposed postdoctoral training plan provides a variety of opportunities including: (1) mentored research training in specific methods, disorders, and underlying pathogenetic mechanisms; (2) a range of didactic experiences (including courses, seminars, and lectures) that integrate the study of clinical disorders, normal developmental processes, mechanisms of disease, and research methods; and, (3) clinical exposures to complement previous basic science and basic science exposure to complement clinical experiences. Twenty Ph.D. or M.D. level trainees (four new trainees per year) will participate in this two-year training program, over the five-year period of this proposal. This proposal addresses the critical need for focused training opportunities beyond formal graduate programs by using the existing interdisciplinary research and administrative structure of the Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities (CIDD). All faculty mentors are members of the CIDD, which offers a comprehensive program for services, education, and research in developmental disabilities. Together with the excellent clinical and basic science resources of the University of North Carolina (UNC), the CIDD provides an ideal environment for integrating training in biological and behavioral research in neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9301049","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a major complication and cause for morbidity and mortality in diabetes mellitus. Despite much effort and investment, there is no clear pathogenic mechanism underlying the disease and therapeutic options are limited to pain management and symptomatic treatments. We propose to test an epigenetic mechanism that will open the door to new treatment options. Studies indicate acerbate (vitamin C) deficiency in tissues of diabetes, caused by the oxidation of acerbate to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). DHA is then outcompeted (~1:300) by high glucose for cellular uptake leading to intracellular acerbate reduction. Intriguingly, acerbate is essential in axonal myelination by Schwann cells in vitro. Acerbate deficiency also is known to cause peripheral neuropathy in humans and hypomyelination in mice. It is plausible that deficiency in acerbate plays a critical role in demyelinating DPN. Recently, we uncovered a novel function of acerbate in regulating DNA demethylation, which has been validated by others. Ascorbate enhances the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which is the major pathway for active DNA demethylation. New insights gleaned from the epigenetic studies led us to develop an unconventional, exceptionally novel hypothesis: The epigenome of Schwann cells is impaired specifically by intracellular ascorbate shortage, leading to demyelinating DPN. Three specific aims are designed to test our hypothesis: (1) To test whether ascorbate deficiency causes demyelinating DPN in vivo; (2) To test whether ascorbate treatment can delay or prevent demyelinating DPN in mice. (3) To test whether an impaired epigenome of Schwann cells caused by ascorbate deficiency underlies demyelinating DPN. Testing this hypothesis will have a significant impact on science and health in the following aspects. (1) Identifying a novel mechanism for DPN and a fresh start for this field to understand pathomechanisms. (2) None of the current rodent models of diabetes mellitus develop demyelinating DPN. Our research will establish a rodent model with demyelination phenotypes, which will be extremely useful to study DPN pathogenesis and to screen drug candidates. (3) This research will have a huge potential impact on clinical care of diabetic patients. Successful prevention of demyelinating DPN in rodent models will implicate the ascorbate pathway to delay or prevent DPN in diabetic patients. (4) This study will be a blueprint for investigations into other diabetic complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. By testing the exceptionally unconventional hypothesis using innovative approaches, this research will accelerate the knowledge of DPN. Our unique approach has the potential to open up entirely new pathways to a field that has made relatively little progress in the recent decade, especially in terms of translational applications."
"9316645","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate chromosome segregation is important for human health because its failure can lead to congenital malformations and is part of a cancer's progression to malignancy. A cell's ability to achieve mitotic and meiotic precision depends on kinetochore-microtubule (MT) interactions, which are the major source for the forces that organize and move chromosomes in preparation for cell division. Many proteins are involved, especially in the connections with MT plus ends that form as chromosomes become bi-oriented, but how these molecules do their jobs is currently unknown. Some of the relevant proteins are motor enzymes, some are MT binding proteins without motor activity, and some are regulatory enzymes that adjust the strength of MT binding, helping to eliminate improper connections. Experiments in yeasts have shown that chromosome movement depends less on kinetochore motors than non-motor, MT-binding proteins, which emphasizes the importance of these non-enzymatic links in mitosis for all kinds of cells. Images of mitotic kinetochores obtained by electron tomography suggest that at least some of the links between kinetochores and MT ends are made directly with the bent protofilaments that flare out at the ends of these dynamic polymers. Here we propose to study such links in human cells by pursuing promising leads discovered during our previous period of funding. The N-terminal moiety of centromere protein F (CENP-F) binds preferentially to oligomers of tubulin that are curled, whereas the C-terminal MT-binding site of this protein prefers MT walls. Both these interactions are likely to be important for mitosis because the connections between kinetochores and MT ends are the sites at which force is exerted on chromosomes and where the addition and loss of tubulin occurs during chromosome motion to and from the spindle poles. We will analyze the interactions of MTs with recombinant polypeptides generated from CENP-F cDNAs, using biochemical, cell biological and biophysical methods. The resulting data will clarify how MT plus-end dynamics can exert force on this MT-kinetochore coupler and show how CENP-F contributes to precise chromosome movement. MT binding sites on CENP-F will be mapped by protein cross- linking, proteolysis, and mass spectrometry. Amino acids important to these sites will be mutated, allowing us to measure their contribution to MT-CENP-F interactions in vitro. Both truncations of CENP-F and the point mutants identified as significant for MT binding will then be examined in vivo, using a recombinase-mediated cassette exchange strategy to generate stable mutant human cell lines. Thanks to RNA interference, either dominant or recessive mutants can be characterized for their effects on mitotic chromosome behavior. The biophysics of CENP-F interaction with dynamic MTs in vitro will let us characterize these interactions and their abilityto transduce significant force from MT shortening and growth. Together these results will elucidate the role(s) of CENP-F in the accurate segregation of human chromosomes and tell us whether this MT-kinetochore coupler might be a suitable target for novel drugs to arrest mitosis and inhibit unwanted cell growth."
"9306944","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The Duke University Program in Environmental Health (UPEH) is a proposed predoctoral training program which will prepare students for research careers in environmental health.

"9522946","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed MARC U*STAR program is to further increase the number of qualified URM undergraduates who continue their education at the Ph.D. level in the biomedical sciences. The project will consist of activities that represent a coordinated program that includes undergraduate recruitment, extensive research experience, and graduate school preparation. These activities are centered around the College Honors Sequence, coupled with specific courses for the MARC trainees to prepare them for the rigors of postgraduate training. In the previous funding period we made significant progress in implementing a more stringent student recruitment and selection process to screen out candidates interested in pursuing careers in medicine or fields unrelated to biomedical research; increasing numbers of MARC trainees from City College are now being admitted to doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences. Core goals of our program remain student recruitment and selection, and advisement and preparation for graduate school. Students will be placed in the laboratories of faculty in the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics. We will expand the pool of appropriate mentors and trainees with faculty and students from the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, Biomedical Engineering, and Psychology. We will also take advantage of the initiative by the City University of New York to expand science infrastructure; for example trainees interested in working on projects in structural biology will have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation for structural analyses of biomolecules at the newly constructed New York Structural Biology Center, and trainees interested in cancer research will be able to take advantage of opportunities created by City College's partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The implementation of the new MARC U*STAR program will benefit top science students, both trainees as well as non-trainees, thereby meeting the goals of strengthening the capability of the college to train students in the sciences, and enhancing their research training experience at City College."
"9307795","4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan. These analysis methods will give us the key background needed to advance our fundamental understanding of nanoparticle in-vivo delivery, and test ways to interrupt transport barriers in interventional future work."
"9331357","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application for a T32 predoctoral and postdoctoral training program describes a proposed plan for training in symptom management and palliative care research among adults with advanced disease - specifically cancer, heart failure, and chronic critical illness. The long-term goal of this training program is to train a diverse group nurse scientists who will advance our knowledge and understanding of how to provide effective palliation - - that is, management of symptoms - - that significantly impair quality of life in advanced and incurable disease states. Symptom management investigations are especially challenging in subject populations who have life-limiting, progressive disease, yet these are also the patients usually in greatest need of expert symptom management. In addition to measurement and instrument issues specific to single symptoms (e.g. pain, dyspnea), identifying appropriate end points in the context of disease progression, the high likelihood of missing data from subjects who are quite ill, and accounting for the effects of co-existing depression and anxiety when measuring physical symptoms are common challenges in this population. In order to advance our understanding of symptom management approaches and build the evidence base needed for effective palliative care, specific tailored preparation in methodologies and analytic strategies needed for research with persons with progressive, advanced illness are essential. This training program will address that need.  This NRSA will provide support for 8 predoctoral trainees and 9 post-doctoral trainees over the 5 years of the program. In addition to our typical applicant pool, we will particularly target BSN students for entry to the fast-track BSN-to-PhD program and members of minority groups. We have an existing internal program to identify promising BSN students in our school who demonstrate exceptional potential for moving directly in to a doctoral program. Our faculty also have leadership roles in national specialty organizations with large BSN memberships, and these will provide additional recruitment opportunities. Through our existing relationships with several colleges that have large minority student populations, we will be able to target recruitment to achieve a demographic balance in the training program. We have established collaborative relationships with a variety of accomplished researchers from other disciplines who will be active faculty participants on this training program. Both the pre- and postdoctoral training plans are built on a successful record of recruitment and productivity of previous graduates and we believe the focus of the proposed program will enable trainees to make significant contributions to this important area of nursing science."
"9265847","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human DNA polymerase delta (Pol ?) is a central enzyme in the replication of human chromosomal DNA and its repair. Pol ? thus has important roles in maintaining genomic integrity. We have established that the Pol ? holoenzyme (Pol ?4) is converted into a 3-subunit enzyme, Pol ?3, by the loss of its p12 subunit after cellular UV irradiation. Our central hypothesis is that Pol ?3 has altered properties which contribute to the cellular defense against genomic damage. The goals of this project are directed toward a) elucidating the properties of Pol ?3 and Pol ?4 in Okazaki fragment maturation and in facilitating translesion synthesis, and b) characterizing the cellular and molecular basis of p12 degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and CRL4Cdt2 and how they integrate p12 degradation into the cellular networks of DNA damage responses. Aim 1 addresses the abilities of Pol ?3 and Pol ?4 to perform Okazaki fragment processing in cooperation with Fen1, as well as the impact of ubiquitination of PCNA on this process. Model substrate templates will be used to test the hypotheses that Pol ?3 is well adapted to participate in Okazaki fragment processing, and that formation of ub- PCNA during DNA damage inhibits this process. Aim 2 addresses the mechanism and role of p12 degradation in translesion synthesis, and will test a novel hypothesis for the mechanisms of switching between Pol h and Pol ? on ub-PCNA. This hypothesis takes into account the fact that ub-PCNA is a hexavalent molecule on which both Pol ? and Pol h exhibit multivalent interactions that drive the recruitment and switching process. We will use rigorous pre-steady state kinetic analysis to quantitatively assess their switching rates. These studies will include other translesion polymerases that exhibit similar domain structures as Pol h to determine the generality of this mechanism. Aim 3 addresses our major discovery that p12 is a substrate of the CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase. Here we will characterize in a rigorous manner it's in vivo role in regulating p12 degradation in response to UV damage, as well as in cell cycle progression. The consequences of depletion or overexpression of p12 on UV sensitivity and cell growth will be investigated to elucidate the cellular functions of p12. Aim 4 addresses the role of RNF8 which targets p12 for degradation, and in addition, ubiquitinates PCNA to regulate translesion synthesis. Here we will determine the other components of RNF8 pathway that are needed for p12 degradation, and test the hypothesis that RNF8 integrates p12 degradation into several DNA damage signaling networks. This will focus on the currently unknown role of IR in triggering p12 degradation and its effect on HR. The goals of this project on the novel response to DNA damage caused by UV or chemical agents are directly related to the goals of the NIEHS. Impairments in this DNA damage response may increase genomic instability which is a key event in carcinogenesis."

"9302560","Project Summary Abstract The focus of this proposal is to characterize DAergic modulation of coarse and fine locomotor control using a multi-level integrative approach, from behavior to receptor signaling, that employs a powerful array of approaches. To gain a fundamental understanding of the cellular, network and modulatory properties that underlie the development of vertebrate locomotor activity it is critical to examine the neural mechanisms that drive the activity. This proposal is designed to address three main points: 1) Determine the neural mechanisms underlying a developmental switch in locomotor activity from an immature to a mature pattern by a combination of pharmacological, optogenetic and calcium imaging experiments, 2) Characterize the role of descending dopaminergic drive in fine motor behaviors, such as orienting and advancing maneuvers during hunting, by high-speed kinematic analysis of larvae with targeted inactivation (laser photoablation and/or optogenetic) of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral diencephalon, and 3) Identify spinal neurons modulated by the descending dopaminergic drive by correlating the expression of dopamine receptor mRNA transcripts with identified classes of putative locomotor-related spinal neurons. The broad intellectual scope of this proposal and the use of diverse experimental techniques, from simple behavioral measurements to the optical control of neuronal activity, permit the inclusion of students across various levels of sophistication, including high school (restricted to summer months), undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral associates. The lab currently has one graduate student, one post-doctoral associate (5+ years of experience), a senior research associate (over 20+ years of experience), and several undergraduates. Understanding the cellular, network and modulatory properties that underlie the development of locomotor activity will likely aid in developing therapeutic interventions for DAergic-related diseases of the motor system, such as Restless Leg Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movement Disorder and Parkinson's Disease."
"9301062","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a CTG expansion mutation located in the DMPK gene. The identification and characterization of RNA-binding proteins that interact with expanded CUG repeats and the discovery that a similar CCTG expansion in an intron causes myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), have provided strong support that RNA gain of function effects play an important role in DM manifestations in skeletal muscle. Although the CNS deficits are one of the most clinically significant aspects of DM, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes have been unclear. Progress during the current funding period extends our understanding of the CNS features of the disease and molecular mechanisms of microsatellite expansion mutations. Project #3 (PI: Day) has established that DM results in a striking diffuse abnormality of white matter integrity that parallels the cognitive deficits in children, and executive function deficits in adults. Project #2  (PI: Swanson) has extended our understanding of the role of RNA gain of function effects by demonstrating that another member of the MBNL gene family, MBNL2, is a critical regulator of alternative splicing during postnatal brain development. Project #1 (PI: Ranum) has made the unexpected discovery that microsatellite expansion mutations can express homopolymeric expansion proteins without the canonical AUG-initiation codon and that novel proteins accumulate in DM patient tissue. These results suggest novel expansion proteins contribute to DM. The focus of this proposal will be to better understand the clinical consequences of the DM1 and DM2 mutations and to relate specific clinical phenotypes to underlying molecular deficits. To accomplish these goals we propose 3 Projects and 2 Cores: Project 1: Repeat-Associated Non-ATG Translation in DM1 and DM2 Project 2: Mechanisms of RNA-Mediated CNS Pathogenesis in Myotonic Dystrophy Project 3: Clinical and Genetic Characterization of Myotonic Dystrophy Core A: Neuropathology/Functional Imaging Core Core B: Administrative Core."
"9381186","Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response."
"9277448","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A number of diseases and pathologies are associated with both urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction (ED), including diabetes, benign prostate hyperplasia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The co-occurrence of urinary bladder and erectile dysfunction suggests the existence of mechanistic commonalities. One such point of convergence is the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channel, as evidenced by the fact that targeted disruption of the pore-forming BKa-subunit leads to overactive detrusor, urinary incontinence, and ED. A second potential common denominator is the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway, which regulates BK channel function directly as well as indirectly through calcium signaling elements that modulate BK channel function. The NO/cGMP/PKG pathway is nearly universally associated with smooth muscle (SM) relaxation. Yet, in contrast to corpus cavernosum (CC) SM, where nitrergic signaling through the PKG pathway is a well-established mediator of SM relaxation and erectile function, the role of NO in urinary bladder (UB) SM is an unsettled issue. In Aim 1, UBSM and CCSM will be investigated at the molecular and cellular levels to establish the potential of NO/cGMP/PKG signaling to regulate SM function, with an emphasis on the role of the BK channel pathway. BK channel function and PKG regulatory mechanisms in intact bladder and corpus tissue will be addressed in Aim 2, which will also consider the role of the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE5, and Ca2+-sensitive chloride currents (ClCa) as potential contributors to tissue-specific differences in NO sensitivity. Finally, Aim 3 seeks to integrate the findings of Aim 1 and 2 and address the roles of the BK channel and cGMP/PKG pathways in regulating function during bladder filling using an ex vivo whole bladder model. Additionally, the role of these pathways in regulating intracavernous pressure and urodynamic properties during bladder filling will be addressed in vivo.The clinical success of the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil (Viagra) and related compounds in treating erectile dysfunction demonstrates a clear role for the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) pathway in regulating corpus cavernosum smooth muscle relaxation and erectile function. Despite the existence of both neuronal and urothelial sources of NO in the urinary bladder, and evidence for the expression of NO-responsive cGMP/PKG signaling pathway components in myocytes, the significance of the cGMP/PKG pathway in bladder physiology remains an unsettled question. The large conductance, calcium activated potassium (BK) channel, which has a central role in relaxing smooth muscle in the lower urinary tract, is a target of the PKG pathway, and represents a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of sildenafil-resistant ED and urinary incontinence."
"9271134","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Researchers from multiple disciplines advocate the importance of understanding the role of early-life factors in outcomes in midlife and old age. Education, early family life, childhood health, personality, and lifestyle have been identified as factors that shape the life course trajectories of individuals and subgroups within populations. The scarcity of longitudinal panels that span childhood, young adulthood, mid-life, and old age is a major research limitation. The 26 years of life history collected by the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY) offers a unique opportunity to examine questions about the influences of early-life factors in members of the Generation X cohort. Since 1987, the LSAY has tracked a national probability sample of 7th and 10th grade students into adulthood. This proposal seeks funding to (1) maintain this panel as they move into early midlife and extend the interview protocol to harmonize with the Health and Retirement Study (HRS); and (2) examine three characteristics that distinguish this cohort from previous cohorts: their education-work trajectories, financial challenges, and exposure to technology.  Recognizing the value of extending the decades of previous work and federal investment, the first objective of this proposal to continue data collection with the Generation X cohort of the LSAY and to extend it into the Longitudinal Study of American Life (LASL) to monitor the transition from young adulthood into mid-life and to set the stage for subsequent tracking into pre-retirement and later life. This work will build conceptual and empirical bridges from the existing LSAY data base of measures of earlier life choices using items from the NIA-supported HRS and it will improve our understanding of the dynamic processes that occur during mid-life.  The second objective of the proposed work is to examine three characteristics that distinguish the Generation X LSAY cohorts from previous cohorts: (1) the impact of education on career choices and on cognitive choices during mid-life and about pre-retirement and retirement decisions, (2) the influence of mid-life financial pressures on Generation X adults associated with financing the college educations of their children and the possible financial needs of aging parents, and (3) the impact of growing up in the Electronic Era on information acquisition and life course decision making in later adulthood."

"9340229","PROJECT SUMMARY Protein interactions are primary determinants of function in living systems. Functional regulation can be achieved through changes in protein interactions resultant from mutations, altered protein abundance levels, posttranslational modifications, conformational changes or altered protein localization. The importance of the protein interaction network for understanding cellular function has long been primary motivation for its mapping. However, the concept of an ?edgotype? has more recently arisen to describe the protein interaction network where nodes are proteins, edges represent interactions and edge-level changes, or edgetic perturbations, define an edgotype resultant from genetic mutations. While genetic mutations are critical for stable phenotype definition, most drugs target proteins and alter one or more of the categories; abundance, modifications, conformation, or localization of target, downstream and off-target proteins. This project will focus efforts to extend the edgotype concept using a general mass spectrometry-based approach to visualize large-scale pharmacological effects on protein structures and interactions in cells to significantly advance cell- based pharmacological studies."
"9346783","Project Summary  Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is an emerging immunotherapy which shows significant promise in treating both leukemia and solid tumors, as well as certain infectious diseases. ACT comprises the isolation and ex vivo expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognizing epitopes of a mutated or aberrantly expressed protein present almost exclusively on the surface of a patient?s tumor cells. To meet the need for personalized enrichment of the most effective CTLs, this Phase II STTR will employ Cell Microsystems? proprietary CellRaft technology to develop a high-throughput, automated platform, the CLEAR AIR? System, to efficiently screen for and isolate highly active, tumor-directed CTLs on a single cell basis. The CellRaft? technology is based on a unique microwell array recently developed by the Allbritton Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Cell Microsystems has an exclusive license to the CellRaft? technology, currently marketing both the consumable CellRaft Arrays as well as microscope accessories enabling imaging, isolation and retrieval of single cells from the array. In Phase I we used the CellRaft technology to assay the cytotoxic activity and kinetics of CTLs. T-cells were pre-treated with peptide epitopes known to be expressed on influenza-infected cells. Epitope-treated and untreated CTL populations were then co-incubated with cells expressing the influenza epitopes and monitored for cytotoxic activity. By performing these assays at the single cell level, a unique population of ?super killers? were identified as those exhibiting cytotoxicity at least 4 standard deviations above mean cytotoxicity levels. These super killers were enriched by approximately 6-fold in epitope treated CTLs compared to untreated CTLs. These data indicate that the CellRaft technology is amenable to performing CTL cytotoxicity assays and retrieval of CTLs for downstream propagation and analysis. In Phase II we will build on these data by: 1) designing and testing a 96-well CellRaft Array containing 96 small arrays within a single consumable to test multiple conditions and immunoreactive epitopes in the cytotoxicity assay; 2) using this new 96-well CellRaft array to assay sequence dependent cytotoxicity of tumor cell-expressed epitopes; 3) enabling rapid imaging and long-term culture on the automated CLEAR AIR? System for longitudinal studies such as these and 4) performing external validation studies at both UNC Chapel Hill and MD Anderson Cancer Center for novel CTL recognition proteins. This workflow will allow analysis of the T-cell receptor without requiring the best killing cells to be propagation-capable, an issue observed in Phase I with the best killing cells. Commercially, we view the CellRaft System, as both a research tool enabling correlation of killing efficiency with the molecular characteristics of the T cell receptor (TCR) and eventually as a clinical tool for identifying efficacious TCR sequences as well as other time course-based phenotypic screens."
"9281682","Project Summary/Abstract for Administrative Core  The Penn Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders (PCMD) at the University of Pennsylvania will enhance the research productivity of, and provide critical services, resources and programs to, established and new investigators who represent our Center membership. Our members have a wide variety of expertise and address multidisciplinary research strategies for musculoskeletal problems. The overall goal of this Center is to promote cooperative interactions among investigators, accelerate and enrich the effectiveness and efficiency of ongoing research, foster new collaborations and new research, and ultimately, translate our research efforts into better and new therapies for musculoskeletal disorders. This will be done through providing critical research infrastructure, state-of-the-art research resources and study design guidance and intellectual expertise to musculoskeletal investigators. Importantly, the Center serves as a local and regional resource to expand the musculoskeletal community and recruit new investigators to the field. We have chosen to continue the theme of ?Musculoskeletal Tissue Injury and Repair? for the Center. This theme is encompassing (as it includes all musculoskeletal tissue types, such as bone, cartilage, disc, ligament, meniscus, muscle, and tendon), focused (as it takes advantage of commonalities in approaches across all tissue types, with particular emphasis on applications using small animal models), and clinically significant (as it fosters development of assays, procedures and new knowledge in pre-clinical animal and human models of translational relevance).  The Specific Aims are to: 1) Coordinate, integrate, communicate, and monitor the Center components and activities, 2) Advise the Center Director regarding the activities of the Center, 3) Administer the Pilot and Feasibility Grant Program and its associated funding and reporting, 4) Implement an Enrichment Program, and 5) Provide a Resource Sharing Plan. It should be noted that Penn's musculoskeletal research community is quite large and therefore, the needs of our investigators vary widely. Many investigators, both junior and senior, are active users of one or more of our supported Resource Cores as described in this proposal. Other investigators are active participants in our enrichment program, others in our Pilot and Feasibility Grant program, while still others simply utilize our group's e-mail and website for information and identifying new collaborations or research partnership opportunities. One of the great strengths of our Center is its inclusive approach with a broad spectrum of activities and interactions, different from some other Centers that may have a more specific focus such as a ?bone? center or a ?muscle? center. Rather, the PCMD is truly a ?musculoskeletal center? and has emerged as the recognized home for musculoskeletal research across the Penn campus. Further, it has transformed into a regional technical and intellectual resource for the broader Philadelphia musculoskeletal research community."
"9479785","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nephronophthisis (NPHP), one of the most frequent genetic causes of chronic renal failure in the first three decades of life, is a group of autosomal recessive diseases characterized by progressive kidney cystic degeneration and fibrosis. Mutations in the gene GLIS2/NPHP7 are the cause of nephronophthisis type 7 both in humans and mice. GLIS2 is a transcription factor with high sequence homology to GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3, the vertebrate orthologs of Drosophila Ci (cubitus interruptus). Like Drosophila Ci, GLI proteins are key molecules in the vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, a pathway highly conserved in the evolution and central in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation and repair during embryonc and postnatal life. We have recently tested and confirmed the hypothesis that Glis2 is a repressor of Hh signaling in the postnatal kidney and demonstrated that malfunctioning of this pathway results in kidney cysts and fibrosis, increased inflammatory infiltration and apoptosis, but the molecular events leading to this kidney phenotype are still unexplained. Preliminary studies performed in my laboratory have unexpectedly revealed that loss of Glis2 results in over expression of Toll like receptor 2 (Tlr2) and other components of the pro-inflammatory TLR/NF-?B pathway in kidney epithelial cells and in the Tlr2-dependent activation of this pathway. We have also found that expression of several miRNAs in kidney epithelial cells is controlled by Glis2, suggesting that microRNAs are effectors of Glis2/Hh signaling in mouse kidneys. We propose to test in vivo the effect of the inhibition of TLR-2/NF-?B signaling on the inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis in Glis2mut/mut mice kidneys by generating Tlr2-/-;Glis2mut/mut and Myd88flox/flox;Glis2mut/mut;KspCre double mutants and establishing Tlr2-/-;Glis2mut/mut bone marrow chimeras. In addition, we propose to systematically identify at genome wide level the canonical and non-canonical Glis2 target genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation-highly parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and high-throughput microRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq). In light of our most recent results, identifying downstream effectors that are deregulated in Glis2 knockout kidneys has gained even more importance, and is likely to produce further insights in the complex regulatory network that is altered in our model of cystic kidney diseases and fibrosis."
"9269074","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) esterifies cholesterol in high density lipoprotein (HDL), which promotes HDL maturation in reverse cholesterol transport, the process by which cholesterol is moved from arterial plaques to the liver. Mutations in LCAT cause two genetic diseases, both of which are characterized by low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown that low HDL-C is associated with high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Consequently, administration of recombinant LCAT and LCAT activating compounds are being investigated as treatments to increase HDL in both CHD and LCAT genetic disease. However, improvement of these therapeutics is limited due to a lack of structural information on LCAT. The objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular basis for LCAT activation and the structural elements required for cholesterol recognition through the use of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy in parallel with functional studies. The first aim will focus on functional characterization of a new crystal form of LCAT wherein a retractable lid that seems to block the active site. Interestingly, the lid interacts with residues on the catalytic core of LCAT known to be important for activation by apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), the major protein component of HDL particles, suggesting that ApoA-I binding may displace the lid to stimulate LCAT activity. In the second aim, I will investigate the molecular basis for LCAT acyl acceptor selectivity and for activation by a small molecule activator through combined crystallographic and biochemical studies. LCAT crystal structures will be determined in complex with acceptor analogs and/or small molecule activators, and residues in the active site that differ between LCAT and a closely related enzyme will be mutated to test whether substrate selectivity can be exchanged. Overall, these studies are expected to pave the way for the design of more potent small molecule activators as well as more catalytically efficient LCAT for use in enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of CHD and/or genetic disease."
"9298687","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncovering the interplay between regulatory regions and gene coding regions is essential for understanding the mechanisms governing gene regulation in health and disease. Chromatin Interaction Analysis Using Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET) offers a new strategy for mapping chromatin interaction networks on a global scale with high resolution and specificity. Data generated from ChIA-PET analysis can be used to map protein-factor binding sites, as well as to construct genome-wide chromatin interactome maps associated with a specific protein factor of interest. The proposed Workshop on Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired End- Tag Sequencing, will train young scientists (graduate students, post-doctoral trainees, new investigators) in the use of ChIA-PET as a tool for asking questions about chromatin interactions, 3D genome organization and genome regulation in human health and disease. Our five-day ChIA-PET workshop provides a balance of didactic and laboratory-based instruction with ample opportunities for interactions among participants and course faculty. Participants will conduct a ChIA-PET experiment from the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) step to high throughput sequencing and through the bioinformatics analysis and data processing phases. In 2014 JAX successfully piloted the ChIA-PET workshop and a registration waitlist demonstrated significant demand for this technical training. The 4D Nucleome project initiated by the NIH Common Fund in 2015 will further increase research activity within this field and will likely generate significant additional interet in ChIA-PET and related technologies. The proposed course will be held annually during the late fall at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine in Farmington, Connecticut. Lectures, discussions, and laboratory work will be held morning, afternoon, and evening for a total of approximately 50 hours of didactic and hands-on training. The Jackson Laboratory is an NCI-designated Basic Research Cancer Center and has a long history of hosting advanced courses and workshops."
"9331350","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) is required for delivering lipid nutrients to vital tissues such as the heart. y Sponsor, Dr. Stephen Young, has focused on basic mechanisms of lipolysis. His group showed that GPIHBP1, a glycoprotein of capillary endothelial cells, is solely responsible for shuttling lipoprotein lipase (LPL) from the interstitial spaces to its site of action along the capillary lumn. They also showed that the LPL-GPIHBP1 complex is crucial for the margination of TRLs along capillaries (so that lipolysis can proceed). These discoveries were important; however, our understanding of lipolysis is far from being complete. For example, no one understands how the fatty acid products of lipolysis move across capillary endothelial cells to myocytes and adipocytes. It is unclear whether the fatty acids diffuse broadly along membrane surfaces; whether they traverse the endothelial cell cytoplasm; or whether they are shuttled across endothelial cells in transcytotic vesicles that contain CD36. Understanding how the products of lipolysis move across capillaries is highly relevant to cardiovascular disease-for several reasons. TRL processing by LPL is regulated by local concentrations of fatty acids, which likely depend on the efficiency of fatty acid transport across endothelial cells. Also, the efficiency of lipolysis regulates plasma triglyceride levels, which are an important factor in determining risk for coronary disease. Dr. Young has focused on mouse models, but examining TRL processing and lipid transport in other vertebrate species (e.g., birds, fish) is important. Other vertebrate species do not express GPIHBP1-the molecule that is so essential for LPL transport and TRL margination in mammals. Our preliminary studies suggest that the LPL in these species may not reach the capillary lumen. Understanding lipolysis and lipid transport in those species could yield insights into accessory mechanisms for lipid transport in mammals. The objective of my postdoctoral research program is to define mechanisms for fatty acid transport across capillaries. Lipid transport across capillaries has remained a black box, in large part because there was no way to visualize this process. Dr. Young's group has overcome that roadblock. They have used NanoSIMS imaging to produce high-resolution images of TRLs as they marginate along capillary endothelial cells. They found rare examples of intact TRLs traversing endothelial cells in vesicles, but the efforts to visualize free fatty acid movement were suboptimal because a large fraction of free fatty acids were lost during the preparation of tissue sections. I have surmounted that technical issue and am now positioned to use NanoSIMS imaging to visualize the movement of lipids across capillary endothelial cells. I will determine whether most fatty acids traverse endothelial cells in the very same vesicles that contain GPIHBP1, LPL, and CD36. Using mouse models, I will define the role of CD36 in capillary lipid transport. Finally, I will define LPL localization and lipid transport mechanisms in lower vertebrate species that do not express GPIHBP1."
"9256798","Project Summary NGLY1 deficiency is a rare, congenital disorder that is caused by mutations in the cytoplasmic peptide:N- glycanase, an enzyme associated with degradation of misfolded proteins. Symptoms of the disease include neuropathy with movement disorder, global developmental delay, liver damage, chronic constipation and the absence of tears. As NGLY1 deficiency has only recently been identified through whole exome sequencing of patients, no targeted therapies are available. Investigations into NGLY1 expression and function throughout the body are therefore imperative for developing better strategies for clinical management of this condition. The central hypothesis of this research proposal is loss of NGLY1 function elicits an ER stress response in the intestine that alters epithelial differentiation while abrogating enteric nervous system function, changes which together result in intestinal dysmotility. We have based this hypothesis on the key clinical features in patients and preliminary studies using human intestinal organoids (HIOs), or ?mini-guts?, generated by differentiation of control (hESC) and patient-derived pluripotent stem cell (iPS) lines. HIOs generated from NGLY1-/- iPSCs, when transplanted into immunocompromised mice, form mature intestinal tissue which undergoes differentiation and morphogenesis to form intestinal villi, but with epithelial secretory cell hyperplasia (Goblet and enteroendocrine cells). Therefore, in Specific Aim 1a I will characterize the phenotype and function of control iPSC-derived HIOs (NGLY1+/+) compared to HIOs generated from iPSC lines established from the fibroblasts of NGLY1 deficient patients (NGLY1-/-) and their parents (NGLY1+/-). Intestinal cell lineages will be quantified through immunostaining and transplanted HIOs expanded ex vivo as human intestinal enteroid (HIE) monolayers to assess intestinal barrier function, secretion and absorption. Specific Aim 1b will complement these studies by quantifying ER stress responses within these HIOs, as NGLY1 associates with the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) machinery. Collectively, we expect to confirm our initial finding of increases in secretory cell populations and identify that secretory cell function may be inefficient due to elevated ER stress and the inhibition of protein translation. As chronic constipation is a debilitating symptom of NGLY1 deficiency but the contribution of NGLY1 to intestinal motility is unknown, in Specific Aim 2 we will incorporate enteric neurons into HIOs, representing each NGLY1 genotype in each compartment (neuronal or epithelial), to assess their function and interaction with the muscle layer. To do this, we will work with collaborators who have demonstrated that a functional enteric neural network develops in xenografted HIOs when they are combined with neural crest progenitors before transplantation (HIOs + ENS). Immunostaining will be used to assess neuronal differentiation with analysis of contractility using isometric force assays in organ chambers. At the completion of these studies we expect to have elucidated how mutations in NGLY1 impact intestinal differentiation and function."
"9310228","PROJECT SUMMARY Cirrhosis-associated death is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) accounts for 48% of these deaths1. Despite its profound health and economic impact, the management of AFLD remains a challenging prospect because: (i) there are no effective diagnostic tools or biomarkers to assess individual susceptibility to AFLD development or progression to more severe clinical conditions, and (ii) no new therapeutic entities have been developed in the past four decades. The long term goal of this research project is to elucidate the redox-associated mechanisms involved in protecting the liver against AFLD and thereby identify potential novel preventive and/or therapeutic targets against this disease. Oxidative stress plays a central role in many pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AFLD. A major factor contributing to the development of oxidative stress is the depletion of glutathione (GSH), the most abundant non-protein thiol in the liver. Our preliminary studies using GCLM knockout (KO) mice demonstrate that ~85% deficiency in hepatic GSH renders mice protected from steatosis induced by chronic ethanol administration. These mice also exhibit: (i) enhanced capacity to metabolize ethanol and acetaldehyde, (ii) persistent oxidative stress and induction of nuclear factor-erythroid 2?related factor 2 (NRF2) target genes, and (iii) importantly, sustained activation of the AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK? pathway and associated changes in lipid metabolizing genes. This research project will utilize the GCLM KO model to expand upon our preliminary studies and investigate our working hypothesis that chronic GSH depletion induces redox activation of the AMPK pathway that serves as the central link triggering protective mechanisms that prevent AFLD. We propose to: elucidate redox-associated mechanism(s) sustaining AMPK activation in KO hepatocytes, identify AMPK catalytic subunit isoform- dependent pathways involved in ethanol-associated metabolic and stress response in KO hepatocytes, and determine the contribution of hepatic versus extrahepatic effects of GSH deficiency in modulating AMPK pathway and the protective phenotype of KO mice. The findings from these studies will provide important mechanistic information regarding key signaling and metabolic pathways involved in protection against alcohol-induced liver damage. It is anticipated that such new knowledge will reveal novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol-induced liver injury, such as AFLD. This K01 Award will allow the applicant to acquire advanced knowledge and research competency in alcohol research through an integration of interdisciplinary resources. The applicant has assembled an advisory committee composed of an outstanding group of mentors and consultants. Dr. Vasilis Vasiliou (primary mentor) is a recognized leader in the field of ethanol metabolism and toxicity. Dr. Wajahat Zafar Mehal (co-mentor) is a renowned hepatologist and liver immunologist who has extensive expertise in alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Dr. Michael Harris Nathanson (co- mentor) is the Director of the Yale Liver Center and is among the world leaders in studying signaling pathways in liver disease. The program will enlist the expertise of Dr. Hongyu Zhao (consultant), who is among the world leaders in the application of statistical methods in molecular biology. Each member of the advisory committee has a formidable record of training academically successful independent scientists and they will mentor the applicant's career and academic development as well as the implementation of proposed experiments."
"9302707","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow-induced K secretion (FIKS) in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) is mediated by large conductance, Ca2+/stretch-activated BK channels, comprised of pore-forming ? subunits (BK?)) and accessory ? subunits. The channel is detected in distinct cellular compartments in unique cell types in the CCD. BK channels are localized to cilia in Na absorbing principal cells (PCs), and we hypothesize that these channels in PC cilia facilitate localized membrane hyperpolarization, mechanoinduced Ca2+ entry through Ca2+-selective channels, and subsequent autocrine/paracrine signaling cascades that modulate transport processes. In contrast, BK channels are localized at the apical membrane of acid-base transporting intercalated cells (ICs), and we hypothesize that these channels in ICs mediate FIKS. These hypotheses will be tested by selectively inactivating Kcnma1, the gene encoding BK?, in PCs or ICs. We will determine whether mice lacking BK?, in ICs exhibit reduced FIKS, and whether mice lacking BK?, in PCs exhibit blunted flow-induced Ca2+ signaling, as well as reduced secretion of autocrine/paracrine signaling factors in response to an increase tubular flow. BK?, expression in ICs is enhanced in response to an increase in dietary K. Recent studies have shown that specific WNK kinases regulate BK?, expression in heterologous expression systems (WNK1 increases and WNK4 inhibits). We anticipate that studies proposed in this application will confirm our preliminary observation that increases in dietary K selectively enhance WNK1 expression in ICs, yet reduce WNK4 expression in both ICs and PCs. We also expect to show that mice with conditional deletion of Wnk1 in ICs exhibit blunted IC BK?, expression and FIKS when fed a high K diet. We anticipate that the proposed studies will uncover mechanisms involved in the development/maintenance of disorders of urinary K excretion and identify potential targets for novel therapies to treat K imbalances."

"9504769","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nuclear RNAs play key roles in the regulation of transcription, splicing, and RNA modifications; processes that have widespread impacts on cellular function. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) modulate RNA function by altering the composition, stability, or protein association of target RNAs. Although cell-specific nuclear RNA regulation has been observed, the underlying mechanisms and functional consequences have remained unclear. The goal of this research is to determine how two male germ cell-specific RBPs (ADAD1 and ADAD2) regulate nuclear RNA biogenesis and the functional impact this regulation has on spermatogenesis. This research builds upon studies supported by my NIH postdoctoral fellowship. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA- seq) analysis of a male infertile mutant Adad1 model demonstrated substantial changes in the expression of a class of nuclear RNAs (small nucleolar RNA - snoRNAs) in spite of virtually no changes in gene expression or isoform abundance. snoRNAs guide nucleotide modification in other RNAs, particularly ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Improper rRNA modification leads to ribosome malfunction and abnormal translation, a process that is tightly controlled in the male germ cell. This, combined with ADAD1 nuclear localization, suggests that ADAD1 plays a critical role in snoRNA biogenesis or regulation, as may its closely-related homologue ADAD2. The proposed research will occur in two phases, a mentored (I) and an independent phase (II) and will test the hypothesis that ADADs impact translation by regulating the biogenesis of snoRNAs in male germ cells. To address the hypothesis, this research will: 1) establish the impact of Adad1 mutation on rRNA modification and translation (phase I); 2) demonstrate whether ADAD1 and 2 associate with snoRNAs or snoRNA-regulating proteins (phase II); and 3) determine the impact of Adad1 or 2 ablation on snoRNA abundance and germ cell development (phase I) using a combination of biochemical analysis, RNA-seq, and novel genetic models. Ultimately, this work will define the connection between ADADs, snoRNAs and germ cell translation thus informing on the mechanisms by which nuclear RNAs affect male fertility."
"9286727","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cochlear implant (CI) users who are 65 years or older typically show poorer speech perception performance than younger adult CI users, especially in competing background noise. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Whereas declined cognitive function has been proposed as the major factor, deteriorations in the auditory system have also been suggested to be the primary reason. As a result, there is no robust indicator for optimizing programming settings or habilitation strategies for older implanted patients. This study is designed to better understand underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of speech perception deficits in older CI users. Older listeners are known to have temporal processing deficits, and temporal cues are particularly important for discriminating speech in CI users. Therefore, the proposed study will focus on comparing peripheral and central auditory neural encoding of, and perceptual sensitivity to, temporal envelope cues between younger and older adult CI users. Aim 1 will assess group differences in temporal responsiveness of the auditory nerve in younger (< 60 years) and older (between 65 and 85 years) adult CI users. The group comparison will be done for three temporal properties of the auditory nerve: peri-stimulus neural adaptation, adaptation recovery and the accuracy of amplitude modulation encoding. Aim 2 will assess group differences in neural representation at the auditory cortex (i.e. cortical encoding) of, and perceptual sensitivity to, temporal gaps and voice onset time, as well as their association with speech perception in younger and older adult CI users. Aim 3 will evaluate contributions of differences in AN temporal responsiveness and cortical encoding of temporal gaps and amplitude modulation to variations in perceptual envelope sensitivity in individual adult CI users. For experiments in Aims 2 and 3, psychophysical procedures and electrophysiological measures of peripherally and centrally generated evoked potentials will be combined and applied in concert in the same CI users. In addition, cognitive functions will be evaluated and used as one of the predictors for behavioral results. Results of this study have substantial significance from both a basic science and a clinical management point of view. For example, these results will provide information about the contributions of peripheral vs central auditory functions, as well as auditory vs cognitive factors to perceptual sensitivity to temporal gaps and amplitude modulations, which is crucial for understanding underlying mechanisms of these auditory processes. These results will also provide information about whether the accuracy of neural encoding and processing of electrical hearing declines in older CI users, as well as at which level of the auditory system this decline, if any, exists. This information could potentially lead to developing objective tools for early identification of older CI patients who may need additional rehabilitation strategies. Given the importance of temporal processing for speech perception and the rapidly increasing number of older CI patients, experiments proposed in this application are of high scientific and translational significance."
"9372674","ABSTRACT Obesity is prevalent public health problem that contributes to a rising global burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Obesity and DM are fundamentally disorders of energy balance. Energy balance is sensed and controlled by mitochondria. Therefore, a clear understanding of mitochondrial bioenergetics in obesity may lead to new approaches to treat obesity-related health problems. Moreover, individuals with primary (genetic) mitochondrial disease develop many of the same comorbidities as those with diet-induced obesity. The shared metabolic bases for these common endocrine disturbances may represent opportunities for rational therapies. The central hypothesis of the present proposal is that abnormalities in two related mitochondrial processes, creatine metabolism and glucose utilization, contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in both primary mitochondrial disease and obesity. In both conditions, some individuals who develop insulin resistance eventually progress to DM. To test this hypothesis, we propose to perform specialized metabolomic testing on human blood samples banked in the course of Dr. McCormack's K23 mentored patient-oriented research career development award. The parent K23 project cohort includes adults ages 18 ? 65 with primary (genetic, n=15) and secondary (obesity, n=15) forms of impairment in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity, as well as normal-weight controls (n=15). The main outcome measures in the K23 project include: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to quantitate in vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity and creatine (Cr) metabolism and a stable isotope tracer- enhanced oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT*) to evaluate insulin sensitivity. For the R03, we propose 2 Aims: (1): identify a blood-based ?metabolomic signature? that is associated with altered skeletal muscle free creatine (2): to measure flux through intermediary metabolic pathways that reflect mitochondrial glucose utilization. We will test both of these measurements for their association with insulin sensitivity. In Aim 1, we focus on creatine because together with ATP derived from glucose, creatine forms phosphocreatine, an important energy reserve. We will use both targeted and untargeted metabolomics strategies to identify metabolites associated with muscle creatine as assessed by MRI. A candidate biomarker of muscle creatine will facilitate a future trial of creatine therapy. In Aim 2, we focus on mitochondrial glucose utilization because this process provides an important ?sink? for ingested glucose. We will leverage the [1-13C] oral glucose tracer used in the OGTT* to measure flux via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) relative to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Results from this Aim will inform a future mechanistic investigation of a strategy to increase mitochondrial glucose utilization by boosting levels of a key metabolic co-factor. In summary, this R03 proposal will leverage specimens generated from the applicant's K23 parent protocol. Results will be used to support targeted clinical trials to reverse metabolic defects in individuals at risk for DM."
"9283639","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a competitive renewal of 5T32 MH18951-23, a postdoctoral clinical research clinical and translational research training program in child mental health. Support is requested annually for 2 post- residency child psychiatrists, 4 post-doctoral child psychologists or other doctorally-prepared professionals, and four medical students for summer research electives. The postdoctoral training program, 2-3 years in duration, aims to develop scientists who can formulate original and significant research on the pathogenesis, course, treatment and prevention, and dissemination of effective treatments for child mental disorders. A multi- disciplinary faculty group with a long and successful history of research and research training provides mentorship to trainees. Most importantly, the T32 program pairs the trainee with an academically successful mentor and co-mentor committed to research training. The mentors and trainee develop a career development plan with targeted goals for acquisition of skills, presentations, publications, gathering pilot daa, and preparation of proposals for external funding, usually a career award; this plan is reviewed every 6 months with the mentors, trainee, Program Director and selected Training Faculty in order to ensure forward progress. An individually tailored course of didactic study will be developed for each trainee to insure the acquisition of core knowledge in research design, statistics, and content areas relevant to research. Trainees also participate in ongoing seminars on Research Survival Skills, dealing with formulation of scientific questions, grant writing, and project management, as well required didactic and interactive training on the responsible conduct of research.

Since 2003, 44% of the students who have graduated entered psychiatry, and 57% published at least one peer-reviewed paper."
"9391198","Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett)."
"9283617","?    DESCRIPTION: This application is for a 5-year renewal of the T32 Training Program in the Development of Psychopathology: From Brain and Behavior to Intervention. Mental and substance abuse disorders are more likely to arise early in life...[and] are, in fact, the predominant noncommunicable disorders of young people (Insel, 2014; p. 1727). Therefore, early identification of risk processes and early intervention are crucial. As the field has been shifting from a behavioral to a neurodevelopmental focus, this training program also has been evolving to reflect important advances in human brain development. The major thrust of this interdisciplinary program is to produce scientists who will (1) contribute to the state of knowledge about neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of psychopathology, and (2) translate findings from basic research to the development of empirically-based interventions for the prevention and amelioration of psychopathology and for the promotion of mental health. The training program provides individual mentoring in multidisciplinary science complemented by didactic activities. A personalized training plan is developed for each fellow and re-evaluated each semester. In the last five years, we have explicitly shifted our focus to increasing training on multidisciplinary research on neurobiological, psychophysiological, genetic, and psychosocial mechanisms underlying psychiatric illness. Since the last renewal in 2010, three of the 11 (27%) predoctoral trainees and two of the five postdocs (40%) have come from neuroscience programs. In the last decade, over 75% of our 24 pre- and 12 post-doctoral trainees have continued to contribute to the field through scholarly research and teaching. A quarter of trainees represent diverse ethnic minority groups and 67% have been female. Four predocs continue in training on this T32; 3 other former predoc trainees are working on their dissertations; 3 are doing their required clinical internship. All 14 remaining former predoc trainees have completed their PhDs; 6 are researchers in faculty positions in academic psychology departments; 2 are postdoctoral fellows; 4 do a combination of clinical service, consulting, teaching, and supervision, and 2 are doing clinical work. Of the 12 postdoctoral fellows, 3 continue in training; 7 of the 9 former postdocs are still actively involved in research and teaching. Other important indicators of the training program's success are trainees' publication records [predocs: 141 papers, mean=5.9; median=5; postdocs: 157 papers, mean=13.08; median =13] and their acquisition of research funding from individual career development awards (F30, F31, K01, K99), R-type grants (e.g., R34, R21, R00), and foundations (e.g., Brain Behavior Research Fund). This renewal application proposes to again support 4 predoctoral trainees and 3 postdoctoral fellows annually. Our primary goals for the next five years are to continue to develop research scientists who can discover and translate basic knowledge from clinical neuroscience into interventions for reducing psychopathology. We will especially focus on the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), grant writing, and professional development."

"9393773","PROJECT SUMMARY Dopamine (DA) plays key roles in the central nervous system by regulating a variety of physiological states, including cognition, motivation, and attention. While DA dysfunction is known to be involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders, its role in the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as well as comorbidities associated with ASD (e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) are largely unknown. The DA transporter (DAT) is a key constituent of DA signaling in the CNS and the principal regulator of DA homeostasis, mediating the active re-uptake of DA from the synapse following its release upon action potential depolarization. The research proposed focuses on understanding how rare variants (RVs) in the human DAT (hDAT) gene (SLC6A3) identified in several ASD subjects cause aberrant hDAT function and disrupted DA- associated behaviors. Importantly, this work will determine how RVs in hDAT support DA dysfunction, a complication associated with ASD. Our laboratory recently defined the first ASD identified de novo mutation in hDAT. This mutation located in the seventh transmembrane domain, a region critical to DA uptake and efflux, dramatically alters hDAT function both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, this de novo DAT mutation alters DA neurotransmission and DA-associated behaviors as observed in Drosophila melanogaster. The work presented in this proposal aims to create a novel set of discoveries exploiting the structural, functional and behavioral findings from the analysis of new hDAT variants identified in multiple individuals with ASD. We will (S.A. #1) engineer the hDAT ASD variants to determine their putative structural and functional deficits in heterologous expression systems. We will generate transgenic Drosophila lines expressing hDAT wildtype or hDAT variants specifically in DAergic neurons to determine the functional impairments of these hDAT variants in whole, intact Drosophila brains. We will use (S.A. #2) these transgenic Drosophila lines to evaluate the behavioral significance of hDAT dysfunction supported by these hDAT variants."
"9327057","Abstract - The overall goal of the proposed project is to implement and evaluate a co-management model of care for persons with sickle cell disease in central North Carolina. Many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receive care primarily from specialty physicians and emergency departments (EDs), thus resulting in a lack of primary care, a high number of ED visits and hospitalizations, and ultimately poor health outcomes. Prior to model implementation, a comprehensive assessment of barriers to evidence based care will be conducted with all key stakeholders. We will enroll patients from Community Care North Carolina (CCNC, NC?s solution to managed care for Medicaid patients), and Duke University Sickle Cell program to: 1) increase co-management between sickle cell specialists and primary care providers (PCP?s); 2) increase the use of hydroxyurea (HU); 3) identify and link patients not receiving primary or SCD specialty care to care; and 4) shift healthcare use from EDs and hospitalizations to primary and specialty co-management. We will also partner with several EDs. All patients will be assigned a SCD nurse case manager (low level intervention). Patients, PCP?s and ED providers will be encouraged to contact and collaborate with the nurse case manager. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive monthly patient/peer coaching sessions for 12 months (high level intervention). Patients will consent to participate in the consortium registry and clinical trial. To facilitate HU therapy and best practice, as well as willingness to care for SCD patients, PCP?s and ED providers will receive education and decision aids (paper and web-based apps) adapted from the NHLBI recommendations. Project aims are to: 1. Identify patient, provider, healthcare organization, and community barriers to SCD co-management  (primary and specialty care); HU prescription and adherence; accessing care; and reduction in ED use and  hospital admissions. We will use these findings to modify the trial (Aim 2b). 2. Enroll 300 patients, including patients not connected to a SCD center, into the consortium SCD registry and  pragmatic clinical trial.  a. Collect clinical data (HU prescriptions and adherence), health services utilization (number of ED  visits, hospital admissions, and re-hospitalizations) for the length of the project. Collect patient  reported outcomes for 12 months (pain interference, physical function (adult)/mobility (adolescents),  fatigue and sleep (adults only). All data will be entered in the registry.  b. Compare the effect of low and high level patient focused interventions on pain interference (primary  study outcome). Secondary outcomes include clinical (HU prescription and adherence), health  services utilization (number of ED visits hospital admissions, and re-hospitalizations), and patient  reported measures for physical function (adult)/mobility (adolescents), fatigue and sleep (adults  only) over 12 months."
"9415297","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A better understanding of the bi-directional interaction between mutated tumor cells and inflammatory leukocytes during cancer initiation and neoplastic progression is required for the design of more effective therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.  We have generated an inducible genetic model of ovarian carcinoma that leads to terminal metastatic disease complete penetrance and recapitulates the inflammatory microenvironment of human tumors.  Tumors are initiated by a combination of mutational events mediated by Cre recombinase in previously healthy mice in a C57BL6 background.  Our new tumor model progresses through a phase of dynamic equilibrium that keeps tumor expansion in check for the first 3 weeks, followed by a phase of exponential growth from ~day 35 to ~day 60 (evasion phase).  We will use this new inducible system to define the origin and nature of primordial ovarian cancer lesions and the cross-talk between mutated tumor cells and inflammatory leukocytes during ovarian cancer initiation and malignant progression.  Our central hypothesis is that ovarian cancer initiation arises from differentiated epithelial cells from the ovarian surface that upregulate beta-defensins to recruit CCR6+CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs).  Early recruited DCs in turn produce IL-6 that drives irreversible dedifferentiation and subsequent oncogenic transformation, and also CCL3 that eventually induces the exponential accumulation of more inflammatory DCs.  In Specific Aim 1, we will elucidate the debated nature of the cells that initiate epithelial ovarian cancer, as well as their anatomic location.  In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the differential mechanisms driving the recruitment of myeloid leukocytes from the very beginning of tumorigenesis to the exponential tumor growth phase at late stages.  In Specific Aim 3, we will establish how myeloid leukocytes initially recruited by mutated epithelial cells to primordial tumor lesions impact oncogenic transformation and irreversible malignant progression.  Our work will exert a profound effect in the field by defining the existence of true cancer stem cells in ovarian cancer, and how inflammatory leukocytes promote irreversible oncogenic transformation in primordial tumor lesions and irreversible malignant progression, which may be applicable to other lethal epithelial tumors."
"9320002","Summary The hair follicle (HF) is an excellent model system to study the molecular cross-talk between stem/progenitor cells with their niche microenvironment. During early hair morphogenesis, hair follicle-specified epithelial cells in hair placodes receive directive niche signals from specialized cells in dermal condensates (DC) that are the precursors of the mature HF mesenchyme, the dermal papilla (DP) and the dermal sheath (DS). After embryonic hair follicle formation, cells in the DP continue to send signals to rapidly proliferating transit amplifying cells during hair growth, and are critical for activating stem cells to initiate hair follicle regeneration during the hair cycle. The role of DS is much less clear, but recently DS has been implicated as a source of new DP over a lifespan by contributing cells to the DP compartment. Despite these insights, several fundamental questions remain to be answered: (1) What is the lineage and functional relationship between DS and DP? (2) What are essential functions of the DS for hair follicle growth? (3) What are the molecular mechanisms that govern DS identity and function? The goal of this work is to answer these fundamental questions by employing our recently established genetic tools to specifically label and target the mature DS and its embryonic precursors. We have previously established the methods to lineage-trace the DS and its precursors, purify for the first time DS cells separately from DP, define a DS-specific gene signature, test the requirement of DS for hair follicle growth, and target the DS for gene ablation, thereby altogether opening up the opportunity to study the core biological DS functions.  This proposal aims to define the cellular dynamics and molecular mechanisms of the formation of the DS and its functions as a niche component. I will determine the clonal and proliferative dynamics with pulse- chase label retention experiments and lineage tracing of single-cell labeled DCs using established genetic targeting tools with reporter mice. I will also use an inducible labeling system to determine the proliferative dynamics of niche cells during follicle formation and growth. Additionally, I will selectively ablate the DS in hair follicles to determine their role in follicle growth and maintenance using genetic targeting tools and the inducible diphtheria toxin cytotoxic ablation system. Further, I will define the gene expression signature of the DS through systems-level analysis of our lab?s recently generated RNA-sequencing data from in vivo isolated cells. Finally, I will further investigate the role of the DS in the HF by gene ablation of the recently identified sheath transcription factor, Satb2, using genetic targeting tools and a conditional knock-out mouse line of Satb2. The strengths of this proposal lies in its innovation of using novel mouse tools to target mesenchymal niche cells within the hair follicle, and its potential to generate translatable findings for the development of future clinical applications."
"9341541","Abstract The Specific Aim of this Phase I STTR proposal is to test the feasibility of treating non-alcohol steatohepatitis (NASH) by increasing mitochondrial metabolism, which is the main pathway for lipid catabolism in the liver. NASH is a stage of non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that has progressed to a pathological state. NASH can lead to cirrhosis, leading to liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is especially common in those with other metabolic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, and/or hyperlipidemia, but also affects the healthy population. About 30% of the population in US has NAFLD, with 5 million instances of NASH diagnosed each year in the US with advanced fibrosis and about 1.8 million individuals progressed to cirrhosis. The primary treatment for NASH is lifestyle change. However, few patients remain adherent for extended periods of time. No drugs have been approved by the FDA for treating NASH. To address this need, we are developing an siRNA-based drug to treat NASH by increasing liver metabolism. Fatty acids are transported to the liver where they are metabolized through beta-oxidation coupled to the electron transport chain (ETC) in the mitochondria. Increased mitochondrial respiratory activity in the liver could therefore speed up the degradation of fatty acids and prevent their accumulation in the liver. A key regulator of the ECT is the MCJ protein (MCJ/DnaJC15 or Methylation-Controlled J protein). MCJ is a mitochondrial protein that reduces respiration dependent ATP levels. We have demonstrated that removal of MCJ activity is safe and results in increased mitochondrial metabolism/ATP production. We have developed an siRNA formulation (siMCJ) that effectively removes mouse MCJ in the liver. Using this formulation, we have shown in two mouse models that we can reverse or prevent NASH pathologies. siRNA has been validated as a drug for number of diseases, including liver diseases, with over 30 clinical trials having been run, thus validating the use of this therapeutic approach. While our preliminary data are compelling thus far, the studies were carried out at only one dose of siRNA and against the mouse MCJ protein. Thus, to show feasibility of our approach, prior to carrying out IND enabling studies, we must carry out a more robust feasibility study that includes demonstration of safety, a dose/effect relationship, and efficacy of human siMCJ. To this end, we will carry out the following Tasks: Task 1: Evaluate efficacy and toxicity of mouse siMCJ in vivo using mouse models Task 2: Evaluate efficacy human siMCJ in vivo using humanized-liver mouse model (KMT-Mice) Test of Feasibility: We must observe findings in Task 1 that are similar to those in the preliminary study section and we must observe a dose/effect curve that can be fit to a standard Hill type or log/logit analysis and that covers the EC50 point of the curve. We must observe a TI (therapeutic index) of at least 3 (maximally effective dose/MTD). This TI would indicate a very safe dosing window, since we use a maximally effective dose as the numerator. Findings in Task 2 must also be similar to the findings in the preliminary study section."

Finally, the PSOM promote an academic environment in which basic and clinical research are encouraged and viewed as attractive career paths for physicians."
"9395131","Project Summary Corticospinal tract (CST) is an important supraspinal descending motor system that controls voluntary movement in humans. Good progress has been made in recent years to elicit CST axonal regeneration and re-connectivity after spinal cord injury (SCI). For example, conditional deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) or pharmacological suppression of PTEN that boosts neuronal intrinsic ability to grow enhances CST sprouting and regeneration after SCI. Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) or neural progenitor cells (NPCs) as a permissive extrinsic environment supports extensive CST regeneration into SCI/transplant site. These exciting results provide an unprecedented opportunity that is the subject of this grant: combine NSC grafts with pharmacological suppression of PTEN to generate the most extensive CST regeneration described to date. In a logical extension of this work related to the VA's rehabilitation mission, we will combine rehabilitation training, hypothesizing that this will re-shape and strengthen connectivity of regenerating CST axons to further enhance functional recovery. There are 3 Aims in the proposed studies. The specific Aim 1 is to determine whether combined NPC grafts and pharmacological PTEN suppression promote CST regeneration and skilled forelimb functional recovery. The specific Aim 2 is to determine whether combined NPC transplants and skilled forelimb reach rehabilitation training enhance CST regeneration and forelimb functional recovery. Last, the specific Aim 3 is to determine whether combined NPC transplants, pharmacological PTEN suppression, and skilled forelimb reach rehabilitation training optimize CST regeneration and forelimb functional recovery. All these Aims are based on previous reports and supported by our preliminary feasibility data. Findings of this work will substantially extend our knowledge of NPC/NSC treatments for SCI, in a systematic set of experiments designed to be translationally relevant and specifically focused on interventions for Veterans."

"9211173","Project Summary/Abstract Viruses can establish persistent infections by escaping or suppressing the host immune system. The clone 13 strain (Cl 13) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a profound immune suppression and persists in the mouse, its natural host. The immunosuppression caused by LCMV Cl 13 infection is principally due to the impairment of anti-viral T cell responses, which is also observed during chronic viral infections in humans. Therefore, LCMV infection of mice is a valuable animal model for studying the interplay between the virus and the host immune system. Sphingosine kinase (SK) 2 mediates the generation of sphingosine 1- phosphate from sphingosine and regulates multiple cellular conditions including host immunity. However, the role of SK2 in host immune responses to virus infection has not been explored. Preliminary data demonstrate that SK2 deficiency results in heightened T cell responses to LCMV Cl 13 infection, leading to lethal immunopathology. The data also indicate that LCMV Cl 13 increases the expression and activation of SK2 in CD4 T cells, which inhibits the expansion of virus-specific T cells. Therefore, in this proposal, the role of SK2 in the suppression of virus-specific, functional T cell responses will be determined during persistent LCMV infection. The intrinsic function of SK2 in virus-specific CD4 T cells will be investigated by using LCMV-specific TCR transgenic T cells. Also, the molecular mechanisms by which SK2 causes CD4 T cell suppression upon infection will be studied. Additionally, we will investigate if T cell-extrinsic functions of SK2 in non-hematopoietic cells and programming of innate cytokine profiles affect virus-induced T cell suppression. Collectively, this research is expected to produce new information about the SK2-mediated T cell suppressive pathway upon viral infection. The proposed project could act as foundation to develop immune therapeutics for the treatment of chronic viral infections."
"9307573","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surveillance and monitoring of risk behavior and disease is a top priority of many health-related agencies and organizations, including the UN AIDS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local public health and epidemiology departments. Identification and localization of changes in risk behaviors and disease can dramatically improve public health outcomes and reduce health-related costs, by providing data on where interventions are needed and how to direct public health efforts. For example, HIV researchers, public health departments, and government organizations, have attempted to identify and monitor HIV risk behavior (e.g., sexual intercourse and illicit drug use) and HIV outbreaks to improve prevention and treatment efforts and curb a growing HIV epidemic. Social media use has been rapidly increasing, and data from these technologies might be leveraged for identification of HIV risk behaviors, such as sexual- and drug-related risk behaviors. Although researchers have developed methods of using social media to monitor HIV and public health behaviors and outcomes, these methods require extensive manual time, technical expertise, and multiple software platforms to process these big data. Advances in technology, including technology infrastructure, data mining, and machine learning approaches, can be leveraged to provide tools that can be used to create a single automated platform for extracting free-text social media conversations, labeling these conversations to identify health risk-related behaviors, and using these labels to monitor disease outbreaks. We propose to create a single automated platform that collects social media (Twitter) data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV risk behaviors; and provides an output that is acceptable for HIV researchers, public health workers, and policymakers to monitor HIV risk behaviors and outcomes. The tools developed from this application will be open source, tailored for use for epidemiologists and public health departments, and will be available for integration with other software tools to improve the effectiveness of public health monitoring systems."
"9310074","ABSTRACT?Clinical Project  Preeclampsia (PE) affects 3% to 8% of pregnant women and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. With no effective therapy for PE, the only approach to prevent maternal morbidity is delivery. Due to the similarities between PE and cardiovascular disease, we and others have demonstrated the ability of pravastatin (PRA) to reverse several pathophysiologic pathways and phenotypic features of PE. The labeling of PRA as category X is predominantly due to the absence of an indication for its use in pregnancy, as data from experimental animal models and cohorts of pregnant women exposed to PRA early in pregnancy did not support the teratogenicity claims of a category X medication. Recently, as a site in the NICHD-OPRU network and after obtaining an IND from the FDA, we completed a pilot, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of pregnant women at high risk of PE, randomized to 10 mg PRA or placebo. The study revealed favorable maternal-fetal safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of PRA in this population. The completed pilot trial utilized the lowest dose of PRA (10 mg) allowed in the IND, and our proposed investigation in this application will evaluate PRA at a higher dose (20 mg) already approved by the FDA IND.  Our hypothesis is that pravastatin, when given to pregnant women at high risk of PE, exhibits favorable maternal-fetal safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), and PK Profiles. We are proposing a double-blind, placebo- controlled RCT of 100?120 pregnant women at high risk for PE to investigate the following specific aims: (1) determine the maternal-fetal safety profile of PRA during pregnancy, (2) determine whether early prophylactic treatment with PRA in high-risk women reverses the angiogenic imbalance associated with PE, (3) determine the PK of PRA and the formation of its metabolites during pregnancy (compared to the postpartum period), and (4) determine the effects of SNPs in genes encoding uptake and efflux transporters and sulfotransferase enzymes on maternal exposure to PRA.  The data obtained on safety, PK parameters, and PD will be compared between the different doses to determine which dose results in the most significant PD effect and the most favorable safety profile. This determination will provide the framework required for the implementation of a larger clinical trial to determine PRA?s ability to prevent PE."
"9321079","PROJECT SUMMARY  In this study we seek to understand how genetic and environmental factors jointly influence both the risk of developing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and the outcome of treatment interventions. OCD and related disorders are of major public health importance owing to their profound personal and societal costs. Little is known for certain about their etiology, and treatment, detection and prevention strategies are not optimal or directed by knowledge of pathophysiology. In other psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism), genomics has begun to deliver fundamental knowledge about genetic architecture, identify specific loci for biological follow-up and localize pathways altered in disease. We intend to realize these same advances for OCD by markedly increasing the worldwide sample size for genomic analysis, in a first step toward elucidating the fundamental biology of this condition.  Three overlapping areas will be investigated in this project. First, we will collect the world's largest richly phenotyped sample of OCD cases (N = 10,000). To do this in an efficient and cost-effective manner, we will take advantage of an ongoing nationwide OCD treatment study in Norway and a network of active OCD clinics in Sweden. The phenotypes will include a detailed clinical characterization (e.g., comorbidities, symptom dimensions, treatment response) and links to the Swedish and Norwegian registers, facilitating gene by environment interaction studies. Second, we will genotype all 10,000 samples on the PsychChip GWAS array (genotypes for >30,000 matched controls are already available). This will allow us to discover genomic loci harboring common and rare variation associated with OCD. We will also incorporate a novel comparative genomic approach to interpret these genomic data, capitalizing on an animal model with high face and construct validity: canine compulsive disorder. Third, we will calculate individual risk profile scores (GRS) as a measure of genetic liability to OCD and test for interactions between genetic liability and a range of clinical (e.g., response to treatment), epidemiological (e.g., paternal age, obstetric complications, early life adversity, socioeconomic status) and genetic epidemiological (e.g., family history) variables from the Swedish and Norwegian registers. We expect this study to improve our understanding of the causal mechanisms implicated in OCD, with a view towards improving clinical outcomes and reducing chronicity and societal costs."
"9317292","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite hundreds of linkage and association studies, including eight recent case-control genome-wide association studies (GWAS), there has been limited progress in identifying specific genes associated with depression. Epidemiological evidence indicates that life stress is a key factor in the etiology of depression. Indeed, there is growing recognition that accounting for stress facilitates the identification of genes important in the development of depression. Because of methodological limitations however, gene x stress studies have been limited from utilizing the broad-scale genomic approaches that have been successful in identifying genes in other complex disorders. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the pathophysiological architecture underlying depression to facilitate the development of improved treatments. Our objective in this application is to identify genetic variants associated with the development of depression under stress by utilizing medical internship as a model. The power and effectiveness of traditional gene x stress interaction studies have been compromised by the following study design limitations: 1) substantial variation in the type and intensity of stress between subjects 2) retrospective design and 3) loss of power due to tests of statistical interaction. Designing methods to overcome these limitations has been difficult because the onset of chronic stress is difficult to predict beforehand and the type of stress encountered by individuals varies greatly. Medical internship, the first year of professional physician training, presents a unique situation in which we can prospectively predict the onset of a uniform, chronic stressor and a dramatic increase in depressive symptoms. We hypothesize that both common and rare SNPs from across the genome will interact with internship stress to impact depressive symptom phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) identify longitudinal patterns of depressive symptoms under internship stress and factors associated with the depressive symptom patterns, 2) identify common and rare, functional genetic variants associated with depressive symptoms and depressive symptom trajectories during internship stress using cutting edge GWAS and Exome chip analysis and 3) assess whether significant associations with depressive symptoms in the intern sample replicate in other depression samples. Our approach is innovative because it takes advantage of a naturally occurring stress to overcome limitations of existing studies and allows us to perform a broad-scale, longitudinal cohort gene x stress study. This project is significant because it has the potential to identify key genetic factors involved in depression under stress, an advance that holds promises in predicting treatment response and identifying novel targets for antidepressant development."
"9257203","?     DESCRIPTION:     Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects an estimated 12 -15 million adults in the US and an estimated 20% of older Veterans. Those with PAD ambulate with slow gait and experience decreased leg strength, dysmobility, reduced quality of life, serious morbidity and often premature death. It is estimated that over 60% of individuals with PAD are overweight or obese. While PAD itself worsens mobility, obesity adds a further functional burden to older adults with PAD. Individuals diagnosed with PAD, who are also obese typically claudicate 40% more quickly than non-obese individuals and take 20% longer to recover after claudication. Studies of older obese adults without PAD have demonstrated that the combination of exercise and weight loss is more effective at improving physical function, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors than exercise alone. While these findings likely translate to older adults with PAD, this hypothesis has yet to be tested. This CDA-2 is designed to determine whether weight loss and exercise (WL+EX) versus exercise ( EX ) alone will 1) improve mobility function to a greater extent than exercise alone and 2) determine the mechanisms underlying changes in mobility function by measuring muscle microvascular perfusion, systemic and muscle inflammation, cardiometabolic risk, and muscle composition. We hypothesize that a combined intervention of weight loss and exercise (aerobic and resistive) will result in greater improvements in mobility function through improved muscle perfusion, reduced inflammation and reduced muscle fat infiltration than exercise alone in obese Veterans with PAD. The goals of this 5 year CDA-2 are for me to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the functional and underlying metabolic effects of 6 months of weight loss and exercise (WL+EX) versus exercise training alone (EX) in obese Veterans with Fontaine Stage II PAD to learn skills in the assessment of muscle perfusion, inflammation and lipid infiltration. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To compare the effects of WL+EX vs EX on mobility function in Veterans with PAD. Aim 2: To compare the effects of WL+EX vs EX on the mechanisms underlying changes in mobility function measured as muscle perfusion, inflammation and lipid infiltration. We will study 76 older (60+ years) obese Veterans with PAD. Prior to baseline testing all participants will be weight stabilized. After weight stabilization baseline testing followed by randomization will occur. Participants will undergo mobility testing (gait speed, modified physical performance test, and six minute walk distance), walking impairment questionnaires, lower extremity muscle strength testing (1RM for major lower extremity muscle groups),and measures of body composition (DXA and CT scan) and muscle perfusion (contrast enhanced ultrasonography). Muscle biopsies and blood draws will determine inflammatory levels (IL- 6 and TNF-?). All participants will participate in a gradul and progressive walking and strength training program 3x/week in our clinic and a home walking 2x/week for 6 months. Individuals randomized to the weight loss group will also attend weekly classes where they will receive instructions on how to implement a 250-350 kcal diet reduction per day. Post-testing will be done 24 hours after the last bout of exercise. We anticipate this proposal will show the importance of the addition of a weight loss program to exercise programs to improve the health and reduce disability in obese Veterans with PAD. The skills gained in this CDA-2 will greatly enhance my development into an independent investigator while the information gained from this study will allow us to make new clinical guidelines that include weight loss to improve mobility function in older Veterans with PAD. These findings may potentially result in reduced healthcare utilization, costs of treatment, and hospitalization relatd to poor circulation and mobility dysfunction in those with PAD."

"9276818","PROJECT ABSTRACT Many genetic disorders are characterized by defects in neuronal function and cognitive ability. To gain key insights into new ways of approaching these diseases, it is critical to understand the molecular basis for regulating neuronal transcriptional programs and take advantage of emerging global genomic technologies, which provide deep insights into the molecular basis for these disorders. Here, we focus on a severe neurological disorder that is caused by mutations of the methyl-CpG-binding protein, MeCP2, and how it causes alterations in gene expression programs required for neuronal function. We propose to investigate this perplexing syndrome, which can be categorized under the umbrella of ?autism spectrum? disorders, to test a previously unappreciated mechanism for regulating neuronal transcription programs based on chromosomal architecture. Specifically, we will determine the effects of MeCP2 loss on chromatin architecture and its relation to changes in gene transcription, as well as determine the functional role of MeCP2 on the nuclear matrix-dependent architectural network. We will utilize several mouse genetic models to target several important brain cell types and apply genome wide methodologies to elucidate the contribution of each of these to the observed brain phenotype. We expect to expand our understanding of MeCP2-dependent transcriptional de- regulation due to structural effects on chromosome architecture, and uncover the role of MeCP2 in regulation of chromosomal boundary/ sub-nuclear architectural interactions as an underlying mechanism in Rett syndrome. This will enable new understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this devastating neurological disease, and lay the groundwork for potential new classes of potential therapeutic avenues.  "

The clinical outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality remain poor and the pharmacological therapy of FA has not changed in over 30 years. In the past funding period we identified multiple novel small molecules and therapeutic targets that have beneficial effects in FA models. In this project we will follow up on the following candidates: 1) metformin (Aim1), P38-MAPK inhibitors (Aim 2) and combinations of small molecules (Aim 3), including those from Aims 1 and 2 as well as Project 2. We will use murine models of FA and xenotransplants (Core B) to assess the effects of these regimens on human blood progenitors in vivo. Core C will perform DNA damage assays for our project and Project 3 will test our candidates on human FA cells in vitro. In aggregate these experiments will define the therapeutic potential of small molecule monotherapy or drug combinations for the treatment of bone marrow failure in FA."
"9306205","Project Summary/Abstract  Bipolar disorder (BD) and other depressive disorders are some of the most common mental illnesses affecting millions of people. The primary treatment, lithium (Li+), has remained unchanged for > 50 years. However, the therapeutic window for Li+ is very narrow (0.5-1.2 mM) and the side effects can be severe. Also, Na+ dysregulation is implicated in BD and its pathways are also involved in Li+ uptake, but very little is known about the basis of BD or the mechanism of action of Li+. A critical barrier to maximizing the therapeutic effect and minimizing the side effect is missing information of the concentrations and distributions of Li+ and Na+ in BD cells, because of lack of selective sensors for Li+ and Na+ in living cells. This R21 proposal seeks to explore and demonstrate proof-of-concept of a novel class of DNAzyme sensors with high specificity for either Li+ or Na+ for simultaneous detection of Li+ and Na+ in BD cells, in order to provide new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Li+ treatment of BD.  Specifically, we propose to use an in vitro selection method to obtain Li+- or Na+-specific DNAzymes with high catalytic activity towards ribonucleotide cleavage. These sequences will be characterized and optimized for sensor applications, whereupon we will transform them into fluorescent sensors using the catalytic beacon method for simultaneous imaging of Li+ and Na+ in lymphoblast cell models of BD, including cells obtained from BD- and non-BD patients. These fluorescent sensors will further be improved upon by incorporating both a photolabile-caging group to protect against ribonucleotide cleavage during the cell transfection, and a FRET pair of fluorophores to enable ratiometric sensing to allow for better quantitation of ion concentrations.  While most cellular sensors have been designed for detection of divalent metal ions (e.g. Ca2+), few effective cellular sensors have been developed for monovalent ions. By developing a novel class of DNAzyme sensors to provide a direct measure of Li+ and Na+ simultaneously in BD cells, this proposal provides a critical missing piece of information in providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms for Li+ treatment of BD. In the process, we will demonstrate general methodologies for DNAzyme-based sensors applicable for any metal ion, including the use of in vitro selection incorporating negative selection to improve selectivity and use of the catalytic beacon system to transform metal binding into different fluorescence readouts. The methods demonstrated can be applied for detection and imaging of Li+ and Na+ for other BD cells and can be generalized to develop similar sensors to image many other metal ions, which will advance the fields of mental health, cell biology, and clinical diagnostics."
"9355215","Each year in the United States, 70,000 hospitalized children are estimated to experience an injury caused by medical management rather than the underlying disease or condition of the patient, defined as an ?adverse event.? Approximately 60% of these adverse events are considered potentially preventable. Little has been done to examine adverse events specifically during the transition when children are discharged from the hospital to home ? postdischarge adverse events. Postdischarge adverse events are important because while they result from care provided during a hospitalization, the majority are not detected until after patients have been discharged to home. Furthermore, the adverse events that are detected in the hospital and appropriately managed still lead to significant symptoms after the patients are sent home. As a result, the postdischarge incidence rates (19% - 28%) in three adult studies were about five to seven times higher than the inhospital adverse event incidence rates. Thus, it is plausible that the postdischarge adverse event incidence rate in children may be much higher than the inhospital rate, as with adults. Thus, efforts in children are needed to investigate postdischarge adverse events to estimate the burden and to identify the risk factors. This prospective cohort study will examine the frequency of adverse events, preventable adverse events, and ameliorable adverse events (aim 1) and identify the types of adverse events (aim 2) in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) neonates discharged home from the hospital. In addition, the study will examine patient, system, and patient care factors associated with the occurrence of postdischarge adverse events (aim 3). Patients will be identified from the NICUs of Children's Hospital of Michigan and Hutzel Women's Hospital of the Detroit Medical Center. Nurses will recruit NICU neonates prior to discharge, contact their guardians within 4-weeks after discharge to conduct a follow-up telephone interview, and review health records for NICU neonates related to patient care received postdischarge. The nurses will combine the information obtained from the telephone interview and the outpatient health record to screen neonates for adverse events using the following criteria: 1) new or exacerbated symptoms; 2) unplanned health services utilization; and 3) abnormal laboratory test results. If nurses identify any of the above information from the interview responses or health record, they will refer to two physicians who will independently review that neonate's entire health record (inpatient/outpatient) and responses from the telephone interview to determine the occurrence of adverse events. This project addresses a neglected area of patient safety that is related to NICHD's overall mission to improve patient safety during neonatal care. Results from this study will help children's and community hospitals develop systemic interventions to improve the hospital discharge process and pediatric patient safety during the post-discharge period."

"9379655","Project Summary Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology which affects the lung in greater than 90% of cases. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of activated CD4+ T cells in the lung and other sites of disease activity. Evidence suggests that these T cells are intimately involved in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. In an acute form of sarcoidosis known as Löfgren?s syndrome, a correlation between the presence of the HLA-DRB1*03:01 allele and expansions of lung CD4+ T cells expressing the T cell receptor (TCR) ?- chain variable (V) region V?2.3 has been observed. These T cell populations are oligoclonal in nature, suggesting their recruitment to the lung in response to conventional antigen. In addition, these T cell expansions are compartmentalized to the lung and disappear with disease remission, underscoring their importance in disease pathogenesis. We hypothesize that in HLA-DRB1*03:01 individuals with Löfgren?s syndrome, V?2.3-expressing CD4+ T cell clones accumulate and expand in the lungs in response to the etiologic sarcoidosis antigen and recognize that antigen in an HLA-DRB1*03:01-restricted fashion. This proposal harnesses the strengths of an international research team and focuses on a distinct cohort of HLA- DRB1*03:01+ Swedish subjects with Löfgren?s syndrome in which two of the three components of the trimolecular complex are known (i.e., HLA-DRB1*03:01 and V?2.3-expressing CD4+ T cells). Using a single cell RT-PCR approach, Aim 1 will characterize the ??TCR pairs expressed on CD4+ V?2.3-expressing T cells in the BAL of Löfgren?s syndrome patients and generate hybridomas expressing the TCRs of interest. The second specific aim will determine the peptides that stimulate the CD4+ T cell hybridomas expressing disease- relevant TCRs derived from Löfgren?s syndrome patients. The final aim will use HLA-DR3-peptide tetramers to identify antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the lungs of sarcoidosis patients and determine if the frequency of these T cells can serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. Thus, using innovative and novel technology, we will address critical knowledge gaps in the etiologic T cell antigens involved in the initiation of disease in patients with Löfgren?s syndrome, further advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In addition, these results will lay the foundation for additional studies of sarcoidosis in the US."

"9249447","Project Summary Age-related bone loss is an enormous public health problem. While there has been considerable progress in recent years towards a better understanding of the mechanisms of skeletal aging using rodent models, there are major gaps in our understanding of the aging skeleton in humans. In particular, the underlying mechanisms in humans that lead to reduced bone formation with aging remain unknown. Consistent with rodent studies, we recently demonstrated, using direct microneurography, that increased sympathetic outflow in postmenopausal women was associated with impaired bone microarchitecture and reduced serum bone formation markers. Based on these findings, Project 1 will investigate the central theme of this program project grant (PPG), sympathetic nervous system (SNS) control of bone metabolism, by a proof-of-concept interventional study in Aim 1 which will not only provide the pivotal test of the hypothesis that the SNS regulates bone turnover in humans but will also examine the ?-adrenergic receptor (?-AR) selectivity of this effect. In Aim 2, this Project will examine other mechanisms, in addition to ?-AR signaling, that lead to the impaired bone formation with aging. We have developed novel techniques whereby we can obtain small needle biopsies of bone from humans and rapidly isolate sequential fractions of increasingly enriched human osteoblast and osteocyte populations in which we can interrogate specific gene expression pathways. Thus, the overall goal of this Project is to better define, in vivo in humans, the mechanisms for the age-related defect in bone formation. We will accomplish this goal within the context of our two specific Aims. Aim 1: In postmenopausal women, who have increased sympathetic outflow, to test the hypothesis that treatment with low doses of a non-selective ?- blocker (propranolol) will increase serum markers of bone formation and reduce markers of bone resorption (Aim 1a); and, to better define the ?-AR selectivity (?1 versus ?2) for regulation of bone turnover by sympathetic outflow in humans by using increasingly ?1-selective blockers (Aim 1b). Aim 2: In aging women and men, to identify novel mechanisms responsible for the age-related impairment in bone formation by interrogating specific genes and pathways related to bone formation in human osteoblast- and osteocyte- enriched preparations, including known ?-AR target genes. The studies proposed in this Project are highly integrated with those in the other two Projects. Specifically, the population impact of an important age-related condition associated with increased sympathetic outflow (congestive heart failure) will be examined in Project 2, and Project 3 will use mouse models to examine potential interactions between ?-AR and estrogen (E) signaling in bone. Further, specific genes and pathways identified as regulated by ?-AR and E signaling in osteoblast- and osteocyte-enriched cell populations from mouse bones in Project 3 will be evaluated in similar cell populations from young versus elderly humans in this Project. Thus, as in previous cycles of this PPG, Project 1 will provide the central underpinnings for interactions and synergies across the Projects of this PPG."
"9285690","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a major public health issue and have an enormous societal and economic impact. Current FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for treating AUDs suffer from deleterious side effects and are only effective in a subset of individuals. This signifies an essential need for improved medications. Emerging evidence suggests that anticonvulsants are a promising class of drugs for treating individuals with AUDs. Our preliminary data demonstrates that the anticonvulsant retigabine significantly reduces drinking in two rodent models of voluntary alcohol consumption. Retigabine is a KCNQ (Kv7) voltage-dependent K+ channel positive modulator that is approved by the FDA for treating partial onset seizures. In central neurons, Kv7 channels display activation at voltages close to the resting membrane potential and are the molecular composition of the M-current (IM) in brain. IM activation is important for repolarizing the cell, fine-tuning the resting membrane potential, and controlling action potential generation and frequency. Previous evidence has demonstrated that acute alcohol exposure inhibits IM in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine and CA1 pyramidal neurons. In Drosophila, Kv7 channels have been implicated in acute alcohol-induced memory impairments and tolerance to the sedative effects of acute alcohol exposure. Recent evidence has also demonstrated a role for Kv7 channels in synaptic plasticity and cognition. Chronic alcohol exposure is known to engage neural mechanisms associated with synaptic plasticity. However, it is unknown if chronic alcohol consumption affects Kv7 channel expression or function. Preliminary evidence suggests that prolonged alcohol consumption alters surface trafficking of Kv7.2 channels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Interestingly, Kv7.2 channel protein and transcript levels in the NAc negatively correlated with voluntary alcohol intake. Bioinformatics analysis also demonstrated that genes that encode Kv7 channels are included in the support interval for replicated QTLs for alcohol consumption in mice. Thus, our preliminary data have identified Kv7 channels as promising molecular targets that can influence voluntary alcohol consumption. In addition, these results have demonstrated that prolonged alcohol consumption alters Kv7 channel expression. Three specific aims were designed to test the overarching hypothesis of this proposal that Kv7 channels are critical regulators of voluntary alcohol drinking. We have proposed a multifaceted approach using biochemistry, electrophysiology, pharmacology, and mouse transgenic models to determine if: A) positive modulation of Kv7 channels in the NAc, dorsomedial striatum (DMS), or VTA can reduce drinking (Aim 1), B) altered Kv7 channel function in mutant and transgenic mice can influence alcohol consumption (Aim 2), and C) prolonged drinking alters Kv7 channel function and expression in NAc, DMS, and VTA (Aim 3). These studies will advance our knowledge on alcohol-associated neuroadaptations and will in turn help us to understand, at an increasingly sophisticated level, the role of Kv7 channels in alcohol drinking."
"9277341","ABSTRACT ? RESOURCE CORE (RC) 1 To support the goal of the San Antonio (SA) Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) to develop interventions that will promote healthy aging in people, we propose a Core that provides expertise, resources, and services to evaluate effects of putative aging-modulating interventions on the lifespan and healthspan of a non-human primate (common marmoset). These translational studies will set the stage for assessing the potential of these interventions to extend healthy aging in humans. This Core will aid and accelerate transition through the T0-T1 spectrum of translational research. Interventional lifespan studies in healthy humans are not feasible under existing funding programs, including the OAIC, and current regulatory guidelines. Thus, because of its relatively short lifespan and small size, the marmoset is an excellent non- human primate model for rapid screening of interventions identified in other species. At about 7 to 10 years of age, marmosets manifest a wide array of age-associated traits and pathologies that mirror those seen in humans. The Barshop Institute has developed the resources and expertise required to provide the OAIC with an outstanding environment for testing aging-modulating interventions in this model. Through this Core, the OAIC will ensure enhanced and timely access to this key pre-clinical resource by the OAIC community. The Specific Aims of the Pre-clinical Research and Analytical Pharmacology Core (RC1) are to: 1) Characterize, prioritize, and coordinate the use of a colony of aging marmosets available to OAIC investigators for translational aging research; 2) Assist investigators who seek to use the marmoset model in study design, data collection, analysis and interpretation of data, and preparation of material for publications and future grants. Resources include measurements/assays of mobility, cognition/memory, metabolism, cardiovascular function, inflammation, and histopathological assessments; 3) Provide analytical pharmacology services to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic interventions; 4) Develop and/or adapt new technologies and approaches for using marmosets to study aging, e.g., testing stem cell and gene transfer therapies in marmosets; 5) Support the educational and training mission of the OAIC by assisting early-stage investigators or those new to aging research to test potential aging-modulating interventions; and 6) Maintain a bank of blood/tissues from young and aged marmosets, and ensure availability of samples to the scientific community to address relevant questions related to lifespan and healthspan. This Core will synergize with other Cores towards achieving key OAIC goals, including the training of a new generation of translational scientists in aging, accelerating transformative aging research through pilot and exploratory studies, optimizing study design and assisting with data analyses and interpretation, ensuring the compatibility of studies conducted by the preclinical and clinical Cores, and facilitating the flow of findings from the marmoset model into human studies."
"9512067","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Weliky, David Paul Project Summary/Abstract  The long-term goal of the proposed research is detailed understanding of the basis for viral fusion protein- induced membrane fusion. Fusion of viral and target cell membranes is a key step in infection for many viruses important in disease and a detailed understanding of fusion mechanisms will aid development of anti-viral therapeutics whose mode of action is fusion inhibition. Fusion proteins are also a target of viral vaccine development. The proposed research focuses on the hemagglutinin HA2 and gp41 fusion proteins of the influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus, respectively. These proteins are chosen because these viruses cause major human diseases and because the proteins serve as prototypes for other class I viral fusion proteins. Although the protein sequences are non-homologous, both proteins are single-pass transmembrane proteins of the viral membrane with ~180-residue ectodomain regions which lie outside the virus. There is particular emphasis on the ~25-residue N-terminal ?fusion peptide? (FP) domain which plays a key role in fusion catalysis and is thought to insert into the host cell membrane early in the fusion process. There are four Aims which include structures in membrane of the FP's of HA2(Aim 1), and gp41(Aim 2), and the membrane locations of the FP's of HA2(Aim 3) and gp41(Aim 4). Each Aim is divided into (a) FP-only and (b) FP+soluble ectodomain+transmembrane domain sections. The FP's of both proteins can adopt either ? helical or antiparallel ? sheet structure, and both structures catalyze membrane fusion. The project focuses on the ? HA2 and ? gp41 FP structures. Structure/function correlations are further developed with corollary measurements on HA2 G1E and gp41 V2E mutants which both result in greatly impaired fusion and viral infection. The main technique to elucidate FP structure and membrane contacts is solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance(SSNMR) with particular emphasis on rotational-echo double resonance(REDOR) which can elucidate internuclear proximities and distances ?10Å. REDOR will be used to determine interhelical HA2 FP structures and antiparallel registries of ? gp41 FP structures. Fractional populations will be determined for the different structures as well as how the structures and populations change with fusion-impairing mutations. There will be REDOR measurements of FP/membrane contacts as well as complementary SSNMR measurements of FP/water contacts using paramagnetic relaxation and 1H spin diffusion.
