"9351191","Uterine leiomyomas occur in approximately 77% of all women in the United States and can cause severe  morbidity and infertility. To date, there is no effective treatment for leiomyomas aside from hysterectomies. We  have previously shown that the AKT pathway is activated in the majority of fibroids and that inhibiting this  pathway results in regulation of specific mechanisms that ultimately drive cells into cellular senescence or cell  death. In addition, we observed that oxidative stress is upregulated in leiomyomas due in part to suboptimal  growth conditions and a modification (acetylation) of the detoxifying enzyme, manganese superoxide  dismutase (MnSOD) that inhibits its function. We hypothesize that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can promote  growth of leiomyomas through the AKT pathway. In turn, when AKT is inhibited, ROS promotes senescence  and cell death. In Aim 1, we will determine whether increased levels of ROS, through the induction of miR-  182, drive p16 and HMGA2 localization to heterochromatin foci and promote senescence. In Aim 2, we will  determine whether ROS can decrease BCL2 function and expression resulting in mitochondria permeability  and release of DNA damaging molecules. We will also investigate the role of ROS and AKT in a unique stem  cell population in maintaining ?stemness?. Investigation of the mechanisms underlying senescence and cell  death upon inactivation of AKT will not only enhance our understanding of how fibroids grow and survive, but  also inform the future development of new therapies for fibroids."
"9305170","The widespread use of Glutamate (Glu) as the major excitatory neurotransmitter (NT) in the mammalian brain is both critical for normal physiology and a source of predicaments: a) As seen in stroke and a range of neurodegenerative diseases, any disruption in Glu clearance causes its accumulation, leading to over- excitation of postsynaptic cells and excitotoxic neurodegeneration. b) The use of the same NT in so many adjacent synapses can cause signaling to ?bleed over? between neuronal circuits, and the loss of processing fidelity. An idealized view of the brain describes synapses as well insulated from each other, enveloped by glia that expresses high levels of Glu clearing transporters (GluTs). However, a more realistic examination reveals that some particularly-important brain areas (e.g., hippocampus) show severely deficient glial isolation, with estimated 2/3 of released Glu seeping out of the original synapse. How sufficient Glu clearance is achieved in glia-deficient brain areas remains unclear. To overcome the limitation of current techniques we will study Glu clearance in the glia-deficient synaptic hub of the C. elegans nerve ring. We are aided by the availability of information on the precise identification of individual neurons, the exact location of their synapses, the circuits that they participate in, and the sensory inputs and behavioral outputs of these circuits. Together with animal transparency and the wide availability of optogenetic tools, this is an ideal system to study Glu clearance without perturbing interstitial fluids. In our recent studies we have discovered that specific synapses fall into watershed territories of Glu clearance, and that synapses might be affected by the agitation of body fluids. We therefore propose a novel concept, where Glu clearance in a glia-deficient synaptic hub can be robust enough to allow functional synaptic isolation. Such robust clearance depends on division of labor between proximal and distal GluTs, and is facilitated by agitation and perfusion of interstitial fluids. To provide further support to this model we will use genetically-encoded florescent Ca2+ reporters (GCaMP) to follow synaptic activity and assign additional synapses and circuits to GluT drainage territories; we will stimulate one circuit and record responses from an adjacent one to detect spillover; we will use genetically-encoded fluorescent detectors to study the flow of Glu in the interstitial space; we will study the effect of paralysis on neuronal responses and Glu flow; We will correlated the differences between the structure of proximal and distal GluTs to potential differences transport in affinity and capacity. These studies will provide novel insights to mechanisms of robust Glu clearance in the absence of glia, and highlight the significance of agitation of interstitial fluids in synaptic areas that are deficient in glia insulation, a feature shared between nematodes and some areas of the mammalian brain. These insights will aid in the design of future therapeutic interventions to prevent excitotoxicity (seen in stroke and a range of neurodegenerative diseases), and highlight the significance of vascular pulsatility in CNS physiology."

"9372474","Project Summary/Abstract Although China and Vietnam have both ratified the FCTC, neither provides its smokers with comprehensive cost-covered smoking cessation services. Cessation by current smokers is considered by many to be the only practical way to avoid a substantial proportion of tobacco deaths worldwide before 2050. Determining how to provide effective smoking cessation services to smokers in China and Vietnam represents one of the biggest challenges in global tobacco control efforts today. Mobile health technology (mHealth) holds particular promise for China and Vietnam, two countries with rapidly increasing mobile phone usage. However, substantial adaptations of existing mHealth smoking cessation interventions are needed to address the unique sociocultural barriers to quitting smoking for Chinese and Vietnamese smokers. The long-term goals of this project are to build and strengthen the capacity to develop and disseminate evidence-based, culturally appropriate interventions for smoking cessation using mHealth approaches in China and Vietnam. The specific aims of this project are 1) to develop and examine the efficacy of a culturally-enhanced mHealth intervention to promote smoking cessation among adult male smokers in China and Vietnam; and 2) to build and strengthen sustainable capacity for rigorous research on smoking cessation intervention studies using scalable mHealth methods in China and Vietnam. This project will not only provide timely and much-needed research evidence on the effectiveness of culturally-adapted mHealth approaches in China and Vietnam, but will also build a cadre of local researchers who will be able to carry out independent mHealth smoking cessation interventions. If scaled to population level, these interventions have the potential to help millions of smokers to quit smoking in China and Vietnam."
"9224026","Determining the importance of in vivo estrogen receptors and in vitro hormone modulation of Wnt/?-  catenin signaling on Chlamydia infections. Project Summary Naturally fluctuating levels of the hormones, estrogen and progesterone, alter the occurrence and/or severity of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). An estimated 150 million women worldwide use hormonal contraceptives containing combinations of synthetic estrogen and/or progesterone. C. trachomatis annually causes 1,400,000 infections in the US and remains the most frequent bacterial STI worldwide. The non-invasive, sexually transmitted C. trachomatis serovars D-K are obligate intracellular pathogens that replicate primarily within female genital tract (FGT) luminal and glandular epithelial cells. If untreated, these organisms can ascend the FGT, evoking pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancy in infected women. Clinical trials, animal models and in vitro studies all suggest that estrogen enhances chlamydial infection by multiple mechanisms. Steroid hormones have both direct and indirect effects on endometrial epithelial cells and also induce endometrial stromal cells to release effector molecules that regulate growth and maturation of uterine epithelial cells. Previously, we investigated the effects of hormones on chlamydial infection in an endometrial epithelial cell (Ishikawa, IK)/stromal cell (SHT-290) co-culture system, which provides a unique opportunity to dissect complex hormone/stromal cell/epithelial cell interactions in a simplified in vitro setting. Data from these studies indicate that: i) membrane-associated estrogen receptors help mediate C. trachomatis serovar E entry into host genital epithelial cells; ii) estrogen receptor signaling facilitates intracellular development of C. trachomatis; iii) estrogen-stimulated endometrial stromal cells secrete effectors that indirectly aid intracellular chlamydial development in genital epithelial cells, and; iv) progesterone antagonizes the effects of estrogen on chlamydial development. Published reports indicate that the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway is important for C. trachomatis development. Interestingly, estrogen activates Wnt signaling whereas progesterone inhibits Wnt signaling in the FGT. This proposal will test two independent, but related, hypotheses. First, in hormone- exposed co-cultures, estrogen-activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling contributes to estrogen-mediated enhancement of C. trachomatis infections whereas progesterone negatively effects C. trachomatis development by inhibiting Wnt. Second, the establishment and/or progression of chlamydial infection in vivo will be inhibited in the absence of estrogen receptors. Data from these experiments will: i) increase understanding of how hormones modulate chlamydial infection, transmission and reproductive pathology; and ii) determine the feasibility of analyzing the effects of estrogen receptor-independent signaling on chlamydial infection in vivo."
"9339471","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) particularly that due to diabetes, is a global problem that causes untold suffering in Veterans and the general population. Diabetic patients are at high risk of CKD and many face the prospect of irrevocable renal decline to end stage renal disease (ESRD). For some, renal transplantation is an effective way to treat ESRD, however, only a small minority receives a kidney. The majority of ESRD patients remain on dialysis, and most patients ultimately succumb to painful complications. One promising approach to CKD-ESRD is regenerative nephrology, and attempts have been made to restore renal function in animal models with stem cells. However, transplantation of stem cells from diverse sources has not yet fulfilled the basic postulates of cytotherapy:  engraftment, differentiation and expansion. We devised a completely different strategy for renal regeneration by cell transplantation in CKD, and accomplished long-term kidney cell engraftment and successful renal regeneration with allogeneic transplants and autotransplants of adult primary kidney cells that express the tubulogenic protein Serum Amyloid A1 (SAA). This proposal aims to test the novel and clinically relevant hypothesis that transplantation with renal tubule cells expressing the tubulogenic protein serum amyloid A (SAA) rescues kidney function in experimental CKD. Furthermore, we propose that cells from kidneys with CKD can be expanded in vitro and then auto-transplanted to effect recovery of both renal structure and function non-invasively. These studies are a necessary prelude to future clinical translation in which part of one kidney would be removed, its tubules harvested and transfected and the derived tubular cells returned to the donor to restore renal function without need for immune suppression. The proposed work is derived from accumulated experience:  First, we found that the acute phase protein SAA is critical in tubulogenesis in the embryo and during renal regeneration after ischemia (Kelly et al Am J Physiol 296:  F1355, 2009). Second, immortalized renal tubule (NRK52E) cells reprogrammed with SAA and administered intravenously produce striking improvements in renal function in multiple models of acute kidney injury (Kelly et al Am J Physiol 299:  F453, 2010). Third, transplantation with primary renal tubule cells resulted in significant recovery of structure and function in both chronic and acute kidney disease (Kelly et al Am J Physiol 303:F357, 2012). We already have conducted extensive experiments and found that CKD can be corrected in six rats with cells from a single donor of the same strain. Our hypothesis has generated the following specific aims:  (1) To evaluate cytotherapy, including autotransplantation, as novel treatment for CKD in diabetic nephropathy and ischemia. (2) To determine the mechanisms by which cytotherapy with SAA expressing primary renal tubule cells restores renal function in CKD from diabetic nephropathy and ischemia. The proposed innovative, translational study will define mechanisms of renal regeneration, potentially extend the utility of organs available for transplantation, and develop means for autotransplantation. We suggest that further defining mechanisms of cytotherapy-mediated renal regeneration and improvement in kidney function, including cell grafting effects, will stimulate further research on regeneration and facilitate the development of therapies to target the specific mechanisms identified. The ultimate goal is the prevention and treatment of CKD in Veterans and the general population."
"9512092","A number of developments over the last decade are promoting bold new projects that can enable the promise of precision or personalized medicine. While DNA sequencing costs continue to drop rapidly, equally important has been the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) allowing for the low cost, highly secure exchange of large amounts of longitudinal health data from individuals. In addition, the increasing consumer adoption of mobile and personal technologies offers the opportunity to link genomic and health data with exposure, behavioral and other environmental health data on a scale not previously possible. We must ensure that the benefits of these advances are accessible to all. Key to the success of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) Cohort Program will be the proportional inclusion of diverse groups. This is a major strength of the ?South-East Enrollment Center? (SEEC) consortium. SEEC will recruit 10,000 individuals from Florida and Georgia into PMI, including approximately 3,000 (30%) Hispanic/Latino and 3,200 (32%) Black/African American volunteers. Importantly, half of the Hispanics will come from the Caribbean (e.g. Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic) and the other half from South and Central America. Our sample of Blacks will include approximately 305 foreign-born blacks predominantly from Haiti and English speaking Caribbean islands. The Consortium will be spearheaded by four leading academic health centers in Florida and Georgia. Each member brings a considerable track record of establishing genomic cohorts, recruiting minorities into clinical research, forming community engagement partnerships, and sharing medical records across large networks (e.g. all participate in PCORnet)."
"9339497","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The dimorphic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) is found world-wide, and endemic to the Midwestern and southeastern United States. The organism can cause a life-threatening infection in immunocompetent or immunosuppressed individuals. One of the major risk factors for acquisition of disseminated Hc is the use of the TNF-? antagonist. In the past 3+ years, we have examined the role of the chemokine receptor, CCR5, in hastening the clearance of Hc. Our data demonstrate that this receptor is pivotal in dictating the balance between regulatory T cells and Th17 cells. In the CCR5 knockout mice or in mice that lack one of this receptor's major ligand, CCL4, the number of regulatory T cells in lungs is diminished whereas the number of Th17 cells is elevated. Neutralization of IL-17 reverses the salutary effect of a lack of CCR5 signaling. As an extension of these studies, we examined if the inimical effects of anti-TNF-? on host defenses to Hc were mitigated in the CCR5 knockout mice. We pursued this consideration since regulatory T cells arise after anti- TNF-? treatment and are responsible, in part, for the demise of animals. The absence of CCR5 mitigated the deleterious consequence of anti-TNF-? treatment. This finding has rekindled an interest in understanding the cells that drive the expansion of regulatory T cells in Hc-infected mice given anti-TNF-? and in examining how the lack of this cytokine or regulatory T cells blunt the innate immune response. Our preliminary data demonstrate that anti-TNF-? has a profound effect on recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and dendritic cells to the infected lung. Moreover, the cells that do reach the lungs are grossly impaired in their ability to inhibit the growth of Hc. In this proposal we will pursue  aims to enhance knowledge regarding how anti-TNF-? promotes Treg expansion and how the lack of this cytokine and/or regulatory T cells alter recruitment and function of mononuclear phagocytes. Specific aim 1 will endeavor to identify a population or populations of dendritic cells or monocyte/macrophages that promote expansion of regulatory T cells in the absence of TNF-? and to investigate the phenotype of regulatory T cells that arises in TNF-?-neutralized mice. Aim 2 will examine why recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and dendritic cells is defective. We will attempt to separate the contribution of the lack of this cytokine from that of regulatory T cells. Aim 3 will pursue how antibody to TNF-? or regulatory T cells cause dysfunction of monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells. These studies will generate a better understanding of the mechanisms by which anti-TNF-? enhances susceptibility to infection."
"9325501","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN), funded by the National Institutes of Health, represents a critical strategy to mitigate the adverse consequences of DILI. Already, this extensive network of centers around the U.S. has cultivated an impressive repertoire of case based clinical information and samples which has given important insights into DILI in the U.S. Some of the salient findings that have shaped our understanding of DILI and impact future research plans include the observation that antibiotics are the most common class of agents implicated in DILI, followed by Herbal and Dietary Supplements (HDS). The specific aims of this o Application are as follows: 1) To accrue early DILI cases, and collect serum, tissue, and clinical information on those patients meeting entry criteria through three mechanisms: Gastroenterologist- based; electronic health record (EHR); and population-based surveillance; 2) To continue to administer the DILIN Repository for Herbal and Dietary Supplements (HDS) and facilitate collaborative descriptive and product analysis and genetics research to identify injurious agents and host factors responsible for HDS induced liver injury (HILI); 3) To lead DILIN's effort in the causality assessment process for HILI, including it validation, and contribute to its incorporation into a computer-based instrument that is practical for clinicians and applicable for assessment of injury due to both drugs and HDS; 4) To contribute to the expansion of the Herbal and Dietary Supplement component of LiverTox and facilitate the use of LiverTox as a mechanism for DILI reporting by the medical community at large. To accomplish these aims, key collaborations have been built. Informatics specialists will assist in the design, implementation, validation, and refinement of an electronic health record algorithm. Collaborations have also been built with geneticists and the FDA toxicology group to explore the mechanisms for idiosyncratic liver injury from HDS, as well as to identify the agents responsible for injury. Our research will further refine causality assessment, particularly as it pertains to HILI. Finally, the proposed work will expand the functionality of LiverTox, both as a resource for the clinician and clinical scientist, as well as the individual seeking to report a cae of DILI or HILI."
"9380828","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to define the molecular and cellular events that occur within the primate periovulatory follicle that are critical for fertility. While the necessity of pituitary-derived luteinizing hormone (LH) for ovulation and development of the corpus luteum (CL) is well known, the specific cellular activities required for such processes to occur are poorly defined. Through the use of high-throughput genomic profiling methods, the P.I. and colleagues created extensive mRNA expression databases from primate follicles isolated prior to and following an ovulatory stimulus as well as in the developing CL. From the resultant transcriptome data, several pathways involved in coordinating LH action were identified. First, although progesterone (P) is known to be an important LH-induced regulator of ovulation and luteal development/function, our preliminary studies suggest unique roles for P action in primate ovulation and luteal development depend on its signaling through the nuclear P receptor (PGR) or related membrane associated P receptors (P receptor membrane component- 1 and -2; PGRMC1 and PGRMC2, respectively). Secondly, cortisol levels increase in the follicle after an ovulatory stimulus, which is associated with significantly increased expression of 11?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (HSD11B1) mRNA and reduced levels of HSD11B2 mRNA. HSD11B1 converts biologically inert cortisone to cortisol that can bind to and activate the glucocorticoid receptor, whereas HSD11B2 metabolizes cortisol to cortisone. Importantly, cortisol levels were significantly higher in rhesus monkey follicles that yielded oocytes capable of undergoing fertilization and embryonic development than in follicles whose oocytes remained unfertilized or failed to develop to an implantation stage embryo (i.e., a blastocyst). Lastly, the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and its signaling pathway is induced following an ovulatory stimulus and blocking LIF action prevented ovulation in rhesus monkeys. While our findings to date support an important role for P, cortisol, and LIF in coordinating LH action in the primate follicle, the specific processes they regulate are not understood. Thus, studies are proposed in adult, female rhesus monkeys to test the hypotheses that: (Aim 1) PGR and PGRMC1, -2 regulate distinct events critical for ovulation and luteal development, (Aim 2) HSD11B1 is critical for the local generation of cortisol, which acts through the glucocorticoid receptor present in the follicle to elicit the release of an oocyte competent for fertilization and embryonic development, and (Aim 3) LIF regulates the expression of a network of genes necessary for follicle rupture. The proposed studies will employ a controlled ovulation (COv) protocol that allows for the development, manipulation, and isolation of the naturally-selected rhesus macaque follicle from which a systematic genomic and cellular assessment of steroid (P, cortisol) and cytokine (LIF) control of ovulation and luteal development can be characterized. These experiments will provide important insight into the mechanisms controlling ovulation and the development of the CL, and hence fertility, in primates."
"9322556","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the rapidly increasing capacity to sequence human genomes, our incomplete ability to read and interpret the information content in genomes and epigenomes remain a central challenge. A comprehensive set of regulatory events across a genome - the regulome - is needed to make full use of genomic information, but is currently out of reach for practically all clinical applications and many biological systems The proposed Center will develop technologies that greatly increase the sensitivity, speed, and comprehensiveness of understanding genome regulation. We will develop new technologies to interrogate the transactions between the genome and regulatory factors, such as proteins and noncoding RNAs, and integrate variations in DNA sequences and chromatin states over time and across individuals. Novel molecular engineering and biosensor strategies are deployed to encapsulate the desired complex DNA transformations into the probe system, such that the probe system can be directly used on very small human clinical samples and capture genome-wide information in one or two steps. These technologies will be applied to clinical samples and workflows in real time to exercise their robustness and reveal for the first time epigenomic dynamics of human diseases during progression and treatment. These technologies will be broadly applicable to many biomedical investigations, and the Center will disseminate the technologies via training and diverse means."

"9372362","Summary The World Health Organization reports that more than six million people die each year from tobacco-related diseases. Moreover, changing markets have generated a dramatic shift in consumption from high-income countries (HICs) to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and by 2030 more than 80% of the disease burden from tobacco use will fall on LMICs. To help facilitate this shift, opponents of tobacco control ? led by the tobacco industry and even some governments ? have successfully used the supposed harm from tobacco control measures to smallholder tobacco farmers as a reason to slow, stop and even reverse tobacco control interventions, particularly in LMICs. This complex nexus of economic, agricultural and public health policymaking may prove to be home to one of the largest threats facing tobacco control. The emerging battleground is concentrated in countries with weaker governance capacity, more politically vulnerable governments and a greater economic reliance on tobacco, which includes many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. While there is a small literature examining some of these dynamics, there is a lack of cross-country and deep, individual-level evidence about the actual livelihoods of these farmers and the political economic context in which these dynamics are unfolding. Understanding the complexities of these livelihoods is a crucial component to addressing this challenge: helping policymakers to develop strategies to integrate public health and agro-economic policies positively, and in particular, to assist farmers in finding viable economic alternative livelihoods. Such policies supporting viable alternatives are needed to counter many existing ones that serve to propel or entrench tobacco cultivation. This project aims to fill the large research gap in this area by examining rigorously the economic lives of these farmers, and the political and economic processes that frame their livelihoods, in four major tobacco- growing LMICs ? Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi and Zambia. To reach this aim, we will first collect and analyze existing data and scholarship relevant to the economics and politics of tobacco farming in these regions. Informed by these findings, we will implement individual-level economic surveys of nationally-representative samples of farmers in four major tobacco-growing countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. We will complement the surveys with focus group discussions with farmers across the major tobacco-growing regions of each case country. Finally, using the expert consultation of the in-country co-investigators, we will extensively interview relevant actors in these countries, including relevant farmer organization representatives, ministry officials, civil society advocates, representatives of intergovernmental organizations, and industry representatives in order to illuminate the broader structures, policies and other important contexts that frame farmers' livelihoods. One of the project's principal aims is to improve research and policy analysis capacity in this vital substantive area in the region. Accordingly, there will be close cooperation among the HIC and LMIC co- investigators not only for research collaboration, but also to train a select cohort of graduate students (four in total) and two post-doctoral or post-graduate researchers in African universities and two in Indonesia who focus specifically on the political economy of tobacco control in LMICs. There is also a component in which three LMIC researchers will visit one of the North American institutions for post-doctoral studies. As the final component of our capacity-building strategy, the multi-disciplinary team will present the key findings to major stakeholders ? policymakers, advocates and scholars ? in a series of workshops across the region that elucidate the complexities of tobacco farming with an ultimate goal of creating a policy environment that is conducive to reducing the supply of tobacco parallel to efforts to control demand. At the same time, we will conduct workshops to present our findings to the survey and FGD participants so they can directly benefit from the researching to which they are contributing. These workshops will be accompanied by a corresponding set of country-specific reports and policy briefs that will also be distributed to key stakeholders. Finally, co-investigators will cultivate relationships with key stakeholders and engage in the presentation of research results and meaningful policy discussions in much smaller settings."
"9339498","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The discovery of ischemic preconditioning in the 1980's revealed the presence of a potent endogenous protective mechanism to increase ischemic tolerance in the heart that could be produced by brief periods of ischemia and reperfusion preceding a prolonged ischemia/reperfusion event. Ischemic postconditioning, evoked prior to reperfusion of ischemic tissue, has provided a clinically relevant target for cardiac protection. Numerous endogenous ligands and pharmaceuticals, includeing volatile anesthetics, produce pre and post conditioning in the heart, providing cardiac protection from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Despite significant insights gained over the last 30 years into mechanisms of cardiac protection, the full potential of harnessing pre and post conditioning in the clinical setting remains unfulfilled. Cardiac protection strategies in the clinical setting are limited by several factors including age and diseases related to aging. We have shown previously that the signaling molecules involved in cardioprotection need to function within caveolae and interact with caveolins to produce effective cardioprotection. We propose to test the novel hypothesis that loss of caveolin and disruption of precise cardioprotective signaling within caveolar microdomains results in the impaired volatile anesthetic-induced cardiac protection evident in aged animals and that re- expression of caveolin can restore volatile anesthetic-induced cardiac protective signaling that has been impaired by aging. The aims of the grant will 1: Determine mechanisms involved the interaction of volatile anesthetics and caveolins at the sarcolemmal membrane in young and aged cardiac myocytes, 2: Determine the mechanisms involved in the interaction of volatile anesthetic-induced cardioprotective signaling molecules, caveolins and mitochondria in young and aged cardiac myocytes, and 3: Determine if overexpression of Cav-3 restores volatile anesthetic-induced cardiac protection in aged mice and human hearts. We will use state of the art molecular biology techniques, electron paramagnetic resonance technology, imaging technology, and physiological techniques in cardiac myocytes, human myocardium and clinically relevant models of I/R injury to focus on mechanism and produce important preclinical data to support the use of caveolins as novel therapeutics for aged veteran patients at risk of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury."
"9351520","Project Summary Signal transduction through dedicated molecular pathways and networks in live cells is subject to substantial variability. Thus the precision of detection of the signaling inputs is not absolute, limiting the amount of transmitted information and thus the spectrum of signal-conditioned phenotypic outcomes. In the previous funding periods, we developed a new framework for analysis of information transfer in noisy signaling networks and applied it to various networks, most notably the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulated activation of diverse targets, including, most prominently the NF-kappaB transcription factor. We have also built a progressively experimentally validated deterministic model of this signaling network, which has been extensively used both in the analysis of the innate immune response and in development and validation of diverse systems biology tools. To enable high-throughput analysis of signaling networks, we have also developed a number of novel micro-fabricated tools and streamlined high throughput single cell analysis. Although this work and the work of many other labs have done much to uncover multiple insights into the workings of the TNF-activated signaling networks and many other eukaryotic signaling pathways and networks, much remains to be explored. First, we still lack complete understanding of how the variability (noise) is distributed across complex multi-node signaling networks. Knowledge of such noise distributions can both help us train more realistic stochastic mathematical models of the signaling processes and better understand the mechanisms of information transfer through complex biochemical `channels'. Second, in many cases, an in TNF induced signaling processes in particular, analysis is frequently performed in model cell lines, often without a clear connection to phenotypic outputs (the cell decision making). Thus it is not clear how much of the information transferred through signaling networks is used to inform cell decisions. Third, the analysis of signaling processes is mostly performed by imposing simplistic inputs, rather than reconstituting the signaling inputs that can be generated by live cells communicating TNF and other ligand-based signals. Thus, in experiments in cell culture, we might not study the response to the most relevant or informative inputs. In this application, we propose a set of modeling and experimental studies to address these challenges, by focusing on more relevant cell types: macrophages and endothelial cells, and the relevant phenotypic outcome of TNF signaling process: an increase in the endothelial layer permeability. We propose to build detailed stochastic analysis of TNF signaling in these cell types and use it to describe heterotypic cell-cell communication. A result of this analysis will be a set of tools to analyze the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LSP) and TNF signaling on an important aspect of the innate immune response, the endothelial layer integrity control leading to monocyte recruitment, which will also be universally applicable to other signaling and cell-cell communication systems."
"9339499","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure associated with trauma are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in American soldiers and veterans. Gut barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in the development of posttraumatic complications such as sepsis by providing the major site for plasma leakage and bacterial translocation to the circulation. Despite the well- recognized importance of gut dysfunction in the pathogenesis of posttraumatic complications, the intestinal permeability response to severe burns, a major form of trauma, has not been well characterized, and its cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The goal of this study is to elucidate the cell-specific mechanisms of leaky guts during thermal injury. We propose to define the function, regulation and molecular mechanisms of palmitoylation in mediating gut epithelial hyperpermeability during thermal injury. The hypothesis to be tested is that burn injury stimulates protein palmitoylation in the gut epithelial cells through upregulation of DHHC isoforms. Palmitoylation contributes to the pathogenesis of burn-induced gut hyperpermeability by stimulating ROCK-dependent cytoskeleton contraction and claudins/ZO2- mediated junction dissociation in the epithelial cells leading to epithelial barrier failure. Three specific aims are developed in this proposal to: 1) study the function and regulation of palmitoylation in gut epithelial barrier injury, 2). examine the regulatory role of palmitoylation n gut epithelium during thermal injury, and 3) identify molecular targets of palmitoylation in mediating epithelial hyperpermeability. The study design employs complimentary in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models that incorporate molecular and genetic approaches into physiological experiments under clinically relevant trauma conditions. The significance of this study lies in the potential to identify a new role of protein palmitoylation in pathogenesis during trauma. Data derived from the research work will not only contribute to the advancement of gastrointestinal pathobiology, but also has clinical implications in the development of effective therapies or surgical interventions against gut barrier injury in patients with trauma or inflammatory diseases."

The body of work from our laboratory in the past decade has shown several mechanisms by which iron affects metabolism, including damaging ß-cells, down regulating adiponectin and leptin, and mediating multiple effects on the signaling pathways that regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. A second nonconventional risk factor for diabetes is disruption of the circadian rhythm of metabolism. Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for environmental changes. They coordinate metabolic changes needed as we shift from being asleep to being awake, from fasting to being fed, and from storing energy to using energy. It is therefore not surprising that many studies have shown these rhythms' importance to obesity and diabetes, whose pathogenesis incorporates derangements of all of those processes. Disruption of this normal cycle is felt to be a major factor in the increased prevalence of diabetes and obesity among night shift workers. Our work in the previous funding period has demonstrated that dietary iron, even within the broad range of normal, has significant effects on the circadian clock, specifically the shift from hepatic gluconeogenesis to hepatic fuel storage. In the course of these studies, it also emerged that dietary iron also affected the circadian rhythmicity of thermoregulation.  Besides iron, another important input to the regulation of these cycles is oxygen. These two factors are necessary for fuel metabolism, so their availability needs to be part of the regulation of this fundamental rhythm. Deficiencies i both are common: Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disease in the world, and hypoxia occurs commonly in diabetes, both systemically (associated with sleep apnea) as well as in tissues such as fat that outgrow their blood/oxygen supply in obesity. With deficiency of either, the organism must respond by limiting oxidative metabolism, which in turn will limit thermogenesis and the normal oscillations of body temperature that entrain the circadian clock. When in excess, we have shown that iron may also allow escape from the constraints of those rhythms, but at the expense of increased levels of oxidant stress. Importantly, we have shown that these effects occur across the very broad range of normal dietary iron intake and tissue iron levels. Thus, once the effects of different levels of dietary iron are understood, we will be able to verify the same effects in humans and begin to determine the optimal levels of iron that will best prevent obesity and diabetes. (In fact, we are currently working on a clinical trial to teat diabetes with bloodletting.) At the same time, we will uncover novel targets that can be potentially used to treat those conditions. This application builds upon our discoveries on the mechanisms and importance of dietary iron in the circadian rhythm of gluconeogenesis, and extends them into studies of thermoregulation, brown adipose function, and the novel underlying signaling mechanisms, including generation of microRNAs,"

"9395746","Project Summary/Abstract: LncRNA Regulators of Epidermal Homeostasis and Early Neoplasia  Extensive regulatory mechanisms control cell growth and differentiation, the deregulation of which can lead to tumorigenesis. Investigation of the factors that regulate normal cellular homeostasis has revealed important insights in the understanding of neoplasia. Research on homeostatic regulators has primarily focused on protein coding genes, however long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical factors in the control of proliferation and differentiation. Despite the growing number of functional lncRNAs, the majority have not been thoroughly investigated for their potential role in tumorigenesis.  To identify novel lncRNAs involved in the regulation of epidermal homeostasis and early neoplasia, 15 human cutaneous SCC tumors and patient/site matched normal skin samples were subjected to RNA sequencing. Following stringent filtering criteria, including high expression, differential expression in SCC versus normal skin, and low protein coding potential, computational analyses identified 11 novel unannotated transcripts that are likely lncRNAs. These candidate lncRNAs were termed SCC Mis- Regulated Transcripts (SMRTs). Functional evaluation of one of these SMRTs, SMRT-2, which is downregulated in SCC, has revealed an essential role in epidermal differentiation. Thus, to our knowledge, SMRT-2 is the first identified lncRNA with an essential function in epidermal homeostasis that is mis-regulated in SCC. Given these findings, the goal of the work proposed here is to mechanistically characterize SMRT-2 to address how it influences epidermal homeostasis and how this is deregulated in early neoplasia. Specifically, in Aim I we will define the protein, RNA, and DNA interactors of SMRT-2 using the unbiased and high-throughput approaches of RNA-Protein Microarray Analysis (RNA-PMA), RNA Interactome Analysis sequencing (RIA-seq), and chromatin isolation by RNA purification sequencing (ChIRP-seq). Because the remaining ten SMRTs have not yet been studied for functionality, another goal of this work that will be addressed in Aim II is to functionally evaluate the remaining SMRTs by manipulating their expression levels in robust models of epidermal homeostasis: in vitro three dimensional epidermal tissue culture and in vivo skin xenografting onto immune deficient mice. Identified functionally active SMRTs will then be mechanistically characterized similarly to SMRT-2. Overall, these studies will provide insight into the role of lncRNAs in epidermal homeostasis and early neoplasia and identify additional factors essential for their function, potentially informing methods of cancer prevention, detection, and treatment."
"9359609","The function of the Flow Cytometry and Pathology (Core D) is to provide each Project with the expertise, equipment, and facilities required for the flow cytometric analyses, cell sorting, and pathological analyses that are needed for studies of cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Accurate identification, characterization, and quantitation of cells in a complex heterogeneous population are technically demanding and require specialized and expensive equipment and personnel. One of the major advantages of this Program Project is that it will make available to all four Projects the facilities and techniques of flow cytometry and cell sorting, which otherwise would not be affordable to any Project in isolation. Flow cytometry- based analysis for the identification of specific cell populations, changes in cell commitment or phenotype, and characterization of cell functions such as cell cycle, viability, or signal transduction, will be crucial to all Projects. A central common facility that performs these technically challenging analyses is therefore indispensable to achieve the goals of the Program Project. Besides the obvious advantages of efficiency and cost savings, the Core will also enable four investigators with diverse and complementary backgrounds (Drs. O?Toole, Moore, Li, and Ratajczak) to combine their technical and biological expertise in order to ensure that the proposed work is successfully executed. The Core will offer the Program Project investigators the ability to identify and characterize specific cell types from complex populations. It will also offer the facilities and expertise necessary to perform the comprehensive histopathologic/immunohistochemical analyses required for this Program. The uniform histopathologic analyses conducted by the Core in a blinded and rigorously standardized fashion will make it possible to compare results of different experiments within the same Project and among different Projects. Core D will be the continuation of the Flow Cytometry Core in the current funding cycle (led by Dr. O?Toole) and of the intense and productive ongoing collaboration in flow cytometry and pathology between Dr. O?Toole and the other PPG investigators. The function of Core D is to provide all four Projects with the expertise, equipment, facilities, reagents, procedures, and analyses needed for flow cytometry, sorting, and pathology work. Specifically, the Core will i) perform the flow cytometric analyses and cell sorting procedures required for studies of CMCs and EVs, ii) perform tissue processing, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry of cardiac samples, and iii) make available to the four Projects the tremendous experience and expertise of the Core personnel."
"9339518","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The abuse of illegal drugs poses a worldwide problem, with a multitude of negative individual and societal consequences. Addiction to methamphetamine (MA) damages the brain, can induce psychosis, and is associated with crime and increased aggression. Military personnel, including Veterans and their families, have been identified as among key populations requiring special support to deal with their drug abuse problems. Genetic animal models for investigating risk for MA use and mechanisms that underlie risk and escalating use are lacking. This application describes research focused on a genetic mouse model for human methamphetamine (MA) use and on the identification of genetic factors and specific mechanisms that influence genetic risk for MA abuse. To be utilized are (1) unique genetic tools that consist of lines of mice selectively bred for high and low MA drinking (the MADR lines) and of interval specific congenic strains to be used for finer mapping of a gene(s) that influences MA intake; and (2) a newly developed operant oral MA self-administration method that has been used to validate the MADR lines as a genetic model that shows differential sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of MA. This program of research will develop a model of genetically-determined escalating, binge-like MA intake. It will also follow up the results of quantitative trat locus (QTL) mapping, which identified a locus on mouse chromosome 10 that accounts for ~50% of the genetic variance associated with differential MA intake, by completing finer mapping and sequence analysis that will allow progress to be made in identifying genes and gene networks that influence genetic risk for MA addiction. Preliminary data support the importance of mu-opioid receptors in this risk and pharmacological and molecular studies will be completed to further test the importance of this mechanism. In addition, molecular analyses will explore other potential candidate mechanisms and knockout mice and pharmacological approaches for druggable targets will be used to follow-up promising mechanisms. There are 3 specific aims: (1) examine genetically-determined patterns of MA intake, escalation, binge-like intake, and reinstatement. Potential differences in sensitivity to reinforcement by natural rewards will also be examined as part of this aim; (2) use an existing panel of interval specific congenic strains to more finely map the chromosome 10 QTL; measure genetically correlated traits in these congenics to test the hypothesis that a common genetic region on mouse chromosome 10 influences MA drinking and the correlated trait; (3) complete qPCR, sequence and Western blot analyses, after fine mapping of the chromosome 10 QTL, for genes that could impact MA drinking; use these data to identify specific mechanisms that should be tested for their impact on MA intake, using knockout and pharmacological approaches. Functional analysis of the mu- opioid receptor in the MADR lines, one candidate gene in the chromosome 10 interval, will also be completed. This work has the potential for developing a needed genetic animal model of high MA intake that takes advantage of existing genetic risk in the development of this model. In addition, the study of opioid system involvement dovetails nicely with ongoing clinical work that indicates concomitant changes in MA use in individuals receiving buprenorphine or methadone treatment (both opioid receptor agonists) for opiate dependence. Use of the genetic model will indicate whether animals at higher genetic risk for MA use are susceptible to opioid and other pharmacological interventions that are explored."
"9255776","Ischemic ventricular tachycardia (VT) causes more than half of the 300,000 sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) that occur annually in the United States. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the standard of care, but they are expensive (the total cost of an ICD implant exceeds $80,000) and not curative. Patients who receive ICDs are subject to periodic shocks to halt episodes of VT, and those shocks can be traumatic. RF ablation represents a potential method for curing VT, and at a much lower cost than ICDs, but while RF ablation has been successful at treating atrial arrhythmias, it has not so far been as effective at treating VT. An ablation tool capable of treating VT has the potential to eliminate the need for ICD implants, greatly reducing the cost to the health care system of treating VT while also improving the lives of patients affected by VT. We have developed an ablation system and catheter for the treatment of VT. Our technology delivers heated saline along with RF energy, and is unique in its ability to treat the large volumes of cardiac tissue necessary to eliminate arrhythmogenic tissue located deep in the ventricular wall. Our technology is capable of treating much larger volumes of tissue than conventional RF because saline carries the heat generated by RF into tissue by convection. We have demonstrated that our ablation system can cure VT in an infarcted animal model. Our primary aim is to carry out a 20-patient clinical trial to establish the safety of our technology and to begin to demonstrate the efficacy of the Thermedical system for treatment of VT. Before beginning the human clinical trial, we will complete verification and validation activities to ensure the electrical safety of the system and the biocompatibility of the catheter materials, and to validate the catheter packaging and sterilization. Additionally, prior to the human trial we will carry out a final safety study on 8 infarcted canines. We will conduct the 20-patient study at the Mayo Clinic. Patients will be eligible for the study if they have recurrent, symptomatic VT; if they have failed prior cardiac catheter VT ablation; if the etiology of the arrhythmia is related to ischemic structural heart disease; and if a target arrhythmia has been treated by an implanted ICD. The primary safety endpoints of this study will be the absence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) prior to hospital discharge in more than 70% of the patients, and the absence of serious adverse events that are potentially device related within 30 days for more than 70% of the patients. The primary efficacy endpoints of the study will be non-inducibility of the clinical VT and treatment of clinically relevant scar."
"9297403","Project Summary/Abstract  Parkinson's disease (PD) imposes a major burden on our aging population, and represents a  neurodegenerative disorder that affects broad areas of the brain, but primarily manifests as a loss of  dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia nigra. ?-Synuclein is thought to play a central role in PD because ?-  synuclein mutations and polymorphisms are linked to PD, and because ?-synuclein containing inclusion bodies  (Lewy bodies) are found neuropathologically in PD. Current data suggest that ?-synuclein promotes  neurodegeneration in PD by misfolding into a toxic conformation, most likely as a microaggregate, that is  deleterious to the neurons harboring the toxic ?-synuclein conformer. However, the mechanisms mediating the  toxic effects of ?-synuclein remain incompletely understood. The present project proposes to investigate the  mechanisms underlying ?-synuclein neurotoxicity in two specific aims, using cultured human neurons and  mouse brains in situ as model systems, and focusing in particular on an understanding of the nature of ?-  synuclein toxicity. The project will utilize an interdisciplinary approach with a particular emphasis on  electrophysiological recordings to probe the relation of neuronal function, in particular as regards synaptic  transmission, to ?-synuclein neurotoxicity. The results from these experiments will elucidate the extent and  nature of ?-synuclein neurotoxicity in mouse and in human neurons."
"9546866","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is a key component in the prevention and treatment of many obesity-related metabolic complications, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. High intensity interval training (HIIT), which alternates brief high-intensity efforts ith brief recovery periods, has been found to markedly improve clinical markers of metabolic health (meal tolerance, 24h glucose). Therefore, HIIT may be considered an effective and time- efficient alternative to conventional exercise. Importantly, HIIT has also been found to be safe and well tolerated in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. The exercise stimulus of HIIT is obviously very different from conventional exercise, and can yield unique adaptions. However, mechanisms underlying HIIT-induced improvements in metabolic health remain poorly understood. In addition, variations in the main components of HIIT (# of intervals, exercise time, energy expended) may induce very different metabolic outcomes, yet a systematic assessment of deviations in these parameters has not been conducted. Furthermore, while available evidence clearly demonstrates HIIT can induce impressive health benefits after a few to several weeks of training, the ability/willingness of obese adults to adhere to a long-term HIIT program is not known. Our overall objectives are to: 1) comprehensively assess putative mechanisms underlying HIIT-induced improvements in insulin resistance at the whole-body, tissue, and cellular levels, 2) systematically evaluate the impact of different doses of HIIT that may be optimal for improving metabolic health in obese adults, and 3) assess the ability/willingness of obese subjects to adhere to long-term HIIT programs. In Specific Aim #1, we will examine the effects of 3 months of HIIT (10 x 1min at ~90%maximal heart rate [HRmax]; 4d/wk) on changes in key clinical health outcomes (e.g., insulin resistance, 24h glucose control, hepatic lipid accumulation, blood lipid profile) in obese adults with impaired glucose tolerance. We will also compare HIIT with conventional exercise-training involving steady-state exercise for 45 min at 60-70%HRmax (which represents a common exercise prescription for health and fitness). Specific Aim #2 will determine factors underlying the improvements in insulin resistance (e.g., reduced lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle, lower macrophage infiltration and markers of inflammation in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and/or enhanced insulin signaling). Specific Aim #3 will address important clinical/applied issues regarding the optimization of HIIT by systematically evaluating the effects of the number of intervals, exercise time, and energy expended during HIIT on insulin resistance - and we will also assess the ability/willingness of obese adults with impaired glucose tolerance to adhere to HIIT programs for up to 1 year. Findings from these studies will greatly expand our understanding about the effects of HIIT on metabolic health, and will provide tremendously valuable information for the design of programs aimed at maximizing key metabolic benefits of exercise."
"9380826","Abstract: Respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus (IAV) cause high levels of morbidity and mortality in human populations. Host immune responses can play either protective or a pathologic role during infection. Therefore, understanding of the regulatory networks and signaling pathways that determine the magnitude and quality of an individual's antiviral immune response has important implications for human health, since these genes/pathways could be therapeutically targeted to control viral replication, to treat aberrant immune responses, or they may represent targets for enhancing the safety and efficacy of vaccines against a wide range of viral pathogens. Polymorphic host genes and regulatory networks have a major impact on immune response variation in human populations. However, confounding environmental factors and/or ethical concerns limit the types of studies that can be conducted in humans. Therefore, genetically tractable model systems that capture the range of genetic and phenotypic diversity seen in humans are needed to mechanistically dissect the genetics of immune variation. To address this need, we have used the Collaborative Cross (CC), a highly diverse mouse genetic reference population, to identify and characterize polymorphic host genes that regulate baseline and IAV- induced innate and adaptive immunity. As part of this effort, we have quantified variation in virus-induced innate and adaptive immune responses and disease over a 45 day time-course (Days 2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 28, and 45 post infection) in a panel of 110 CC RIX lines (reproducible F1 crosses between CC recombinant inbred (RI) lines that model heterozygous human populations). This resource, when combined with other complementary Systems Genetics tools, such as the Diversity Outbred (DO) population and CRISPR-mediated genome editing, data sets comparing the host response to other pathogens that are being studied in the context of this U19, and the analysis of gene expression changes and genetic variations in IAV infected human patients, gives us the opportunity to: 1) identify polymorphic genes associated with IAV immune response variation, and test their impact on other aspects of the antiviral response or virus-induced disease process, 2) test how these genes impact responses to other viral pathogens, or function during allergy/auto-immunity, and 3) test the impact of these genes in the context of human infections to identify targets for diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic interventions in humans."
"9526064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary incontinence (UI) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) affect almost half of US women and cause substantial distress, diminished quality of life, and dramatic limitations in daily functioning. Obesity, a US and worldwide epidemic associated with enormous health and quality of life impact, is one of the strongest independent risk factors for UI and weight loss is an effective treatment for UI. However, the mechanisms by which obesity promotes UI and LUTS and why weight loss is an effective or UI in women are poorly understood. This proposal outlines a 5-year K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (POR) renewal application for the candidate to expand her mentoring work with early career patient oriented researchers and promote a multidisciplinary, translational research paradigm focused on the association of weight and weight loss with UI and LUTS. In addition to mentoring plans, the proposal outlines specific aims to continue to advance our understanding of the association of UI, LUTS, and obesity in women by examining the effect of weight and weight loss on UI/LUTS in women, the possible roles of inflammation, physical activity, stress, and body habitus in the relationship between obesity and UI/LUTS, and facilitate the translational development of novel approaches to treatment and prevention of these conditions. The goals of this patient-oriented research and mentoring proposal will be achieved by efficiently leveraging existing resources, including ongoing NIH-funded clinical trials, comprehensive datasets, and productive research collaborations. The candidate's long-term goals are to be a leader in UI research, to contribute substantially to our understanding and approaches to the treatment and prevention of UI and LUTS, and to mentor the next generation of investigators interested in the epidemiology and treatment of female incontinence. Elucidating the mechanisms of the association between obesity with UI and LUTS in women will facilitate the translational development of novel approaches to treatment and prevention of these conditions. Strengths of the candidate include her formal training in research methods, history of research productivity and NIH funding, and a successful track record of mentoring junior trainees. Strengths of the institution include the resources of the UCSF CTSI and K30 Clinical Research Curriculum Award, several K12 training grants from which to recruit mentees, a unique formal mentor training program, and the availability of resources to foster research of junior POR investigators. The candidate has the enthusiastic support of her department, the UCSF CTSI, and patient-oriented research collaborators to pursue her research goals. The protected time provided by the K24 program is critical for the candidate to continue mentoring the next generation of investigators committed to patient-oriented research in the female lower urinary tract and advancing innovative research on the obesity-UI/LUTS associations."

"9356547","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Globally, nearly 3 billion people rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, the vast majority in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). The resulting household air pollution (HAP) is the third leading risk factor in the 2010 global burden of disease, accounting for an estimated 4.3 million deaths annually, largely among women and young children. Previous interventions have provided cleaner biomass-based cookstoves, but have failed to reduce exposure to levels that produce meaningful health improvements. There have been no large-scale field trials with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cookstoves, likely the cleanest scalable intervention. Here we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial of LPG stove and fuel distribution in 3,200 households in four LMICs (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda) to deliver rigorous evidence regarding potential health benefits across the lifespan. Following a common protocol, each intervention site will recruit 800 pregnant women (aged 18-34 years, <20 weeks gestation), and will randomly assign half their households to receive LPG stoves and a 30-month supply of LPG. Controls will receive the same cookstoves and LPG supply at the end of the study. The mother will be followed along with her child until the child is 2 years old. We estimate that 25% of households will have a second, non-pregnant older adult woman (aged 35-64 years) who will also be enrolled at baseline and followed during the 30-month follow-up period in order to assess cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and cancer outcomes. To optimize intervention use, we will implement behavior change strategies informed by previous experiences and formative research in Year 1. We will assess cookstove use, conduct repeated personal exposure assessments to HAP (PM2.5, black carbon, carbon monoxide), and collect dried blood spots and urinary samples for biomarker analysis and biospecimen storage on all participants at multiple time points. The primary outcomes are low birthweight, pneumonia incidence, and linear growth in the child, and blood pressure in the older adult woman. Secondary outcomes include preterm birth and gross motor development in the child, maternal blood pressure during pregnancy, and endothelial function, respiratory impairment, carcinogenic metabolites, and quality of life in the older adult woman. We will address the following specific aims: (1) using an intent-to-treat analysis, determine the effect of a randomized LPG stove and fuel intervention on health in four diverse LMIC populations using a common protocol; (2) determine the exposure-response relationships for HAP and health; and (3) determine relationships between LPG intervention and both targeted and exploratory biomarkers of exposure/health effects. The proposed trial, powered to detect health effects both within and across four LMIC populations, will provide compelling evidence, including costs and implementation strategies, to inform national and global policies on scaling up LPG stoves among vulnerable populations. Ultimately, this will facilitate deeper policy-level discussions as well as identify requirements for initiating and sustaining HAP interventions globally."
"9339465","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary/ Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US and disproportionally affects Veterans. Advances in non-small-cell lung cancer over the past decade have resulted in new molecularly targeted therapies with minimal toxic effects and dramatic clinical benefits. However, despite these progresses, overall five-year survival remains at approximately 16%, partly due to low responsive rate to targeted therapy, development of acquired resistance, difficulty of targeting certain proteins such as mutant K-RAS, and a large subset with undefined genetic alterations. Therefore, new molecular targets are needed for lung cancer subtypes that are currently refractory to available treatments. EphA2 is such a promising target. EphA2 is overexpressed in NSCLC, and high levels of EphA2 correlate with smoking, brain metastasis, disease relapse, and poor patient survival. A gain-of- function EphA2 mutation has also been identified in tumor specimens, suggesting an oncogenic role of EphA2 in lung cancer. Indeed, we discovered that knockdown of EphA2 in a large numbers of human lung cancer cell lines inhibited tumor cell viability, most dramatically affecting those bearing mutant K-RAS or carrying EGFR mutation that developed acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). To support this notion, an EphA2 small molecule kinase inhibitor suppressed cell viability in vitro and induced tumor regression in K-RAS mutant human lung cancer xenografts. Based on these preliminary data, the overall goal of this VA Merit renewal is to determine the efficacy of targeting EphA2 in lung cancer subtypes that are refractory to current targeted treatment, to elucidate molecular basis for EphA2 function in tumor, and to test small molecule EphA2 kinase inhibitors for cancer therapeutics. We will first to investigate the effects of EphA2 deficiency on lung cancer development and progression in vivo in transgenic K-RAS G12D and TKI-resistant EGFR L858R+T790M lung cancer models. To elucidate EphA2 receptor downstream signaling, we will focus on the JNK/c-Jun pathway in regulating tumor cell viability and tumor stem-like cell function. Finally, we will test the efficacy of selective small molecule inhibitors of EphA2 receptor. Success of this project will not only generate novel insights into the molecular basis whereby EphA2 RTK regulates tumor cell viability, but also provide novel EphA2- selective inhibitors for treatment of lung cancer subtypes that are refractory to current targeted therapies, such as K-RAS mutant and drug-resistant EGFR mutant lung cancers."
"9419571","Summary One of the most devastating consequences of alcohol misuse is its teratogenic effects on fetal development, particularly in the development of the brain and the formation of its complex circuitry. These permanent developmental deficits caused by alcohol misuse are referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).  Recent findings have demonstrated that fetal alcohol exposure results in wide-ranging and adaptive alterations of gene expression within the developing cerebral cortex. Such coordinated gene expression changes are regulated mainly by highly specified transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, recent studies on budding yeast and fruit fly have demonstrated that RNA binding proteins coordinately regulate the post-transcriptional modification of specific types of mRNAs in response to rapid environmental changes. This post-transcriptional regulatory complex of specific mRNAs and RNA binding proteins, known as RNA-operons, are suggested to have important roles in cellular adaptation to environment and diseases. However, the response of RNA-operons as a result of alcohol exposure within the mammalian brain remains unknown.  We have recently found that the RNA binding protein, Rbm39, is upregulated in response to ethanol exposure in both the human and mouse embryonic cortex. Our preliminary data suggests that the upregulation of Rbm39 is required for protecting neural progenitor cells from both cell death and cell cycle arrest in embryonic mouse cortices exposed to ethanol. However, alterations in Rbm39 expression, whether due to loss- or gain-of- function, do not show obvious effects on normal cortical development. These results suggest that the Rbm39 plays specific roles resulting from ethanol exposure. In addition, we have found that the Rbm39 regulates the post-transcriptional modifications of specific mRNAs that are required for adaptive cellular protection from ethanol. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Rbm39 coordinates post-transcriptional modification through RNA- operons after exposure to ethanol, providing an immediate and adaptive system in protecting cells within the embryonic cortex. We will examine this hypothesis through three discrete aims.  Aim 1 will define the requirement of Rbm39 for neural protection by knocking down Rbm39 in embryonic cortices exposed to ethanol. Aim 2 will determine whether exogenous increased of Rbm39 activity on RNA- operons can further reduce the brain damages by ethanol. Aim3 will examine whether Rbm39 orchestrates immediate post-transcriptional modification of specific genes in response to ethanol exposure."
"9336225","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized pathologically by inflammation and neurodegeneration. Because current treatments for MS, which are immune modulators, do not prevent neuronal loss and disability, neuroprotective treatments have been sought. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a phleotrophic cytokine with neuroprotective properties that has been studied as a potential treatment. In an animal model of MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), BDNF is produced by immune cells and is responsible for reducing axonal loss. BDNF is present in MS lesions and may play a protective role in lesion pathogenesis. Studies of exogenously administered BDNF have been limited by its short serum half-life and poor blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration so we conducted studies using genetically engineered bone marrow stem cells to deliver BDNF in EAE. BDNF reduced inflammation and neurodegeneration and our observations have been confirmed by Linker et al (4) using a lentivirus delivery system. Together these studies suggest that BDNF treatment reduces inflammation and neurodegeneration in EAE.  In 2010 Jang et al. reported that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) has potent BDNF agonist activity, can be given orally and readily crosses the BBB. In cultured neurons it activated the receptor for BDNF, TrkB, and downstream signaling. It protected wild-type, but not TrkB-deficient neurons from apoptosis. DHF activated TrkB in the mouse brain, inhibited kainic acid-induced neurotoxicity, decreased infarct volumes in experimental murine stroke in a TrkB-dependent manner, and was neuroprotective in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. Not all DHF effects are TrkB dependent: DHF has anti-inflammatory activity that is NFKB dependent and antioxidant effects that could reduce inflammatory injury. We tested DHF in MOG-induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice and showed that treatment resulted in reduced clinical and pathological severity even when treatment was delayed until the onset of symptoms. Together these results support further studies of DHF as a possible treatment for MS.  Based on the results outlined above, there are at least four possible mechanisms through with DHF could reduce the severity of EAE: It could reduce inflammatory injury through its antioxidant activity, i could reduce inflammation through a non-TrkB mediated pathway, it could reduce inflammation through a TrkB mediated effect on inflammatory cells or it could have a direct TrkB mediated protective effect on neuronal cells. We propose the following Primary Hypothesis: DHF treatment of MOG-induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice reduces the clinical and pathological severity of disease. We propose the following Secondary Hypothesis: DHF treatment of MOG-induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice reduces disease severity by a TrkB dependent mechanism. We will test these hypotheses by completing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim #1: Optimize DHF dosing of C57Bl/6 mice with MOG-induced EAE. Specific Aim #2: Determine the effect of DHF treatment started at the time of symptom onset on CNS inflammation, immunity, demyelination, axonal loss and apoptosis in the MOG-induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice.  Specific Aim #3: Determine the effect of DHF treatment started on day 50 on CNS inflammation, immunity, demyelination, axonal loss and apoptosis in MOG-induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice.  Specific Aim #4: Determine whether the effect of DHF in MOG-induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice is TrkB dependent by determining the sensitivity of the TrkBF616A knock-in C57Bl/6 mouse to the effects of DHF in mice with and without functioning TrkB.  Confirming our hypotheses will provide important new information about the effects of DHF treatment in a model of MS and could provide a rationale for studies of DHF in MS patients."
"9395953","Project Summary Candidate: Dr. Slogrove is unwaveringly committed to a career focused on finding solutions to maternal and child health challenges in low-middle income countries (LMIC). She ultimately envisions herself globally as a leader in HIV exposed uninfected (HEU) child research and locally as the leader of a rural maternal and child health research unit. Dr. Slogrove?s 5-year career development plan is focused on three specific areas: 1) to develop advanced epidemiologic skills building on doctoral and post-doctoral studies in epidemiology; 2) to strengthen leadership ability; 3) to expand maternal health expertise complementing pediatric specialist training to comprehensively research the maternal-child dynamic. This will be achieved through drawing on the strengths of four leading institutions with strong collaborative ties, Stellenbosch University, University of Cape Town, Columbia University and Harvard. Dr. Slogrove has assembled a highly experienced mentorship team combining expertise in maternal and child HIV clinical research with public health, epidemiology and biostatistics. Research: This study aims to understand epidemiologically whether HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) and whether this represents a pathway to adverse maternal, birth and HEU infant outcomes. The specific aims are to determine: 1) whether maternal HIV and antenatal ART are associated with HDP; 2) the contribution of HDP in HIV-infected women to adverse maternal and birth outcomes; 3) the contribution of maternal morbidity and mortality and adverse birth outcomes to HEU neonatal and infant morbidity and mortality. This early career award study will be integrated within the NICHD-funded B-POSITIVE study, comprehensively evaluating the universal maternal ART strategy at a population level in the entire Western Cape Province of South Africa. Provincial surveillance through harmonization of existing provincial electronic routine data sources is combined with sentinel-site activities to investigate population trends in greater depth. This presents a unique opportunity to interrogate pathways of HEU infant vulnerability in a population where 19% of infants are in utero HIV and ART exposed. The current application utilizes the B-POSITIVE electronic harmonized data platform to evaluate the specific aims at a population level in the entire cohort of pregnant women in the Western Cape for a 2-year period (N?190,000) and in greater depth at two sentinel sites (N?17,000). Mediation analysis will be used to understand whether the adverse birth outcomes associated with antenatal ART are partly mediated by increased HDP and in turn whether they partly mediate neonatal and infant morbidity and mortality. This study will rapidly determine in an entire population whether widely used antenatal ART regimens are associated with HDP and whether this represents a pathway to adverse maternal and birth outcomes leading to excess HEU infant morbidity and mortality. Establishing the safety of ART during pregnancy is of critical public health importance for the 30% of pregnant South African women who are HIV-infected."
"9337258","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder that has an incidence rate of about 1.1% among all malignancies and constitutes 12-13% of hematologic malignancies in the US. The epidemiology is similar in our veteran population and includes a 3-fold higher prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a premalignant lesion, in African American veterans. Renal dysfunction, determined by serum creatinine elevation = 1.3 mg/dl, is frequently (about 48%) associated with MM, and an increase in the serum creatinine concentration beyond 2.0 mg/dl portends a poor prognosis. One large study concluded that reversibility of renal function was a more important prognostic factor than response to chemotherapy. Recent work has shown that monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) produced in multiple myeloma are biologically active proteins that generate intracellular oxidative stress in the proximal tubule and promote significant changes in epithelial cell biology.  The working hypothesis of this renewal application is that monoclonal FLCs promote a pro- fibrotic state in the kidney by generating oxidative stress in the proximal tubule.  Three aims wil be pursued:    Aim 1. Define the mechanism of FLC-induced release of HMGB1 by the proximal tubular epithelium. Hypothesis: release of HMGB1, an Alarmin, is mediated through activation of the JAK2/STAT1 pathway by oxidative stress.  Aim 2. Determine the mechanism of FLC-induced production of Interleukin (IL)-1ß by proximal tubular epithelium. Hypothesis: monoclonal FLCs promote a noncanonical inflammasome pathway-mediated activation of IL-1ß in proximal tubular epithelium.  Aim 3. Determine how monoclonal FLCs promote renal fibrosis through TGF-ß in vivo. Hypothesis: monoclonal FLCs promote tubulointerstitial fibrosis by activation of TGF-ß through the production of IL-1ß.  The proposal will use in vitro and in vivo models to characterize the pathomechanisms by which human monoclonal FLC generate pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic growth factors that induce tubulointerstitial renal fibrosis. The lon-term goal of this proposal is to shift clinical practice paradigms in the management of progressive renal failure occurring in the setting of MM, by exploring novel theoretical concepts to devise strategies that limit the development of chronic kidney disease and thereby improve outcomes in MM."
"9324966","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Podocyte cytoskeletal injury is characterized by dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling and increased podocyte motility, which correlate with podocyte foot process (FP) collapse and the emergence of albuminuria. Our laboratory showed that increased podocyte motility is mediated by TRPC5, an ion channel our laboratory introduced a few years ago as an important Ca2+ influx pathway in podocytes. Based on our recent work, TRPC5 channels play an important role in the emergence of albuminuria in acute models of disease. However, little is known about the role of podocyte TRPC5 signaling in the chronicity of acquired glomerular disease such as FSGS, which is the focus of this proposal. Understanding the mechanistic steps involving TRPC5 activity and how to block it is important for the many children and adults with de novo idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (such as FSGS), for the devastating cases of recurrence of FSGS post-transplantation and for the millions of patients with albuminuria and FSGS in the setting of diabetes and hypertension. Unfortunately, we presently lack effective treatment for these patients, so there is tremendous unmet need in this therapeutic area. Here we propose a series of detailed in vivo studies to test the hypothesis that blocking TRPC5 channels using a small molecule inhibitor can prevent progression to FSGS and kidney failure."
"9338345","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of The West Africa-Michigan CHARTER II for GEOHealth is to build upon long- standing, extensive occupational and environmental health (OEH) research and training collaborations between academic and government partner institutions in Ghana, as well as other countries of West Africa (WA), and the University of Michigan (UM; lead of current U2R application) so as to sustainably enhance capacity for world-class scientific research and research training which address and inform key national and regional occupational and environmental health priorities and policies. We will leverage numerous existing strengths among consortium partners, who include the University of Ghana (UG; lead of linked U01 application, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), the Ghanaian Ministry of Health/Ghana Health Service (MOH/GHS), and UM to create a dynamic regional hub in EOH. A critical element for a truly regional strategy is to strengthen partnerships across Francophone and Anglophone countries in West Africa region. This is being achieved by strategically linking with the existing West African francophone-based Community of Practice in Eco-Health for West and Central Africa (COPEH-WCA) through their Ecohealth Chair based at the University of Abomey-Calavi (UAC) in Benin (also involved are Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, and Sénégal), which is funded by Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), as well as through linking with McGill University (North American partner in a bilingual environment with long-standing history of OEH practice in West Africa). In addition, our program will benefit from the active input of key leaders from the University of KwaZulu Natal (UKZN), who has extensive experience in working in close coordination with the program leadership at UM to build regional OEH capacity in the Southern African Development Community. Project management, ongoing evaluation, and key decision-making for the two closely linked U01 research and U2R research training grant, will reside with the Administrated Oversight Committee (AOC), which will include among its members representatives from the US (UM), Canada (McGill), Ghana (UG, KNUST, and MOH/GHS), Benin (UAC, also representing COPEH-WCA), and South Africa (UKZN). With a specific research activities (mainly exposure assessments) focused on OEH-threats associated with work activities in the informal sector (primary focus: electronic waste; secondary focus: small-scale gold mining and informal transportation-related ambient air pollution), the plan holds great promise of tangibly improving EOH-related research practice and training, and increasing scientific knowledge, and technical ability in Ghana, and, at the same time, improving prevailing products, processes, and policies to create outcomes of improved effectiveness, affordability, accessibility, and superior scalability throughout West Africa."
"9171453","Since 1996, the Neuropathology Core (NPC) of the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center (BU ADC) has conducted cutting-edge research on the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, the NPC directed groundbreaking research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), research that revolutionized public health by identifying repetitive brain trauma as a major risk factor for neurodegeneration, including CTE (6-27). During the last funding cycle, the NPC published preliminary criteria for the neuropathological diagnosis of CTE (9), criteria that are in the process of being validated by a NINDS funded UO1 panel of expert neuropathologists from other ADRCs and academic centers and will eventually be incorporated into NIA-AA guidelines (27). One of the major outcomes from NPC research has been the recognition that some of the clinical symptoms of CTE can be very similar to AD, raising the possibility that some subjects clinically diagnosed with AD dementia may, in fact, have CTE. Our studies have also found beta amyloid (Aß) deposition in 52% of individuals diagnosed pathologically with CTE (17) and that the presence of Aß in CTE is significantly associated with increased clinical severity and tau and alpha-synuclein pathology. Ongoing research also indicates that changes of CTE are a common co-morbidity in ADC and other neurodegenerative disease brain banks (26). These advances suggest a dynamic synergism between CTE and AD pathobiology, and highlight the importance of studying the effects of repetitive brain trauma on the development of AD. The overarching goals of the NPC are to conduct and foster research on AD and to determine the relationship of AD and other neurodegenerative pathology to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and CTE. The specific aims of the NPC consist of fundamental Core functions, namely to perform state-of-the-art diagnostic neuropathology, optimally store and distribute CNS tissue and other biospecimens, and provide neuropathological data to the other cores of the BU ADC and to NACC. The specific aims also build upon the significant innovations of the NPC with regard to CTE and focus on determining the relationship of RHI to AD and CTE. Over the past cycle, there have been substantial increases in funding and personnel, including 2 new MD, PhD neuropathologists, as well as large increases in infrastructure and equipment. These expansions have stimulated major technical innovations in qualitative and quantitative neuropathology. Other advances of the NPC include developing biomarkers for AD, CTE and related disorders, expanding the collection of CNS tissue to include spinal cord, eyes, plasma, serum and CSF, and increased collection of control tissues. To accomplish these aims, the NPC will continue to work in close collaboration with the other BU ADC Cores, other ADCs and ADRCs."
"9355686","The Clinical Outcomes/Biobehavioral Technology Core (CBC) of the Kansas Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (KIDDRC) is designed to provide expertise and assistance to investigators on the quantitative assessment of behavioral, biological, or psychosocial processes that is particularly critical to intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) research programs. The assessments employed in KIDDRC?s longstanding emphasis on biobehavioral research extends across many levels of measurement, from the biological (neuroimaging, psychophysiology) to the behavioral (granular behavioral measures, cognitive assessments, and detailed observational protocols). Progress in the generation and implementation of such measures moves forward rapidly. The CBC is designed to assist investigators in areas where such progress outstrips researchers? ability to keep up with such advances, to assist investigators who want to add measures to their projects on which they do not have sufficient expertise, or to provide the means for enhancing data collection with new technology. The CBC is designed to meet the specialized needs of our research themes; the translational research found in themes 1 and 2 rely on the proper use, automation, and adaptation of methods for assessing brain-based and behavioral outcomes that form the fundamental basis for the interdisciplinary work that characterizes the KIDDRC?s portfolio. The CBC will also serves as a resource for researchers from themes 3 or 4 who are looking to extend behavioral outcomes from preclinical models to human participants, thus contributing to the translational mission of the KIDDRC. The objective of the CBC is to provide high quality, cost-effective support to KIDDRC research programs requiring quantitative measurement of human neurobehavioral and behavioral outcomes, as well as biological correlates. This will be achieved by providing services for designing and programming new protocols to address unsolved problems in human translational research, providing training and skills necessary for developing software for biobehavioral, behavioral, and psychosocial measurements for KIDDRC principal investigators (PIs), and by allowing investigators access to knowledge resources on research strategies and solutions, new approaches and technologies, and training in biobehavioral measurement techniques.  "
"9381638","Abstract The promises of precision medicine leading to healthier lives, free of the burden of cardiovascular diseases, will be hastened by creating timely, efficient, and effective scientific conduits that rapidly move newly characterized molecular genetic information between genetic epidemiologists and functional biologists. Within the setting of 2 international consortia on the genetics of hemostasis phenotypes and venous thromboembolism (VTE), a network of genetic epidemiologists have successfully collaborated to identify and to replicate novel associations of loci with VTE and thrombosis-related phenotypes, a few of which have undergone functional testing. The goals of this project are 2-fold: (a) to coordinate and advance new genetic discovery in the setting of the 2 international consortia on hemostasis phenotypes (Cohorts for Health and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology [CHARGE] Consortium) and VTE (International Network of Venous Thrombosis [INVENT] Consortium); and (b) to follow-up the discoveries with functional biology work conducted by laboratory-based research using cell and animal models that will provide new biologic insights. The CHARGE Hemostasis Working Group coordinates genomic discovery in key hemostasis-related phenotypes from 42 studies and the INVENT consortium coordinates genomic discovery in the VTE phenotype from 12 studies. The genetic discoveries made thus far have provided new biologic insights to the regulation of key hemostasis proteins and VTE risk in genes not previously known to be involved biologically, such as STXBP5 and TC2N, associated with von Willebrand factor and VTE, and TSPAN15 and SLC44A2, associated with VTE. A growing limitation to our scientific productivity has been the challenge of replication: as more studies join consortia for discovery, fewer studies are available for replication. An alternative approach, which accelerates scientific discovery, is to move discoveries that have been prioritized by bioinformatics resources directly to functional testing in the laboratory. Another challenge to new discovery has been the lack of analytic tools that are practical in the consortia setting to analyze across phenotypes in discovery efforts. Recently, however, new approaches that use genetic correlations to facilitate multi-phenotype investigations have emerged and can now be applied using hemostasis phenotypes. In this application, we apply these new approaches to advance genetic and functional discovery and validation efforts via 3 aims. Each aim contains novel work to be accomplished in the proposed 4-year project leverages existing and soon-to-be released genomic resources to achieve the overall goal of characterizing functional physiologic diversity that leads to clinical thrombosis in humans."
"9308703","DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): If poorer families with children aged from 3 to 8 want larger and better dwelling units, then for a constant housing budget they will likely have to locate in worse neighborhoods with worse schools because rents are lower there. If the same families seek better neighborhoods or schools, then this will likely entail a smaller or otherwise worse unit because rents are higher in these better locations. This trade-off motivates the proposed study. It has three aims: (1) To understand the kinds of housing options available to families of different racial/ethnic and income groups, whose housing options are also likely to entail systematic variation in the quality of neighborhoods and schools; (2) To learn how these housing options and their links to neighborhoods and schools jointly affect the socioemotional development, academic achievement and health of children aged from 3 to 8 over a period of 40 months. This will allow us to conclude which combinations of housing, neighborhood and school quality best support positive child development. (3) We will also learn which specific combinations of housing, neighborhoods and schools families actually prefer to live in and thus the extent to which these preferences entail the best possible developmental outcomes for children of a given family income.  The proposed study takes place in Cleveland, Dallas, Denver and Seattle, all chosen because they use a lottery to distribute their Section 8 housing vouchers and because they also differ on other factors that might affect how housing trade-offs impact on children - e.g., their racial/ethnic mix, the tightness of the private market for rental housing, ad how hard the foreclosure crisis hit. We seek to identify patterns of housing availability, child effects and housing preferences that are robust across cities. These provide the best foundations for future research and policy.  A three-wave longitudinal survey will be conducted over 40 months. It will have two strata. The first is a randomly selected stratum of families in each city whose income is below the area median and who have at least one child aged from 3 to 8. The second stratum is of families with the same-aged children who have applied for a housing voucher and been declared eligible. Half will win a voucher and half not, with random deletion being used to prune study and control children to the numbers desired by our power analyses-- 3,450 children and 2,654 caregivers across strata and half of this in each of the separate strata.  The child outcomes at three time points are: internalizing and externalizing behaviors, performance on math and reading tests and obesity.  The analysis of Aim 1 depends on hedonic regressions that predict housing costs from attributes of dwelling units, neighborhoods and schools. Aim 2 uses propensity scores with the general stratum and random assignment as an instrumental variable with the housing voucher stratum. Aim 3 depends on a vignette experiment that varies three attributes for each of housing, neighborhood and school quality."
"9332417","PROJECT ABSTRACT The proposed K01 award will provide Dr. Martinez with the support necessary to achieve her immediate training goals: 1) to gain expertise in pediatric sleep science and measurement to complement her strong training in nutrition and physical activity, 2) to increase understanding of child growth and development as it relates to energy balance, and 3) to advance her skills in research design to plan an RCT. This training will provide her with the skills necessary to establish her independent research program. To achieve these goals, Dr. Martinez has assembled a team of mentors with relevant expertise to fill the gaps of her research experience. Her mentoring team includes: Dr. Ronald Dahl, with expertise in pediatric sleep; Dr. Sheila Gahagan, with expertise in child growth and development; Dr. Jeanne Tschann, with expertise in Latino family dynamics, study implementation, recruitment and retention specifically in Latino families; Dr. Nancy Butte, with expertise in pediatric obesity and metabolism; and Dr. Patricia Crawford, with expertise in community nutrition and clinical trials and a track record of excellent mentorship. With this K01 award, Dr. Martinez will achieve her long-term goal to become an independent investigator conducting energy-balance related research on how to reduce chronic disease in underserved Latino children. Individuals of Mexican descent comprise the largest proportion of the Latino population in the United States and they suffer high rates of obesity. An improved understanding of the underlying behavioral mechanisms by which short sleep duration may impact obesity among Mexican American children is critical to prevent and/or reduce obesity and chronic disease in this population. Dr. Martinez's research will focus on: behavioral mechanisms (i.e., diet and physical activity) that link sleep duration to obesity (Aim 1). These relationships will be examined in an existing data set of Mexican American 8-10-year-olds (n=323). For Aim 2 and Aim 3, data will be collected in a new sample of Mexican American 8-10-year-olds to examine: 1) contextual factors (i.e., bedtime routines, sleep hygiene, familism) that may impact sleep (Aim 2); and 2) the impact of prior night's sleep duration on diet and physical activity the subsequent day (Aim 3). This research will be used to plan a randomized control intervention to promote optimal sleep, healthy eating and physical activity among Mexican American children, to be proposed in a R34 grant application before the end of the K01 award."
"9339519","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Alzheimer's disease is associated with two main types of abnormalities in the brain, plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Our lab, like most labs trying to develop new treatments for Alzheimer's disease, has focused on the plaques up to this point. Based on a number of recently completed studies, we are proposing to shift our focus to the neurofibrillary tangles. Based on preliminary evidence that brain levels of copper affect the development of neurofibrillary tangles, the hypothesis is specifically focused on the relationship between copper and tangles.         OBJECTIVES: 1) We will determine if copper can act directly on the precursor of the tangle, a brain protein named tau. 2) We will determine if the individuals baseline level of copper affects their ability to respond to the treatment, 3) we will determine if copper has an effect on the type of tau associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease or the type of tau associated with some forms of hereditary frontotemporal dementia. 4) we will determine if a treatment which prevents protein misfolding can be used to enhance the effects of copper modulating therapy.         PLAN: Experiments will be conducted in mice which are genetically engineered to express aspects of Alzheimer's pathology. Mice will be given treatments that raise or lower brain copper levels, and the effects on tangle pathology and memory function will be measured.         METHODS: Standardized tests of mouse behavior, brain concentrations of disease- associated proteins, tests of cognitive function.         FINDINGS TO DATE: Copper seems to increase tau phosphorylation and worsen memory in mice with neurofibrillary tangles.         CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These experiments are designed to lead to clinical trials of copper-lowering treatment for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.         RELEVANCE TO THE VA'S MISSION: Development of safe, effective therapies for Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia is within the VA mission. Since neurofibrillary tangles are also seen in traumatic brain injury (TBI), this work may have additional relevance to the VA mission."
"9240423","Project Summary/Abstract Title: Gender identity and own body perception ? implications for the neurobiology of gender dysphoria Individuals with gender dysphoria (GD) experience a stark contrast between their gender identity and their gender assigned at birth. These individuals discover, early in development or later in life, that their body is incongruent with their gender identity. Persistent desire for the physical characteristics and social roles of the other sex contributes to dysphoria. Public awareness of the diversity of gender experience is rising, and issues of those with GD related to self-identity, body image, and medical interventions are becoming more openly discussed across the globe. As this is occurring, more and more individuals are considering, or actually undergoing, treatments to alter their hormones and physical body in attempt to better conform to their gender identity. These interventions, termed medical gender (identity) confirming interventions include gender confirming or sex reassignment surgery and cross sex hormone treatment. Many individuals will obtain these costly, usually irreversible, invasive, and sometimes risky measures to address incongruence between their gender identity and their body. This is quickly becoming a critical global health issue; yet there is very little understanding of what developmental, neurobiological, and sociocultural factors contribute to GD, and who may or may not benefit from these procedures, including those who experience gender ambiguity rather than dysphoria. However, studies of brain structure have found abnormalities in cerebral midline structures, and recent studies found differences in functional connectivity within resting state networks associated with self- referential thinking, as well as differences in the functional neural circuitry related to body perception. The purpose of this study is to address core symptoms of GD?dissatisfaction and estrangement from the own body, and self-referential thinking?by using behavioral experiments and functional and structural neuroimaging to investigate the cerebral networks mediating own body perception in individuals with GD compared to cis- sexual controls, and how they relate to subjective body self-incongruence. We will also investigate the longitudinal effects of estrogen and testosterone treatment on brain functional connections and body phenotype, and how brain structure/function, body phenotype, and hormones pre-treatment may predict who will benefit in terms of improvement of dysphoria and quality of life. As an exploratory aim we will investigate a novel body-morph visual processing task in its reliability and validity for research and clinical use. Studying individuals in both Sweden and the United States will additionally allow us to investigate the effect of stress related to differential cultural stigmatization of non-conforming gender roles. This study will provide valuable information on the neurobiological underpinning of GD and the effects of sex hormones, and promises to uncover functional or structural neural patterns that could predict outcome in terms of body image and quality of life after cross-sex hormone treatment, which ultimately could be used to assist in medical decision-making."
"9389872","The search for molecular targets/pathways that can be manipulated to improve bone properties is a highly active area of investigation. Recently, particular interest has been expressed in targeting biomolecules that can augment mechanical signaling in bone; the next generation of osteoporosis drugs is likely to work in conjunction with physical activity/loading in order to disproportionately direct new bone formation to skeletal areas that need it most (i.e., those regions that endure the greatest strains and are at the greatest risk of failure). The WNT signaling pathway has emerged as a key regulator of bone mass and strength, but also of bone cell mechanotransduction. Recent work by Professor Wim van Hul in Antwerp and by Novartis Pharma in Basel identified an accessory protein?LRP4?that regulates the activity of SOST, which is a secreted inhibitor of the WNT co-receptors LRP5/LRP6. Specific missense mutations in LRP4 cause high bone mass (HBM) phenotypes by eliminating SOST-mediated inhibition of LRP5/LRP6. The goal of the present application is to understand precisely how LRP4, LRP5, and LRP6 function to regulate bone metabolism and mechanotransduction, which ultimately will reveal new approaches for preventing or treating bone disorders?a primary mission of NIAMS/NIH. Among the key questions we addressed are: (1) Is the principal role of LRP4 in bone to bind SOST? (2) Does LRP4 directly present SOST to LRP5/LRP6 or simply increase local concentration of this inhibitor? (3) Does LRP4 function throughout osteoprogenitor differentiation, or does it have stage-specific roles? (4) Does LRP4 regulate LRP5 and LRP6 equally, or is LRP4 more important for one of these two WNT co-receptors? (5) Will bone-specific deletion/inhibition of LRP4 prevent the bone-wasting effects of mechanical disuse? (6) Does LRP4 coordinate the deposition of new bone to high-strain surfaces during mechanical loading? (7) Do LRP5 and LRP6 differ in terms of when (early vs. late in differentiation) and where (cortical vs. trabecular envelopes) they are active? (8) Which upstream and downstream mechanical signaling pathways will be identified in specific bone cell subtypes using single-cell transcriptomics of loaded and unloaded bone? We will use cutting-edge, novel, mouse models (CRISPR-based Lrp4 and Lrp6 knockins), single-cell transcriptomic approaches (Drop-seq and 10XGenomics), live cell microscopic techniques (FRET/FLIM), mechanotransduction models (strain mapping in ulnar loading and tail suspension), and radiographic/histologic/biochemical approaches to reveal the underlying biology and therapeutic potential of LRP4, LRP5, and LRP6 manipulation in bone tissue. The project is a continuation of the close collaboration between the Robling (Indiana Univ.) and Warman (Harvard Univ.) labs, an extremely fruitful partnership for more than 12 yrs. We have assembled a unique combination of expertise, resources, biological models/tools, and technical innovation to elucidate the role of LRP4 in bone biology."
"9357365","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background: Hibernating myocardium is viable, persistently dysfunctional myocardium that occurs in response to continuing or repetitive ischemia and is characterized by hypoperfusion without evidence of necrosis. Our group has successfully established a reproducible swine model of hibernating myocardium and has studied this model extensively. As an extension of this work, we have now established a novel method whereby (a) we perform off-pump single vessel bypass surgery with survival to revascularize ischemic myocardium, (b) we test the time course of recovery from hibernating myocardium following revascularization, and (c) we test the efficacy of supplementation with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a known cardioprotectant, as an aid to recovery following revascularization. Methods: In a swine model of hibernating myocardium, surgical revascularization (versus sham operation) will be performed using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to bypass the chronically obstructed left anterior descending (LAD) artery using a beating heart, off-pump technique, which is identical to the clinical technique. At 12 and 16 weeks, a prebypass and postbypass multi-detector computer tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be obtained to determine LIMA patency, recovery of regional wall thickening, recovery of subendocardial perfusion, and contractile function. Also, studies of the recovery induced by surgical revascularization of hibernating include myocardial blood flow, mitochondrial bioenergetics and respiration, and protein alterations, which will be simultaneously analyzed at the terminal study to more accurately, understand the spectrum of myocardial functional recovery. Aims: The aim of this study is to characterize the time course of recovery from hibernating myocardium following successful revascularization. Furthermore, this study will examine the potential for pharmacological intervention in the form of coenzyme Q10. This study will evaluate the effects of revascularization and CoQ10 on mitochondrial function, protein expression, and antioxidant status as well as improvement of physiological parameters such as cardiac strain, ejection fraction, and regional blood flow. Conclusion: Clinical understanding of potential recovery of hibernating myocardium is limited by the lack of an appropriate animal model to identify and test alleged markers predicting benefit with surgery. Adaptations to hibernation are complex and involve alterations in the bioenergetics and proteome of the mitochondria that allow the tissue to maintain its viability while sacrificing myocardial function. Hibernating myocardium appears to have dynamic proteomic responses to persistent ischemic stress, which has similarities to the global changes in energy substrate metabolism and function seen in advanced heart failure. These proteomic changes may limit oxidative injury and apoptosis and impact functional recovery after revascularization. We believe that hibernating myocardium is an adaptation to promote survival but at the expense of contractility. Clinically, revascularization of hibernating myocardium results in a wide spectrum of outcomes from near total recovery of function to dense infarction. The time course of recovery following revascularization as well as the efficacy of pharmacological intervention have not been characterized and the mechanisms by which the heart recovers remain unknown."
"9460888","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV has made major progress in resource rich settings where transmission has been reduce to less than 2% with use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and avoidance of breastfeeding. In resource limited settings where breastfeeding is crucial for infant survival, interventions are aimed at providing antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis during pregnancy, labor/delivery and then throughout breastfeeding. This will potentially expose the fetus and infant to as long as 24 months of antiretroviral drugs during a period of rapid brain and physical growth. Although shorter term prenatal and peripartum exposure has been found to generally safe based on studies in the US and Europe, there are concerns that longer term exposures may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction in end organs such as the brain or bone. Given that there are major plans to upscale PMTCT worldwide, it is important to carefully assess the impact of these ARV interventions on child development and growth.  We propose to conduct a longitudinal cohort study to compare neurodevelopmental (ND), neurocognitive (NC), hematologic and growth outcomes of HIV and ARV exposed uninfected infants as well as their growth over 60 months and hematologic parameters; to a control group of non HIV non ARV exposed children from similar socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. The study will co-enroll HIV ARV exposed uninfected infants from the PROMISE PMTCT trial in Blantyre Malawi and Kampala Uganda. Control healthy children matched for age, and gender will be recruited from well child and acute care clinics at the sites where the PROMISE infants have been enrolled. ND measures that have validated in these settings will be assessed at 12 and 24 months using the Mullens Test, and NC testing using the Kaufman ABC at 60 months; while neurologic status, hematologic (CDC) and growth (height, weight, head and upper mid arm circumference will be gathered annually. Maternal and caretaker education, home environment assessments will also be adjusted for in the analyses. The main independent variable of interest is duration of ARV exposure both in utero and postnatally during breastfeeding.  This study will provide important data to policy makers and researchers on whether extended in utero and post partum ARV exposure among HIV and ARV exposed uninfected infants is associated with long term sequelae in terms of ND, bone marrow suppression or physical growth. This in turn will help inform PMTCT policies."
"9339477","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The successful translation of tissue engineering therapies into clinical application that will benefit veterans requires overcoming a number of technical, biological and surgical challenges. The volume of tissue that can be engineered is limited by the extent to which stable blood vessels can be stimulated to form. An extensive, stable blood supply is required to meet mass transport demands in the new tissues and most methods are optimized for engineering tissues in small volume pre-clinical models. We have shown that implantation of a chamber containing model tissue engineering therapies against the periosteum can lead to the generation of three-dimensional vascularized bone of clinically appropriate shape and volume.4 This technique has been translated into clinical application but required an autologous source of bone for the chamber components. Broad application of this approach requires the identification of alternative, non- autologous tissue sources. Tissue engineering has the potential to provide alternative sources for chamber components.  In our previous MERIT grant we investigated and optimized the design of porous hydrogel scaffolds for vascularized tissue formation. In the previous cycle we developed techniques for polymer synthesis and design, evaluated vascularization and cellular response to these biomaterial scaffolds in vitro, in vivo, and in silio, and investigated new imaging techniques for the evaluation of tissue engineering strategies. These studies illustrate our ability to promote and influence vascular ingrowth into engineered tissues. Challenges remain in regards to achieving vascular ingrowth sufficient for engineering large volumes of bone, coordinating vascularization and bone formation and engineering complex structures suitable for clinical application. The broad goals of this proposal are to 1) investigate and optimize the design of biosignal-embedded poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels for engineering vascularized bone and 2) apply these materials for engineering vascularized bone for reconstruction of large, complex craniofacial defects. In order to achieve our goals we will complete the following specific aims: Objective 1: Investigate and optimize the generation of gradients scaffolds for stimulating vascularized tissue invasion into porous hydrogels. Objective 2: Investigate porous hydrogel systems for coordination of vascularization and bone formation in porous hydrogels in vitro and in vivo. Objective 3: Develop topological optimization methods for applying the clinically-translatable large animal model to engineer vascularized bone of appropriate volume and structure for clinical application.  This is an ambitious proposal focused on the optimization of techniques that will bring new reconstructive techniques closer to the clinic."

"9332454","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in myotubularin cause X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a devastating congenital muscle disorder causing severe muscle weakness and premature death from respiratory muscle failure. Only supportive, palliative care is available. We have shown that AAV-mediated gene replacement rescued severe muscle weakness in myotubularin-deficient mice. New data show that a single systemic treatment with rAAV-MTM1 sufficed for long-term (at least one year) survival and essentially complete amelioration of symptoms of mice with myotubularin-deficient muscles. However, for eventual therapy of XLMTM patients, it is imperative to employ a predictive large animal model to refine the delivery system, assess critical safety parameters such as the potential host immune response to vector and transgene, and optimize efficacy measurements. We, therefore, developed a breeding colony in which affected male dogs display a phenotype directly analogous to human XLMTM. In preliminary studies we confirmed that local gene replacement therapy, delivered intramuscularly in the hind limb of young dogs, improved both function and pathology in myotubularin-deficient skeletal muscles. Moreover, the first XLMTM dog in which rAAV-MTM1 was delivered systemically maintained nearly normal strength in all four limbs, and normal respiratory function for more than 6 months surviving > 4 months longer than any untreated mutant dog in our colony. The positive observations in the murine and canine models drive us to focus on the development of systemic rAAV-MTM1 gene therapy. We hypothesize that modest levels of myotubularin will suffice to sustain long-term functionality of striated muscles throughout the body, including the vital respiratory muscles. We propose to utilize the canine system to test this hypothesis and to optimize vector selection (Aim 1) and dosing (Aim 2), while assessing potential safety concerns. Towards this end our Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Test systemic MTM1 gene replacement in the canine model using a novel rAAV vector (serotype 2i8) engineered for effective delivery to skeletal muscle while avoiding the liver Aim 2. Determine dose-response relationships for safety, efficacy, and immune response parameters over a period of at least 32 weeks after systemic MTM1 gene replacement in young XLMTM dogs"
"9533821","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The increasing occurrence of antimicrobial-resistance in infectious diseases poses a serious threat to human health, and demands the development of new antimicrobial therapies. The indispensable methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway to isoprenoids comprises seven enzymatic targets in a wide variety of pathogens, including greater than half of bacterial pathogens prioritized by the CDC as serious or urgent threats to public health. Despite this, only the IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has advanced through clinical evaluation, highlighting the lack of clinically useful agents targeting this pathway. Our research seeks new approaches to block essential isoprenoid production in human pathogens. The proposed studies will focus on under-developed targets in the MEP pathway, including the first step catalyzed by thiamin diphosphate-dependent 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase, and the fifth step catalyzed by cyclodiphosphate synthase IspF. A third area of research will focus on targeting flux through early stage isoprenoid biosynthesis. We will take multidisciplinary approaches to: 1) delineate the unique aspects of DXP synthase catalysis and conformational dynamics that can be exploited for selective inhibitor design, 2) examine a putative feed-forward regulatory mechanism for MEcDP production by IspF as a potential new antimicrobial target, and 3) develop strategies to inhibit flux through the early steps of the MEP pathway using simple substrate analogs. Our research is expected to build our knowledge of the unique enzyme behaviors that represent potential points for pharmacologic intervention, which could lead to the development of new antimicrobial therapies."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We aim to develop molecular imaging agents for hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that effectively access the intracellular environment of malignant tissue and provide insight into the metabolic profile of tumors. A series of 13C-labeled analogs of tricarboxylic cycle intermediates, which exhibit enhanced cell permeability and are effectively metabolized, will be explored. Through chemical synthesis, systematic modification of carboxylic acid functional groups will yield the corresponding biologically cleavable carboxyl moieties and provide probes with the desired properties. These agents will be assessed to determine ideal candidates and subsequently be employed in hyperpolarized 13C MRS studies of tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism in cellular and animal models of prostate cancer. New strategies for molecular probe delivery in hyperpolarized 13C MR spectroscopy will offer unique opportunities for targeting specific aspects of tumor metabolism, which will be of broad importance to medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and medical imaging."
"9380048","There is a critical need to develop interventions to reduce barriers to optimal asthma management and reduce the significant risk for asthma-related morbidity experienced by minority children, especially African- American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma. There are few clinical trials focusing on African-American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma, and intervention studies targeting African-American adolescents with asthma in general or African-American children with poorly controlled asthma in particular are characterized by methodological limitations and/or limited effects on objective health outcomes. Multisystemic Therapy-Health Care (MST-HC) is an intensive, multi-component, home-based psychotherapy that targets the multiple causes of poor adolescent asthma management across individual, family and community systems. In a randomized clinical trial, we showed that MST-HC was significantly more effective than home-based family support in improving adherence to controller medications and improving lung functioning among African- American adolescents with moderate to severe, poorly controlled asthma up to six months after the completion of the intervention. In addition, MST-HC reduced asthma-related hospitalizations and associated ED visits. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to adapt MST-HC for use in real world, public healthcare settings and test it in a T3 translational trial. The new intervention, Reach for Control (RFC), will be housed in a pediatric emergency department (ED) at Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM)and will be adapted for delivery by community health workers (CHWs). The design is an effectiveness-implementation ?Hybrid 1? design where the primary aims are to determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention in a real-world setting, and the secondary aims are to gather information about the context for implementation and barriers/ facilitators to implementation. For our effectiveness aim, we will conduct a randomized effectiveness trial with 170 high risk adolescents with poorly controlled asthma seen in the ED for an asthma exacerbation. RFC will be delivered by Wayne Children's Healthcare Access Program, a community agency providing health care services to underserved children in the Detroit area and will be compared to the agency's standard care intervention for youth with poorly controlled asthma. For our implementation aims, we will evaluate the effectiveness of identification, screening and referral to RFC by ED clinical staff via a clinical pathway. We will study barriers and facilitators to the implementation of RFC (both its integration within the ED and delivery by CHWs) using a mixed methods approach. We will also develop and evaluate an efficient and effective method of measuring CHW fidelity to RFC and conduct a cost analysis that will inform decisions such as treatment dose and CHW caseload in future real-world implementations. If successful, the study has the potential to improve quality of life for a vulnerable population while reducing healthcare costs.  "

"9357580","Project Summary: Prostatic inflammation is a common feature of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and may alter epithelial cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis in BPH through cytokine induction of proinflammatory signaling mediators such as cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). Cox-2 is overexpressed in luminal epithelial cells of BPH tissue but predominantly in regions of chronic inflammation. One clinical trial reported only a short-term benefit of a Cox-2 inhibitor (i.e. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [NSAIDs] such as rofecoxib) in reducing LUTS symptoms when combined with a 5AR inhibitor. The mechanism responsible for the limited clinical effectiveness of Cox-2 inhibition is not known. In the human BPH-1 prostate epithelial cell line (which expresses high basal levels of Cox-2), pharmacologic or molecular ablation of Cox-2 expression limits the protective effects of ERß through selective disruptions in steroidogenic enzyme expression leading to a reduced production of ERß ligands from testosterone. We therefore hypothesize that the limited effectiveness of NSAIDs in current BPH clinical trials is due to disruptions in prostatic steroidogenic pathways that generate ligands for the tissue protective ERß. Four Aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1 will determine the impact of Cox-2 on ERß ligand production in PrECs. Aim 2 will identify genome-wide basal and ERß-regulated gene expression patterns influenced by acute or long-term adaptive responses to Cox-2 overexpression in PrECs. Aim 3 will identify the impact of Cox-2 and ERß on targets relevant to polarized epithelial cell function in 3- dimensional cultures of PrECs and ERß knockout mice. Aim 4 will determine the impact of Cox-2 on ERß signaling in human prostate explants and a rodent model of prostatic inflammation"
"9357579","Project Summary Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common disease conditions in older men. Although BPH is not life threatening, its symptoms significantly impact quality of life and treatment costs over $4 billion annually. Prostatic inflammation is a major factor associated with BPH, which can result in stromal fibrosis and can reduce the integrity of the epithelial barrier by altering cellular junctions. In preliminary studies, we identified the presence of luminal epithelial secretory protein, PSA, in the stromal compartment of BPH nodules. Additionally, we found that adherens junction protein E-cadherin was down-regulated in BPH tissues as well as in a rat model of prostate inflammation. These findings led to our hypothesis that prostate inflammation causes disruption of epithelial cell-cell junctions and/or loss of polarity via E-cadherin down-regulation and subsequently leakage of prostatic secretions such as PSA into the prostatic stroma compartment. We propose to determine the mechanism of PSA leakage into the BPH stroma via accomplishing the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine if cellular junctions in prostatic luminal epithelial cells are altered and associated with PSA leakage into the stromal compartment in BPH specimens; 2) To determine the role of inflammation in increased prostatic epithelial permeability; 3) To determine the effect of E-cadherin knockout/knockdown on cellular junctions and leakage of the prostate epithelial layer. The success of the above specific aims will define changes of luminal epithelial permeability in BPH, lay down a foundation to further explore mechanisms leading to leakage of epithelial secretions into BPH stroma compartment, and uncover the contribution of the epithelial secretion leaked into the stromal compartment to BPH pathogenesis. Defining the mechanisms leading to and consequences of prostatic epithelial leakage may lead to new targets for prevention and/or treatment of BPH/LUTS."
"9359174","The overall aim of this One Health application is to accelerate the development of paramyosin (rSj97) and a newly discovered antigen (rSj68) as vaccines against human and bovine schistosomiasis japonica.  Schistosomiasis, caused by three principle species of dioecious trematodes (flatworms), currently infects over 250 million individuals, results in 1.53 million DALYs lost per annum 1, and contributes to poor health and economic stagnation in endemic areas 2. Although schistosomiasis is effectively treated with praziquantel (PZQ), rapid reinfection with rebound morbidity precludes effective control based on chemotherapy alone and justifies current efforts to develop vaccines for these parasites. Most importantly, Schistosoma japonicum is a zoonosis with domesticated water buffalo (the key labor force for rice farming) suffering from the disease, as well as constituting a critical reservoir for continuing transmission to humans. In our recent work, we show that buffalo residing in our field site in Leyte, the Philippines have a prevalence of infection of 97%- underscoring the importance of these species for transmission to humans.  Paramyosin was originally identified as the parasite target of antibodies generated in mice protectively vaccinated with S. mansoni schistosomula or adult worm extract 3. Our group conducted the pivotal study linking paramyosin and protection in S. japonicum 4. In four independent experiments, vaccination of mice with biochemically purified paramyosin (Sj97) resulted in 62%-86% (all P < 0.001) reduction in worm burden following cercarial challenge. We have conducted extensive immuno-epidemiology studies of Sj97 in a treatment-reinfection cohort of 616 S. japonicum infected individuals 5. We demonstrate a 30 to 41% lower intensity of reinfection (all P < 0.05) after praziquantel treatment in individuals with high Th2/Th1 cytokine ratios measured in PBMCs stimulated with Sj97. In this same cohort, we recently demonstrated that individuals with IgE but not IgG4 responses to rSj97 had a 77% lower intensity of reinfection at 12 months compared to individuals with IgG4 but not IgE responses, even after adjusting for potential confounders (p=0.016) 6.  We identified rSj68 using a novel differential screening approach to identify parasite antigens recognized by antibodies expressed by resistant, but not susceptible children 7. By immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy, rSj68 localizes to the tegument and gastro-dermis of adult male and female worms. In a holoendemic site in the Philippines, individuals with high titer IgE anti-rSj68 had a 58% lower intensity of reinfection over 12 months of follow-up compared to individuals without these antibodies (n=616, P < 0.001).  In the current application, we propose to accelerate the development of paramyosin and rSj68 as vaccines for human and bovine schistosomiasis by conducting safety and efficacy trials in water buffaloes. We will focus our studies on adjuvants that have already been tested and found safe in humans and animals, thus accelerating our development efforts toward a Phase I vaccination study in humans and Phase II studies in bovines.  The deliverables of this program will be an adjuvant optimized, bivalent schistosome vaccine that is ready for human Phase I and bovine Phase II trials with safety data to support an FDA IND application. This vaccine would have a tremendous impact on One Health objectives, including: 1) improved animal health, 2) improved animal productivity, 3) improved farm output, 4) decreased transmission of schistsosomaisis to humans, and 5) improved human health due to both direct (human vaccination) and indirect (buffalo vaccination) effects."
"9323546","PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 35 percent of school-aged children are overweight and 19 percent are obese. This is a nearly five-fold increase in the percentage of obese children since the 1960s. Policy makers are aware of the childhood obesity problem, but developing effective obesity prevention interventions has been challenging. One reason is because weight gain among children is influenced by a complexity of factors. The focus of this study is on attributes of the commercial environment, built environment, and school environment that affect obesity among children and adolescents. The project involves strong quasi-experimental methods and follows a systems approach with the overall objective of generating actionable, policy-relevant information that can be used to prevent childhood obesity. Specifically, the project assesses the effect of access to a healthy diet, exposure to unhealthy food environments, availability of safe areas for vigorous play, and other characteristics of neighborhoods on childhood obesity. The study takes advantage of a unique dataset on the population of Arkansas public schoolchildren. Since 2004, public schools in Arkansas have been taking body mass index screenings. This allows investigators to track childhood weight status from the time children enter kindergarten through 10th grade. The proximity of schoolchildren to different types of food stores, restaurants, playgrounds and other features of the community are being carefully measured in order to determine whether and how much neighborhood characteristics affect obesity. Outcomes of the project will help policymakers better target interventions to those children that are especially at risk for obesity and will help community leaders understand what specific elements of neighborhoods place children at greater risk. Finally, the project is coordinated closely with the Community Development efforts of the project to facilitate coordination of efforts among communities with similar risks and thereby foster the creation of health-focused community systems among educators and health professionals."
"9320964","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome wide association studies have contributed greatly to the understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis through the identification of 110 non-HLA genetic associations and deconstruction of the MHC genomic effects on disease risk. Progress in mapping additional risk-genes for this chronic, debilitating disease of the central nervous system is likely to be immediate. However, all large genetic studies to date have focused on susceptibility and not clinical expression or course of MS; genetic contributors to progression remain to be revealed. We hypothesize that allelic susceptibility variants act within functional networks that confer cumulative physiological effects on the phenotype, and that genetic burdens within distinct functional pathways will be reflected mechanistically in MRI metrics associates with neuronal damage and consequent disability. We propose two main research goals, bridging hypothesis driven genetic experiments with measurable indicators of neuronal loss to identify the genetic underpinnings of clinical progression. Specific Aim 1 describes the development and empirical validation of global genetic burden scoring statistics that incorporate mechanistic annotations for the stratification of patients into functional disease sub-types according to the ontological enrichment of the genetic risk variants each individual carries. Specific Aim 2 takes advantage of novel high-field MRI sequences to describe a limited number of correlated quantitative MRI phenotypes reflecting a specific aspect of the biology of progression, namely grey and white matter volumes of the brain and spinal cord. Although this proposal relies on a variety of ambitious and challenging methodological and analytical approaches, it is important to emphasize that we have extensive experience in clinical, imaging, and laboratory aspects of MS, together with data management, bio-informatics, and statistical analysis. The demonstration of even a modest functional effect of a known gene or group of genes on the course of MS could help elucidate fundamental disease mechanisms and yield a major therapeutic opportunity. Equally exciting is the potential for a better understanding of disease heterogeneity and rational reclassification on the basis of genotype scores, molecular pathways, and shared genetics with other diseases."
"9354371","Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive global health problem and a major source of physical injury and psychological harm to women. It is also increasingly recognized as a significant determinant of poor developmental outcomes among children who witness IPV in early childhood or who are exposed in utero, and pregnancy has been demonstrated to be a period of increased vulnerability to IPV. Prevalence of IPV in Pakistan, as elsewhere in the region, is high yet it is understudied and interventions to prevent or respond to IPV are extremely limited. This project seeks to address the dearth of even formative knowledge needed to provide the basis for effective IPV prevention in this context. Using a rigorous mixed-methods approach, this project will conduct exploratory research designed to a) measure attitudes and perceived norms regarding IPV among male and female community members and female community health workers and b) explore potential culturally-appropriate IPV prevention strategies, including a health-focused intervention targeted at pregnant women and their families and administered through the community health worker infrastructure. Building on a successful collaboration between Columbia University, Duke University, and the Human Development Research Foundation (HDRF) in Islamabad, Pakistan, this project will also have as a key objective the development of capacity within this team, and at HDRF specifically, to conduct in-depth research on the topic of IPV, to develop insights regarding the potential for effective prevention efforts through the extant health care system, and to lay the foundation for successful application for a R01 proposal to formally test the intervention strategies expected to emerge from this project. The combination of exploratory qualitative investigation (focus group discussions) and robust quantitative assessment (individual surveys) using novel instrumentation will enable this project to elicit and better understand both perceptions of and actual IPV attitudes of community members and health workers. It will also facilitate an understanding of the perceived barriers to and opportunities for community-based IPV prevention strategies in rural Pakistan, with relevance for other, comparable settings in which patriarchal norms are still strongly entrenched and programmatic attention to IPV is historically limited."
"9387052","PROJECT SUMMARY: Evidence suggests that the effects of trauma exposure can be transmitted across generations to shape pathways to psychological impairment in offspring, with the perinatal period identified as pivotal to these processes. Although the mechanisms and timing of these effects are not well elucidated, an emerging literature focuses on the influence of maternal posttraumatic stress (PTS) during pregnancy. PTS affects up to 40% of pregnant women, particularly those from low-income, minority populations with documented health disparities. Maternal PTS may interrupt healthy development of biological stress systems in offspring, namely the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, a well-defined biological pathway that is modulated by environmental and genetic factors. Recent studies have begun to link maternal PTS with biobehavioral indicators of stress reactivity in offspring, and these so-called intermediate phenotypes may serve as early markers of stress-related psychopathology, which can emerge in infancy and have cascading and disabling effects across the lifespan. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are hypothesized to play a critical role in influencing these processes. This hypothesis builds on studies, mainly in adults, linking PTS with DNA methylation of genes implicated in HPA axis functionality and candidate gene studies showing effects of maternal trauma exposure on DNA methylation in adult offspring. Notably, pilot data from our lab link maternal PTS during pregnancy with newborn infant DNA methylation of a single gene (FKBP5) implicated in the stress response. No study has yet applied an epigenomic approach, which offers a more holistic and unbiased method of discovery, for examining intergenerational transmission of trauma. We propose an exploratory study to prospectively explore predictive relationships between maternal pregnancy PTS, genome- wide methylation patterns in offspring at birth, multi-level biobehavioral indicators of infant stress reactivity at 6 months (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia, heart rate, cortisol, observed distress), during a laboratory stress challenge, and key elements of the caregiving environment (i.e. observed maternal sensitivity, family support, family stressors), which may moderate these intergenerational effects. We build from extensive pilot work in our laboratory and an established research infrastructure for recruitment and retention. This work, which aligns well with the priorities of the National Institute of Child Health and Development is essential for delineating the origins of stress-related psychopathology and informing the optimal targets and timing for effective preventative interventions."

We will leverage numerous existing strengths among consortium partners, who include the University of Ghana (UG; lead of linked U01 application, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), the Ghanaian Ministry of Health/Ghana Health Service (MOH/GHS), and UM to create a dynamic regional hub in EOH. A critical element for a truly regional strategy is to strengthen partnerships across Francophone and Anglophone countries in West Africa region. This is being achieved by strategically linking with the existing West African francophone-based Community of Practice in Eco-Health for West and Central Africa (COPEH-WCA) through their Ecohealth Chair based at the University of Abomey-Calavi (UAC) in Benin (also involved are Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, and Sénégal), which is funded by Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), as well as through linking with McGill University (North American partner in a bilingual environment with long-standing history of OEH practice in West Africa). In addition, our program will benefit from the active input of key leaders from the University of KwaZulu Natal (UKZN), who has extensive experience in working in close coordination with the program leadership at UM to build regional OEH capacity in the Southern African Development Community. Project management, ongoing evaluation, and key decision-making for the two closely linked U01 research and U2R research training grant, will reside with the Administrated Oversight Committee (AOC), which will include among its members representatives from the US (UM), Canada (McGill), Ghana (UG, KNUST, and MOH/GHS), Benin (UAC, also representing COPEH-WCA), and South Africa (UKZN). With a specific research activities (mainly exposure assessments) focused on OEH-threats associated with work activities in the informal sector (primary focus: electronic waste; secondary focus: small-scale gold mining and informal transportation-related ambient air pollution), the plan holds great promise of tangibly improving EOH-related research practice and training, and increasing scientific knowledge, and technical ability in Ghana, and, at the same time, improving prevailing products, processes, and policies to create outcomes of improved effectiveness, affordability, accessibility, and superior scalability throughout West Africa."
"9337251","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Project Summary/Abstract Speech perception is one of the most important cognitive functions of the brain. Humans use both the auditory information available in the heard speech and the visual information available from viewing the speaker's face to understand speech. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the most popular method for examining human brain function, but suffers from the critical limitation of poor temporal resolution: because it measures  hemodynamic changes, it has only ~sec resolution, rather than the ~ms timescale of neuronal activity. This renders fMRI a poor choice for examining dynamic neuronal processing. Instead, we propose to use electrocorticography (eCog), in which electrodes implanted in human subjects for the treatment of epilepsy are used to directly measure neuronal activity in the human brain. The major innovation of this proposal will be to use eCog to measure the dynamic neural processes underlying audiovisual speech perception. The central hypothesis is that rapid communication occurs between the human superior temporal sulcus (STS) and sensory areas through neural oscillations, specifically frequency-specific interactions between the multisensory cortex in the STS and earlier sensory areas in the auditory and visual cortex. As a measure of functional connectivity between areas in the speech network, we will measure trial-by-trial correlations in gamma-band power between brain areas. We assume that high correlations in gamma- band power reflect information transfer and a functional connection between the areas. Neuronal oscillations, particularly in the gamma range (~ 30 - 200 Hz), have been found to reflect neuronal spiking activity and several studies suggest that neuronal oscillations might be an important mechanism of information transfer in the brain that modulates spiking activity. We will test the hypothesis that gamma-band activity in the STS correlates with gamma-band activity in auditory association areas during multisensory speech perception. In ordinary speech, the auditory speech signal is much more informative than the visual speech signal. Therefore, we hypothesize that for clear audiovisual speech, the correlation in gamma oscillations between auditory cortex and STS is stronger than the correlation in gamma oscillations between visual cortex and STS. Conversely, we expect a stronger correlation between gamma-band activity in the visual cortex and the STS when the auditory speech signal is noisy. The proposed research will make use of direct neural recordings from the human brain to investigate whether the information content of the different speech signals affects the communication between early sensory areas and multisensory associative areas. These findings will help us understand the neuronal dynamics involved in speech perception and devise new therapies to help treat veterans with hearing loss and other disabilities."

A comprehensive set of regulatory events across a genome - the regulome - is needed to make full use of genomic information, but is currently out of reach for practically all clinical applications and many biological systems The proposed Center will develop technologies that greatly increase the sensitivity, speed, and comprehensiveness of understanding genome regulation. We will develop new technologies to interrogate the transactions between the genome and regulatory factors, such as proteins and noncoding RNAs, and integrate variations in DNA sequences and chromatin states over time and across individuals. Novel molecular engineering and biosensor strategies are deployed to encapsulate the desired complex DNA transformations into the probe system, such that the probe system can be directly used on very small human clinical samples and capture genome-wide information in one or two steps. These technologies will be applied to clinical samples and workflows in real time to exercise their robustness and reveal for the first time epigenomic dynamics of human diseases during progression and treatment. These technologies will be broadly applicable to many biomedical investigations, and the Center will disseminate the technologies via training and diverse means."
"9296100","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies have established MED1 (Mediator Subunit 1, also named TRAP220, DRIP205, or MED220) as a key transcriptional coactivator for ER? during both normal mammary gland development and breast cancer. Significantly, the MED1 gene is located at the chromosome 17q12 region, also known as the HER2 amplicon, and co-amplifies with HER2 in almost all instances in breast cancer. We have recently confirmed MED1 overexpression and correlation with HER2 status at the protein level using human breast cancer tissue microarrays. Importantly, we found that MED1 serves as a key crosstalk point for the HER2 and ER? pathways ER?-mediated transcription and resistance of breast cancer cells to anti-estrogen therapies. However, despite recent progress, whether MED1 and its overexpression play a role in HER2-driven tumorigenesis is still unknown. Towards that end, we have crossed MMTV-HER2 mammary tumor mice with our established MED1 mutant knockin mice and newly generated MED1 mammary-specific overexpression mice. We found that the progression of MMTV-HER2 tumors is dramatically reduced in MED1 mutant knockin mice, with greatly inhibited tumor metastasis to lung and decreased tumor mammosphere formation capability. Conversely, we observed significantly accelerated tumor onset, growth, multiplicity, and tumor metastasis in MMTV-HER2/MMTV-MED1 double transgenic mice compared to MMTV-HER2 mice. Based on these findings, our central hypothesis is that MED1 is required for HER2-mediated tumorigenesis, and targeting the MED1 pathway could be a useful strategy for treatment of the HER2+ER+ breast cancer subtype that is clinically challenging to treat due to resistance to both anti-estrogen and anti-HER2 therapies. We will utilize a combination of biochemical, nano-technological, and mouse genetic approaches to 1) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying MED1 functions in HER2-mediated tumorigenesis; 2) determine the role of MED1 overexpression in HER2-mediated tumorigenesis; and 3) test the efficacy of targeting the MED1 pathway in HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Through these studies, we expect to identify the role of MED1 and its key downstream molecular pathways involved in HER2-driven breast tumorigenesis. The research proposed in this application is innovative because we are utilizing our unique MED1 mutant and newly generated MED1 overexpression mouse models to elucidate the role and underlying molecular mechanism of MED1 regarding its previously undescribed functions in breast cancer stem cell formation and metastasis. This study is also significant because it is expected to fill a key knowledge gap on the role of a co-amplified gene (MED1) and its interplay with the driver (HER2) at the HER2 amplicon in tumorigenesis, and to make a positive impact by providing novel RNA nanotechnology-based therapeutics for potential treatment of human breast cancer."
"9526065","PROJECT SUMMARY This project will test the hypothesis that bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity regulates gut motility in a dose-dependent manner via signaling pathways in the enteric nervous system (ENS) that include RET, a tyrosine kinase receptor critical for ENS development and function, and TGR5, the only bile acid receptor known to be expressed by enteric neurons. To explore this hypothesis, I will integrate various technologies to produce functional readouts, combining a gnotobiotic mouse model of diet-dependent bile acid-mediated motility phenotypes with mass spectrometry, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics. In Aim 1, I propose to determine the extent to which gut motility is regulated by bacterial BSH activity. First, bacterial strains cultured from the microbiota of a single healthy Bangladeshi individual will be classified as possessing high, mid-level, or low BSH activity using an established in vitro screen. These strains have undergone preliminary screening to establish presence or absence of BSH; here I will characterize BSH activity with time-scale resolution down to 3 hours and with respect to the two predominant primary bile acid substrates in mice (taurocholic acid and tauro-beta-muricholic acid). Then, selected strains with high/mid/low BSH activity will be transplanted into gnotobiotic mice to determine (i) the extent to which BSH activity correlates with gut motility and (ii) whether BSH's motility effects are robust to taxonomic diversity (essential for understanding generalizability of the findings). In the future, I aim to initiate a clinical study to test the hypothesis that gut bacterial BSH activity correlates with motility in patients with diarrhea- or constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, in order to identify subsets in whom bacterial bile acid metabolism could serve as a therapeutic target. In Aim 2, I propose to identify key ENS mediators of the effects of microbiome-encoded BSH activity on gut motility. To determine whether the TGR5 bile acid receptor is responsible for mediating this bile acid- dependent response, I will use conventionally raised and gnotobiotic Tgr5-/- mice. To identify key ENS molecular mediators and pathways, I will adopt TRAP-Seq (translating ribosome affinity purification sequencing), a technology developed to study distinct populations of the mouse brain, to profile the ENS in gnotobiotic mice. Using this approach, I will elucidate the effects of a cholekinetic agent (turmeric) and model human gut bacterial communities with defined BSH activity on the ENS transcriptome in the small intestine and colon, correlating these signals with measured transit times and bile acid profiles. Together, these data obtained from humanized gnotobiotic mice will help dissect the extent to which bacterial bile acid metabolism regulates gut motility and provide mechanistic insights regarding interactions between dietary ingredients, the gut microbiome, and ENS signaling pathways that regulate motility. Follow-up future studies will involve transplanting intact uncultured microbiota from selected well-phenotyped humans with motility disorders into gnotobiotic mice."
"9339584","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary/Abstract The goals of this project are to understand the mechanistic basis for the increased incidence of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) associated with aging in humans. It has been known for decades that aging mice frequently develop lymphomas and work in mouse models have identified age-associated reduction in the DNA damage response (DDR). The ATM gene, a master regulator of the DNA damage-signaling pathways is responsible for ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), and is essential for maintaining the integrity of the genome. The Levine group demonstrated that the function of ATM kinase declines significantly with age in mice. Of clinical relevance, human peripheral blood lymphocytes from older individuals also demonstrate an attenuated response after exposure to genotoxic stresses. Interestingly, a significant percentage of DLBCL exhibited elevated levels of the oncogenic microRNA-421 which down-regulates levels of ATM protein. The levels of expressed genes are controlled through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional/translational events after genotoxic stress exposure. RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and microRNAs are major posttranscriptional/ translational regulators of gene expression. This synchronized regulation of mRNA subsets is the basis of the post-transcriptional RNA-operon model whereby RBPs coregulate multiple mRNAs and thereby regulate the co-expression of proteins with related function. The RBP, HuR is recognized as a key post-transcriptional regulator of mRNAs encoding proteins central to the cellular stress response. Our group recently identified those transcripts differentially associated with HuR, including multiple cancer-related mRNAs in an ATM/Chk2- dependent manner. The specific hypothesis to be investigated is that the aberrant posttranscriptional regulation of genes by HuR in response to IR contributes to lymphomagenesis in the elderly. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the linkage between aberrant post-transcriptional regulation of genes and aging in human B- cell lymphocytes. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate if the oncogenic microRNA-421 contributes to DLBCL development. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate whether the development of splenic lymphomas in aging mouse are mechanistically linked with defects in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Our proposal should provide a functional link between ATM and HuR's posttranscriptional role in mediating oncogenic, and antiapoptotic activities as well as to validat the paradigm that the age-associated decline in function of ATM underlies the increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) observed with increasing age."
"9327458","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed research aims to evaluate the association between neighborhood context and cognitive function among racially and ethnically diverse middle-aged adults. The United States? population is aging at unprecedented rates and it is also becoming diverse with racial and ethnic minority adults suffering a greater incidence of Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias compared to non-Hispanic white adults. Psychological and biological markers of chronic stress are important predictors of cognitive function and the neighborhood contexts in which individuals live, or have previously lived in, comprise an important backdrop for linking the effects of chronic stress to cognitive function. Neighborhood characteristics and race and ethnicity are interrelated and studying the effects of neighborhood contexts on cognitive function will inform on relevant determinants of cognitive health disparities. Further, because cognitive decline may begin long before old age, understanding its antecedents requires mapping changes that manifest in early and middle adulthood. In order to develop a more nuanced understanding of the link between neighborhoods and cognitive function, it is imperative to 1) determine the extent to which neighborhood stress is associated with cognitive function across racial and ethnic groups; 2) examine which specific facets of cognitive functioning are affected by neighborhood stress; and 3) evaluate the interplay between neighborhood context and genetic influences on cognitive function. The PI aims to address these aims by leveraging the strengths of three studies of middle- aged adults, CATSLife, ESCAPE, and MIDUS II to comprehensively assess the associations between neighborhood stress and cognitive function. The proposed research will make a timely contribution to our understanding of contextual influences on cognitive function.  Moreover, the research and training plan proposed under this award will advance the PI?s scientific and career development in several ways. With her sponsors? mentorship and training activities, the PI will achieve three career goals: 1) learn and apply new skills on integrative data analysis and neighborhood coding techniques; 2) broaden conceptual understanding and gain advanced analytical experience in behavioral genetics; 3) develop the skills needed to design and implement studies that incorporate environmental and genetic perspectives to the study of context and cognitive function and aging. Achievement of these goals will position the PI to launch an independent line of research that will inform theoretical and empirical understanding on the influence of social/contextual sources of stress on cognitive health in adulthood, with a focus on elucidating common and/or differential associations across racial and ethnic groups."
"9351180","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) represent the most common tumor in women, disproportionately affect African- Americans, cause pregnancy loss, and induce excessive uterine bleeding leading to severe chronic anemia. Our long-term objective is to understand novel clinically relevant mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis and growth of uterine leiomyomas in order to reduce associated morbidity. Our team has designed integrated projects focusing on paracrine interactions among leiomyoma cell populations and biologically critical signaling pathways involving RANKL/RANK, NR4A subfamily of nuclear receptors and AKT. Project I (Bulun) seeks to understand the mechanisms responsible for clonal expansion of a small but distinct stem cell population deficient in estrogen  or progesterone receptors. Progesterone action, essential for the in vivo growth of leiomyomas, are transduced from steroid receptor-rich and mature leiomyoma cells onto the stem/progenitor cells via a paracrine signaling pathway involving the cytokine RANKL secreted by support cells for activating its receptor RANK in stem cells, triggering self-renewal and proliferation. Targetin RANK pathway in a unique stem cell population, responsible for regeneration and proliferation of leiomyomas, is a novel and clinically significant approach. Project II (Chakravarti/Nowak) was launched after system-wide expression profiling of the entire nuclear receptor family, which showed severe deficiencies of the NR4A subfamily expression in uterine leiomyomas. Project II will test the hypothesis that the NR4A members play critical and integrative roles involving TGF?3 and SMAD signaling in leiomyoma growth by regulating key proliferation and profibrotic genes. Elucidation of a novel role of a nuclear receptor subfamily deficiency in the context of proliferation and fibrosis is novel and a paradigm shift for identifying therapeutic targets. Projet III (Kim/Wei) will define the mechanisms that promote cellular senescence and death upon inhibition of AKT, which mediates the major signaling pathway for leiomyoma cell survival. Project III will test the hypothesis that the high oxidative stress levels in leiomyomas is able to  promote growth and survival through the AKT pathway, however, upon inhibition of AKT, reactive oxygen species will induce miR-182, p16 and HMGA2 and cause senescence. AKT inhibition will also decrease BCL2 and enhances cell death. Pursuing AKT-dependent senescence and death pathways through ROS in uterine leiomyoma cells is both novel and translational. Optimally organized Administrative (Bulun) and Tissue/Cell (Wei/Marsh) Cores run by experienced Directors support these projects. Overall, all projects are clinically and thematically connected, collectively investigate self-renewal, proliferation, senescence and cell death in stem and differentiated cell populations of uterine fibroids, and are designed to introduce paradigm-shifting pathologic and therapeutic concepts. Just as the past funding period of this P01 Center led to the use of antiprogestins to treat uterine leiomyomas, we expect the development of novel treatments targeting RANKL/RANK, NR4A or AKT as a result of the proposed studies."
"9380824","ABSTRACT Systems genetics studies utilize a diverse array of experimental, computational and statistical approaches to interrelate genotypes and phenotypes in order to provide a comprehensive view of the underlying genetic architecture of complex traits. The Systems Genetics and Bioinformatics Core (Core C) serves as the catalyst for integration for the U19 across data types, viruses and species to enable the identification of candidate genes, pathways and networks implicated in human diseases and provides context for the loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with regard to their contribution to disease susceptibility. Core C will focus on robust and reproducible approaches to facilitate identification of candidate genes and gene networks involved in innate, adaptive, and memory immunity, as well as prioritization and candidate refinement in close coordination with all projects and Core B (Mouse Genetics). The goal of this Core is to provide focus for empirical investigation and validation of the computational predictions. Specifically, by employing integrative, systems-level approaches dissecting immunological traits, we are able to elucidate key drivers of immune host response beyond what could be achieved by traditional genetic association studies alone. Core C will facilitate hypothesis-driven (candidate gene) and hypothesis-generating (network) analyses to address the U19 goals. In some cases an underlying candidate gene may be the same in animal models and humans and will be prioritized for further study. In other cases, animal model research or our analysis of the human responses and genetic variants that direct these responses may identify a gene network relevant in humans, with a hub that could be manipulated in the mouse model to examine network effects. Analyses of both candidate genes and networks will be more powerful than either alone to provide the interlocking levels of proof to move from gene/network to mechanism. Successful implementation and execution of the proposed research in each project necessitates robust cutting-edge analytical methods and computational workflows. Core C personnel have significant experience in systems genetics (both statistical genetics and systems biology) that includes computational modeling and network inference, in addition to the detection of QTLs in a highly complex genetic background, as well as expertise in management and dissemination of large scale genetic and genomic resources."
"9322560","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the rapidly increasing capacity to sequence human genomes, our incomplete ability to read and interpret the information content in genomes and epigenomes remain a central challenge. A comprehensive set of regulatory events across a genome - the regulome - is needed to make full use of genomic information, but is currently out of reach for practically all clinical applications and many biological systems The proposed Center will develop technologies that greatly increase the sensitivity, speed, and comprehensiveness of understanding genome regulation. We will develop new technologies to interrogate the transactions between the genome and regulatory factors, such as proteins and noncoding RNAs, and integrate variations in DNA sequences and chromatin states over time and across individuals. Novel molecular engineering and biosensor strategies are deployed to encapsulate the desired complex DNA transformations into the probe system, such that the probe system can be directly used on very small human clinical samples and capture genome-wide information in one or two steps. These technologies will be applied to clinical samples and workflows in real time to exercise their robustness and reveal for the first time epigenomic dynamics of human diseases during progression and treatment. These technologies will be broadly applicable to many biomedical investigations, and the Center will disseminate the technologies via training and diverse means."
"9324343","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with pulmonary vascular remodeling that promotes right heart failure and premature death. In PH, pulmonary endothelial dysfunction is identified as a critical mediator of aberrant distal arteriole remodeling to induce pulmonary hypertension. The current WHO classification system segregates PH patients into distinct categories based on predisposing conditions. Despite this, it remains unknown if patients within these groups share a common endothelial or endovascular pathophenotype that is a determinant of disease progression or response to pharmacotherapy. This has led to our hypothesis that an integrated pulmonary artery endothelial (patho)phenotypic analysis will identify previously unrecognized features shared between subsets of patients with PH that will inform on disease status. To address this, we propose 3 specific aims, which are designed to 1) establish an integrated pulmonary artery endothelial profile through microRNA, mRNA, and metabolyte expression analyses using RNA-Seq and proteomics; 2) evaluate the pulmonary artery endothelial response to exercise; and 3) correlate the endothelial phenotypic profile with clinical assessments of hemodynamics, right ventricular performance and functional capacity. Studies to profile the pulmonary vascular endothelium will be performed using immediately isolated pulmonary artery endothelial cells obtained at the time of right heart catheterization and plasma samples drawn in the pre- and post- exercise phases of a 6-minute walk test. Using a systems biology approach, data from the advanced phenotypic profiling studies will be incorporated into a network to uncover previously unknown interactions between microRNAs, mRNAs, and metabolic proteins that function as disease modifiers and can be developed further as targets for pharmacotherapies or biomarkers. Integrated endothelial pathophenotypic profiling will be accomplished through collaboration of a multidisciplinary team that includes individuals with expertise in pulmonary vascular disease, cardiology, imaging, cell and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Completion of the integrated phenotyping proposal will lead to the emergence of key endothelial phenotypes that will redefine our approach to patients with PH."
"9280209","Infrastructure Project Summary The Infrastructure Core provides for overall software development and compute infrastructure for the Virtual Cell (VCell) modeling and simulation software, as well as supporting research applications that drive the development of the software. The CCAM software development group is a team of two full time software developers, and several part time developers and this core manages the formalized structure for development of the software, including management of the development tools, code repositories, bug tracking protocols, multi-platform builds, etc.. We also develop and manage the server-side infrastructure for the Virtual Cell, which now has been in place for over 17 years, but which has continuously grown in size to cope with increased user base and software features. A scalable set of services are being deployed at our High Performance Computing Facility and we have introduced recently new elements for compatibility with cloud computing protocols and prototype single-instance VM packaging. The infrastructure core also develops and maintains the VCell database (VCDB) that stores all models and model elements, as well as identifying information for compute job status and result location on the shared storage servers. We plan to construct a web application building on a recently developed VCell RESTful API to greatly expand access to the database over the web, expanding the use of the database as a knowledgebase for the entire modeling community. Part of the VCDB development is also the maintenance of the formal VCell XML data structure (VCML) and schema, as well as the updating and improvement of the import/export algorithms and tools for interfacing with community standards SBML, BioPAX, and SED-ML. A completely new requirement for development in the next project period is to create a specialized infrastructure for processing and analysis of multiple run stochastic simulations. The growing number and increase use of stochastic and hybrid solvers in VCell create requirements that go beyond the simple data retrieval of multiple trajectories and single point distribution histograms and scale in fault-tolerant and optimized fashion to support hundreds and thousands of related spatial and non-spatial runs. Last, but not least, this core is tasked with the development and maintenance of the VCell Math testing Framework. Comprised of a growing test Suite mixing random models from database with manually chosen ones (including a full complement of cases with exact solution), it automates the process of end-to-end regression testing that is critical for maintaining forward compatibility and verifying correctness and accuracy of various solvers and algorithms."
"9339489","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cholangiocytes are the target cells in chronic cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which are characterized by the damage/ proliferation of cholangiocytes of different sizes and function. Cholangiocyte proliferation and regrowth are critical for the maintenance of biliary mass and the functional recovery during the pathogenesis of these cholangiopathies. The elucidation of the intracellular mechanisms regulating the proliferative/regenerative responses of large and small bile ducts to cholestasis will play a pivotal role in the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. Secretin (SEC), a gastrointestinal hormone, is critical for hepatobiliary growth and regeneration. As the secretin receptor (SR) is only expressed by cholangiocytes in the liver, levels of cyclic-AMP in the bile ducts increase and bicarbonate rich bile is secreted after administration of secretin. During hepatobiliary growth/damage, cholangiocytes acquire neuroendocrine phenotypes and thereby secrete and respond to neuroendocrine hormones such as VEGF/NGF and secretin that regulate biliary mass and response to damage. Targeting specific factors that are activated/deactivated during liver injury may help limit biliary damage and the progression of PBC, PSC and liver fibrosis. We have shown that SEC/SR (expressed only by cholangiocytes) axis regulate biliary mass during bile duct ligation (BDL). Secretin levels are elevated during the early stages of BDL. Lack of SR expression leads to: (i) ablation of biliary growth during BDL; and (ii) exacerbation of biliary damage in response to toxins indicating that SEC is a pro-proliferative/protective factor. The mechanisms regulated by the SEC/SR axis during models of acute (short-term BDL and CCl4 administration) and chronic biliary damage (animal models of PSC and PBC) are unknown. Preliminary data indicate that: (i) the SEC/SR axis has pro-proliferative and protective functions during biliary injury (e.g., CCl4 administration and in dnTGFbetaRII KO mice); (ii) activation of the SEC/SR axis (which increases biliary growth) results in the downregulation of the miRNAs, let-7a and miR125-b, that modulate the expression of VEGF and nerve growth factor (NGF) as well as the other potential target genes such as Bcl-2; and (iii) the serum levels of SEC are reduced in PBC and PSC patients indicating that dysregulation of the SEC/SR axis may be key in the pathogenesis of these cholangiopathies. We propose the overall hypothesis that the SEC/SR axis is a key pathway responsible for mediating biliary proliferation/damage during liver diseases. Our long-term objective is to define the therapeutic role of the SEC/SR axis in hepatobiliary disorders such as PBC/PSC. The overall hypothesis will be evaluated by three specific aims. First, we will demonstrate that the SEC/SR axis modulates cholangiocyte proliferation and damage during animal models of acute cholestasis through the activation of autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. Second, we will identify functional SEC-dependent miRNAs involved in the regulation of the expression levels of the pro-proliferative/protective neuroendocrine factors. Third, we will determine the trophic/protective SEC/SR axis that contributes to biliary damage/recovery during chronic cholestasis in animal models of PSC and PBC. Therapeutic effects of secretin dependent gene/miRNA manipulation on biliary cell growth and proliferation will be evaluated. Novel insights into the physiological roles and mechanisms of molecular and functional secretin signaling in human biliary epithelium will be obtained. Meanwhile, the fundamental knowledge obtained in the regulation of growth, proliferation and apoptosis in biliary tree is expected to advance the field of biliary biology/ pathophysiology. !"
"9379998","An emerging and challenging research ?eld in genetics is to detect associations between com- plex traits and rare variants (RVs) with next-generation sequencing and Exome Chip data. Due to ex- tremely low minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of RVs, many existing tests for common variants (CVs), such as the univariate test on each individual variant, most popular in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), may no longer be suitable. To boost power and facilitate biological interpretation, we propose combining information across multiple sources of data, which may or may not be of the same type. For the former, it leads to highly adaptive meta analysis suitable and powerful for com- bining multi-ethnic cohorts; for the latter, we integrate DNA genotype and sequencing data with gene networks, gene expression data and metabolomic data for association analysis of RVs. A common theme of the proposed methods is to explicitly account for genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. For example, to account for genetic heterogeneity, we propose an adaptive network-based association test to aggregate information across multiple causal genes clustered in a network for a single cohort; for multiple cohorts, especially multi-ethnic ones, our proposed meta-analysis test is highly adaptive to heterogeneous and varying association patterns across cohorts (e.g. only few cohorts contain causal RVs) and among RVs. The developed methods will be applied to detect associations of RV- cardiovascular traits with the sequencing and other omic data from the ARIC study. We will develop and distribute software implementing the proposed methods. The proposed research is in line with the NHLBI's continuing interest in whole genome/exome sequencing and integrative omics analysis as evidenced by its TOPMed Program and NIH's other Precision Medicine initiatives."
"9394505","Substance abuse remains a national crisis that presents substantial health-care and socio-economic costs. Of the panoply of abused substances, amphetamine (AMPH) and AMPH-like psychostimulants are among the most highly abused and exert considerable toxicity. Moreover, a recent surge in the generation of novel AMPH- like congeners that circumvent legal prohibitions has precipitated a new, major public health concern. My preliminary findings suggest that Regulator of G Protein Signaling-12 (RGS12) may be a critical molecular component underlying the CNS mechanisms by which these drugs exert their effects. RGS12-null mice were found to have reduced hyperlocomotion to AMPH and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), but not to methylphenidate nor cocaine. Each of these psychostimulants exerts their locomotor-activating and rewarding properties by elevating extracellular dopamine (DA) in the striatum, but each does so via differential actions at the dopamine transporter (DAT): AMPH and MDMA are known to induce dopamine (DA) release via transport reversal of DAT, whereas MP and COC work to antagonize DA uptake through DAT. Additionally, I have found that the maintenance of AMPH-induced locomotor sensitization following three weeks of drug cessation is reduced in RGS12-null mice. The effects of AMPH and AMPH-like psychostimulants are dependent on mesolimbic and nigrostriatal brain structures, such as the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, dorsal and ventral striatum -- all regions where Rgs12 mRNA and RGS12 protein are robustly expressed. Since submission of my original fellowship request, I have now shown that RGS12 reduces AMPH-induced [3H]DA release in ventral striatum, but not dorsal striatum, despite normal DAT- dependent [3H]DA uptake in these regions. Moreover, AMPH-induced c-Fos expression in RGS12-null mice is attenuated specifically in the ventral striatum. These new preliminary data suggest that RGS12 is required for AMPH action and, mechanistically, RGS12 may selectively modulate DAT-mediated DA release processes in the mesolimbic system. This resubmission thus seeks to further define the role of RGS12 in modulating the effects of AMPH and AMPH-like psychostimulants to advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which these drugs elicit addictive potential. The first Aim is to evaluate the role of RGS12 in behavioral sensitization and rewarding properties of drugs of abuse, using locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference paradigms, respectively. The second Aim is to determine the neuroanatomical locus and neurocircuitry underlying the function of RGS12 on responses to AMPH-like drugs, as well as establish whether perturbations in DAT or other monoaminergic transporters (i.e., serotonin and norepinephrine transporters) explain the selectively attenuated hyperlocomotor responses to DAT-mediated DA releasers. My overall goal is to validate RGS12 as a novel molecular target within the process of how substance abuse is established and thus contribute to the future discovery of new therapeutic agents to ameliorate the debilitating disease of addiction."

"9398426","NIH has identified weight loss maintenance as the next major challenge in obesity treatment. Continuous care models that involve ongoing patient-professional contact yield promising maintenance outcomes. However, the traditional approach to providing continuous care (professional staff) is costly and thus unsustainable. Patient-delivered interventions (in which trained patients deliver treatment) may be a unique solution to providing continuous care at low cost and with organic sustainability. Moreover, qualitative data suggest that, given their shared experience, fellow patients have a unique sense of empathy not duplicated by professionals, family or friends. Thus, patient-delivered treatment may be a uniquely powerful, sustainable, and cost-effective treatment experience. However, patient-delivered treatment has never been tested for continuous care and has never been evaluated for weight loss maintenance.  The proposed study will, for the first time, test patient-delivered treatment for weight loss maintenance. Our preliminary data demonstrate that our team is highly effective at engaging, retaining, and providing evidence-based training to patient providers, evidenced by 12-month engagement and retention rates between 88 and 100%. Moreover, in a recent trial, we showed that during the initial maintenance phase (when weight regain is common) trained patient providers yielded additional weight loss. Thus, in this trial, participants will be randomized to either patient-delivered care or current best practice. Weight loss maintenance will be examined at month 18. Given that trained patients will provide weekly ongoing evidence-based treatment, our primary hypothesis is that patient-delivered treatment will yield better weight loss maintenance outcomes at 18-months compared to current best practice (i.e., which involves tapered contact ? i.e., weekly, bimonthly, monthly). In addition to this trial being the first to test the long-term efficacy of patient providers for maintenance, it will also be the first to (1) train patient providers to deliver ALL treatment components (previous trials relied on a hybrid approach in which professionals and patients co-delivered treatment); (2) examine the long-term sustainability of patient-provided treatment once formal treatment ends (patients? continued correspondence via email or text will be examined); (3) explore the unique mechanisms (empathy, inspiration, hope, compassion) by which patient-provided care exerts its effects; and (4) examine the cost-effectiveness of patient-provided treatment vs. current best practice. If effective, this study would demonstrate that patient-provided care is a new and transformative intervention approach that provides continuous care in a sustainable, cost-effective manner."
"9333950","Project Summary/Abstract  Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) are characterized by a progressive decline in memory and other cognitive functions that ultimately result in dementia. Amyloid ? (A?) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles made up of hyperphosphorylated Tau are the two hallmark features of AD. Although no mutation in the Tau gene has been identified to cause AD, FTDP-17 can be caused by the P301L mutation. Fyn, a Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SFK), has recently been implicated in AD. A? activates Fyn to cause behavioral deficits, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and downregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) at the synapse. Previously, our laboratory discovered that wild type Tau (TauWT) upregulates Fyn activity and mutant Tau (TauP301L) has increased affinity for Fyn. Missing from our current knowledge is the role of the Fyn-Tau interaction in both normal physiological functions and in FTDP-17 where A? is absent. This proposal is based on our hypothesis that during disease pathogenesis, an interaction between Tau and Fyn serves as a key event leading to neurodegeneration.  To investigate the role of the Fyn-Tau interaction in both normal functions and neurodegeneration, we will first create a Fyn-/-/Tau-/- mouse and then induce Tau pathology by injecting Adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing TauP301L (AAV TauP301L) into the ventricles of the double knockout mouse on postnatal day 0 (p0). We propose the following specific aims: 1) Characterize behavioral and biochemical properties of Fyn-/-/Tau-/- mice. We will perform various behavioral and biochemical assays starting with areas where single knockout animals display deficits in order to identify pathways that are affected by both Fyn and Tau. Fyn-/-, Tau-/-, and WT mice will be used as controls. The results obtained from this aim will also serve as a control for experiments in specific aim 2. 2) Determine how Fyn depletion affects TauP301L induced neurodegeneration in an FTDP-17 mouse model. We will create Fyn-/-/Tau-/-(AAV TauP301L) animals and use behavioral, biochemical and immunohistochemical assays to compare the properties of this mouse against those of Tau-/-(AAV TauP301L) animals. Fyn-/-/Tau-/-(AAV TauWT), Tau-/-(AAV TauWT), Fyn-/-/Tau-/-, and Tau-/- will be used as controls.  Our proposal will investigate the interaction between Fyn and Tau during both normal neuronal function and during the neurodegenerative process in an FTDP-17 mouse model. Our research may establish Fyn as a critical protein involved in the pathogenesis of tauopathies. Understanding the interaction between Fyn and Tau may lead to the development of therapeutics to slow or halt neurodegeneration."
"9321484","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed work aims to improve the quality of pediatric and fetal neuroimaging MRI data acquired without sedation and anesthesia through the development and clinical evaluation of novel MRI pulse sequences. Sedation and anesthesia account for a significant percentage of the cost of pediatric neuroimaging MRI studies, and increase both the risk to the patient and the time required for a scan. Although some clinical neuroimaging studies are attempted without sedation, success is not consistent and the resulting image quality is often considered marginal. In the research setting, MRI is frequently not available to study children because the risks of sedation are not ethically justifiable; this limits the use of MRI for studying development and pediatric disease. In fetal MRI, motion results in degraded data and longer scan sessions. The research aims of this proposal provide a sequence of development and testing stages designed to produce high-speed motion-corrected MRI pulse sequences to address these issues. The first step in creating the proposed sequences is the addition of volumetric navigators to a selection of clinical MRI sequences that have been tailored to gain the maximum savings in time from modern high- channel-count coil arrays. The navigators embedded in these sequences will be used to track the motion of the subject's head during scanning and automatically update the scanner's imaging coordinates in real time. Additionally, portions of the scan that are detected to be degraded by subject motion will be automatically reacquired. The second stage of the project consists of developing novel high-speed image registration software that will improve the accuracy of the motion tracking. These first stages of development work will take place mostly at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical imaging, taking advantage of its engineering resources, 7 large-bore MRI scanners, and the large pool of collaborators in MRI physics, pulse sequence programming, and medical image analysis algorithms. Additional pilot testing during the development phase will be performed with pediatric volunteers on the clinical MRI systems at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). As a third stage, when the sequence development is complete, we propose to validate the tools using a clinical trial at BCH, with the goal of demonstrating improvements in quality and efficiency in pediatric subjects scanned without sedation. This clinical trail will take advantage of the child life, nursing, radiology technologis, radiologist, and research support staff in Radiology and the Fetal Neonatal Neuroimaging & Developmental Science Center at BCH. The project will also proceed to a pilot study applying this technology to fetal neuroimaging via the development of a fetal-specific high-speed motion-corrected sequence - this population is unique in that competing optical- and probe-based motion-correction systems cannot be applied, making the use of navigated sequences particularly attractive. Together, these steps will advance the candidate's long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher focused on developing novel MRI technology and translating advances into clinical and neuroscience research practice. The development work during this period will help solidify Dr. Tisdall's knowledge of pulse sequence programming and MRI physics. It will also give him the opportunity to study more deeply in medical image analysis techniques such as registration and segmentation. These technical skills will be of use to his future research career goals. Additionally, the process of designing and implementing a clinical trial study will be essential to Dr. Tisdall's future goal of developing technology with direct cliical impact. Thus, the clinical trial portion of this proposal will provide invaluable exposure to these tasks while collaborating with more senior researchers. Finally, the results gathered from the study will help direct future work by Dr. Tisdall, suggesting new theoretical advances to address clinical imaging issues. In addition to the significant research component of the proposal, there is also an initial two-year mentored career development phase in which Dr. Tisdall will spend a 25% of his time on tasks selected to help him become a successful independent researcher in medical imaging. As part of this period, Dr. Tisdall will attend courses in neuroanatomy and disease, and clinical trial design at Harvard Medical School and MIT, and participate in career development seminars at Massachusetts General Hospital and BCH. He will also have a 4-week clinical experience period at Children's Hospital Boston, where he will shadow Dr. Ellen Grant and observe both MRI scanning sessions and image reading. Together these direct training components are designed to broaden Dr. Tisdall's knowledge of clinical and research neuroimaging practices, the delivery of clinical care, and the development and management of clinical research. Dr. Tisdall will also receive regular mentorship and feedback on research, academic, and career development topics via weekly meetings with Drs. Bruce Fischl and Andr? van der Kouwe, and monthly meetings with Dr. Lawrence Wald at the Martinos Center. He will also have biweekly meetings with Dr. Ellen Grant at BCH. Every six months Drs. Fischl and Grant will evaluate Dr. Tisdall's research and career development progress, and meet with him to provide feedback. Through these two years of mentored development, Dr. Tisdall will hone his technical skills, and substantially develop his clinical and study-design knowledge, preparing his transition to independence."
"9249386","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) is characterized by the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies that promote tissue injury, including in the kidney. Pathogenic autoantibodies in lupus undergo affinity maturation and immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching in germinal centers (GCs) within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), a site of CD4+ T cell-dependent (TD) B cell maturation. Yet, the specific subsets of effector CD4+ T cells that promote auto-reactive B development, and the regulation of these cells, are not well defined. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells comprise a subset of CD4+ T helper (Th cells, phenotypically and functionally distinct from other Th cells, such as the classical the Th1, Th2 and Th17 subsets. They reside in B cell follicles and GCs and are essential for B cell maturation and (auto) antibody production. Tfh cells express proteins critical for their development and GC maturation. They also secrete the canonical cytokine interleukin (IL)-21 that is necessary for GC B cell development, as well as the classical Th1 and Th2 cytokines IFN-¿ and IL-4, appropriate to pathogen challenge, and that are also necessary for B cell maturation as well as Ig isotype switch. Unlike the classical CD4+ Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets, the mechanism of cytokine production by Tfh cells is unclear. I have used model systems to explore Tfh-cell cytokine production and its role in B cell maturation, with the long-term goal to investigate these events in pathogenic autoantibody production in SLE. I have demonstrated in work submitted for publication that Tfh cells following model (viral) infection secrete both IL-21 and IFN-? as do classical Th1 cells, and as also occurs in SLE. My findings underscore the complexity of the genetic regulation of cytokine production by CD4+ T cells following pathogen challenge and, importantly, in SLE. Inhibition of IFN-? and IL-21 is beneficial in murine lupus with these cytokines as therapeutic targets in SLE; however, their contribution to disease is not fully understood. I hypothesize that the factor(s) defining Tfh- cell cytokines compared to Th1 cells will have consequences in lupus, and may represent novel therapeutic targets. Accordingly, I will dissect the factors that regulate these responses in a viral infection model and in spontaneous lupus, utilizing novel genetically modified cytokine reporter mice that I have created and/or bred. I will use these tools to explore the interplay of transcriptional regulation, dynamic chromatin architecture, regulatory protein binding, and genomic organization in cytokine production in Th1 and Tfh cells following viral challenge (a tractable system) and in lupus (a more complex model), using novel genomics approaches combined with fundamental cellular immunology experiments. These tools will bolster my research skills in the setting of this career development award, and will enable me to identify the common classes of regulatory elements in both cytokine genes. Ultimately, this work should help me distinguish pathogenic and nonpathogenic effector T cells, aiding therapeutic design, and serve to launch my independent research career."

"9527242","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world, is characterized by progressive degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the retinal nerve fiber layer, and the optic nerve. Glaucoma is often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and because the increased IOP exerts a compressing force on the blood vessels in the eye, it has long been hypothesized that the RGC damage is caused by mild, but chronic, reduction of basal blood flow and/or blood-flow dysregulation. For many patients, by the time glaucoma is detected in examinations or patients notice vision loss, more than half of the RGCs have already degenerated. The eventual outcome is often blindness. Thus, non-invasive imaging technologies capable of detecting depth-resolved blood flow, oxygenation, and stimulus-evoked hemodynamic changes to evaluate blood flow reduction and dysregulation in the retina and the optic nerve head could enable objective early detection, longitudinal disease staging, and monitoring of therapeutic interventions. Although optically based imaging techniques provide high spatial resolution, they are depth limited which precludes quantitative resolution of retinal, choroidal, and optic nerve blood flow. Our laboratory pioneered the application of multimodal MRI to image high-resolution lamina-specific anatomy, blood flow, oxygenation, and function of the retina without depth limitation. Here we propose: i) to develop a multimodal MRI approach to markedly improve contrast and spatial resolution (35x35x300 ?m) without MRI susceptibility artifact by using a 3D balanced Steady State Free Precession (bSSFP) data acquisition scheme, and ii) to apply this approach in an established genetic (DBA/2J) mouse glaucoma model to determine whether MRI can detect glaucomatous changes in early stage and examine a plausible mechanism of glaucoma pathogenesis. We hypothesize that: 1) MRI can provide high resolution, depth-resolved, laminar- specific anatomical, blood flow, and functional images free of susceptibility artifacts; and 2) the pathogenesis of glaucoma is mediated by reduced blood flow and/or blood-flow dysregulation in the early stage, resulting in eventual loss of RGCs by ischemic hypoxia, and, if this is the cause, hyperoxia treatment should halt glaucomatous damage."
"9502761","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite enormous expansion of HIV testing and treatment services in resource-limited settings, adolescents continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV. In 2013, UNAIDS reported that adolescents between the ages of 15-24 have the highest HIV incidence rates compared to any other age strata. And while mortality has decreased in adult and pediatric populations, there has been a 50% increase in adolescent HIV-related deaths over the last 7 years. Inadequate provision of accessible and acceptable HIV testing, counseling, and treatment services has been cited as a barrier to uptake of and retention in HIV care among adolescents. Additionally, in preliminary studies by our group, health care workers tasked with providing adolescent HIV services frequently reported feeling inadequately prepared to cope with the needs of this age group. Primarily used in medical education, simulated patient (SP) encounters show great promise as a mechanism for health care workers in low-resource settings to improve critical decision-making, patient interaction, and communication skills. These encounters serve not only to provide teaching and mentorship where a trained actor and a faculty observer can provide immediate feedback and support to the clinician, but also provide quantitative and qualitative measures of clinical performance and competency that can be compared to clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that SP encounters will increase provider confidence and capacity to facilitate HIV status disclosure and provide supportive interactions with HIV-infected youth, which will in turn increase uptake and improve retention in HIV services among adolescents. We propose to develop and evaluate a clinical training intervention utilizing standardized patient actors to improve communication and interpersonal skills of health care workers in working with adolescents, resulting in increased engagement in HIV care. In AIM 1, we will develop patient case scripts specific to adolescent HIV- related care and counseling needs in Kenya and establish the number of training interactions necessary to reach competency. AIM 2 is a cluster randomized controlled stepped-wedge trial assessing the impact of SP encounters on the proportion of adolescent patients retained in care at public HIV treatment facilities in Kenya. In AIM 3 we will determine the cost effectiveness of the SP intervention. These data will contribute valuable information to HIV programs in Kenya and other low-resource settings, providing a potentially scalable strategy to improve adolescent linkage to and retention in critical HIV services."
"9339529","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Prostate cancer is still one of the leading causes of death in men of developed countries including the U. S., despite of the recent progress in its diagnosis and treatment. Although the advanced tumors initially respond to therapies such as androgen ablation, anti-androgen or the taxane-based chemotherapy, most of them develop resistance and the disease relapses. Therefore, there is an urgent need for better understanding of the resistance mechanisms and to identify markers and therapeutic targets for personalized treatment and improving survival. Current evidence supports the notion that multiple diverse pathways and mechanisms drive tumor resistance to different therapies including chemoresistance. Therefore, it will be highly significant if key resistance driving factors that interface the seemingly complex arrays of pathways can be identified. This proposal is based on our recent identification of an epigenetic regulator/histone methylase protein as a key factor of prostate cancer cell survival, proliferation and tumor growth. It functions as a novel co-activator of AR and NF-kB for induction of cell survival, pro-inflammatory gene and kinase signaling programs. Interestingly, it is induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and is overexpressed in prostate cancer tumors with high Gleason scores. Here, we wish to establish its function in driving chemoresistance and elucidate its functional mechanism as a key activator of multiple pathways involved in therapeutic resistance. We will also examine the epigenetic regulator for the potential value as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target."
"9330783","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         In the VA population, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, increases from <5% among adults 18-44 years old to nearly 50% among those >85 years old. CKD is associated with many adverse outcomes including the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as higher rates of mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), CKD- related complications and functional decline. While the presence of abnormalities in kidney function in older Veterans with CKD are clearly associated with adverse health outcomes, many of these patients have multiple co-morbid conditions and diminished functional reserve across a range of organ systems. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and CVD and the burden of frailty and disability are substantial in older adults with CKD. In the geriatric population, the presence of these other conditions may diminish the value of a purely disease-oriented approach that focuses only on the role of intrinsic kidney abnormalities in understanding trajectories of kidney function. In contrast, an individualized, patient-centered approach prioritizes patient goals and preferences and recognizes that observed signs and symptoms in older adults are often multi-factorial reflecting the complex interplay between one or more chronic predisposing and acute precipitating events. With this in mind, we propose an incremental research agenda to better understand the predictors, outcomes and significance of different longitudinal trajectories of kidney function in older Veterans. Only a few prior studies have evaluated longitudinal trajectories of kidney function. These studies demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity in kidney function trajectories in patients with CKD and that many patients follow a non-linear disease trajectory. Furthermore, qualitative work has suggested that uncertainty about the expected course of CKD appears to be an important concern among both patients and providers. In Aim 1, we will identify long- term predisposing factors and short-term precipitating factors associated with a decline in eGFR trajectory among older Veterans with CKD using multilevel change regression models. In addition to traditional measures of kidney disease burden, we will evaluate a range of time-varying factors of special relevance to older adults such as use and dosing of medications and intercurrent health events such as acute illness and hospitalization. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the association of different eGFR trajectories with both traditional CKD outcomes and nontraditional, patient-centered outcomes of relevance to older adults with CKD (e.g., nursing home admission). Finally, in Aim 3, we will examine how older Veterans view and prioritize challenges related to CKD self-management at specific points along different eGFR trajectories using the nominal group technique (NGT). Knowledge of these barriers will allow us to better engage patients in shared-decision making and problem solving strategies as well as design patient- and family-centered interventions directly targeting these barriers. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to changes in health status or acute insults. However, prior studies have not addressed how dynamic changes in the health of older CKD patients impact eGFR trajectory. Further we do not know the significance of eGFR trajectory from the patient's perspective. To fill these knowledge gaps we propose a comprehensive approach using both advanced statistical methods and an innovative qualitative component that will identify (1) time-varying and event-based factors associated with a decline in eGFR trajectory, (2) patient-centered outcomes associated with eGFR trajectory, and (3) patient-reported barriers to CKD self-management at specific points in eGFR trajectory."
"9347376","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is estimated that over 10% of all American couples suffer from infertility, a topic of great importance to NICHD and cited frequently by this Institute. Professional American women & those from all developed nations increasingly delay childbearing for several years compared to the past because of career advancement and increasing social acceptability. This problem is not solely a woman?s health issue but equally affects men as only 40% of infertility is attributable solely to women, while an estimated equal 40% is attributable to the male partner who also contributes to another 20% of combined female & male causes. Currently, recombinant (r) human (h) follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is the single largest therapeutic component of the infertility market with sales considerably in excess of $1 billion per year, of which 40-50% of that total over $500 Million per year in the much higher priced and growing US market and another 40% in the European market. Several infertility consultants to the Trophogen PIs have confirmed that rhFSH therapy for infertility is much too expensive for most American women as the cost is not covered by insurance in many states and, even if covered, there are often prohibitive out-of-pocket costs. In addition, the results with current rhFSH treatments are far from optimal with only an average response rate of 30-35% per cycle, and much worse for women over 35, especially for greatly under-reported ?poor responders?. The latter include both to conventional first line in vivo FSH stimulation performed with intrauterine insemination (IUI) as well as to more effective but costly and invasive in vitro fertilization (IVF). Poor responders often produce fewer than 5 oocytes per superovulation cycle of variable quality and may require repeated cycles up to 6 or more to achieve a full term pregnancy, if they are successful at all, with devastating emotional and financial cost to infertile couples. Moreover, rhFSH stimulation is an important component of many rapidly growing additional markets limited only by cost; elective and medical egg banking, ethical preferred sexing of IVF babies & especially important to the PIs, future disease prevention using cutting-edge entire genome screening of IVF embryos for even more than currently screened chromosomic aberrations, all known monogenic diseases and even proclivity to complex genetic and epigenetic diseases the latter using newest metabolomics techniques. To be most effective in disease prevention, all such methods also require an improved rhFSH analog to produce the largest possible number of high quality IVF embryos of which only 2 and in the future only 1 will be transferred to the uterus. Trophogen has recently designed a 3rd generation neoglycosylated, long-acting bovine FSH analog already licensed to Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health and the world?s largest animal pharma) which has performed extensive due diligence on the safety and all aspects of the superiority of this analog compared to all currently used wild-type animal FSH products. This new bovine FSH analog has recently inspired the homologous design of the hFSH analog on an hFSH template 40 amino acids different from the bovine. Using the expedited FDA 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory track for Biosuperiors and with all these attributes (potency, maximal efficacy, long action, much lower production costs than big pharma using only inexpensive internet marketing with no need for a sales force), Trophogen is confident it will still be highly profitable, pricing its vastly superior new FSH analog in the US well below that of both currently branded FSH as well as coming biosimilars to quickly assume a dominant position within the infertility treatment market in the US & globally. In the current studies, the PIs propose in Phase 1 to: establish unequivocally the superiority of the lead TR44701 molecule based on extended in vivo testing & stimulation of ovarian weight, size & number of antral follicles; to establish a master Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell bank for future good manufacturing practices (GMP) production providing high level expression of the lead FSH analog; produce & purify additional larger of the final FSH analog candidate in roller bottles or bioreactors sufficient to submit an IND using methods of production and purification optimized in preliminary data research studies; Phase 2: transfer Trophogen?s previously developed smaller scale GLP production methods and purification methods developed in Phase 1 to the GMP facility of its about-to-be selected foreign pharma partner or alternatively to an outstanding commercial GMP facility tentatively-selected with previous methods now adapted to major up-scaling for large commercial disposable bioreactors plus addition of required new viral clearance steps; obtain larger amounts of GMP material sufficient for an FDA agreed-upon Phase 1/2 combined clinical trial as well as only one more final Phase 2B clinical pathway for Biosuperiors; perform all FDA-required efficacy, specificity, stability, metabolic, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and analytic studies; Perform FDA-IND-required toxicology studies without repro-tox studies with supplemental support from NCATS BrIDGs; preparation & submission of IND. Advanced development of this vastly superior FSH analog on a low cost, Fast-track NDA for Biosuperiors using internet marketing will make rhFSH treatment for infertility & many other growing markets, for the first time, much more effective & affordable for US & women throughout the world!"
"9401746","1 Project Summary:  2 Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular South Africa is disproportionately challenged by a burden of deadly  3 infectious diseases including tuberculosis (TB). South Africa has the highest burden of TB in the world  4 (22.5% of the global burden). Furthermore, TB that is resistant to existing drugs is on the rise. However,  5 there are very few new drugs for TB in the drug discovery pipeline. Further, it is not encouraging to note  6 that in the current era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, new drugs are faced with a real threat of 7 pathogen resistance emerging soon after clinical use; as was recently observed with bedaquiline,  8 whereby resistance was detected 2 years after clinical use. The combination of increasing multidrug  9 resistance, global population density and international travel urgently calls for the development of 10 novel therapeutics for TB. Under this 5-year mentored K43 award, I intend to investigate a new 11 treatment modality that employs nanoparticles to activate the innate immune system for treatment of TB 12 (immuno-therapy). As a Postdoctoral fellow in nanomedicine at the University at Buffalo, we synthesized 13 nanoparticles functionalized with an immune modulating ligand (?-glucan), and demonstrated that these 14 nanoparticles could stimulate the TB host cells, i.e. macrophages, to produce cytokines and oxidative 15 species known to be critical to the eradication of the TB causative organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis 16 (M.tb). Under this award, I will determine whether this cellular response leads to death of M.tb in 17 macrophages and mice. This study will generate proof of concept data towards the development of this 18 new treatment modality. My prior training in nanomedicine was focused on the synthesis of nanoparticles 19 and how to characterize them. However, my career objective is to be a leader in the development of 20 nanomedicines for the treatment of infectious diseases. Therefore, I intend to undergo extensive training 21 in the biology and immunology of infectious diseases and pharmacokinetics, and to also improve my 22 research leadership skills. I will gain these skills through completing didactic and hands-on training 23 courses and group learning. I believe these additional skills will complement my current skills (in 24 nanoparticle synthesis), to equip me to rationally design nanomedicines and effectively collaborate with 25 infectious disease medical experts throughout my career. My mentorship team comprises established 26 researchers in TB biology and immunology and nanotechnology (South Africa mentors) and drug 27 development (US mentor). I will leverage the scarce resources such as biosafety level 3 facilities as well 28 as the excellent teaching and research environment at institutions in South Africa and the US, to 29 successfully complete my training and research goals. 30 31"
"9544394","Project Summary: Bacterial cells have a repertoire of responses that can be used to survive under different types of environmental stress. Changes in carbon sources cause cells to turn on specific metabolic genes, which are later repressed when those sources are depleted. Antibiotic exposure can trigger the expression of molecular pumps that remove the antibiotic from the cell, or the production of enzymes that specifically degrade it. In a continually fluctuating environment, the process of turning genes on and off can be costly, especially under antibiotic exposures when cells are rapidly killed if the response gene is off. Our work shows that bacteria combine their responses with molecular memory mechanisms that allow cells to avoid the costs of frequent gene regulation in a fluctuating environment. The project will determine the conditions under which molecular memory is a beneficial strategy, and by using a combination of synthetic biology, microfluidics, microscopy, and modeling, we will experimentally perturb and measure the costs and benefits of memory. We will construct bacterial strains with a range of memory levels, and perform competition experiments to determine how cellular memory profiles are tuned to the external environment. The proposed experiments make use of a custom-built microfluidic ?chemoflux? system that we developed, in which bacterial populations grow in monolayers, tracked at single cell resolution under the microscope, while the growth media can be arbitrarily fluctuated in time. Using the chemoflux and our image analysis algorithms, we are able to quantify tens of thousands of cells over hundreds of generations, and thereby measure population dynamics in fluctuating environments at a resolution that was previously unattainable. We will use two different levels of modeling, including a coarse-grained approach in which timescales and rate constants are the main parameters, and the goal is to predict the optimal amount of memory for a given response and fluctuating environment; and a detailed, single cell stochastic model, in which the process of cellular elongation and division is precisely quantified and modeled under changing conditions. These two representations will address different aspects of memory, and allow us to bridge from detailed laboratory measurements to the general biological principles that underlie bacterial survival."

"9386386","BRAIN CONNECTIVITY AND THE ROLE OF MYELIN IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS ABSTRACT The maturation of the myelin sheath is a cornerstone to human brain development and function. Myelination plays a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of efficient communication between discrete brain regions (i.e. brain connectivity) and is additionally believed to underlie a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the current understanding of myelin in ASD is exceptionally limited. Thus, the goal of this proposed research is to examine whether differences in the myelinated white matter microstructure exist between individuals ASD and typical development and to investigate the extent to which the myelinated white matter and its development influences structural and functional connectivity in these two groups. We aim to achieve this goal in two solid steps. In the first phase (K99), we will leverage an ongoing longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study to measure both structural and functional connectivity characteristics in the brain of 40 individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and 40 typically developing subjects. We will additionally utilize advancements in the field of quantitative MRI to implement and acquire measurements of the myelin water fraction, a surrogate measure of myelin content, from these subjects. This data will allow us to perform the first investigation about the role of myelin in autism spectrum disorders and allow us to examine how myelin influences the relationships between structural and functional brain connectivity. In the next phase (R00), we measure and interrogate brain microstructure during early brain development in infants at heightened risk for developing autism. We will examine the cross-sectional neurodevelopmental trajectories of brain connectivity and myelin content in order to provide knowledge and new insights regarding the neurodevelopmental mechanisms that underlie this escalating disorder. We expect that this detailed analysis will result in invaluable information about the structure-function relationships of the brain as well as provide new understanding into the critical role that myelinated white matter has on mediating connectivity relationships of the brain. Our results will reveal new neurobiological mechanisms of the pathogenesis of autism and advance our comprehension about the earliest manifestations of this impairing disorder. The results from the proposed project are thus significant to new understanding of brain imaging phenotypes of autism spectrum disorders and will have direct implications for the development of earlier and targeted intervention strategies."
"9321207","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goals of this proposal are to advance a therapeutic intervention for preclinical or mild forms of IPF by targeting the glycoprotein MUC5B with a novel mucolytic agent and to develop a biomarker profile relevant to the detection of preclinical/mild IPF. This approach is based on the following rationale. First, MUC5B is a validated target in IPF. The MUC5B promoter SNP rs35705950 has been validated as a risk variant for IPF in six independent studies, is the strongest known risk factor for the development of both familial and sporadic forms of IPF (odds ratio H 6-8 per allele), and represents a risk variant observed in at least half of the cases of either familial or sporadic IPF. Second, MUC5B appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. The MUC5B promoter SNP is associated with enhanced MUC5B expression in both unaffected subjects and patients with IPF, IPF patients have significantly more MUC5B gene expression than unaffected subjects, MUC5B message and protein are expressed in the pathologic lesions of IPF, and we have recently found that Muc5b deficient mice are resistant to both bleomycin and asbestos models of fibroproliferation. Third, our results suggest that excess mucus appears to be pathogenic in the preclinical/mild stages of IPF. While the MUC5B promoter SNP is the strongest known risk factor for IPF, we have shown that the MUC5B promoter SNP may identify preclinical/mild stages of interstitial lung disease, providing further evidence that excess mucus appears to be relevant in the preclinical/mild stages of disease.  Based on these observations, we speculate that the MUC5B promoter SNP places individuals at risk of developing IPF via chronic mucus hypersecretion and accumulation in the peripheral airspace that impairs mucociliary transport, results in mucus adhesion in the bronchoalveolar region, and consequently induces and potentiates chronic inflammation and injury. We further postulate that terminal bronchiolar and possibly alveolar epithelial inflammation/injury as well as subsequent fibroproliferation induced by MUC5B can be overcome, in part, by reducing agents such as inhaled, long-acting mucolytics, particularly in the preclinical/mild stages of disease. Thus, we hypothesize that an inhaled mucolytic agent will prove effective in delaying the onset and progression of preclinical/mild IPF. Milestones: Following the UH2 phase, we will select one long-acting, inhaled mucolytic agent that: 1) decreases lung mucus; 2) reduces fibroproliferative lung disease in mice; and 3) has an acceptable TI. A secondary milestone includes the development of biomarkers that identify individuals with preclinical/mild IPF. Following the UH3 phase, we will be fully prepared to submit an IND-application to the FDA. This will require that we: 1) manufacture and scale up production of the long-acting inhaled mucolytic agent; 2) complete toxicology studies in rats and dogs; 3) determine validity of peripheral blood biomarkers for preclinical/mild IPF; and 4) develop a clinical formulation/dosing strategy for controls and patients with IPF.

The first two specific aims include the development and implementation of 7 molecular diagnostic assays for retroviruses and herpesviruses that are already on the bioexclusion list, and a novel arterivirus that has recently been identified in research baboons. Application of these assays will allow us to identify incipient infections in nursery-raised animals sooner, thus decreasing the attrition rate from the nursery. The next two projects involve genomic sequencing efforts to further define the animals within the SPFBRR and to improve the quality of research studies. The first of these genetics projects is to sequence the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I mRNA transcripts of all of the breeding animals in the SPFBRR to identify the complete repertoire of MHC class I genes. This information will allow us to perform MHC class I genotypes on all progeny animal in the colony to better inform future research studies. The second genetics project will be to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) on 26 animals from the SPFBRR: the genomes of all 13 male breeders and one offspring from each of them will be sequenced. This information will allow us to calculate a 7 to 8 generation genomic pedigree analysis to better manage future colony breeding genetics, and it will also allow us to search for functionally significant genetic variations that could help to direct and inform future research projects. The final applied research project is a pilot study to use female retired breeder beagles as surrogates for nursery-raised baboons. The goal of this project is to provide some additional ?maternal? contact to ensure behaviorally normal adult baboons for the SPF breeding colony."
"9171455","Research Education Component (REC) Program - Abstract A major research focus of the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center (BU ADC) is the intersection between brain aging, cognitive decline, and the long-term effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is now widely recognized as a significant cause of progressive dementia in professional athletes who have sustained repeated mild TBI. The BU ADC is committed to training the next generation of leaders in clinical, basic, and translational research in neurodegenerative diseases including CTE. To this end, the Research Education Component (REC) will leverage the unique expertise of the BU ADC and affiliated faculty at BU to provide advanced training in clinical, basic, and translational research as it relates to CTE and to common themes of neurodegeneration including the basic mechanisms, as well as their clinical, cognitive, and behavioral sequelae. The scientific and research training of the REC will be focused on:  (1) CTE, including its pathology, pathophysiology, risk factors, genetics, biomarkers, clinical symptoms, and  behavioral manifestations, and (2) common themes related to neurodegeneration, including how pathology, pathophysiology, risk factors,  genetics, biomarkers, clinical symptoms, and behavioral manifestations of CTE compare and contrast to  other neurodegenerative diseases such as those that lead to frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive  aphasia, corticobasal syndrome, dementia with Lewy bodies, AD, and others. For example, research topics may include comparing and contrasting the role of tau in various neurodegenerative disorders, and its spread through the brain as one final common pathway. Other research topics may include comparing the pathophysiology and behavioral manifestations of the emotional dysregulation in CTE compared to that of the frontotemporal lobar degenerations. The REC will thus prepare the next generation of clinicians, researchers, and clinician-scientists to treat, understand, and develop new therapies not only for CTE but for the entire spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases in aging."
"9401999","PROJECT SUMMARY Amblyopia is a disorder of visual acuity caused by disruptions in vision during an early critical period. The neural basis for amblyopia has predominantly been studied using ocular dominance plasticity. I recently discovered a distinct critical period for high spatial acuity in visual cortex that precedes the ocular dominance critical period. In this proposal, I aim to take advantage of this key insight and dissect out the specific neural circuits responsible for high acuity responses. Using in vivo calcium imaging of large populations of cortical neurons, I will determine the development of high spatial frequency tuned neurons in mouse visual cortex. I hypothesize that the emergence of high acuity vision involves the emergence of a subpopulation of high spatial frequency tuned neurons. Previously, I showed inhibitory interneuron transplantation induces recovery of high acuity vision in amblyopic mice. I will use a calcium imaging to determine whether our previously reported transplant induced restoration of acuity in amblyopic mice involves the restoration of high spatial frequency tuned neurons. If successful, this work will be provide insight into the neural circuits underlying high acuity vision and may lead to new insight for amblyopia research.!"

"9410277","Project Summary/Abstract  Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability and expense in the U.S. Maladaptive beliefs about pain and physical activity are central risk factors for development and maintenance of LBP. Individuals with elevated maladaptive pain beliefs become trapped in a cycle of continued pain and disability through avoidance of common physical activities which they associate with harm and (re)injury. The proposed project will capitalize on recent mixed-reality gaming technologies in combination with an innovative robotic walking treadmill system to develop an individualized, high-quality, intervention designed to challenge maladaptive beliefs and promote physical function/reduce disability. People with LBP can benefit from daily, vigorous walking regimens to prevent secondary complications and improve psychological and social well-being. This project integrates a VR-gaming platform with an existing robotic treadmill-based walking apparatus. The robotic treadmill system takes advantage of the user?s ability to drive the treadmill belt speed and steer the rotational and vertical direction of their body, and the ability of the apparatus to deliver both assistive and resistive forces horizontally against the person?s body. This Phase I SBIR will comprise development of the gaming intervention based on existing prototypes, as well as user feasibility and effect size estimation. A subsequent SBIR Phase II project will streamline the current system in order to reduce costs and promote access to and dissemination of intervention to a wide range of users within public fitness centers and other health-related environments. Our application proposes the following aims: Aim 1: To develop and implement a VR-gaming platform that provides progressive and accessible walking challenges for individuals with chronic LBP and high pain-related fear by utilizing visual, interactive, and motivational elements afforded by a mixed-reality paradigm. In total, this system will generate a gaming environment where an individual with chronic LBP can experience accessible challenges and control their walking experience in a variety of motivational and inspirational settings. Aim 2: To determine the feasibility of the VR-gaming walking platform for individuals among chronic LBP and high pain-related fear, and to calculate effect-size estimates for maladaptive pain beliefs, self-reported pain, disability, and walking performance in the VR-gaming environment. Participants will be asked to engage in structured performance designed to challenge an individual to walk further and faster and against greater physical challenge. The proposed project is significant, innovative, and timely because it will (a) represent the first application of VR-gaming to promote walking behavior among individuals at risk for continued back pain and disability, (b) provide a platform for future treadmill and other walking products adapted to home, community, and clinical settings, and (c) has the potential for important public health impact by incorporating a therapeutic modality into low-cost and widely accessible technology, thereby allowing large-scale treatment provision and testing."
"9359607","The function of the Surgery and Physiology Core (Core B) is to provide the expertise, equipment, and facilities needed for all of the in vivo murine and porcine studies. Specifically, Core B will be responsible for all surgical and cardiac catheterization procedures (coronary artery occlusion/reperfusion, delivery of cardiac mesenchymal cells [CMCs], delivery of CMC-derived extracellular vesicles [EVs], and endomyocardial biopsies), echocardiographic analyses, invasive hemodynamic studies, magnetic resonance imaging studies, and maintenance and genotyping of transgenic and knockout mouse lines. Accurate physiological measurements and surgical procedures in mice represent technically demanding tasks that cannot, and should not, be attempted in every laboratory, but rather should be performed by a group of dedicated investigators who focus on studies in mice and thereby acquire extensive experience with this difficult model. Similarly, studies in large animals such as the pig are complex, expensive, and technically challenging, and require experienced and skilled investigators and staff. One of the main advantages of this Program Project is that it provides all four Projects with access to complex and technically challenging in vivo mouse and pig models of myocardial infarction (MI) and cell therapy, expert physiology and surgery, and state-of-the-art techniques that otherwise would not be available to these investigators. This is a major benefit to all investigators. Core B consists of a team of skilled, highly-experienced investigators who have worked together cohesively for many years focusing exclusively on murine and porcine studies (Dr. Guo has performed >31,000 surgical procedures in mice and Dr. Tang >600 procedures in pigs), have developed and perfected murine and porcine models of MI and cell therapy utilizing state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, and have collaborated extensively with the other investigators in this PPG. An important feature of Core B is that it will use a new technique for delivering CMCs ? percutaneous intraventricular infusion in the mouse, which was recently developed in our lab. Compared with standard intramyocardial injection, percutaneous intraventricular infusion offers the advantage of enabling repeated cell administrations in the same mouse with very low mortality. Another feature is that all echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and MRI analyses will be performed off-line by blinded observers. The capacity of the Core has been tested during the current funding cycle. In the past 5 years, the Core has successfully assisted all four Projects, resulting in a total of 27 full-length original papers, and has performed a total of 4,654 procedures in 5,029 mice (including 2,964 transgenic/knockout mice provided by our transgenic facility). These procedures include 2,029 coronary occlusion/reperfusion protocols, 1,060 injections of cells or vehicle, 333 implantations of minipumps for BrdU/IdU delivery, 1,396 echocardiograms, and 291 invasive hemodynamic studies. These numbers eloquently illustrate the research output that the Core can produce."
"9344391","Slc26a6 knockout results in altered gut oxalate secretion and stone formation. Two groups recently knocked out Slc26a6 in mice. With proximal tubule (PT) oxalate secretion knocked out, one might predict that mice would develop hypo-oxaluria. However, the findings are the opposite, i.e., the Slc26a6-/- mice have hyperoxaluria and CaOx stones. Decreased intestinal ox2- secretion was demonstrated in one model. These knockout animals could give us insight into the pathophysiology of ox^ stone-formation, however, there has been little additional insight in the past several vears from these mice because, in part, the experiments are slow-going (i.e.. Slc26a6(-/-) mouse generated in 2006)."
"9344394","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Nephrolithiasis is common, affecting up to 10% of the population. Symptomatic stone episodes produce significant pain and suffering, as well as great individual and societal economic costs. Much effort has been directed towards understanding metabolic abnormalities that can increase urinary supersaturation, which is clearly one key factor that initiates and favors stone growth. However, crystal-crystal and crystal-cell interactions also appear to be critical events during the early stages of stone formation. Therefore, increased understanding of the factors that modulate the interface of urinary proteins and crystals, and hence their subsequent interaction with other crystals or cells, is a necessary prerequisite for identifying new therapeutic targets. Such knowledge will in turn enable development of new strategies for the treatment and prevention of renal stone disease.  Therefore, the urinary phenotyping core will serve 4 key functions in support of this Urology O'Brien Center:  1) Quantification of urinary components of the supersaturation profile  2) Quantification of urinary inhibitor activity  3) Renal biopsy processing, including staining of sections, and quantification of calcifications  3) Biobanking of urine, blood, renal tissues, and stones  The Urinary Phenotyping Core will directly support Projects 2 and 3, and it will likely be of value for pilot projects initiated during the Center's activities that require biobanked samples or urinary assays."
"9545944","Ovulation is an indispensable reproductive event; yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control ovulation is still incomplete. Activation of proteases leading to extracellular matrix disassociation is an essential step for follicle rupture and ovulation to proceed. Involvement of several metalloproteinase families including members of ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs), MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases), and ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) in ovulation and tissue remodeling has been suggested. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating key proteinases and identities of essential enzymes that are responsible for the recurring tissue remodeling process have not been established. Our preliminary data suggest that a member of ADAMTS family, ADAMTS9, is likely a downstream target of nuclear progestin receptor (PGR), and is mainly responsible for ovulation. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 to generate global and conditional knockouts of ADAMTS9, and characterize these knockouts to determine whether knockout ADAMTS9 affects ovulation and fertility in zebrafish. If ADAMTS9 is a key downstream enzyme of PGR that is important for ovulation, we should be able to rescue PGR knockout anovulation phenotype by overexpressing ADAMTS9 in PGR knockout fish. In addition, we propose to determine the expression, regulation and functions of ADAMTS9 during ovulation in zebrafish, in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways for ovulation. We will determine expression of both transcript and protein of ADAMTS9 during the development of oocytes, and in the follicular cells of preovulatory oocytes around the ovulation in zebrafish. We will also determine whether the expression of ADAMTS9 is hormonally regulated by gonadotropins and/or progestin. We will then determine whether PGR regulates ADAMTS9 directly or indirectly via other transcriptional factors. For the first time, the regulation and functions of ADAMTS9, particularly in the follicular cells of oocytes, will be comprehensively determined in a vertebrate model. The ADAMTS9 knockout models will be very valuable resource for future studies. The functions of ADAMTS9 in ovulation and fertility will also be established in a zebrafish model, which will provide a foundation to study the functions and regulation of ADAMTS9 in mammals, as well as the development of new drug targets and novel non-steroid treatments for infertility, tissue remodeling, and cancer."
"9450413","Project Summary  Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a group of genetic disorders that abrogate T cell development and function. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the standard treatment, for the disease, which is typically fatal by age 2 years if not treated. HCT can be performed successfully in SCID patients without the high dose pre-HCT busulfan conditioning typically used, due to the lack of functional T cells. Despite restoration of T cell function, humoral immunity remains poor in many patients post-HCT. This project seeks to test the efficacy and safety of a regimen of low dose, individualized targeted busulfan compared to moderate dose in SCID patients at risk of poor humoral outcome undergoing non-matched sibling donor HCT. We will target patients without active infection, leveraging the widespread implementation of universal newborn screening in the United States. We hypothesize that in our proposed multi-institutional randomized phase II trial patients receiving low dose busulfan will achieve similar outcomes compared to those receiving moderate dose (myeloablative) busulfan, achieving both T and B cell immune reconstitution.  In Aim 1, we will examine immunological and safety outcomes in trial participants. Patients who lack matched sibling donors, confirmed to have the appropriate genotype, and who do not have active infection will be recruited over 4 1/2 years. Within each of 2 genotype cohorts (IL2RG/JAK3, RAG1/RAG2), 32 patients will be randomized to cumulative area-under-the-curve exposure of busulfan of 30 mg*h/L versus 60 mg*h/L (32 patients per cohort, 64 patients total). IL2RG/JAK3 patients will also receive rATG and RAG1/RAG2 patients will receive rATG, fludarabine, and thiotepa. Stem cell sources include unrelated and haploidentical related donor products that will be TCR??+/CD19+ depleted with no post-HCT GVHD prophylaxis. The primary endpoint is protective antibody response to tetanus, a gold standard of normal humoral immune function in children, by 2 years post-HCT. Secondary endpoints include reconstitution of T cell number, thymic output, cell type specific chimerism, response to live viral vaccines at 3 years, survival, and incidence of HCT related complications.  In Aim 2, we will examine the correction of T and B cell abnormalities in depth. The central question is whether mixed/split chimerism (donor-derived T cells with mixed chimerism in the B and myeloid compartments) will nevertheless be associated with normal immune phenotype, function, repertoire and tolerance in one or more genotypic cohorts. We hypothesize that generation of memory B cells, antibody- secreting cells and correction of pre-existing abnormalities of the B cell receptor repertoire post-HCT will be evident in all genotype cohorts and that the degree and quality of correction in the setting of mixed chimerism will vary according to the biology of each genetic abnormality. We hypothesize that T cell exhaustion seen in patients undergoing HCT in the absence of conditioning will be diminished or absent in trial participants due to improvements in thymic output associated with engraftment of donor-derived HSC. We hypothesize that T cell tolerance will occur by different mechanisms (central deletion versus peripheral regulation) according to donor type (haploidentical versus well matched unrelated donor) yet will be induced successfully in patients with mixed chimerism."
"9248787","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)          Objectives: To develop drugs for treatment and prevention of multidrug resistant malaria that are safe for use in children and pregnant women and that may be co-formulated with other drugs for prevention and treatment of active infections, for transmission blocking, and to aid in worldwide efforts to eradicate the disease. Introduction: For each of the estimated ?1 million people killed each year by malaria there are hundreds that are severely sickened by the disease. Indeed, malaria is one of the most frequent causes of sickness and death in the world today but especially in sub-Saharan Africa where its victims are primarily young children and pregnant women. And the situation is worsening due to the spread of Plasmodium strains that harbor resistance to multiple drugs including the quinolines chloroquine (CQ), amodiaquine (AQ), quinine and mefloquine. In some areas of the world, especially in SE Asia, multidrug resistance (MDR) has forced an absolute reliance on the artemisinin combined therapies for treatment of malaria. And now there are reports of increasing response times and artemisinin resistance in malaria parasites from Cambodia. Findings to date: We have used sontochin (SQ) as a guide to create pharmachins with alkyl or aryl substituents at the 3-position of the 4-aminoquinoline core. Modified with an aryl substituent PH-203 exhibits low nM IC50 values against MDR strains and in vivo efficacy against patent infections of P. yoelii in mice that is superior to CQ. With SQ and PH-203 as structural leads for optimization we have generated a library of >300 analogs varying the aryl substituent at the 3-position while optimizing the scaffol for in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy. Our results show that 3-position aryl pharmachins represent potential CQ and AQ replacement drugs. From here to there: We discovered that SQ is active against MDR P. falciparum strains. We then replaced the 3-position CH3 group with an aryl ring to produce analogs with impressive low nM IC50's vs. MDR strains, low ED50's vs. murine malaria, that were curative at 16 mg/kg in the 4-Day Peters test. Our efforts to optimize the 3-position aryl substituent as well as the 4-position side chain continue. For the proposed work we will focus on 3-position alkyl pharmachins, to optimize a sub-series with impressive antimalarial properties. Consider PH- 255with single digit nM IC50 values against MDR falciparum strains and with an ED50 value of less than 0.5 mg/kg against patent malaria infections in mice. Specific Aims: 1. To evaluate and optimize 3-position alkyl-pharmachins for antimalarial activity in vitro against MDR resistant strains of P. falciparum and in vivo vs. a rodent species of malaria, P. yoelii, 2. To evaluate and optimize 3-position alkyl-pharmachins for metabolic stability (t1/2) and fate in both murine and human microsomal systems and assessment of pharmacokinetics in vivo (in mice), 3. To conduct in vitro risk assessment tests on selected 3-position alkyl-pharmachins for potential genotoxicity in a prokaryotic system (Ames tests) and hERG channel inhibition, and 4. To establish the propensity for (and including mechanism of) 3-alkyl-pharmachin resistance in P. falciparum parasites (Dd2) in vitro. Methods: We will follow a standard drug optimization routine involving iterative synthesis and screening of 4- aminoquinoline analogs of the our lead 3-alkyl-pharmachins to enhance: in vitro potency against MDR P. falciparum parasites including clinical isolates from Cambodia with resistance to artemisinin; in vivo efficacy in malaria infected mice, metabolic stability, pharmacokinetics and safety. VA relevance: We seek to develop a safe CQ replacement drug for treating and preventing malaria without the neurological side effects of existing alternatives such as mefloquine. Rapid therapeutic intervention with a cocktail of safe antimalarial agents may avoid unnecessary toxic exposures (i.e., febrile conditions compounding the stress of warfare and combat readiness) that may otherwise have enduring long-term health consequences."
"9297402","Project Summary   Mice are currently the best available animal models for molecular neuroscience research because they  allow the integrated use of genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis in a  single organism. All three Research Projects of our Udall Center rely heavily on genetically modified mutant  mice. Thus, the major goal of this Mouse Core will be to generate, characterize and distribute commonly used  mice to each Project efficiently and effectively. We propose two Specific Aims for the Mouse Core. In Aim 1,  we will generate floxed LRRK1 (fLRRK1) and fLRRK2 mice, which will be used by all three Projects, and will  perform molecular characterization to ensure that the fLRRK1 and fLRRK2 alleles express normal LRRK1 and  LRRK2 mRNA, respectively, and that in the presence of Cre recombinase the deleted LRRK1 and LRRK2  alleles represent complete loss of function null alleles. In Aim 2, we will breed, genotype and distribute multiple  lines of mice that will be used in all three Projects in an efficient, cost effective way with high quality control. In  summary, the Mouse Core will serve and coordinate research efforts in all three Research Projects in our Udall  Center by providing standardized generation and characterization of the mutant mice and optimal use of the  available funds."

"9318508","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal responds to RFA-DK-13-507, which requests applications from existing Discovery Sites participating in the Multi-Disciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network. Our team at the University of Washington Discovery Site seeks continuing support to participate in efforts to unravel the enigma of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). We will conduct the required Project 1, the Trans-MAPP UCPPS Symptom Pattern Study, and capitalize on our findings from our twin studies and our cohort of UCPPS patients. This large study is a longitudinal investigation of UCPPS symptom patterns and phenotypic features that will provide a platform for standardized recruitment and phenotyping on which to base our other 3 projects. Project 2 will design new clinical tools for patient reporting that can be evaluated by rigorous scientific methods. Project 3 builds on exciting preliminary findings from our study of monozygotic twins who are discordant for interstitial cystitis symptoms. In Project 3, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to examine neural connectivity among UCPPS patients and healthy controls before and during the application of a fluid challenge paradigm to provoke urinary pain. Project 4, which is also informed by findings from our twin study, is basic science/translational work that evaluates epigenetic, telomeric, and bioinformatics approaches in urinary epithelial cells and blood specimens to identify biomarkers for UCPPS diagnosis, disease activity, natural history, and predictors of symptom change. Therefore, our overarching Specific Aims are to 1) Correlate clinically significant longitudinal urological and non-urological symptom patterns with phenotypic characteristics among patients with UCPPS; 2) Create patient-centered clinical tools, including aids to attain treatment goals, electronic patient dashboards, and smartphone symptom diaries that are relevant to providers and both useful and satisfying for UCPPS patients; 3) Ascertain whether particular brain structures are associated with urinary urgency and pain, and compare functional brain connectivity in people with and without chronic urological pelvic pain; and 4) Compare methylation patterns and leukocyte telomere length in UCPPS patients and healthy controls. All projects are designed to be exported to other Discovery Sites. The MAPP Network has transformed the study of UCPPS by encouraging researchers to adopt a broad, systemic view of UCPPS and use novel, multidisciplinary approaches in basic, translational, and clinical science. However, much still remains to be learned about the etiology and natural history of UCPPS, and about the best ways to measure symptoms and outcomes. Our proposed Discovery Site will link clinical epidemiology with basic and translational science in interdisciplinary research of the highest scientific and programmatic caliber."

"9324204","ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus affected 382 million adults worldwide in 2013 and is expected to increase in prevalence to 592 million people by the year 2035. Foot ulceration continues to be a major comorbidity of diabetes and afflicts as many as 25% of subjects with type 1 and 2 diabetes during their lifetime. Lower limb amputations due to poor DFU management are a global burden that is associated with a 77% 5-year mortality rate and cumulatively costs the system approximately $70,000 per patient. Effective prevention and treatment of foot ulcers can be hindered due to a lack of objective standards to quantitatively track foot health and assess treatment outcomes. The broad goal of this research is to develop Modulated Imaging, a new clinically-viable tool which provides quantitative insight into disease stage, progression and therapeutic response, into a clinically-viable tool for screening and managing diabetic foot ulcers. MI is a non-contact imaging technology that determines the in-vivo concentrations of subsurface chromophores relevant to tissue health (i.e. hemoglobin, oxygenation, edema and scattering). The goal of this proposal is to develop a user-friendly dedicated MI platform system for studying the value of MI-derived biometrics (like hemoglobin, oxygenation, and scattering) in the diabetic foot. In this Phase II program, we will build a DFU-MI device and perform three pilot studies to assess the capability of our technology to impact diabetic foot care. First, we will characterize vascular reactivity in control and feet considered ?at risk? for ulcer to determine normative MI biometrics. Second, we will study our ability to predict new wound formation in feet that are considered in ?remission? but with a >35% chance of re-ulceration. Finally, we will study lower limb perfusion changes after vascular intervention for and existing wound to assess efficacy prior to wound closure. Our Phase II research will determine the insertion point of MI technology into DFU clinical care and provide insight to future Phase III clinical study hypotheses and designs in order to build a medical imaging device with indications specific to wound prediction and healing."
"9339564","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary/Abstract Multiple sclerosis is a devastating disease of the central nervous system that affects thousands of US veterans. MS frequently initially presents as temporary tingling or numbness in extremities or blurred vision. However, with time these events result in an accumulation of deficits leading to irreversible motor, sensory and cognitive dysfunction. Presently, there are no cures for MS. Treatment are available but their efficacy is highly variable and loss of motor function appears irreversible. Although classically described as a demyelinating disease, more recent studies have shown that axonal pathology is prevalent in MS and that this axonal pathology may be responsible for the irreversible loss of function associated with the disease. Here, we present strong preliminary data that challenge this view of MS. We show that a specific domain along the axon, known as the axon initial segment is structurally disrupted independent of demyelination indicating that axonal pathology in MS is a primary event and not merely consequential to demyelination. Structural disruption of the axon initial segment is functional devastating to the CNS since it is within the initial segment where i is decided whether an action potential will be generated. If our hypothesis is current, then disease onset does not parallel demyelinating episodes but occurs significantly earlier. Although our findings could revolutionize the view of MS onset, more importantly, we present strong preliminary data that disruption of the axon initial segment is reversible. Presently, we provide morphologic data suggesting reversibility. In this proposal we will test functional reversibility. Together, the studies outlined in this proposal are designed to challenge the current thinking of MS onset and the pathologic mechanisms that mediate the earliest stages of the disease. Moreover, we will further investigate the possibility that dysfunction that results form MS is reversible."

However, the size and diversity of our environment requires thoughtful management  and coordination, both to maximize program productivity and to attract and maintain interest in work relevant to  our goals of supporting research along translational pathways targeting intellectual and other developmental  disabilities. The Administrative Core has and will continue to meet these challenges by: (a) managing all  Center activities, (b) promoting productivity through coordination of activities across all components of the  IDDRC, (c) setting policies for ensuring that Core services reflect the highest standards of quality and for  maximizing utilization efficiency, (d) encouraging interactions with other Centers and implementing  collaborative efforts that support the development of the IDDRC national network, (e) providing technological  and financial resources for new and continuing research efforts, and (f) contributing to the training of students  and early career professionals and, more broadly, stimulating interest in developmental disorders throughout  our institution.  In keeping with the history of the KKI/Hopkins IDDRC, the leadership will again shift as Dr. Cataldo completes  his eighth year as Center Director. Specifically, Dr. Cataldo will remain Director until the end of the current  funding cycle, whereupon the Directorship will be assumed by Dr. Silverman, who has served as Co-Director  for several years and who has taken the lead with the preparation of this application. Dr. Cataldo will then  remain as Co-Director, continuing to provide strategic oversight and heading up across-center collaborations."
"9547957","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interindividual differences in pharmacological response contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality often associated with therapeutic treatments of disease. Genetic variation represents a major source of this variability. Yet despite  considerable research effort over the past 20 years to identify genetic and other causes of variable drug response, much remains unknown. We posit that this is the result in part of unrecognized gene-environment-drug (GED) and polygenic-drug (PGD) interactions. While the challenges in conducting research in this area are considerable, we believe that significant inroads to understanding GED and PGD interactions can be made by developing sound mechanistic hypotheses and careful design of basic and translational studies. In this Program Project grant application, we propose three, highly interactive research Projects, and two supporting Cores, that together will develop and apply novel, generalizable approaches to understanding and predicting GED and PGD interactions in the context of preventing thromboembolic events in individuals with cardiovascular disease through the use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet drug therapies. The interaction of environmental exposures and anticoagulation/antiplatelet drugs with the vitamin K-dependent coagulation and platelet activation cascades offers an exceptional opportunity to study GED and PGD effects. Central to this effort will be our continued collaboration with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations of the Northwest and Alaska who have unique and often well-defined dietary and other environmental exposures that preliminary data suggests modify the coagulation pathway and platelet function; enrichment of unique, functionally important genotypes; and reduced genomic heterogeneity overall, compared to the general US population. Moreover, there is a strong moral imperative to conduct health research with AI/AN people, as they are often left out of such investigations and, thus, do not receive the potential benefits that such research can provide. Thus, our overall Program goals are to: 1) to advance our understanding of how genetic and environmental factors affect anti-coagulation and anti-platelet pharmacological responses, and 2) to more broadly improve the national environment for genomic research with AI/AN populations."
"9514563","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although it is now apparent that the incidence and symptoms of diseases, as well as responses to treatments, are different between males and females, sex- and gender-related research remains a persistently understudied, yet vitally important, component of health research. These differences extend to laboratory animals and even to cell lines in bench research. The Utah Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health Career Development Program (Utah BIRCWH Program) will provide University of Utah junior faculty members with mentored research experiences that will focus the sex and gender lens on their discovery, translational, and clinical research training. The Utah BIRCWH Program will provide a bridge to research independence and will create a cadre of independent scientists addressing clinically important women's health issues. The Utah BIRCWH Program will focus outside the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology to draw Scholars from across the University, its CTSA affiliated institutions, and across the nation. BIRCWH Program mentors will come from research communities across the campuses of the University and also our CTSA partner institutions (Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake VA, Utah Department of Health). We will leverage the Vice-President's Clinical and Translational science (VP-CAT), an established and highly successful academic career development program. The VP-CAT program (and its administrative predecessor) has had 46 consecutive graduates transition to extramural funding and obtain academic medical faculty positions. Utah BIRCWH Scholars will have full access to these successful programs. At the core of VP-CAT is the Matrix Mentoring Model (MMM). The MMM combines self-mentorship with mentorship from senior faculty, scientific experts, peers, and staff to produce unparalleled success in academic career development. The Utah BIRCWH Program's consideration of Scholar candidates from across the University campus and beyond bespeaks the multiple dimensions of women's health and the widespread interest in this Program. The Principal Investigator, PD, and Advisory Committee Chair have >50 years (between them) of mentoring experience and NIH funding and are committed to developing the next generation of multidisciplinary women's health researchers. An Advisory Committee will be formed and will meet quarterly to review Scholar's career development plans, their progress, and the contributions of their mentorship teams. The Utah BIRCWH Program will fund two Scholars at a time, with appointments anticipated to last at least two years. All Scholars will be junior faculty, having completed their clinical or graduate training within six years of their appointment. The Utah BIRCWH Program intends to have all of its graduates pursue full-time academic careers supported by peer-reviewed extramural funding and is committed to providing the resources for this success."
"9469803","ABSTRACT  Previous efforts in our lab have uncovered that consumption of a fatty diet leads to a reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons in mice. Voluntary exercise has been shown to protect neurons in several brain areas from different types of injuries. The primary objective of this project is to determine if participation in voluntary exercise is capable of protecting the neurons of the olfactory system from the detrimental effects of a fatty diet. Beyond protection, I also intend to determine if the well-established neuromodulatory effects of voluntary exercise extend to the olfactory system. The evidence that associates olfactory disorders with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer?s, continues to grow and for this reason it is important to investigate the effects of both diet and exercise on this oft-ignored sensory system. These studies will be accomplished through modification of diet composition to induce obesity, application of pair-feeding to manipulate body weight gain, provision of a home cage running wheel, histological analyses to determine anatomical changes, and electrophysiological analyses to assess changes in cellular biophysical properties. The basis of these experiments is the hypothesis that a fatty diet creates an inflammatory environment that damages the olfactory system of mice and voluntary exercise is a neuromodulator of the olfactory system that will prevent this damage if the mice are allowed to participate in such exercise while they subsist on a fatty diet. The specific aims designed to investigate this hypothesis are 1) To determine if ingestion of a fatty diet without overconsumption, and therefore without the concomitant weight gain, is sufficient to decrease olfactory sensory neuron abundance and their correlate axonal projections. 2) To determine if voluntary exercise is capable of preventing and/or abrogating the structural loss in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that is caused by consumption of a fatty diet. 3) ? To determine if voluntary exercise ameliorates the loss of insulin modulation in mice challenged with a fatty diet. Electrophysiological properties of the olfactory bulb primary neurons will be determined and compared."
"9378905","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Therapy & Research Center (CTRC) seeks renewal of its NCI designation originally awarded in 1991. The only academic Cancer Center in South Texas, the CTRC serves a large and predominantly Hispanic catchment area. The mission of the CTRC is to reduce the cancer burden in South Texas through the highest quality cancer care, ground-breaking research aimed at reducing the incidence and mortality of cancer, education of future cancer scientists and clinicians, and cancer prevention programs focused on our unique population. Dr. Ian M. Thompson, Jr., Director of the CTRC and the CTRC Senior Leaders have organized an interdisciplinary group of 78 cancer researchers (both basic and clinical) from two schools and 11 Departments within the UTHSCSA into three Programs: Cancer Development and Progression (CDP), Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) and Cancer Prevention and Population Science (CPPS). These Programs are supported by 7 Shared Resources: Genomics, Next Generation Sequencing, Macromolecular Structure and Interactions, Mass Spectrometry, Flow Cytometry, Optical Imaging and Biostatistics. The CTRC also requests support for its Clinical Trials Office (CTO). Since 2008, improvements in the CTO have led to an increase in accruals, but importantly, an increase in interventional trials from 394 accruals in 2008 to 796 accruals in 2012. The CTRC has also made efforts to serve its catchment area illustrated by the fact that 46% of patients enrolled in interventional therapeutic clinical trials are Hispanic.    Today, the UTHSCSA has $30,681,682M in annual total extramural research funding; a 74% increase from 2008. Of that $8,948,865M is from the NCI. Since 2008, 31 cancer-related clinical and research faculty have been recruited to the CTRC. All but one of the CTRC Senior Leaders are new since 2008. In 2011, UTHSCSA added 25,000 sq.ft. of CTRC-designated space in the new South Texas Research Facility, increasing CTRC-designated space to 285,193 sq.ft. The CTRC also invested in administrative infrastructure to support the CCSG and the research enterprise at the CTRC, in pilot funds for transdisciplinary research, and infrastructure to support clinical trials. The growth of the CTRC over the past 5 years is evidence of the commitment of the Center and its members to cancer research. Our members continue to make significant contributions to the cancer research field and develop novel approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, all with a continual focus on the predominantly Hispanic catchment area we serve."
"9339733","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Constitutive STAT3 signaling participates in tumorigenesis by stimulating cell proliferation, mediating immune evasion, promoting angiogenesis, conferring drug and radiation resistance, and tumorigenesis. The persistent STAT3 activation is frequently detected in human medulloblastoma cell lines and primary tumors of the most frequently occurring malignant brain tumor, medulloblastoma, in children. The central hypotheses of this project are: STAT3 phosphorylation is expressed in cancer tissues in four medulloblastoma groups and targeting persistent STAT3 signaling using LY5 in combination with cisplatin and radiation therapy is an effective approach for medulloblastoma therapy. The hypotheses are supported by our recent data demonstrating that STAT3 phosphorylation is expressed in medulloblastoma cell lines and primary tumor samples. LY5 inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis of human medulloblastoma cell lines but has little toxicity in normal human cells and tumor-free normal immunocompetent mice. In addition, we observed that combination of LY5 with cisplatin or irradiation exhibited stronger inhibitory effect in medulloblastoma cells. Furthermore, our preliminary the pharmacokinetic data showed that LY5 has high oral bioavailability and good blood brain barrier penetration. The objectives of this proposal are to build on these initial findings to further understand the upstream signaling responsible for STAT3 activation in medulloblastoma, STAT3 activation in different subgroups, and to evaluate the biologic activity of combinational treatments in medulloblastoma mouse models. Our long-term objective is to move a STAT3- selective inhibitor such as LY5 into clinical evaluation in patients as a STAT3-targeting drug for medulloblastoma therapy. We will test the central hypotheses through the following specific aims: (1) Characterize STAT3 phosphorylation in four subgroups of medulloblastoma and investigate the mechanisms responsible for STAT3 activation. (2) Characterize the biologic effects of the novel STAT3 inhibitor LY5 on medulloblastoma cells. (3) Evaluate the inhibitory efficacy of LY5 in mouse medulloblastoma models in vivo."
"9215537","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Aphasia is a communication disorder that affects 80,000 people per year and estimates suggest that VHA outpatient clinics see 2000 new cases of aphasia each year. As in other healthcare disciplines, speech-language pathologists are increasingly called upon to document the impact of their interventions with respect to functioning, activities, and social participation. One response has been the development of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures for a range of health conditions. The goal of this proposal is to enhance the validity and clinically utility o a new PRO measure for veterans with aphasia, the Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure (ACOM). This tool will assist clinicians and researchers in responding to growing mandates to focus on patients' experiences in improving the quality and efficiency of care. In the initial fiel trial of the ACOM, a plausible and clinically useful measurement model for the ACOM was identified; its covariance-based reliability was estimated to be high; and it was found to correlat positively with other measures of communicative functioning and language performance as predicted. The next steps in maximizing the ACOM's clinical utility are to assess its sensitivity t change over time, the stability of its measurement model, and its relationships to other relevant variables. First, the responsiveness of the ACOM to treatment-related change will be assessed in collaboration with 3 independent VA RR&D-funded treatment studies by collecting pre- and post-treatment data from at least 60 participants to test whether the ACOM demonstrates reliable positive change in response to treatment. Estimates of its responsiveness and minimally important difference scores will be obtained. Second, confirmatory tests of the ACOM measurement model and the stability of its item parameters will be conducted in a sample of 300 participants with aphasia in order to verify that its internal structure applies to the intende population. Test-retest stability of score estimates in the absence of treatment will also be assessed this sample. Third, in a sub-sample of 240 participants with aphasia, correlations among the ACOM, a performance-based measure of language impairment, and concurrent PRO measures of communication, cognitive, and physical functioning will be estimated to evaluate convergence with more related constructs and discriminant evidence for less related constructs. We will also use data collected from this subsample to assess the unique contribution of ACOM for predicting communication-related well-being over and above a measure of language impairment and a PRO measure of general negative mood. The outcomes of this proposal will include (1) estimates of the responsiveness of the ACOM to treatment and benchmarks for interpretation, (2) evidence supporting the validity of the ACOM's internal structure and the stability of its item parameters, and (2) evidence supporting claims that the ACOM in fact measures the underlying construct of patient-reported communicative functioning."

"9247702","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The rotator cuff tendon (RCT) is the primary dynamic stabilizer of the glenohumeral joint and dysfunction can lead to abnormal joint kinematics, ultimately causing cartilage degeneration and cuff arthropathy. RCT pathology is common, present in up to 70% of cases that seek medical attention for shoulder pain. However, not all RCT pathology is equivalent and clinical decision making can be heavily influenced by knowledge of tissue status. Additionally, conventional MRI is limited due to the short T2 properties of tendon and the magic angle effect, which causes signal intensity changes in anisotropic structures dependent on orientation within the magnet. These changes often far exceed that produced by disease. This application proposes to perform a study that will implement quantitative MR biomarkers on RCT, which has not previously been performed. We have developed three new purpose-driven, ultrashort time-to-echo (UTE) sequences to combat the confounding factor of the magic angle effect while imaging the majority of the constituents of the RCT, which include water, collagen and proteoglycan/GAG. These sequences include multi-echo UTE-magnetization transfer, UTE bi- component, and adiabatic UTE-T1rho techniques. In our first aim, we compare the sensitivity of novel and conventional MR pulse sequences to the magic angle effect in RCT. Our hypothesis is that our novel UTE sequences will be resistant to the magic angle effects compared with conventional sequences. In our second aim, we propose to compare the relationship between novel UTE sequences and standard clinical quantitative sequences in an in vitro model of RCT degeneration with biochemical and histopathologic reference standards. Our hypothesis is that our novel UTE sequences will more strongly correlate with changes in RCT microstructural integrity. In our third aim, we apply the aforementioned techniques in whole shoulder specimens with normal and degenerated RCTs, implementing histopathologic and biomechanical reference standards. Our hypothesis is that novel UTE sequences will allow non-invasive tissue characterization (both structural and biomechanical). In our final aim, we will translate the novel  MR pulse sequences to a cohort of patients with unilateral shoulder pain, utilizing measurements on the contralateral asymptomatic shoulder and clinical assessment tools as reference standards. Our hypothesis is that novel quantitative MR sequences can be successfully translated to the clinical setting where they can aid in the non-invasive characterization of RCT quality. Ultimately this information could be helpful to the orthopedic surgeon for pre-operative and post- operative tendon quality assessment."
"9326320","The goal of the proposed STEM BUILD@UMBC initiative is to create a comprehensive, multidimensional  model for a public research university to increase the number of students from all backgrounds completing  majors in the life and behavioral sciences and entering graduate school and/or the STEM workforce.  Through the nationally recognized Meyerhoff Scholars and MARC U*STAR programs, and other initiatives  focused on increasing minority participation in STEM, UMBC faculty, staff, and administrators have learned  key lessons about the importance of building community among aspiring STEM majors, setting high  expectations, and providing students with significant research experiences and academic, financial, and  social support. UMBC is nationally recognized as a model of innovation and inclusive excellence, and the  campus is the leader among predominantly white Institutions - and 6* among all universities - in the number  of African American bachelor's degree recipients who go on to complete STEM Ph.D.s, with two-thirds of  those alumni completing Ph.D.s in the life sciences (NSF, 2013).  The proposed STEM BUILD Research Enrichment Core will draw on UMBC's history of innovation as  we conduct a five-year investigation of the most effective strategies to engage students in STEM coursework  and research, and prepare them for careers involving the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Currently,  UMBC's successful scholarship programs focus on students who begin their undergraduate studies with  strong preparation in STEM. However, large numbers of additional students aspiring to major in these  subjects may be at risk of switching to other majors or not graduating. The STEM BUILD@UMBC initiative  will work to retain these students in STEM by expanding access to research and internship experiences for  students, and continuing work to support the pre-transfer preparedness of students at partner two-year  institutions. It will also expand efforts to incorporate applied learning experiences (i.e., traditional internship  or one-on-one mentoring) into the academic program through active-earning courses and opportunities to  participate in professional development training and workshops (e.g.. Introduction to a Research University),  Biomedical Case Study and Responsible Conduct in Research courses, and Affinity Group Research  courses. In addition to the comprehensive support requested for 80 BUILD Trainees, UMBC plans summer  paid practicums involving novel research and research preparation are planned for up to 90 additional  students enrolled at partner institutions over the five-year grant period."

"9339532","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Vision loss in elderly Veterans from age-related eye diseases such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration or Retinitis Pigmentosa is a significant cause of morbidity. The cellular and molecular signaling pathways in the eye that maintain normal retinal function and the mechanisms by which aging compromises their functions to cause retinal degeneration are poorly understood. Our long-term objective is to decipher the mechanisms required for normal retinal function and to identify how disruption of these mechanisms contributes to vision loss during aging. We have recently discovered that patients lacking Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) develop age-related vision loss. ATF6 encodes a key transcriptional regulator of cellular responses to endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress. The precise functions of ATF6 in normal retinal development, in survival of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium during aging, and in development of age-related vision loss are unknown. Our central hypothesis is that ATF6 plays a key role in photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial cell function and viability. Guided by this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim #1. Determine the role of ATF6 in retinal pathology. ATF6 knockout mice develop age-related vision loss by unknown mechanisms. ATF6 is important for cells to survive oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses, and we will analyze retinal phenotypes in ATF6 knockout mouse to see if stress responses are abnormal in the retina. In particular, we will focus on photoreceptor and Retinal Pigment Epithelial (RPE) cells because these are two cell types that are essential for vision and are highly sensitive to environmental or pathologic stresses. Death of these cells also causes many age- related retinal diseases. Aim #2. Examine the role of ATF6 in age-related retinal degeneration and vision loss. We will use novel chemical and genetic tools to artificially activate the ATF6 signaling pathway in the eye after intraocular injection into the vitreous or sub-retina. We will test if artificial ATF6 signaling using these chemical or genetic tools can prevent age-related retinal degeneration and vision loss in an animal model of retinal degeneration that develops because of excessive oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress in photoreceptors. Aim #3. Characterize the function of human ATF6 mutations linked to vision loss. We have identified mutations in ATF6 that are associated with vision loss in patients. It is unclear how these mutations affect ATF6 protein function and why mutant ATF6 bearing these mutations causes vision loss. We will perform site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro studies to characterize the biochemical and functional properties of mutant ATF6. In parallel, we will investigate how cells bearing mutant ATF6 tolerate and survive oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The significance of these studies is that they will decipher the role of ATF6 in retinal survival and in retinal degeneration. These studies will positively impact patient care at the VA by defining new molecular pathways that can be targeted to treat the underlying causes of vision loss in aging Veterans."
"9313976","Project Summary/Abstract: The commensal Bacteroides spp. account for about 30-40% of total bacteria in the human colon. This environment is a highly competitive ecosystem and in order for Bacteroides spp. to maintain their high cell number, they need to compete efficiently for the available nutrients such as iron with other microorganisms of the microflora. Nutritional iron has a remarkable influence on the gut microflora. The competition for iron changes the commensal microflora and iron foraging by commensals protect against colonization by pathogens and colitis. This supports a role for Bacteroides spp. in intestinal iron homeostasis. However, the iron acquisition mechanisms utilized by Bacteroides spp. to compete for iron in the complex microbial ecosystem of the human colon have not been examined. In this application we show that Bacteroides fragilis utilize ferric iron-bound siderophores produced by other organisms (xenosiderophores) to grow under iron limiting conditions anaerobically. In addition, we have identified a TonB-dependent outer membrane transporter present only in B. fragilis, BfFchA1, involved in the utilization of ferric iron-bound siderophore for growth under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, we propose that iron is dissociated/reduced from the ferric iron-siderophore complex in the periplasmic space because the internalization of iron is dependent on the transmembrane ferrous iron transporter system FeoAB. Thus, these studies will expand our understanding of B. fragilis iron homeostasis and its contribution to intestinal colonization. For this application, our hypothesis is that BfFchA1 and FeoAB are critical for B. fragilis iron acquisition during gut colonization. To test our hypothesis, we will in aim 1) define the role of BfFchA1 in ferri-siderophore assimilation anaerobically and in aim 2) define the role of BfFchA1 and FeoAB in B. fragilis intestinal colonization in a mouse model. The long term goal of these studies is to provide targets that could lead to the development of new probiotic therapeutic strategies for the prevention or treatment of intestinal disorders in view of B. fragilis beneficial immunomodulatory properties."
"9513173","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bullying, sexual violence, and dating violence among adolescents are all major public health problems that occur at relatively high rates and demand attention to alleviate the considerable suffering they cause. These problems share developmental correlates and evidence is emerging that bully perpetration and victimization is concurrently and longitudinally associated with sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and teen dating violence involvement (Basile et al., 2009; Espelage et al., 2012). Despite the costs of bullying, the impact of prevention programs in the US has been disappointing, especially in middle-schools. Social-emotional learning (SEL) programs are reducing aggression in US schools (Durlak et al., 2011), in part, by helping students develop social and emotional skills to manage conflicts, but effects could be greater. Data presented in this application strongly suggest that to increase effects, school-based bullying prevention programs need to: 1) integrate evidence-based approaches that focus on different levels of influence (individual, peer, school), 2) focus on gender-based harassment and violence (i.e., sexual harassment and violence, dating violence, harassment and violence associated with sexual orientation and/or gender-role nonconformity) and 3) address a major driver of bullying and gender-based harassment and violence - traditional masculine ideology and homophobic name-calling. Thus, this application proposes a large-scale RCT comparing the Second Step (CfC, 2008) program to a gender-enhanced Second Step + Shifting Boundaries program (SB; Taylor et al., 2011). The SB program combines a classroom curriculum that addresses sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and dating violence with whole-school strategies to decrease these outcomes. School-wide strategies include school protocols for responding to dating violence and sexual harassment and increased monitoring of hot spots. Twenty-eight middle schools (grades 6 - 8) from two school districts in Illinois will be randomly assigned to either the Second Step only condition or the gender-enhanced Second Step condition (Second Step/SB). Two cohorts (6th and 7th graders) will complete baseline and follow-up surveys. Study aims are to evaluate the differential efficacy of the Second Step: Student Success Through Prevention program (Second Step) versus a gender-enhanced Second Step program (Second Step/SB) on reducing bullying, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and teen dating violence; to assess the extent to which gender-enhanced Second Step versus Second Step results in greater increases in positive bystander intervention around bullying, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and teen dating violence; and to test the extent to which the intervention impacts peer-level attitudes toward bullying, sexual harassment, homophobic name-calling, and teen dating violence through its effect on peer social dynamics. This study is highly innovative and could have substantial public health impact by targeting bullying, dating violence, and sexual harassment."

In 2008, the Center was renewed for an additional five years of funding support With that renewal, the Center continue to build upon its core research to renew and refine the biomaterials, bioreactors and imaging tools while expanding its research portfolio to include more complex tissues, and more sophisticated data acquisition and control strategies. Great strides have been made toward this goal during the past eight years.  Tissue engineering and regenerative medicie continue to rely on advances at the fundamental level, while supporting clinical and industrial effrts with significant impact on human health. As we look to the next five years, TERC is uniquely positined to help advance the field precisely because it maintains a core research program in the fundamental of tissue engineering (stem cell biology, tissue biomechanics, bioreactor design, biomaterials development, integration with imaging), while pushing the field forward with preclinical studies, translation activities, development of platform technologies, and disease modeling. Our research ha spawned collaborative projects, service projects, and many other opportunities that feed into our fundamental research. As we continue to develop more complex and customized biomaterial and bioreactor systems, we initiate collaborations in new tissue types and disease states.

"9270567","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The placenta is the nexus between the fetus and mother; placental health is absolutely central and critical to both fetal and maternal health. The placenta is the source of nutrition and oxygenation for the fetus, allows the fetus to eliminate waste, protects it from toxins, environmental exposures, infectious agents and rejection by the maternal immune system, and produces hormones that support the pregnancy. Abnormalities in placental structure and function underlie complications associated with pregnancy, including preterm birth, miscarriage and stillbirth, and hypertensive disorders such as preeclampsia. Therefore, monitoring placental function is necessary in order to prevent adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus. Early detection of changes in placental function provides the opportunity for increased pregnancy surveillance and treatment. As is the case with every other organ, the functional state of the placenta is reflected by changes in the expression of coding and non-coding genes. Thus, monitoring the transcriptome of the placenta allows for a comprehensive assessment of placental function. The challenge is to be able to assess placental transcriptome without using invasive methods (e.g. placental biopsy) because these methods pose a risk to the pregnancy. To be clinically relevant, this method must be robust, reliable and able to use on large numbers of clinical samples at reasonable costs, and be able to monitor the full placental transcriptome. Unfortunately, these goals are not possible with existing technology. Our laboratory has developed an RNA sequencing method to comprehensively and quantitatively profile extracellular RNA (exRNA), specifically, placental microRNAs (miRNAs), found in maternal circulation. In the proposed project, we will advance this method and develop technology that will enable non-invasive monitoring of the placental transcriptome through the maternal blood and urine. In Aim 1, we will develop two new technologies, automated exRNA Isolation (AxRI) and total short RNA sequencing (tsRNAseq) that will enable isolation and sequencing of coding and non-coding exRNAs from the maternal blood and urine. In Aim 2, we will apply these new technologies to monitor placenta-specific exRNAs in the maternal blood and urine of term and first and second trimester pregnancies; these earlier time points are important because these is the gestational ages when changes in the transcriptome will be the most clinically relevant and biologically informative. In Aim 3, we will define the precise cell-origin of placenta-specific exRNAs to provide contextual information to analysis of the exRNAs. Therefore, the scope of this project provides the unprecedented opportunity to leverage cutting-edge technologies for exRNA isolation and detection, sequencing, and bioinformatics, in order to develop a tool to non-invasively monitor the transcriptome of the placenta in real time. This tool can then be used to gain insights into pathogenesis of pregnancy-related diseases, identify high-risk pregnancies before the onset of end-organ damage and, ultimately, provide therapeutic interventions to improve maternal and neonatal health."
"9322354","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study (CKiD) is a multi-center, prospective cohort study of children aged 1 to 16 years with mildly to moderately impaired kidney function at study entry. Two clinical coordinating centers (CCCs) (at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH) in Kansas City), a central laboratory (at the University of Rochester), and a data coordinating center (at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) have formed a cooperative agreement to conduct a prospective study of chronic kidney disease in children. Since its inception in 2003, the scientific aims of CKiD have been to determine the risk factors for decline in kidney function and the effects of kidney function decline on risk factors for cardiovascular disease; growth failure and its associated morbidity; and neurocognitive function and behavior. The purpose of this application is to request funds to continue the cohort study from August, 2013 to July, 2018. The aims of the current proposal are to assess and improve the accuracy and precision of the CKiD estimating formulas in youth with early CKD, to define the risk of kidney disease progression in children according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification of CKD according to Cause, GFR and level of albuminuria, to define risk factors for accelerated and non-linear decline in GFR among strata of children with glomerular compared to non-glomerular diagnoses and in African Americans, and to assess physical performance, arterial stiffness and myocardial structure and function as GFR declines. The East Coast Clinical Coordinating Center investigator has clinical expertise in kidney disease in children, clinical research design, recruitment and retention, quality control of study procedures, and organization of collaboration across the multiple participating sites in CKiD. The CKiD study encompasses a geographically and racially diverse cohort. The structure of CKiD and its support of ancillary studies continue to stimulate novel approaches to identify risk factors for kidney disease progression. The infrastructure of CKiD continues to serve as a platform for career development awards for junior investigators and ancillary R01's for more senior colleagues. With longer follow-up and additional recruitment of subjects with mild kidney dysfunction and glomerular disease, we will continue to characterize novel biomarkers of kidney injury that are associated with CKD progression and its sequellae to inform future therapeutic trials."
"9339520","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is a serious clinical problem due to its high and rapidly increasing incidence rate, and the limited treatment options currently available. This disease has now overtaken other histological types of esophageal tumors in the US. The major risk factor for EA is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which affects 10 to 20% of the US population. Under conditions of GERD, esophageal cells are ex- posed to acidic gastric juice frequently mixed with duodenal bile acids. The reflux exposure causes chronic inflammation, and excessive tissue and DNA damage, resulting in the accumulation of tumorigenic alterations and progression to EA through Barrett's metaplasia (BE). However, the majority of GERD and BE patients re- cover without malignant transformation, with only a fraction going on to develop an esophageal tumor. It is therefore important to uncover mechanisms that underlie tumor progression, to enable both the identification of targets for screening at risk patients and the development of new preventive therapies for esophageal tumors.  We have developed an innovative hypothesis to investigate specific mechanisms of DNA damage repair in conditions of esophageal reflux injury and to apply this knowledge to design novel chemopreventive therapies. This hypothesis is supported by strong preliminary data from human tissues, animal models, and extensive in vitro studies. We have demonstrated that the p73 protein plays a critical role in esophageal tumorigenesis and regulation of DNA damage repair under conditions of esophageal reflux injury caused by GERD. We have also identified a new group of chemopreventive compounds that can specifically activate the protective function of p73 and decrease DNA damage caused by reflux.  We will build on these findings to further investigate the role played by p73 and other members of the p53 protein family in the progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. In aim 1, we will dissect the mechanisms of DNA damage repair regulated by p73 under conditions of esophageal reflux. In aim 2, we will investigate esophageal tumorigenesis in vivo. We will employ gastroesophageal reflux injury mouse models and esophageal organotypic cultures to recapitulate human GERD-associated pathology and dissect the mechanisms of DNA damage repair. These studies will be complemented with analyses of human esophageal precancerous and cancerous lesions. In aim 3, we will explore the chemopreventive potential of compounds that induce the p73 protective activity under conditions of GERD.  Our findings will have a strong impact on the understanding of multistep tumorigenesis associated with GERD and BE. Importantly, our results could help to reveal potential risk factors for esophageal tumor development and lay the groundwork for development of novel chemopreventive approaches in at risk patients with GERD and BE."

"9339485","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The alarming increase in overweight and obese individuals in the US is a major healthcare issue since it contributes to higher rates of type 2 diabetes, vascular disease and cardiovascular events. Because dietary saturated fatty acids have been linked to vascular dysfunction and insulin resistance (a prelude to type 2 diabetes), dietary fatty acid manipulation may be an important target for preventing or reversing vascular abnormalities associated with obesity. The focus of this proposal is to address the mechanisms underlying dietary fatty acid-induced vascular dysfunction. We hypothesize two potential mechanisms:  high saturated fat diets may produce abnormal membrane lipid composition which 1) affects formation of specialized membrane compartments (lipid rafts) and activation of signaling molecules or 2) promotes unique sphingolipid signaling pathways within vascular tissue. These abnormal membrane effects of saturated fatty acids may be reversed by enriching the diet with monounsaturated (MUFAs) or polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. To test our hypothesis, we will use a mouse model of high saturated fat-induced obesity and manipulate dietary fat composition to address the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1:  To determine whether replacement of a portion of dietary saturated fats with MUFA or n-3 PUFAs restores vascular function to normal by modifying caveolar versus non-caveolar localization of key signaling molecules. Our working hypothesis is that diets enriched in MUFAs and n-3 PUFAs target endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and/or cyclooxygenase (Cox) to membrane lipid rafts differently than a high saturated fat diet by altering membrane composition. This shift in localization defines their activation and vascular function. We will measure responses of small gracilis arteries and aorta from mice on diets enriched in saturated fats, MUFA enriched olive oil or n-3 PUFA enriched menhaden oil in conjunction with membrane fatty acid composition and localization of eNOS and Cox within lipid rafts. We will compare the effects of diet on vascular function with localization of signaling pathways using wild type and caveolin-1 (cav-1) deficient mice devoid of vascular caveolae to separate effects on caveolar versus non-caveolar lipid rafts. Aim 2:  To determine whether dietary fatty acid saturation affects sphingolipid signaling pathways- specifically sphingosine kinase and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)- to modify vascular function. Our working hypothesis is that dietary fatty acids promote signaling through formation of unique sphingolipid-based proteins that impact vascular function. We will measure responses of small gracilis arteries and aorta from mice on diets enriched in saturated fats, MUFAs or n-3 PUFAs in conjunction with levels of sphingosine kinase and S1P within vascular tissue. We will assess the effects of dietary fatty acids on sphingosine kinase by comparing expression levels and using pharmacological inhibitors and genetically modified mice. High fat feeding of mice is a relevant model for study of vascular complications of diet since mice become obese, develop insulin resistance and abnormal glucose tolerance similar to type 2 diabetics. High fat diets are the greatest cause of obesity in people. These studies are innovative in directly testing the mechanisms involved in effects of dietary fats on vascular function using a mouse model of obesity:  abnormal membrane composition and localization of signaling proteins within specific lipid rafts or fatty acid-dependent signaling pathways. The studies are significant because dietary fats are a known therapeutic target but the optimal diet composition for reversing the progression of cardiovascular disease and the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined."
"9316620","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common event associated with high morbidity and mortality. Ischemia is a major cause of AKI. TRPM2, a member of the transient receptor potential- melastatin subfamily, is activated by oxidant stress, ADP-ribose, TNF and intracellular calcium, all of which are increased during kidney ischemia. We found that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of TRPM2 dramatically reduces ischemic kidney injury. The mechanism involves, at least in part, a TRPM2-dependent increase in Rac1 activity resulting in increased NADPH oxidase activity and oxidant stress. Having identified important and novel roles for TRPM2, Rac1 and NADPH oxidase in ischemic kidney injury, we propose that these pathways may be targeted to prevent acute kidney injury. We will conduct a multifaceted exploration of the mechanisms by which TRPM2 promotes kidney injury. Our central hypothesis is that TRPM2 represents a pivotal target in AKI which integrates multiple injury signals to activate oxidant production and cell death pathways. This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data which clearly indicate that inhibition of TRPM2 or Rac1decrease AKI, oxidant stress and apoptosis. Our approach will employ both in vivo and in vitro models in pursuing an integrated analysis of TRPM2-dependent pathways active in AKI. We will test our hypothesis and achieve the objective of this application by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the sites of TRPM2 expression which are responsible for kidney injury. Aim 2: Determine the mechanism and functional significance of TRPM2-dependent Rac1 activation in AKI. Aim 3: Determine the role and regulation of NADPH oxidase in ischemic AKI. Aim 4: Develop therapeutic interventions to reduce AKI and prevent the AKI-CKD transition. Successful completion of these aims will advance the field by elucidating the mechanistic connections between ion channel activation and subsequent kidney injury while identifying tractable therapeutic targets."
"9321833","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the strong and persistent interest in systems science methods among health researchers, the demand for these skills far outstrips the supply of instructors able to teach them. We propose here the creation, evaluation, refinement and dissemination of a course on Dynamic Systems Science Modeling for Public Health, representing the popular approaches of both System Dynamics and Agent-Based Modeling. The course will leverage the strong and varied background and experience of the applicant team in teaching and disseminating dynamic systems science materials to (1) develop and implement a 1-week workshop on dynamic systems science methods in a program with a track record of drawing students interested in dynamic methods in systems science, (2) iteratively evaluate and refine this curriculum for maximum impact and accessibility; and (3) package the curriculum for broad distribution as a set of stand-alone materials that can be used in public health education without requiring a systems science expert as faculty. Course materials will use interactive exercises and practical, structured mechanisms to introduce students to basic motivations for systems science, the notions, strengths and limitations of models, problem framing and scoping, the basic perspective and model building blocks of each of the two dynamic systems science approaches, discussion of common processes - such as sensitivity analysis and model testing - common to both approaches, varied ways of leveraging data with a dynamic model, and preparing models for publication. Targeted promotion and a generous allocation of earmarked scholarships will help ensure that under-represented groups are well- represented among its US-based target audience."

"9379760","Project Summary/Abstract  With the rapid advances in DNA sequencing, we now have a near-complete human genome, a fairly comprehensive catalog of germline and somatic variants, as well as rich annotations of functional genomic elements. The next challenge in the field is to obtain a complete functional annotation of genetic variants and genomic elements at the cellular and organismal levels. Genome editing technology, in particularly the CRISPR/Cas9 system, has allowed rapid and precise modifications of the genome and connecting of these to functional outcomes. However, all current high-throughput screening approaches rely on phenotypes that can be coupled to cell survival, cell imaging, fluorescent cell sorting, or affinity enrichments. Genetic variants that have more subtle phenotypic consequences, which might represent the majority, are not amenable to such screens. Furthermore, screening of natural genetic variation via assaying of individual cell lines under in vitro culture conditions also has limited throughput and might miss functional differences that depend on specific physiological contexts. In this project we seek to develop a next-generation functional genetic screening method that can overcome these current limitations. Utilizing induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation as an exemplar model system, we will develop and demonstrate our integrated experimental and computational methodology to enable comprehensive and en masse functional screening of coding and non-coding genomic elements. We expect our platform will greatly accelerate the functional annotation of genetic variants, including many variants of unknown significance, across various normal and diseased cell types and tissues."
"9534336","Abstract G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate the actions of a wide variety of hormones and neurotransmitters to control functions in all mammalian cells. As such, GPCRs are major targets of therapeutics. Individual GPCRs directly couple to distinct complements of heterotrimeric G protein ? and ?? subunits that drive downstream signaling pathways to shape the cellular responses that determine GPCR efficacy. Both G? and G?? subunits interact directly with effectors to produce cellular responses. Our laboratory has focused largely on G?? subunit signaling and has identified a series of small molecules that bind to G?? to ?bias? signaling pathways downstream of GPCRs. These inhibitors have been applied extensively to dissect G?? functions in biology, and to validate G?? as a viable therapeutic target. Most recently we have identified a small molecule that activates G?? subunit signaling without activating G protein ? subunits. We have applied this tool to study signaling in immune cells to reveal exciting and previously unappreciated roles for G?i in chemokine- chemoattractant receptor signaling. In this proposal we will examine in detail how G?? activating molecules function at a molecular level, and explore the mechanistic role for G?i in chemoattractant receptor signaling in the following specific aims. Aim 1. Determination of the mechanisms of action of 12155 and M119/gallein on G protein subunit interactions and GPCR coupling. Aim 2. Determining the mechanism(s) for G?iGTP- dependent regulation of cell migration and adhesion. Aim 3. Analysis of spatiotemporal regulation of G?i activation in chemoattractant-dependent directional cell migration. We believe that these studies will reveal a new molecular target and cellular function for G?i in regulation of integrin function that will have wide implications for chemoattractant/chemokine receptor and integrin regulation."
"9402126","Project summary/abstract: This award will support the career development and training of Dr Alisha Wade, an endocrinologist and clinician scientist with an interest in endocrine and metabolic diseases in lower and middle income countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Endocrine and metabolic disorders (EMDs) are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide, but little is known about their relative prevalence in rural South Africa, where multiple independent risk factors such as HIV/AIDS, antiretroviral therapy, increasing life expectancy in adulthood and nutritional transitions interact in ways that likely make the relative burden of EMDs different from high income countries. Early detection and treatment of EMDs would reduce morbidity and mortality, but broad-based population screening in primary care is impractical in low resource settings. Integrating targeted case finding in those at highest risk for key EMDs into routine primary care may prove cost-effective. The long-term objective of this work to identify those individuals in South Africa at highest risk of key EMDs and their sequelae and to develop a cost-effective, pragmatic strategy for their long-term identification and management. The specific aims of the project are to (1) determine the relative prevalence and risk factors of key EMDs in a population based sample of 1630 adults aged 40 years and over in a Black South African population with high prevalence of HIV and HAART use, (2) determine the feasibility of implementing use of a mobile application in primary care to support integration of case-finding for common endocrine and metabolic disorders and (3) determine the cost effectiveness of integrating a case-finding approach to identifying EMDs into primary care. These studies will be nested within the NIA-funded HAALSI project and the NHGRI-funded AWI-Gen project. This research will allow the applicant to develop skills in advanced biostatistics and epidemiology, development and evaluation of complex interventions and health economics, with an emphasis on cost effectiveness analysis, to support her long term career objective of become an independent clinician scientist investigating the evolution of EMDs against the backdrop of high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in lower and middle income countries and developing cost-effective interventions for their detection and management. The applicant will be mentored primarily by Dr. Anne Cappola at the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Stephen Tollman at the University of the Witwatersrand, experts in the endocrinology of aging and aging in LMICs respectively. She will be well supported by the facilities at the University of the Witwatersrand, one of the leading African research institutes. This award will facilitate the applicant's transition to a leading independent scientist in endocrinology in LMICs."
"9358155","RESOURCE CORE ? Project Summary The NIH-funded Specific Pathogen Free Baboon Research Resource (SPFBRR) was developed in collaboration between the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and Oklahoma State University (OSU). Now the future of this valuable colony is uncertain. There has been a recent decision to wind-down the baboon colony and end all nonhuman primate (NHP) research at OUHSC. An exhaustive effort has gone into finding a new home for this valuable colony and a suitable location has been identified. The Michale E. Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research (Keeling Center) in Bastrop, TX is favorably positioned to obtain the indispensable SPFBRR and has all of the necessary infrastructure and support to ensure its future success. Therefore, the overall goals of this P40 application are to transfer ownership of the SPFBRR to the Keeling Center in order to preserve this valuable national research resource of SPF baboons. There, the Keeling Center will preserve and expand the breeding colony in order to form an active, self-supporting, behaviorally healthy, and genetically robust breeding colony of baboons; provide education and training to scientists, veterinarians, colony managers, and animal caregivers learning about baboons; continue research to improve the resource; and, support investigators who need facilities and expertise to conduct animal studies using SPF baboons. The SPFBRR is the only national research resource of laboratory born super-clean SPF baboons available to NIH grantees, intramural research programs of federal agencies including the FDA, NSF, and the NIH, and other sponsors of biomedical research (private foundations, pharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations). Absolutely unique in the entire world, the baboons in the SPF breeding colony have an extensive bioexclusion list of 19 pathogens normally found in other wild and captive monkey colonies. But ridding the baboons of these common pathogens has been challenging. Even so, the SPFBRR has a current population of 125 baboons which includes 52 productive females. At the Keeling Center, the SPFBRR will continue to improve the resources it provides and continue to add new information about the biology and research value of baboon model. Baboons continue to be used extensively for xenotransplant, infectious disease, vaccine development, surgical models, and maternal fetal medicine. New areas of research requiring SPF baboons, such as Bordetella pertussis, Respiratory Syncytial Virus and most recently Zikavirus, continue to emerge. As these new research areas develop, the SPFBRR will be poised to play an essential role by providing the animals, biological resources, and the expertise needed to carry out research in baboons. In the proposed funding period, the SPFBRR will relocate to the Keeling Center where it will increase animals and related resources provided to the scientific community. The baboon MHC1 loci will be sequenced and blood types will be determined for all breeding animals. This information will further refine and add value to the resources provided by the SPFBRR."

Building on existing models for student engagement and success, the initiative will provide important insights into innovative practices to help a broad range of students succeed."
"9389820","PROJECT SUMMARY The ?nutrient-sensing? enzyme SIRT1 lays at the crossroads of a complex array of molecular interactions that impact susceptibility to diseases as diverse as obesity, diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer. One promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity-related morbidity involves small-molecule STACs, which bind the SIRT1 N-terminal region to allosterically increase SIRT1 activity, thereby elevating the expression of catabolic PGC-1?/PPAR? target genes that help to protect against diet-induced obesity. STACs bind SIRT1 in a 3-helix bundle located at the distal part of the SIRT1 N-terminal region. This 3-helix bundle is shielded by an upstream element of the SIRT1 N-terminal region, protecting the enzyme from an unidentified cellular regulator. Thus, identification of cellular proteins that control enzyme activity through interaction with the 3-helix bundle is key to understanding SIRT1 regulation. Our published and preliminary data suggest PACS-2 is one such SIRT1 regulator and that PACS-2, DBC1 and SIRT1 form a novel tripartite hub that controls SIRT1 deacetylase activity. DBC1 binds to the N-terminal region of SIRT1, where it promotes PACS-2 recruitment and binding to SIRT1. PACS-2 destabilizes the critical 3-helix bundle, which inhibits SIRT1 activity and consequently represses SIRT1-dependent activation of PGC-1?/PPAR? target genes. Our long-term goal is to understand how SIRT1 is regulated to control energy homeostasis in humans. The objective of this particular application is to determine how PACS-2 and DBC1 synergize to allosterically modulate SIRT1 enzyme activity and how this regulatory hub controls the response to fasting or overnutrition in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that disruption of the SIRT1/PACS-2 or SIRT1/DBC1 interactions will prevent high-fat- diet-induced repression of SIRT1 and, therefore, protect mice from hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the conformational and mechanistic steps by which the PACS-2/SIRT1 interaction regulates enzyme activity; 2) Determine how synergistic actions by PACS-2 and DBC1 inhibit SIRT1; and 3) Determine the physiologic importance of interactions between PACS-2, DBC1, and SIRT1 on hepatic metabolism. The approach is innovative because it will characterize, from the atomic structure to whole-organism function, a previously unrecognized regulatory hub controlling energy metabolism during fasting and overnutrition. This research is significant because it will uncover how SIRT1 regulators control enzyme activity and how we can influence their functions to improve health."
"9243093","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic viral infection mediates premature T cell aging and vaccine failure through regulation of microRNA-regulated proteins, with an aim to develop effective approaches to improve vaccine efficacy in virus-infected individuals. To this end, we will use a model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine failure i the setting of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The proposal is based on the fact that co-infection of HBV with HCV is common due to shared risk factors, and as such HBV vaccine is required to prevent super-infection and its associated increase in morbidity and mortality; however, vaccine responses in virus-infected individuals are often blunted. This phenomenon is also observed in the elderly who frequently fail to respond to vaccinations; and attempts to improve the rate of immunizations in both infected and aged populations have been unsuccessful, in part due to our poor understanding of the mechanisms that inhibit vaccine responses in these settings. In studying the effect of chronic viral infection on T cell functions, we and others have recently found that chronic HCV infection leads to T cell dysfunction mediated through up-regulation of aging markers, including killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1) and dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), concomitant with a decline of microRNA-155 (miR155) levels in CD4 T cells. Remarkably, these alterations are associated with impaired CD4 T cell functions in HCV- infected individuals and are more prominent in HBV vaccine non-responders (HBV-NR) compared to age- matched HBV vaccine responders (HBV-R). It has been demonstrated that with increasing age, KLRG1 is up- regulated and leads to inhibition of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling; whereas DUSP6 is increased and leads to recalibration of the TCR activation threshold; and miR155 decline is known to permit translation of a set of target genes related to T cell inhibition. However, the mechanisms underlying miR155/KLRG1/DUSP6 expression and regulation of premature T cell aging and vaccine responses during HCV infection remain unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize that HCV-induced loss of miR155 mediates premature T cell aging by up-regulating KLRG1 and/or DUSP6 expressions, such that targeting these inhibitory pathways may rescue impaired CD4 T cell functions and subsequently boost blunted vaccine responses in virus-infected individuals. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out the following two specific aims: Aim 1 will define the transcriptional and translational mechanisms that control miR155 expression and the role of miR155 in regulating KLRG1 and/or DUSP6 expression in T cells during HCV infection; Aim 2 will examine the consequences of miR155 loss and KLRG1/DUSP6 over-expression in T cell function and vaccine response in virus-infected individuals. This translational study is significant in that it provides a working model to explore mechanisms that may be fundamental to diminished vaccine responses in general, particularly in the setting of immunocompromise by HIV, hemodialysis, transplantation, and cancer."
"9454879","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):BRCA1 is a multi-functional breast and ovarian cancer suppression gene that is suspected of operating in this manner by suppressing the development of genome disorder. But how it delivers signals that elicit a clinical cancer suppressing effect is unknown. During the current granting period, we reported that the BRCA1 protein (aka B1), itself, executes at least one of its multiple biochemical functions under tight control afforded bya B1-bound, multi-subunit protein complex, called RAP80. This larger complex is called the RAP80/B1 complex, and it allows B1 to perform at normal amplitude error-free double strand DNA break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination(HR). Thus, RAP80/B1 physiologically regulates B1 HR function, which is a known contributor to B1 cancer suppression. This process is termed `HR tuning'. We have also reported that there is another protein present in RAP80/B1 complexes, i.e. the enzyme PARP1. In these complexes, PARP1 selectively poly-ADP ribosylates (parsylates) the DNA binding domain of B1 to form a parsylated derivative, aka B1pars. RAP80/B1 complex formation and proper B1 parsylation contribute to B1 HR and B1 genome stability control. All of these events take place in and require the operation of specialized, DSB- containing nuclear focal structures (aka IRIF) that form after DNA damage. In this proposal, we will determine: a) whether PARP1-catalyzed B1 parsylation regulates any of the other, known functions of B1, including cancer suppression; b) how the specific PARP1-driven parsylation of B1 is directed to its DNA binding domain; c) whether defects in B1 parsylation and RAP80/B1pars complex formation elicit clinically important contributions to sporadic breast and ovarian cancer development; and d) whether they dictate a specific strategy for achieving effective breast and ovarian cancer therapy."
"9330213","The basal ganglia network is the motor switchboard of the brain and the output of this macrocircuit is dependent on the balance of two opposing pathways, i.e. the direct and indirect pathways. The disruption of this crucial interplay underlies the debilitating effects observed in movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. Emerging evidence suggests that the external globus pallidus, traditionally thought to once function as a mere relay nucleus, is believed to be more complex than previously thought. The external globus pallidus is connected with other neurons in the indirect pathway through complex recurrent feedback loops, suggesting its key role in indirect pathway function. Our work, along with others, has suggested a complex cellular makeup of the globus pallidus. In this upcoming grant period, we seek to better characterize how these types of neurons are connected with the rest of the basal ganglia. The proposed multidisciplinary research strategy will use a combination of electrophysiological, optogenetic, transgenic, viral, transcriptomic, and anatomical techniques in a 6-OHDA, chronic mouse model of Parkinson's disease. In Aim 1, using a Cre/lox approach, subtypes of globus pallidus neurons will be identified and either FACS-purified or patch-clamped. The intrinsic properties of globus pallidus neuron subtypes will be measured and correlated with molecular profiling of ion channel expression. In Aim 2, the connectivity of globus pallidus neuron subtypes with the subthalamic nucleus will be studied. Using an electrophysiological approach, biophysical properties and receptor complement of the subthalamopallidal input will be measured. Pharmacological methods, transcriptomic analysis, and genetic approaches will be used in conjunction to corroborate the inferences drawn from electrophysiological studies. In Aim 3, using an optogenetic approach, the functional properties of the pallidostriatal input will be studied. Identified striatal neurons will be patch-clamped and signaling mechanisms involved in pallidostriatal transmission will be studied. Pharmacological, immunocytochemical, and genetic knockdown approaches will complement this effort. In Aim 4 we will determine how subcircuits of the indirect pathway are altered in a chronic dopamine depletion model that mimics Parkinson's disease. Transcriptomic, electrophysiological, and anatomical analyses will be performed."
"9352237","Project Summary: The Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) is an ongoing multicenter program designed to study clinical and health aspects of female pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). Women & Infants Hospital (WIH) is a women's hospital, uniquely focused on advancing women's health and research and its mission is directly in line with the PFDN. In Cycle #3, the Brown/WIH site demonstrated that we have the scientific expertise, high clinical volume, research infrastructure, and administrative commitment to be successful in this Network. We have made substantive contributions at all levels: scientifically our site initiated 3 studies: ESTEEM (full protocol-currently enrolling), AIM (supplementary protocol-currently enrolling) and PPAR (supplementary protocol-enrollment to begin Winter), we were in the top tier for recruitment with outstanding retention, we made major administrative contributions including leadership in developing the PFDN Policy and Procedures Manual, and we developed advocacy initiatives promoting PFDN studies in southern New England ensuring a diverse study population. The objective of this application is for Brown/WIH to continue as a major contributor to the PFDN in Cycle #4 through the following aims: 1) ensure that Brown/WIH continues to be a Network leader in protocol development and implementation, recruitment, data quality, manuscript preparation and publication, and active support of all Network administrative functions; 2) maintain and continuously maximize our position as a top site in recruitment and retention; 3) develop innovative and translational concepts to scientifically advance the field and care of women with PFDs; and 4) ensure the highest quality of care and research for women with PFDs in New England through wider-reaching advocacy efforts. We have a long- standing, formal relationship with multi-disciplinary collaborators committed to advancing the care of women with PFDs led by Urogynecology (including Urology, Colorectal Surgery, Women's Gastroenterology, Women's Physical Therapy, and Women's Radiology). In 2014 the Division of Urogynecology saw 1800 new PFD patients and performed surgery on 720 patients; vaginal, abdominal, laparoscopic, robotic approaches all represented. New components in this application that will further increase our productivity as a PFDN site in Cycle #4 include: hiring of a 7th clinical Urogynecologist and 2nd nurse practitioner to increase clinical volume; a new, state of the art space with fully integrated clinical and research components dedicated to Urogynecology; advocacy and community outreach through engagement of minority community leaders (e.g. Latino Public Radio) and New England colleagues, and collaboration and commitment of experts in tissue regenerative techniques and biomedical engineering, biomarkers, and microbiome work. Brown/WIH has a multi-faceted application and is uniquely qualified and enthusiastic for the opportunity to continue as a productive member of the PFDN.  "
"9301430","Preserving late-life mobility, defined as the ability to walk safely and independently, is central to maintaining a high quality of life, is critical for the performance of many activities of daily living and is necessary for maintaining physical independence. Therefore, the continued development and standardization of tools that can reliably assess physical functioning and disability status will be important for addressing the growing challenge that societies worldwide will face with the expanding older population. The physical function assessment core seeks to continue to provide the necessary infrastructure to perform standardized, valid and reliable measures of musculoskeletal impairments, physical function, and disability across the spectrum of observational studies and clinical trials embedded within, supported by, or associated with the Boston-OIAC. The leadership of this core has collaborated extensively over the past sixteen years, has unique experience in the application of these measurements across a wide range of cross-sectional and intervention studies in older adults, and has been on the leading edge of the development and refinement of new instruments and technologies to assess domains of physical function and disability. We propose to examine the following specific aims: Aim 1: We will provide an organized infrastructure for FAC-supported procedures and activities across Tufts' Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (Drs. Fielding and Reid), Boston University's Health and Disability Research Institute (HDRI) (Drs. Jette, Latham, and Beauchamp), and Brigham and Women's Hospital Laboratory of Exercise Physiology and Physical Function (Dr. Storer) and serve as focal point for interdisciplinary collaboration by OAIC investigators in the development, evaluation, and application of new and existing tools and instruments to assess musculoskeletal impairments, physical function, and disability in older adults to evaluate the efficacy of function promoting therapies. Aim 2: We will provide direct measurement and consultative services, as well as assist with proposal development for clinical studies supported by, or associated with, the theme of the OAIC that require measures of musculoskeletal impairments, physical function, and/or disability. All Core services will use standardized equipment and operating protocols for the assessment of muscle performance and functional limitations in human studies, and will maintain extensive quality control procedures. Aim 3: We will develop novel and innovative approaches to assess musculoskeletal impairments, physical function, and disability in older adults. The FAC will also support innovative developmental projects that seek to develop or further validate innovative approaches to assess musculoskeletal impairments, physical function, and disability in older adults."
"9519127","The Wnt pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway present in metazoans from Drosophila to humans. Wnt signaling has been shown to play important roles in development. Given that the Wnt pathway is involved in the genesis of a wide variety of human diseases (e.g., over 90% of all colorectal cancers), there is an intense effort to develop therapeutics that target this pathway. Unfortunately, in part due to our incomplete understanding of the detailed mechanism of Wnt signal transduction, progress in developing therapeutics that target this pathway has been slow, and no Wnt inhibitors are currently in clinical use. Our overarching goal is to understand the basic biochemical mechanisms by which a Wnt signal is propagated to ultimately coordinate the formation of tissues, organs, and limbs and to understand how its misregulation can lead to disease states. In over more than a decade, my laboratory has 1) developed the first biochemical system (Xenopus egg extract) that recapitulated key reactions of the Wnt pathway, 2) developed the first mathematical model (Lee- Heinrich model) of the Wnt pathway, 3) provided evidence for a mechanism involving receptor-mediated signaling (via direct inhibition of GSK3 activity) to the cytoplasm, and 4) identified a small molecule inhibitor of the Wnt pathway that has been designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for a familial precancerous disease (familial adenomatous polyposis). Our recently funded work focuses on 1) our newly proposed model describing how ?-catenin, a Wnt transcriptional coactivator, competes with the corepressor Gro/TLE for binding to the transcriptional factor, TCF/LEF, via a process facilitated by the E3 ligase XIAP and 2) a newly identified mechanism by which loss of the APC tumor suppressor leads to activation of Wnt cell surface receptors. For the MIRA grant application, I propose to extend these studies by 1) determining the molecular mechanism by which APC regulates receptor activation, specifically the role of vesicle transport in this process, and 2) pursuing the characterization of a deubiqutinase, USP47, which interacts with XIAP to promote ?-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling. We have undertaken several genome-scale screens to identify new Wnt pathway genes. Based on the results of these screens, I propose to study 1) Wnt signalosome formation involving the transmembrane and vesicular transport proteins: Arl4c, ITSN1, Syndecan-2, and Cdh13, 2) Wnt receptor homeostasis by the USP46/UAF1/WDR20 deubiquitinase complex, and 3) regulation of Wnt gene transcription by the nuclear kinase STK38."
"9244323","Summary The goal of this research is to investigate the relationship between long-term care, housing transitions in later life, and completed suicide among older adults using a large, prospective, population-based registry of suicide deaths. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the US, and older adults have among the highest suicide risk. A key element of suicide prevention is the identification of ?points of engagement? to interact with potential victims prior to suicide crisis. Forty percent of adults aged ?65 will need residential long-term care (LTC) at some point in their lifetime, and currently 1.5 million older adults reside in nursing homes and another 1 million reside in assisted living facilities. Risk factors for suicide, such as social isolation, depression, and functional impairment, are common among LTC residents, and thus suicide risk may be substantial in these settings despite countervailing factors such as regular monitoring by staff. Suicidal behavior in LTC likely reflects a combination of factors shared with community cases (i.e., history of depression) as well as factors that are specific to LTC such as availability, accessibility, and cost. Finally, few studies have examined whether the process of transitioning to LTC is a risk factor for suicide. This project will use Restricted-Access Data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (RAD-NVDRS) to investigate these questions about the relationship between LTC and suicide among adults aged ?50. The RAD-NVDRS spans from 2003 to 2012, collates data from 18 states, and includes information on approximately 40,000 suicide deaths among older adults. The dataset includes both quantitative data on individual-level characteristics of decedents and qualitative text narratives that describe the most salient circumstances surrounding the suicide. This combination of quantitative and qualitative data makes the RAD-NVDRS the most comprehensive registry on the circumstances related to suicide. This study will employ both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to: Aim 1: Characterize and model change suicide in long-term care settings over a 10-year period in terms of social and demographic factors, health history, means of injury, and recent life events; Aim 2: Examine the characteristics and contexts of suicide related to transitioning into long-term care through qualitative text analysis of approximately 40,000 suicide decedent case narratives; and Aim 3: Examine whether geographic variability in suicide in later life is associated with state policies that regulate the availability, accessibility, and cost of long-term care. By merging the RAD-NVDRS with information on state LTC regulatory environments we are able to examine macro-level factors and provide a more generalizable understanding of suicide in LTC. By leveraging the detailed qualitative text narratives we are we are able to gain a higher resolution of knowledge regarding suicide in LTC than could be achieved from relying on quantitative analysis alone. This project embodies the public health model of suicide prevention by focusing on residential and healthcare settings as potential ?points of engagement? for promoting mental health in later life."
"9284469","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) accelerates brain aging and increases the risk for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, there is no treatment for DM-related cognitive decline. Recently, intranasal insulin (INI) therapy has emerged as a potential new solution to deliver insulin safely to the brain and treat DM- related cognitive impairment. Our pilot study showed that a single INI dose of 40IU improved specific cognitive domains and functional connectivity in type 2 DM adults and healthy controls. Previous studies showed that short-term INI treatment is safe and may improve memory in non-diabetic people with cognitive impairment and AD. These studies provided proof-of-concept supporting the potential usefulness and safety of INI; and lay the ground work to determine the long-term effects and safety of prolonged treatment with INI in diabetic population. We propose the following Aims: Aim 1: We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 200 older adults with type 2 DM and 200 non-diabetic controls examining whether 40 IU INI once daily over a 24 week period improves: a. specific domains of visuospatial attention and memory, verbal learning (primary outcomes); b. gait speed during a dual task ( as a predictor of overall health), daily living functioning and depression as compared to the DM group receiving sterile saline and the non-diabetic groups. The non-DM groups will provide reference of INI effects in a clinical phenotype of cognitive decline and insulin resistance that occurs with normal aging. Aim 2: We will determine a phenotype predicting a clinically relevant positive response to INI therapy and identify long-term trajectories of INI effects on learning and memory in the DM group vs. the placebo and the non-DM groups. Clinically relevant predictors will be determined based on associations between cognitive function and gait and demographic, glycemic control, insulin resistance, endothelial function and genetic (ApoE4) measures. The trajectory of cognitive, gait dual task and functional performances will be assessed during the 24 weeks of therapy and at 6 months post-treatment. MRI substudy will explore long-term effects on perfusion and resting state functional connectivity and their relationships to cognitive outcomes. Aim 3: To determine the long-term safety of intranasal insulin vs. placebo with regard to glycemic control (fasting glucose, Hb1Ac, hypoglycemic episodes) and vital signs and body mass. This study will help us to determine the safety of prolonged INI treatment; the best outcome domains; and the best patient characteristics to be used in future large-scale efficacy studies. The clinical phenotype and time course predicting optimal response to INI therapy would make it possible to target INI treatment for maximal benefits for preserving cognitive function in older diabetic adults."

"9324224","PILOT AND FEASIBILITY PROGRAM ? RESEARCH STRATEGY The Pilot and Feasibility Program of the Mayo Translational PKD Center (MTPC) is designed to attract new investigators to PKD research. These investigators can be of three different types: (a) PIs with no past or current NIH funding, (b) established PIs with NIH funding but which have not worked in PKD, and (c) PKD- established investigators (rare) with new or innovative ideas or approaches. The P&F Program goal is to provide sufficient funds to generate obtain preliminary data to support applications for research grants from external agencies, especially R and K awards from NIH. Applications submitted in response to the biannual RFA, use a R03-NIH format and are processed through a two-phase review. Phase 1 is the initial PKD- relatedness screening followed by review and ranking of the internal Scientific Review Committee. In Phase 2, the PIs (of top 6-8 ranked proposals) present their work to the External Advisory Committee (EAC) at the annual retreat. The EAC makes the final ranking and recommendation for the 4-funded P&F grants (two pilots from MTPC funds and two pilots from Mayo Clinic cost-share funds). The metrics for success of the P&F program are (a) abstracts and meeting presentations, (b) peer-reviewed publications and (c) external funding. For the initial period of MTPC funding, the Pilot and Feasibility Program enjoyed success by these metrics. From a pool of 37 received proposals, the P&F program funded 11 investigators: 5 new investigators, 5 non- PKD established investigators and one PKD-investigator (new approach, cycle 3). Funding for the 8 pilots completed resulted in 13 peer-reviewed papers, 10 other abstracts and two meeting, oral presentations. These pilot-PIs also submitted 14 national grants resulting in 5 external and two internal grants funded. Together, the P&F program, the selection process and the success-metrics, help to sustain and expand the Center Membership. The current renewal will allow the MTPC Center to expand as well as enrich the already successful Pilot and Feasibility program."
"9314164","This study will investigate whether black and white patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer report adverse symptoms differently, contributing to diverse treatment decisions and ultimately disparities in health outcomes. Despite significant reductions in breast cancer mortality over the past two decades, black-white (B-W) mortality disparities continue to widen. Among the 70% of breast cancer patients that have HR+ tumors, black women have double the death rate of white women with the same diagnosis. Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET), typically using the selective estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen and/or an aromatase inhibitor given orally for at least five years, significantly and substantially improves survival rates in women with HR+ breast cancer. Unfortunately, there is significant underuse and lower adherence to AET among black women compared to their white counterparts. AET adherence rates are low for all patients with HR+ breast cancer, most often due to adverse side effects. We will investigate the crucial link between patient symptoms and subsequent treatment course and health outcomes in HR+ breast cancer. Side effects of AET clearly limit medication adherence rates and often trigger clinicians and patients to change or discontinue treatment. To our knowledge, no one has investigated how AET-related side effects and adherence and provider treatment decisions may be driving disparities in B-W health outcomes and mortality. Our study is guided by the Symptom Management Model, which emphasizes the interrelatedness of three symptom management dimensions (symptom experience, management strategies, and health outcomes) while incorporating distinct domains and levels of analyses, including person/health and environment. Our main goal is to understand how B-W differences in potentially modifiable factors in the treatment pathway contribute to B- W mortality disparities. To accomplish this goal, we will pursue the following aims: 1) To determine whether we observe statistically and clinically significant B-W differences (frequency, severity, type) in patient-reported adverse symptoms; 2) To investigate whether black patients and their providers respond differently to the same symptoms in terms of AET adherence and prescribed treatment changes compared to white patients; and 3) To examine if and how patient-reported symptoms, medication adherence, and treatment changes impact B-W disparities in breast cancer outcomes, including mortality, recurrence, and hospitalizations. We will examine patients cared for by the West Cancer Center, an industry leader in leveraging technology to collect and utilize patient-reported outcomes in real-time clinical settings and the largest cancer care provider in the West Tennessee region. This region has the highest B-W breast cancer mortality disparity of the 50 largest US cities. We will leverage nine years of data from multiple sources, including patient-reported measures, clinical data, and claims records for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Our results will provide actionable mechanisms for targeted interventions to reduce B-W disparities in breast cancer."
"9401767","There is abundant evidence documenting the comorbidity of bulimia nervosa (BN), internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression, and externalizing disorders such as substance misuse. One important line of research is to move beyond descriptions of comorbidity to determine underlying mechanisms that may account for it. The intent of the proposed research is to begin to test the possibility that engagement in one behavior in a specified set of comorbid, dysfunctional behaviors increases the experience of shame, and that the increased shame contributes to risk for others of the comorbid behaviors. The scientific basis for investigating this possibility is that (a) estimates of comorbidity between BN, internalizing, and externalizing disorders are as high as 74.4% (Ulfvebrand et al, 2015); (b) prior research on comorbidity has often been descriptive, highlighting the need to investigate mechanisms to explain it; (c) the experience of shame is associated with each of these disorders; and (d) in recent longitudinal work, my colleagues and I demonstrated that binge eating in elementary school predicts increased levels of depression, alcohol use, and tobacco smoking four years later in high school. The research component of this proposal is a study designed to begin to test this idea, using bulimic behaviors by women with BN as an entry point for studying this comorbidity model. Specifically, I propose to test, in the laboratory, whether eating while in a negative mood increases state shame in women with BN as compared to healthy controls. After an ad lib eating session following negative mood induction, women with BN will experience an increase in state shame that is greater than any increase in state shame for the healthy control group and these increases will predict subsequent increases in state anxiety and depression as well as increased urges to use substances. Demonstration of increased state shame and transdiagnostic risk following a distress-based eating session for women with BN is a crucial step in a program of research I hope to conduct, using both experimental and longitudinal designs. The training component of this proposal includes the following: (1) training in the design and execution of laboratory, experimental studies; (2) training in the construct of shame, its distinction from related constructs such as guilt, the role of shame transdiagnostically, methods of measuring shame, and the possibility of reducing shame; (3) training in multilevel modeling: my planned program of research will involve studies of observations nested within people, nested within groups; (4) further advanced training in research ethics, including a second graduate course on ethical research with clinical populations, attendance at the University's clinical ethics grand rounds and research ethics lecture series; (5) preparation of research reports for publication, including learning how to respond effectively to revise and resubmit decisions; (6) presenting original research at leading, international scientific meetings; and (7) training in the mentoring of junior graduate students and undergraduate research assistants, including those assisting with the proposed research."
"9315823","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elevated uric acid levels (hyperuricemia), which form crystals in the joints, may lead to gout, which is associated with chronic kidney disease. Allopurinol is the major pharmacologic agent used for the treatment and prevention of hyperuricemia and gout, as well as other diseases associated with metabolic syndrome. Recent studies involving a large patient cohort challenge the widely accepted pharmacologic mechanism of action of allopurinol and its major active metabolite, oxypurinol, as pure inhibitors of xanthine oxidase-mediated synthesis of uric acid. In particular, our data suggest a major role of the ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP or ABCG2 in this proposal) in response to allopurinol. In the first genomewide association study, GWAS, of allopurinol response, we observed a single locus, in ABCG2, strongly associated with response to allopurinol in approximately 1492 patients of European ancestry (p = 1.9 x 10-9). Moreover, in follow-up studies in cells we observed that allopurinol and oxypurinol are excellent substrates of ABCG2, suggesting that the transporter plays a role in the drugs' disposition and effects. Importantly, we also observed that both compounds inhibit uric acid reabsorptive transporters in the renal proximal tubule. The ABCG2 locus identified in our GWAS included the nonsynonymous variant, Q141K (rs2231142), which is known to have reduced transport function due to reduced protein expression. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that ABCG2-Q141K results in reduced renal clearance of allopurinol and oxypurinol; in turn, the reduced renal clearance results in reduced response to the drugs because of decreased inhibition of uric acid reabsorptive transporters in the renal tubule. Our proposed research involves integrated cellular studies (Aim 1) ascertaining the kinetics of allopurinol, oxypurinol and uric acid with major renal uric acid transporters; and intense phenotyping of patients with hyperuricemia on allopurinol (Aim 2), which includes both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses. Finally, we include an aim (Aim 3) that validates and extends our findings to other major ethnic and racial populations. In particular, in a large meta-analysis we will validate ABCG2 as a critical gene involved in allopurinol pharmacologic mechanism and discover additional loci in individuals from multiple racial and ethnic groups. The proposed studies will add new knowledge to understanding the pharmacological mechanisms of action of allopurinol and oxypurinol and will greatly add to our understanding of genetic factors that lead to variation in response to the drug. Importantly, the studies will lead to the use of genetic information in selection of medications for the treatment of patients with gout."

"9320722","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For decades, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was known only for its neurotoxicity and as an environmental hazard. Recent findings however, suggest that endogenous H2S has a variety of physiological functions and a decrease in production can lead to vascular dysfunction, atherosclerosis and hypertension. This discovery has stimulated further research into its development as a potential therapeutic agent in diseases attributed to diminished H2S synthesis. In chronic kidney disease, low levels of plasma H2S is often associated with a concomitant increase in homocysteine (Hcy), known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). HHcy is well known to cause vascular dysfunction. The cause and effect relationship of HHcy in renal disease can therefore adversely affect the final outcome. Because Hcy is a precursor of H2S, changes in the H2S metabolism can have a significant impact on HHcy-induced pathology. However, the mechanism by which HHcy causes vascular dysfunction and the role of H2S in renal protection is incompletely understood. In the body, Hcy is metabolized by three enzymes, cystathionine ?-synthase (CBS), cystathionine y-lyase (CSE) and 3- mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) and produce H2S. During HHcy, an impairment in these enzymes leads to deficient H2S production. Our preliminary studies suggest that HHcy results in upregulation of caveolin-1 and homocysteinylation of eNOS thus decreasing NO production. The resulting imbalance in matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases causes accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins leading to microvascular remodeling, renal dysfunction and hypertension. In this proposal, we hypothesize that H2S offers renal protection from HHcy-induced renal damage by inhibition of caveolin-1 and modulation of eNOS. We will test this hypothesis in vivo and in vitro. Wild type (C57BL/6J) and genetic model of HHcy (CBS+/-) mice will be supplemented without or with H2S. To determine whether HHcy effects are caveolin-1 dependent we will use caveolin-1-/- mice supplemented with high Hcy diet. To ameliorate the HHcy- induced injury, single, double or triple gene delivery system employing CBS, CSE and 3MST enzymes will be used to enhance conversion of Hcy to H2S. In addition to confirming the preliminary findings, further studies will be performed for a deeper understanding into H2S-mediated improvement in renovascular dysfunction caused by pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory effects of HHcy. This research is novel because it evaluates gene delivery as a therapeutic option to ameliorate HHcy-induced microvascular remodeling, renal dysfunction and hypertension."
"9339574","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The broad objective of this proposal is to investigate the intrinsic mechanisms of tumor cell resistance to newly developed mTOR inhibitors such that their future use may be optimized in the clinic. We have identified an alternate mechanism of mRNA translation initiation that is activated upon mTOR inhibitor exposure allowing tumor cell survival in the face of global inhibition of protein synthesis. These experiments will delineate the signaling events promoting activation of this salvage pathway and will pre-clinically evaluate a novel small molecule inhibito targeting this pathway for synergistic antitumor effects in combination with mTOR inhibitors. Research Plan: We will investigate the molecular events leading to activation of this salvage pathway, as well as how this signaling cascade impinges on the cellular translational machinery to specifically synthesize proteins conferring tumor cell resistance. Additionally, we will evaluat a novel inhibitor of this pathway for synergistic antitumor effects in co-treatment studies with direct mTOR kinase inhibitors. Methodology: We will utilize a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to address the molecular mechanisms by which the salvage protein synthesis pathway is activated in TOR inhibitor resistant brain cancers. We will utilize mouse models of these diseases to evaluate the efficacy of these inhibitors. Results: This is a new project and no results have been obtained. Clinical Significance: CNS malignancies are relatively frequently encountered in our Veterans and current treatment protocols have not advanced significantly. The development of additional treatment options may improve the current prognosis for patients, which remains at a dismal 10 months. Understanding the treatment of malignant glioblastomas may lead to the development of additional therapeutic options for the treatment of bowel, lung and prostate cancers, which are common in our Veteran population."
"9294685","Project Summary Over 20,000 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT) are conducted annually worldwide, confirming its effectiveness as a treatment for patients with otherwise lethal malignancies. Allo-HSCT is beneficial for treatment of malignancies because of the graft-versus-tumor effects (GVT) by allogeneic CD8+ T cells contained within the HSCT inoculum. Although an effective treatment, allogeneic CD8+ T cells also cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which causes significant morbidity and mortality in ~30-70% of transplant recipients. Thus, the separation of GVHD from GVT effects is necessary to improve allo-HSCT outcomes.  The goal of this proposal is to devise new strategies to separate GVT from GVHD after allo-HSCT. I have been investigating the impact of manipulating TCR signal transduction pathways in allo-HCST settings. We provide robust and reproducible evidence that T cells harboring a YàF mutation at Y145 of the adaptor molecule SLP-76 (Y145F) don't develop GVHD, while preserving the anti-tumor effect in a mouse model of major mismatch allo-HCST. Further, we provide evidence that protection against GVHD is mediated T cell- intrinsically by the Y145F KI TCR signaling defect in addition to the expression of Eomesdermin (Eomes), necessary for the T cells to carry out optimal GVT effects. Our Specific Aims include (1) the investigation of the mechanisms by which ITK inhibition alleviates GVHD and (2) to delineate the role of Eomes for CD8+ T cells to mount GVT responses. We will accomplish these Aims by using mouse models of allo-HSCT combined with a variety of genetically manipulated mice (ITK KO, Eomes KO, etc.) and pharmacological interventions (ITK inhibitor, Wnt agonists). We will use a variety of techniques including qPCR, flow cytometry, Western blotting as well as unbiased approaches such as RNA-seq and microarray analysis.  Although much research has been performed in the area of allo-HSCT, there is still a need for new therapeutic strategies to separate GVHD from GVT. Our proposal will fill in this gap by investigating how ITK inhibition in conjunction with Eomes expression by CD8+ T cells can attenuate GVHD while preserving GVT effects. Through my training, I have acquired the skills to investigate T cell activation in a variety of allo-HSCT models and to biochemically and molecularly assess the mechanisms of T cell activation. Together with expert collaborators including Drs. Taku Kambayashi (expert in GVHD), Martha Jordan (expert in T cell signaling), Jan Burkhardt (expert in cell biology and migration), and Warren Pear (expert in transcription factors), the Aims of the proposal are likely to be successfully accomplished. My immediate career goal is to obtain a faculty position at an academic institution and to successfully compete for an R01 proposal. My long-term career goal as I establish myself into an independent scientific investigator is to uncover decisive regulators of the immune system responsible for cancer progression, and seek for novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment as part of the fight against hematological malignancies."
"9322280","Abstract A wide range of mnemonic and cognitive behaviors are dependent on persistent neural activity, sustained discharge in a neuronal population that far outlasts the duration of the stimulus. Persistent neural activity generally exhibits low-dimensional dynamics, meaning only a few patterns of firing across the population can be sustained, even when the population size numbers in the thousands. These low-dimensional dynamics are suggested by theoretical studies to be generated by attractor network mechanisms. However, in most settings there is an extremely large gap between abstract attractor network models and a quantitative understanding of the circuit mechanisms underlying persistent neural firing. Here we aim to close this gap by bridging between neuronal dynamics and circuit connectivity through a cross- scale approach using a combination of whole-network two-photon imaging, targeted optogenetic perturbations, whole-cell patch electrophysiology, serial-section electron microscopy, and next- generation network modeling. These studies will take advantage of the highly quantifiable saccadic and fixation behavior of the larval zebrafish, where persistent firing in the well-localized oculomotor neural integrator encodes a memory of desired eye position. In Aim 1, we will combine imaging of neuronal dynamics with pseudo-random perturbations that explore the state-space of the integrator network to gain insight into the network's attractor landscape and the functional relationships between constitutive neurons. In Aim 2, we will perform high- resolution serial-section electron microscopy on the same brain to gain insight into the circuit's anatomical connectivity. In Aim 3, we will directly fit an attractor network model to these dynamical and structural data to find the expected physiological interactions in the network, thereby obtaining concrete predictions about the direct influence of one neuron upon another. In Aim 4, we will test these predictions by obtaining whole-cell patch recordings of integrator neurons to measure synaptic responses following single-cell optogenetic stimulation. These tools and results will thus allow us to begin defining in a quantitative manner the patterns of physiological interactions in a circuit that give rise to persistent firing and temporal integration."
"9316560","Obesity increases both the incidence and mortality of numerous types of cancer. Children and adults who are obese at the time of diagnosis of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a 50% increased risk of relapse compared to their lean counterparts. Using mouse and tissue culture models, we showed that obesity directly impacts the progression and treatment outcome of ALL. We discovered that adipocytes and ALL cells participate in a two-way communication; ALL cells induce changes in adipocyte morphology and function, and adipocytes in turn release FFA which are used as a fuel for ALL cells.  In the present grant, we will further elucidate the mechanisms behind these effects. We will first investigate how ALL cells, in the context of chemotherapy, affect adipocytes, both in culture and in mice and humans. We will then focus on how adipocyte-derived FFA affect ALL cell growth and survival. We have developed novel techniques to perform these studies, including intravital imaging techniques to visualize bone marrow adipocyte and ALL interactions, and single cell lipidomics techniques to elucidate the effects of adipocytes on ALL cell metabolism. These studies will increase our understanding of how leukemia interacts with its microenvironment. They will also improve our understanding of the relationships between ALL and obesity, and they have the potential to change the way we treat cancer in our increasingly overweight population."
"9356335","Summary ? Core B The Anatomy and non-human primate behavior Core (Core B) will be an essential part of the Udall Center at Emory University. One of the major functions of this Core will be to prepare and process brain tissue from experimental animals generated by the Center projects. This service will be done with standardized histologic techniques, and will provide information that will be indispensable for the interpretation of the functional experiments under projects 1 and 2, and will facilitate sharing and comparisons of results among all three projects. Specifically, the Core will provide the following services: (1) Use of immunohistochemical and microscopy approaches to evaluate the degree of dopaminergic depletion in animals treated with 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, used in mice in project 1) or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, used in monkeys in projects 2 and 3); (2) use of histological markers to delineate nuclei in the motor thalamus in rodents (projects 1) and monkeys (projects 2 and 3); (3) histological reconstructions of recording electrode trajectories (projects 1 and 2); (4) analysis of the degree and pattern of expression of opsins after viral transfection (projects 1 and 2); (5) detection and digital reconstruction of biocytin-filled neurons (project 1); and (6), the cataloguing and storing of brain tissue of MPTP-treated monkeys. A second major service of Core B will be to systemically treat Rhesus monkeys from projects 2 and 3 with the neurotoxin MPTP and evaluate parkinsonism resulting from this treatment with standardized methods. This will allow us to generate animals with similar levels of parkinsonism across both projects, and will facilitate comparisons of data generated by them. By providing these services, the Core will help to free up time and resources from the research projects. In addition, the use of standardized anatomical and behavioral assessment techniques will help us to maintain a consistently high level of quality of Center research."
"9339549","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Hypothyroidism and obesity are associated with hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and atherosclerosis. Overt and subclinical hypothyroidism are commonly observed clinical disorders that exacerbate hyperlipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation. Our laboratory has been investigating the mechanisms by which thyroid hormone (T3) regulates genes controlling hepatic metabolism. T3 can ameliorate hepatic steatosis in part by accelerating fatty acid oxidation and inhibiting lipogenesis. We identified several transcriptional coregulators that participate in T3 induction of lipid metabolizing genes including the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC- 1?) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Recently, we discovered that T3 inhibits the expression of several secretory phospholipases in the liver including secretory phospholipase group IIa (PLA2g2a). PLA2g2a has been linked with chronic inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis and arthritis. Furthermore, PLA2g2a is elevated with hypothyroidism and diet induced obesity. The liver is one of the major contributors to the pool of extracellular PLA2g2a. Although PLA2g2a is highly expressed in hepatocytes, most previous studies have examined the regulation of PLA2g2a in macrophages and immune cells. We hypothesize that the T3 status modulates PLA2g2a expression and that the T3 mediated reduction in PLA2g2a is beneficial for hyperlipidemia. In aim 1, we propose to define novel mechanisms by which T3 inhibits expression of PLA2g2a gene. We will focus on the recruitment of nuclear corepressors to the liganded TR on the PLA2g2a gene. In aim 2, we will examine the role of PLA2g2a in hyperlipidemia and steatosis with hypothyroidism. Interest in the pharmacologic utility of T3 has been revitalized by the development of T3 receptor ? (TR?) selective agonists which act primarily in the liver to reduce plasma and hepatic lipids with little impact the cardiovascular system. Our studies will illuminate potential beneficial actions of T3 in the reduction of conditions associated with the metabolic syndrome such as hyperlipidemia and NAFLD. Obesity, steatosis and associated morbidities occur with very high frequency in the aging Veteran population."
"9414164","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Substance use disorders (SUDs) can have devastating consequences for people with serious mental illness (SMI). SUDs can increase morbidity and mortality and are associated with higher healthcare and social costs, homelessness, and incarceration. Unfortunately, despite the availability of effective treatments, most individuals with co-occurring SMI and SUD, (COD) never receive SUD treatment--treatment that could significantly improve patient outcomes. Increasing access to SUD treatment and improving patient outcomes will require addressing both the supply of and the demand for treatment. At the system and provider level, the availability of treatment needs to be increased. At the patient level, patient demand for treatment needs to increase, by identifying and addressing patient perceptions of need for treatment and preferences. We propose to evaluate system, provider and patient-level facilitators and barriers, and then to use this information to develop an implementation strategy and toolkit to promote the use of medication assisted treatment (MAT)--the use of FDA-approved medications for SUD in combination with behavioral therapies--for people with COD receiving public mental health treatment. We focus on MAT because of its demonstrated effectiveness and cost-savings, and specialty mental health because of the relatively large role the mental health system plays in treating individuals with COD. Aims 1-3 seek to assess organizational capacity (at the system and provider level); organizational readiness (at the provider level); and perceived needs, attitudes and preferences (at the patient level) to identify barriers and facilitators. In Aim 4, we will use findings from Aims 1- 3 to guide development of the implementation strategy and toolkit, using stakeholder input and a systematic process for strategy development. By implementation strategy we mean a group of implementation interventions that will address barriers at multiple levels. By toolkit, we mean the resources providers and clinics will need to execute implementation. To conduct the research, we will collaborate with the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. Using a mixed methods approach, we will conduct semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and surveys with patients and providers from 8 clinics serving an ethnically and geographically diverse population. We plan to test the strategy in a subsequent R01, where we will examine how the strategy affects MAT adoption, implementation and sustainability. Our study is a first step towards increasing access to SUD treatment for a vulnerable, costly and underserved population. Our approach is innovative because we consider barriers to MAT from the system, provider, and patient perspectives simultaneously, and use this information to develop an implementation strategy that addresses both organizational supply and patient demand."
"9339578","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Problems noted: Functional Limitation (described as muscle weakness, body pain and difficulty in day-to-day activities), sarcopenia with or without accompanying weight loss, and cachexia under metastatic setting, are observed in 39%, 26%, and 25% of breast cancer patients, respectively. Functional limitation, observed even before cancer diagnosis, is the major reason for increased non-cancer related deaths in these patients. Thus, functional limitation is mechanistically concomitant to the paracrine effects of cancer. Sarcopenia impacts not only the functional ability but is also linked to increased toxicity from chemotherapy. While cachexia has received considerable attention because of its phenotypic manifestation, Functional Limitation and sarcopenia have not been studied extensively. Therefore, new model systems to understand the Functional Limitation and sarcopenia in breast cancer and therapeutic strategies are necessary.  Preliminary results to resolve the problem: We entered into this field through a serendipitous observation; circulating levels of cardiac and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA miR-486 were lower in breast cancer patients with metastasis compared to healthy individuals and within experimental models of breast cancer. In animal models, lower circulating miR-486 levels correlated with reduced miR-486 expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle, two primary organs in which it is functionally involved. Moreover, proteins in the myogenesis (MyoD), myotube survival (DOCK3/PTEN/AKT) and cardiomyocyte survival (PI3K/PTEN/pAKT and pp38) networks, that are regulated by and/or regulate miR-486, were deregulated in cardiac and skeletal muscle of tumorbearing transgenic mice compared to controls. Overall, signaling defects in muscle of tumor-bearing animals resembled that of muscular dystrophy mutants (aberrant dystrophin isoforms, lower miR-486, elevated PTEN, and DOCK3). Tumor-derived or recombinant TNF? reduced miR-486 in myogenic and/or cardiomyoblast cell lines. NF-?B and/or p38 kinase, both major signaling molecules downstream of TNF?, are critical in relaying the paracrine effects of cancer, as a constitutively active p65 subunit of NF-?B reduced miR-486 in myogenic cell line. These results extend our previous observations on NF-?B activation in cancer progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance to include cancer-induced systemic functional effects.    Hypothesis: Cancer-induced cytokines such as TNF? can impair cardiomyocyte survival and myogenic differentiation via miR-486 deregulation, which leads to Functional Limitation, sarcopenia, cachexia or muscular dystrophy-like phenotype. Thus, circulating miR-486 levels serve as an early predictor of these systemic effects of cancer, which can be exploited not only for diagnostic purpose but also for therapy.     Three aims will test this hypothesis: 1) Determine that cancer disrupts the myogenesis network via miR-486 depletion to cause muscular dystrophy-like condition or sarcopenia; 2) Investigate if NF-?B is a critical signaling relay; and 3) Determine whether circulating miR-486 levels can serve as a putative early indicator of precachexia with accompanying loss of both muscle and fat.        Study impact: Although Functional Limitation in breast cancer patients at the time of diagnosis was first reported in 2004, to our knowledge, no mechanistic studies have been conducted since that time, nor have any therapies been developed. Similarly, sarcopenia, which increases chemotherapy-induced toxicity but is not always manifested phenotypically, is well known in breast cancer but therapies have not been developed. The results of this study will have a positive impact by creating new opportunities for rationally interfering with cancer-induced collateral damage to distant organs by repurposing drugs that are already being tested in clinic and prescreening approaches, thereby leading to the discovery of new mechanism-based therapeutic modalities to improve quality of life in cancer patients."

"9360630","Project Summary Current electrode based approaches for recording of brain activity, as well as EEG and MEG, provide high temporal resolution, but are limited to thousands of channels. Functional MRI can interrogate hundreds of thousands of brain voxels in parallel, but is limited by hemodynamics to a temporal resolution on the order of seconds. There are no current methods that can simultaneously achieve high temporal resolution (ms scale) and high channel count (~106 channels). We propose to explore the use of microelectronic devices in conjunction with MRI, to achieve at least two orders of magnitude increase in combined spatial and temporal resolution over existing methods. In our approach large numbers of small devices on the scale of 4-500?m will be distributed across the brain, either across the surface of the brain or through the blood, and used to sense the local neural activity through electrical detection. These devices will then actively perturb their local magnetic environment in a manner that is both detectable and localizable through MR imaging. This approach combines the high temporal resolution of electrical or magnetic detection with the high spatial resolution/coverage of MRI. Two central novel concepts in this proposal are: 1) that microdevices may be used to detect local signals and output only local perturbations, rather than communicate directly with external receivers; and 2) that MRI may be an efficient means of both relaying and localizing these signals. In the long term, we believe this approach may be scalable to millions of devices on the 4?m scale circulating in the blood, providing volumetric detection of electrical activity throughout the brain. As an intermediate goal we aim to record neural activity at sub-millimeter scale and 10ms resolution from the entire cortical surface, providing a measure of electrical activity at every cortical column simultaneously."
"9530835","Individual respiratory complexes of mitochondria are in dynamic equilibrium with higher order supercomplex organizations that compose the respirasome. Physiological and pathological perturbations in the mitochondrial cardiolipin (CL) pool directly affect and regulate this equilibrium. Aging, neurodegenerative diseases, heart failure, ischemia/reperfusion, cancer and Barth Syndrome are associated with abnormal CL pools. Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants lacking CL display similar phenotypes to mammalian cells with reduced CL levels making yeast an excellent model system. We were the first to report that formation of the yeast tetrameric respiratory supercomplex (SC III2IV2) and cytochrome c (cyt c) channeling between complexes III (CIII, bc1 complex) and IV (CIV, cyt c oxidase) within the SC are directly dependent on CL. Using our recently acquired K2 Summit direct electron detector for single particle electron cryo-microscopy, we have significantly improved the quality of EM images. We achieved a higher resolution 3D density map of the tetrameric SC than we previously reported. We are now in a position to attain 3D density maps of SCs at an unprecedented sub- nanometer resolution. We propose an innovative combination of high resolution structural determinations, functional assays, genetic manipulation of yeast cells and novel lipid-dependent reconstitution studies to establish the molecular basis for CL-dependent formation and function of respiratory SCs. Aim 1: A) obtain a sub-nanometer resolution 3D density map for the tetrameric SC to establish the precise dimensions of the lipid- filled gaps and the interface between CIII and CIV; B) determine the location(s) of bound cyt c in the tetrameric SC to decipher how SC formation makes cyt c channeling possible; C) resolve the structure of the III2IV1 trimer to understand how structural differences with the tetramer results in CL-independent formation and lack of cyt c channeling in the trimer; D) perform structural studies of the SC tetramer lacking subunit Qcr6 of CIII coupled with lipid analysis (under Aim 2) to determine whether Qcr6p maintains the lipid-filled gap between CIII and CIV, which makes SC formation sensitive to CL levels. Aim 2: A) integrate structural with quantitative analysis of CL and other lipids present in the above SCs; B) determine the features of CL that support tetrameric SC formation and function using an innovative in vitro SC-reconstitution system employing structural analogs of CL; C) mimic pathological conditions resulting in CL pool alterations to understand how CL levels and CL oxidation affect SC structure and function. Aim 3: A) determine CIII and CIV surface exposed CL-binding sites potentially responsible for SC formation using a photoactivatible CL analog; B) use Molecular Dynamic Simulations to predict surface exposed CL-binding sites; C) employ site-directed mutagenesis at chemically modified and predicted CL-binding sites that lie at the CIII-CIV interface for verification of their involvement in SC formation. This innovative and integrated approach will establish the molecular mechanism of CL- dependent SC formation and function. In the future similar studies will be extended mammalian respirasomes."
"9313753","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks funding to establish the West/Midwest Consortium for High-Resolution Cryo Electron Microscopy (cryoEM). The goal of the consortium is to offer 19 cryoEM users from 10 regional institutes free access to a high-end cryoEM facility with proven high-resolution capabilities located in the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). UCLA will act as host institute and provide investigators in these cryoEM laboratories access to its highly productive Titan Krios cryo electron microscope recently upgraded with a Volta phase plate, a Gatan imaging filter (GIF), and pre- and post-GIF direct electron detectors. A highly experienced staff with proven records of cryoEM-derived atomic structures will provide on-site assistance to collect data and provide streamlined movie pre-processing for our consortium user laboratories. The critical need for this consortium for recording atomic-resolution cryoEM images of a broad range of bio-medically significant macromolecular complexes is justified by the immediate benefits to the 19 consortium users. Of particular note, we have demonstrated that, once trained by our staff, users no longer have to be present at the microscope and can remotely control the microscope and perform high-resolution cryoEM imaging after our staff have aligned the instruments for top performance, thus significantly improving accessibility to the high-end instrument. A three-member supervisory committee representing non-consortium users, regional consortium users and the UCLA facility staff will provide evaluation and approval of user projects, adding and dropping users. Under our typical operation, a user group with approved projects requests research instrument time with an existing professionally-designed online reservation system, sends cryoEM grids by overnight courier (such as FedEx) in a liquid nitrogen-cooled dry shipper, and, after their grids are loaded by our staff, image their sample remotely for 3-7 days on average, and up to 2-3 weeks if necessary. The 10 institutes are concentrated on the West coast (University of Washington in Seattle, University of California at San Diego, Scripps) and Midwest (Case Western Reserve University, Purdue University, The University of Kansas, University of Alabama at Birmingham) except for three (University of Texas at El Paso, University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, and University of Florida at Gainesville). With the exception of three new investigators, all these users are funded by the NIH or other federal agencies to pursue biomedical research, ranging from biology, biochemistry, virology and microbiology. The establishment of this consortium will immediately empower our users with high-resolution cryoEM capabilities for a broad range of biological samples, enabling them to understand mechanisms of action and identify new targets for the development of new therapeutics."
"9336809","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The long-term immune effects of cigarette smoking especially in the lung remain a poorly understood area of research. We have demonstrated that antigen presenting cells (APCs) are highly activated in the lungs of smokers with emphysema, and mice exposed to smoke increase pathogenic APCs in the lungs that is critical for T helper (Th) 1, and Th17 inflammation and emphysema development. How tobacco smoke activates APCs and the downstream molecular mechanisms responsible for lung tissue injury remain unknown. In search of endogenous molecules that could promote maladaptive lung immune responses, we found elevated plasma concentrations of complement protein 3 (C3) in smokers with emphysema, and show that neutrophil elastase (NE) and MMP12 cleave and release its active fragments. We have also found that C3-/- mice exposed to cigarette smoke have reduced lung inflammation and attenuated emphysema. Interestingly this phenotype in C3-/- mice was marked by immature lung APCs and preserved expression of another complement protein C1q, lack of which has been associated with autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Further, treatment of mice with C1q reduced lung inflammation and emphysema while inhibition of C1q with siRNA increased their ability to induce Th17 effector cells. Collectively, these new critical observations point to an immune modulatory role for complement proteins in emphysema; the clinical significance of our proposed studies includes discovering novel and effective non-immune compromising complement-based therapeutics for treatment of smoke- induced lung diseases. Our three Aims are: Aim 1. Identify mechanism(s) activating complement and stimulating pathogenic APCs in lungs exposed to inhale cigarette smoke. Hypothesis: C3a and/or C5a are required for efficient activation of pathogenic APCs in the lungs in response to cigarette smoke. This work will be accomplished by i) investigating the mechanism(s) for C3 mediated APC activation and lung immune phenotype of wild type, C3aR-/-, and C5aR-/- mice exposed to chronic smoke; using the same model, the efficacy of C3 inhibitor (e.g. CR2-fH) will be examined in vivo ii) In human translational studies using siRNA the function of C3a and C5a signaling in APC-mediated activation of CD4 T cells will be explored. Aim 2. Determine the effect of C1q on lung APCs in cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation. Hypothesis: Reduction of C1q in APCs of mice exposed to smoke stimulates Th1/Th17 mediated inflammation and worsens emphysema whereas production of C1q by APC reduces inflammatory responses that result in emphysema. We will explore the role of C1q using C1q-/- mice and specific C1q deficiency in APCs (CD11ccre/C1qflx/flx mice) in a model of smoke induced emphysema. Complementary studies using loss of function (siRNA) and gain of function (add back C1q protein) will be used to further determine the role of C1q modulation in APCs in human emphysema. Aim 3. Determine the mechanism(s) for the crosstalk between C3 and C1q in lung APCs of smoke exposed mice. Hypotheses: C1q promotes development of tolerogenic lung APCs. Using transgenic mice expressing GFP under Foxp3 promoter (Foxp3GFP) the role of C3, C3aR and C5aR in C1q mediated induction of T cell tolerance, and production of inhibitory cytokines will be examined in response to cigarette smoke. This proposal is based on our human translational studies that are focused on the role of complement proteins in promoting development of autoreactive immune responses in the lungs. Successful completion of the objectives should provide a strong rationale for the use of novel and effective non-immune compromising complement-based therapeutics for treatment of smoke-induced lung diseases."
"9318528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pathogens have evolved a number of ways to subvert host defense arsenals to persist long term and induce recurrent infections. We have previously shown that uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) persists as quiescent reservoirs in membrane-bound compartments within the bladder wall and causes frequent and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). How these reservoirs form and persist is not known; this lack of knowledge impedes our ability to develop treatments to prevent recurrent UTIs. One mechanism used by animals to control infection by intracellular pathogens is autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved process that is activated under starvation or stress to recycle nutrients and damaged membranes by delivering them to the lysosome for degradation. We recently showed that an autophagy gene, Atg16L1, plays a key role in UTI pathogenesis: a mutation in the Atg16L1 gene limits the ability of UPEC to persist and cause recurrent UTIs and is associated with urothelial architectural defects. These defects lead to alterations in complex membrane recycling events in superficial urothelial cells required for both the normal function of the bladder and UPEC pathogenesis. The objective of this application is to determine the mechanisms by which UPEC hijack the normal vesicle trafficking of the bladder epithelial cells to form persistent reservoirs. The centrl hypothesis tested is that UPEC avoid destruction by lysosomes in urothelial cells by appropriating the autophagy pathway, and that Atg16L1 deficiency re-routes bacteria to an intracellular compartment where they cannot persist. We propose to test this hypothesis as follows: in Aim 1, we will systematically disrupt urothelial cell architecture by using newly established urothelial-specific cre mice driving loss of function of Atg16L1 and other autophagy pathway proteins to determine both the nature of the intracellular UPEC niche in vivo and the role of autophagy in UPEC persistence. In Aim 2, we will use a urothelial cell culture model to elucidate how modulation of Atg16L1 alters the process of UPEC invasion, intracellular survival into urothelial cells, and egress out of cells. We anticipate that our work will provide new insighs into the genetic and molecular interplay between the autophagy pathway and UPEC during a UTI and will provide cellular targets for development of therapeutic interventions to combat recurrent infections. Given that urinary tract infections are common and costly and that antibiotic-resistant pathogens are becoming increasingly prevalent, the potential of this knowledge to contribute to development of new treatment regimens to limit or eradicate sources of recurrent UTI could be vital."
"9387508","Many important human pathogens including those responsible for malaria, dengue, yellow fever, Zika, West Nile fever, and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes. A functioning ?gene drive? system could fundamentally change our strategies for the control of these disease vectors, by allowing us to drive genetically engineered alleles into vector populations. The recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive (CGD) system promises a highly adaptable mechanism for this purpose that works by converting heterozygotes for the driver construct into homozygotes in the germ line. However, it remains unclear how well this mechanism would work in wild populations where genetic heterogeneity and mutation will likely give rise to alleles that are resistant to the drive mechanism. Importantly, such resistance alleles will be produced by the drive itself when cleavage is repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). The goal of this proposal is to develop CGD constructs with reduced rate of resistance allele formation and to experimentally quantify the factors that are important to the evolution of resistance alleles in large cage populations of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. In our first aim, we will engineer transgenic Drosophila with several CGD constructs that will allow for rapid assessment of driver, wild-type, and resistance genotypes. Our constructs will disrupt target genes that produce an easily identifiable recessive phenotype. In addition, they will also contain a dsRed gene producing a dominant phenotype, allowing us to distinguish driver alleles from different types of resistance alleles, which may or may not disrupt target gene function. Our CGD constructs will be designed to minimize the rate of resistance allele formation, either through use of multiple gRNAs, use of the male-germline-only ?2-tubulin promoter, or use of a shRNA to silence Lig4 ? an essential component in NHEJ machinery. In our second aim, we will use large cage populations of several thousand flies to study the population dynamics of our CGD constructs over the course of several generations. We will first track the frequency of non-driving disrupted target alleles, which will inform us about their fitness costs and the effective population size in our cages. We will then introduce flies with our CGD constructs at low starting frequency into cages of wild-type flies. Phenotypes will be tracked over several generations and resistance alleles will be characterized by sequencing at the end of the experiment to determine the rate at which resistance arose during the spread of the driver. All experiments will be conducted inside a USDA-inspected arthropod containment facility to prevent escape of transgenic insects. There is good reason for caution in considering the use of gene drive systems for genetic manipulation of wild populations. The parameters derived from our experiments will be critical for modeling the population dynamics of such approaches in the wild, and our large cage system will provide a valuable resource for evaluating future approaches engineered to further suppress resistance. !"
"9318119","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Psoriasis is a common human skin disease that affects approximately 2% of the population including an estimated 400,000 veterans. In addition to activation of the immune system and inflammation, psoriasis is characterized by hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes of the skin. Previous data from our laboratory indicate that in epidermal keratinocytes the lipid-metabolizing enzyme phospholipase D2 (PLD2) and the glycerol transporter aquaporin-3 (AQP3) physically and functionally interact. AQP3 transports glycerol into the cell, making it available to the associated PLD2, which can then use this glycerol to synthesize phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Our results further demonstrate that PG acts as a lipid second messenger to inhibit keratinocyte proliferation, stimulate differentiation and inhibit inflammation. The importance of AQP3 in skin is emphasized by the fact that mice lacking the gene for AQP3 exhibit an epidermal phenotype characterized in part by decreased epidermal glycerol content and delayed barrier repair. The phenotype can be corrected by pharmacologic doses of glycerol but not other humectants, consistent with the fact that glycerol only inefficienty enters cells in the absence of aquaglyceroporins like AQP3. In addition, AQP3 has been found to be dysregulated in human skin diseases. Thus, for example, we have previously reported that AQP3 protein levels are decreased and diffuse in psoriasis; however, other investigators have found an up-regulation of AQP3 mRNA expression in psoriatic lesions. We first propose to resolve whether AQP3 protein levels (compared with mRNA levels) are increased or decreased in psoriasis using western and qRT-PCR analysis of psoriatic and healthy epidermis. In addition, we will measure PLD2 and glycerol levels in these samples, with the idea that reductions in one or both of these parameters could also lead to decreased levels of anti-proliferative, pro-differentiative PG. In these patients we will also investigate the effect of glycerol administratio on psoriasis with the expectation that this agent will improve psoriatic lesions. Despite the importance of AQP3 to skin function, there is little information available concerning the mechanisms regulating AQP3 expression in health or disease. In initial results we have found that AQP3 mRNA and protein levels are increased by treatment with a broad-spectrum histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, suggesting that basally one or more HDACs normally represses AQP3 expression. Additional studies with a panel of HDAC inhibitors and overexpression and knockdown of HDAC3 (versus HDAC1) indicate that this repressive HDAC is HDAC3. In the proposed studies we will explore the mechanism by which HDAC3 regulates AQP3 expression, testing the hypothesis that HDAC3 normally suppresses AQP3 expression by decreasing the acetylation and transcriptional activity of one or more members of the p53 family of transcription factors, in addition to its effects on histones and chromatin organization. We will examine this idea in vitro and in an epidermal-specific conditional HDAC3 knockout mouse model in vivo, monitoring the mRNA and protein levels of AQP3 in comparison with floxed HDAC3 control littermates. We will also examine the effect of keratinocyte-specific HDAC3 deletion on epidermal structure and function and the development of psoriasiform lesions in the imiquimod mouse model of psoriasis, with and without co-treatment with glycerol. Completion of the proposed research should result in an understanding of the role of HDAC3 in regulating AQP3 expression as well as a potential proof-of-principle for HDAC3 inhibition, with or without concomitant glycerol administration, as a therapy for psoriasis."
"9339486","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Following the loss of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA), there is an increase in activity of glutamate neurons within the subthalamic nucleus (STN). In animal models and in humans with Parkinson's disease (PD), both a lesion or high frequency stimulation/deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN results in improvement in motor function and provides symptomatic relief. However, both DBS and a lesion of the STN could be affecting the fibers of passage. Direct inactivation of the STN neurons without affecting the fibers of passage could answer this concern. Since STN neurons utilize the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) for uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles, deletion of this gene would selectively inactivate those STN glutamate neurons and block glutamate release.  Using the Cre/loxP recombinase gene technology where a specific gene can be silenced, inactivation of the STN glutamate neurons can be achieved through deleting a targeted gene in the specific brain area by injecting AAV-Cre to mice that are floxed for Vglut2 (Vglut2flox/flox). To determine if deletion of the Vglut2 gene in the STN can be neuroprotective against DA terminal and cell loss using the neurotoxin, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), we find that a unilateral infusion of AAV-Cre-GFP (green fluorescent protein) into the STN inactivated approximately 80% of those STN glutamate neurons, as determined by GFP labeling of STN neurons. As measured by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, this resulted in a bilateral protection from the loss of DA terminals in the striatum and DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) following progressive administration of MPTP compared to the wildtype mice treated with the toxin. There was a 35% decrease in activated tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) within the substantia nigra (SN) following MPTP compared to the vehicle treated group. If VGLUT2 deletion occurred following the initiation of MPTP treatment (i.e, neurointervention), we find striatal nerve terminals recovered to nearly 80% of the vehicle treated group. Since MPTP results in a decrease in activated TrkB in the SN, deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN, which we found resulted in a decrease in extracellular glutamate in the SN, would allow activated TrkB in the SN to return to control levels and protect the SNpc neurons. To address a possible mechanism of this protection, we find that systemic administration of the TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, 2 weeks after the initiation of MPTP treatment (i.e., neurointervention) resulted in a blockade of any further loss of TH within the striatum due to continued MPTP treatment.  The overall goal of this project is to determine whether deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN initiated following (i.e., restoration) either progressive administration of MPTP or intrastriatal infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) can reverse the loss of DA within the nigrostriatal pathway in both young and aged mice. We will also determine the role of TrkB in blocking or reversing the DA depletion due to MPTP. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1.) determine if deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN initiated 4 weeks after progressive MPTP administration can reverse the loss of DA markers in the striatum/SN and motor function in both young and aged mice, 2.) determine if deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN initiated 12 days following infusion of 6-OHDA into the dorsolateral striatum can reverse the loss of DA markers in the striatum/SN and motor function in both young and aged mice, and 3.) determine if the neuroprotection from MPTP following deletion of the Vglut2 gene within the STN is due to maintained levels of activated TrkB in the SN by daily infusion of a TrkB agonist into the SN."
"9403783","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Tetragenetics Inc, an early stage biotechnology company in Cambridge, MA, has developed a powerful cross-cutting technology for the overexpression of eukaryotic membrane and secreted proteins using Tetrahymena thermophila, an important model organism with a unique features particularly well suited to the production of these important classes of proteins. The company's proprietary SionXTM technology, for example, has enabled expression of properly folded and functional human ion channel at levels 50-100 fold higher than has previously been possible with mammalian CHO or HEK cells, the current gold standard for the production of these otherwise difficult to produce proteins. These data have garnered considerable attention within the biotech and large pharma arenas, and while the platform has numerous applications in basic research, transfer of the technology to the broader academic community has challenges as well. From a technical standpoint, Tetrahymena is complex in terms of its genetics and not amenable to the kinds of out-of-the box (kit-type) solutions available for more conventional systems. At the same time, much of the technology for cell line development and expression optimization is proprietary and demands relatively high upfront licensing fees for commercial use that are beyond what academic researchers can afford. To address this issue and to make the Tetrahymena platform accessible to the entire biomedical research community, Tetragenetics Inc proposes to join forces with the NIH (ORIP)-funded Tetrahymena Stock Center at Cornell University to provide overexpressing cell lines and/or starting material for protein purification to not-for-profit academic and government research laboratories at reasonable costs. The Stock Center has a well developed infrastructure for ordering, storing and disseminating strains, while Tetragenetics has the state-of-the-art vectors, cell lines and growth conditions that make this system so powerful. The proposal describes how this public-private partnership will work to bring the technology to the not-for-profit research community. Additionally, the proposal delineates plans to expand the capabilities of the current platform by developing new tools for heterologous gene expression including new vectors allowing 'plug and play' options for construct design (particularly with respect to epitope tag placement); new promoters for driving inducible gene expression; and new cell lines that will permit identification of positive transformants without direct drug selection. These improvements will expand the flexibility of the platform for both academic and commercial use. Finally, Tetragenetics will explore use of the SionXTM platform for expression of historically challenging G-protein coupled receptors in collaboration with Heptares Therapeutics, a British company that has pioneered the development of stabilized GPCRs for structure-based drug design. The proposed studies are intended to remove a major stumbling block to the study of broad families of proteins that are critically important in normal functionin of the nervous, respiratory, endocrine, and urinary and immune systems."
"9339569","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The prevalence of hypertension is markedly increased in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for reasons that are not clear. Hypertension is an independent predictor of mortality and a major cardiovascular risk factor for this patient population. Renal injury and inflammation is common in patients with SLE which is significant to the risk of hypertension because of the kidney's central role in the long term blood pressure control. Growing evidence suggests that autoimmunity may underlie both human and experimental hypertension. Therefore, autoimmune induced renal inflammation may promote the development of hypertension in women with SLE. In support of this, preliminary data show that renal hemodynamic function is impaired in a hypertensive mouse model with SLE. In addition, our data show that hypertension in female SLE mice is mediated in part by B and T cells of the adaptive immune system. For example, the hypertension associates with autoantibody production and B cell depletion prevents the hypertension and renal injury. Renal and circulating levels of T cell associated cytokines (TNF-, IL-17) are increased in mice with SLE, as well. IL- 17 is widely implicated in autoimmune mediated tissue injury and renal TNF- promotes SLE associated hypertension. When T cells are depleted in SLE mice, autoantibodies are reduced and the progression of hypertension is attenuated. The lower blood pressure in T cell depleted SLE mice is associated with preservation of renal microvascular structure. The major focus of this proposal will be to determine the relative contribution of different immune cell subsets and their impact on renal hemodynamic function during SLE. The overall hypothesis is that the Th2 cell mediated B cell production of autoantibodies associated with SLE impairs renal hemodynamic function. In addition, Th1 and Th17 cells contribute to the hypertension by secreting cytokines (TNF- IL-17) that directly impair renal cortical or medullary vascular flow. The result of these changes is to shift the set point of the chronic pressure natriuresis relationship resulting in the development of hypertension. This specific aims will test whether (1) Th2/B cell interaction and the production of autoantibodies promotes the development of hypertension during SLE. (2) Th1 and Th17 cells contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension and renal inflammation during SLE. (3) Adaptive immune system activation impairs renal hemodynamic function causing a hypertensive shift in the pressure natriuresis relationship during SLE. The proposed studies have significant clinical implications for veterans for whom hypertension remains a significant health concern. In addition, rheumatic diseases and their complications have been a major health concern for the U.S. military and their families for over 100 years. Therefore understanding mechanisms that promote SLE or its sequelae will improve the quality of clinical care for veterans with hypertension or SLE."
"9544406","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Links between metabolism and cancer have been documented broadly, connecting obesity to increased cancer rates and alterations of cancer genes to cell metabolism.  It is hypothesized that a deeper understanding of cancer cell metabolism would provide avenues toward new therapeutics that could be strategically deployed with currently available therapies to prevent or treat cancers.  Proof-of-concept for targeting different metabolic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, and glutaminase has been provided with different tumor xenograft models.  However, normal proliferating cells tend to use similar pathways to build cell mass and produce ATP.  Normal tissues display metabolic circadian rhythms regulated by themaster clock transcription factors that are centrally synchronized via diffusible factors from the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus that is responsive to light.  Preliminary data have documented that the MYC  oncogene can disrupt the cellular circadian rhythm by directly regulating components of the Clock machinery,  thereby uncoupling sustained tumor metabolism from circadian regulation, while normal cells continue to  display peaks and nadirs of metabolic activity. To reach the goal of understanding oncogenic circadian disruption for optimal metabolic cancer therapy timed when normal metabolic rates are lowest while cancer metabolic rates remain elevated, three aims are set in this proposal.  Aim 1.  To test the hypothesis that Myc induction of Rev-erb? alters metabolism and contributes to tumorigenesis. Aim 2.  To test the hypothesis that Myc disruption of circadian gene expression alters cellular circadian metabolism as well as human cancer cell  sensitivity to metabolic inhibitors in vitro.  Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that metabolic therapy administered at specific times of the day will result in better survival using a mouse model of MYC-induced hepatocellular  carcinoma."
"9330007","Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in understanding the pathways, timing, and risk and protective factors that translate early environmental stressors into emerging cardiometabolic risk during childhood. Improved knowledge of the pathways through which early environmental stressors give rise to emerging dysregulation in cardiometabolic processes, the timing during childhood when impacts are observed, and the protective factors that foster resilience, is necessary to optimize interventions to prevent the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The proposed study will address this knowledge gap using a unique cohort of 534 racially/ethnically diverse, low income children who participated in a two-arm randomized controlled obesity prevention trial and have been followed since 2-4 years of age [The NET-Works Trial (U01HD068890; Sherwood/French PIs), part of the COPTR consortium (Child Obesity Prevention and Treatment Research, NIH/NHLBI/DCVS/PPSP)]. The goal of this prospective study is to characterize the emergence of dysregulation in cardiometabolic processes in this high-risk cohort of children at 7-9 years of age, and identify malleable factors that mitigate the deleterious impact of early environmental stressors on later cardiometabolic risk. State-of-the-art measures of environmental stressors (objective and perceived neighborhood and home environment), child and parent behavior patterns (gold standard measures of children's health behaviors, executive functioning skills, and parenting factors) and physiological mediators (cortisol levels from hair samples), have already been obtained at four time points during early childhood. New measurements at ages 7-9 will allow the most cutting-edge assessment of cardiometabolic risk, including cardiovascular and metabolic parameters, body composition, pubertal stage, and oxidative stress/inflammation. Specifically, this study will (1) examine whether longitudinal patterns of children's health behavior, executive functioning, and parenting practices during early childhood buffer the relationship between early environmental stressors and emerging cardiometabolic risk, (2) examine whether HPA-axis regulation is on the pathway to emerging cardiometabolic risk, and determine the extent to which child and parenting factors exert a buffering effect through modulating children's cortisol levels, and (3) explore whether participation in a multi-level behavioral obesity prevention intervention can enhance the buffering effects of children's health behaviors, executive functioning, and parenting factors on cardiometabolic risk by altering the trajectories of these modifiable factors. This approach is innovative, because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by focusing on the pathways through which early environmental stressors give rise to cardiometabolic risk during middle childhood and the protective factors which buffer against this risk, and significant because it is expected to have direct implications for optimizing interventions for young children living in stressful early environments to prevent cardiovascular and metabolic diseases."

"9344393","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions);    Although state-of-the-art CT provides accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones and separation of uric acid and non-uric acid stones, current routine clinical image analysis does not provide a comprehensive tool to quantitatively assess stone composition, volume, morphology and fragility, or to detect precursor lesions and trace elements related to stone formation. We have demonstrated that the novel algorithms developed in our lab during the initial funding period of our first O'Brien Center grant are able to separate eight common types of renal stones into five groups in an anthropomorphic phantom under clinical conditions, and into four groups in patients. In patients, we demonstrated an overall accuracy of 79.1%. We have also demonstrated the ability to accurately measure stone volume and surface  morphology. In Project 1 of the current proposal, we will develop and validate tools to quantify interior stone morphology and use our quantitative measurements of stone composition, volume, surface and interior morphology to predict stone fragility. Thus, CT imaging, which is the predominant clinical tool used to diagnose and stage renal stones, can provide a much richer source of important clinical and research information when dual-energy data are acquired and quantitative analysis techniques used.  The Imaging Core will provide five key functions in support of this O'Brien Urology Cooperative Research Center. These functions will directly support Projects 1, 2, and 3, and may be of value for pilot projects initiated during later years of the Center's activities. Additionally, the functions may be of considerable value to extramural researchers in the field of nephrolithiasis, including  1) Dual-energy CT scanning of ex-vivo specimens or patients;  2) Dual-energy CT attenuation, volume and morphology analyses;  3) Spectral CT scanning of ex-vivo specimens;  4) Coordination of micro-CT scanning and fragility testing with Dr. Jim Williams; and  5) Coordination of neutron activation analysis with Dr. Xin Liu."

"9325027","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abscesses are infected walled-off fluid collections of pus and bacteria, and represent a ubiquitous global healthcare problem. They are common sequelae of surgery, infections or disease, and can affect any part of the body. Current standard of care includes hospitalization, antibiotics and drainage of the abscess with a catheter. The bacteria in puss are susceptible to both thermal and mechanical damage. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) can generate localized heating and cavitation, and is a potential noninvasive means to treat abscesses by exploiting one or both mechanisms. The significance of this proposal is that noninvasive treatment of reachable abscesses using ultrasound therapy under ultrasound guidance is better for the patient because it is noninvasive, allows treatment of small abscesses, has less procedural pain, requires no catheter management, there is no potential tract for new infections, and no need for CT/fluoro imaging radiation."

"9297399","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, affecting approximately 5 million people worldwide. PD is characterized by the clinical triad of resting tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. The neuropathological hallmarks of  PD are progressive degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Mutations in the LRRK2 and ?-synuclein genes are the most common genetic cause of PD, but the mechanisms underlying these mutations are still unclear. Emerging experimental evidence suggests intriguing common pathogenic mechanisms between these two dominant PD genes. For example, LRRK2 is an essential regulator of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, of which ?-synuclein is a substrate. Disruption of this pathway may explain DA neurodegeneration in PD, as impaired autophagy function caused by conditional deletion of genes encoding autophagy-related proteins leads to neurodegeneration during aging. However, how LRRK2 regulates autophagy and whether PD mutations affect its role in autophagy regulation remain to be elucidated. Furthermore, ?-synuclein aggregation, a neuropathological hallmark of PD, causes neurodegeneration during aging, but the mechanisms underlying its neurotoxicity need to be explored further. To address these questions, we propose three inter-related, complementary Research Projects and one Research Core. Project 1 directed by Dr. Südhof proposes to elucidate the mechanisms of ?-synuclein neurotoxicity in mouse and human neurons. Project 2, directed by Dr. Shen, proposes to investigate the genetic interaction between ?-synuclein and LRRK in the regulation of autophagy and dopaminergic neuron survival. Project 3, directed by Dr. Yue, proposes to investigate the molecular pathways by which LRRK regulates autophagy and ?-synuclein homeostasis. The Research Core, directed by Dr. Shen, will serve all three Projects by generating and providing multiple lines of mutant mice that are essential for the three Projects. The Administrative Core, also directed by Dr. Shen, will oversee the overall function and integration of our Udall Center, scientific directions of all Projects and Core, budget allocation,  and our extensive training and public outreach programs. The completion of these highly integrated, complementary Projects and Research Core will provide significant insight into PD pathogenesis, and help uncover novel pathways that can be further explored and developed into effective disease-modifying therapy."
"9326026","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Annual statistics in the United States suggest that there are 1.6 million homeless youths (HY)1,2 and an estimated 1.4 million active gang members.3 Experiences of homelessness and gang membership are known determinants of negative behavioral health outcomes,4-10 including the most frequently examined potential correlates of HIV risk behaviors: substance use and risky sexual behavior. Although seemingly disparate occurrences, homelessness and gang involvement intersect.11-13 Previous research has found that approximately 15% of HY currently identify as gang members and up to 32% have ever been gang affiliated.13 However, very little is known about HY gang members and closely affiliated peers. To better understand this population, the proposed study will explore HIV risk behaviors among gang-involved HY related to social networks. The study's goals include drastically increasing knowledge regarding HY gang involvement using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach. During the first phase of the proposed study, quantitative survey data and social network data from an NIMH-funded R01 study (MH903336; PI: Rice) with HY will be used to identify associations between HIV risk behaviors and social networks among gang-involved HY (self- identified members and affiliates). In Phase 2, purposeful sampling methods will be used to identify and select high risk gang-involved HY to participate in semi-structured life history calendar (LHC) interviews. The LHC approach will be used to contextualize and expand on the Phase 1 findings and to develop a theoretical framework to understand the HIV risk gang-involved HY. The rigor of using multiple sources of data (quantitative, social network, and LHC) will provide a unique contribution to the literature and increase our understanding of gang involvement and HIV risk among homeless youths. With the assistance of a community advisory board, these findings will be used to inform new directions in HY interventions; specifically what network-level interventions could be adapted to prevent gang-related HIV risks in the HY population."
"9325559","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mucus transport is a fundamental component of the innate defense of the lung. In many environmental and genetic airways diseases, abnormal mucus transport produces mucus adhesion and, hence, retention. Mucus adhesion drives the pathogenesis of bronchitis by generating airflow obstruction, inflammation, and infection. Perhaps the best documented examples of mucus adhesion-driven bronchitis include patients with acute viral infections, prolonged intubation, and/or CNS disease. In a related context, acute exacerbations (AEs) associated with COPD, CF, and PCD often reflect a component of bronchitic spread to previously normal areas of the lung. Thus, in pulmonary medicine, there is a general need for agents that clear adherent mucus from airways surfaces to provide both symptomatic relief and slow/stop disease progression. Accordingly, our goal is to develop a novel mucolytic to be used as a single agent, or in combination of hydrating agents, to treat mucus retention in patients in need thereof. Based on a novel two-gel hypothesis to better describe the mucociliary apparatus, biophysical formulations have been developed to describe mucus flow in health and failure of flow in disease. These formulations have been extended to analyze the properties of mucus that becomes adherent in disease states and identify strategies to restore transport. We have developed cough machines and other biophysical assays to measure the biophysical forces that generate adhesion and search for pharmacologic agents to restore clearance. This search led to a focus on disulfide bond reducing agents as key additive/synergistic agents with hydrating agents. Inhaled N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has failed in pulmonary medicine because of the poor intrinsic activity of the compound and short half-life on airway surfaces. Consequently, a chemistry program was initiated to identify superior thiol-based scaffolds (e.g., including DTT scaffolds) and apply strategies from related chemistry programs to increase the activity of thiol-based reducing agents and to increase their residence time on airway surfaces. These approaches led to the selection of a lead compound (P2062) that exhibits greatly increased activity over other thiol-based mucolytics (~1,000X), is more durable (longer t1/2) on airway surfaces, and limits cellular penetration and hence has safety advantages over NAC. Our novel reducing agents are active in reducing both MUC5AC and MUC5B in COPD sputum, clearing adherent mucus from the ?ENaC mouse model, clearing adherent mucus from the rhino/sinus cavity from primary ciliary dyskinesia mice, and restoring mucus clearance in neutrophil elastase treated sheep by the tracheal mucus velocity assay. Strategies to optimize P2062 and generate a clinical candidate are outlined in a four tier approach in Specific Aim 1, which focuses on both increases in safety and efficacy. Processes required to move the clinical lead to an IND are outlined in Specific Aim 2, including all of the IND requiring medicinal chemistry, toxicology, ADME, and PK studies. We anticipate immediate initiation of Phase I trials at the end of the CADET funding period."
"9336807","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Combined pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, often referred to as interstitial lung disease (ILD), is debilitat- ing and even deadly. ILD may develop for a variety of reasons, and with no confirmed therapies, ILD is the main cause of death in patients with scleroderma, whereas median survival is only 2 to 3 years in patients with another ILD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Military exposures, aging, and autoimmune diseases make ILD prevalent in Veterans. Although much progress has been made in uncovering the mechanisms of ILD, the disease still remains poorly understood. Recent findings implicate nuclear factor from high endothelial venules (NFHEV), also known as interleukin (IL)-33, in the pathogenesis of scleroderma and IPF. NFHEV/IL-33 is des- ignated by these two different names because of its dual biology. As a nuclear factor, it is expressed in a varie- ty of cell types and binds directly to DNA. As a cytokine, proteolytically activated extracellular IL-33 is a power- ful inducer of Th2 responses, such as those in allergies and asthma. The latter activities of the IL-33 cytokine are under active investigation, whereas the former activities of NFHEV as a nuclear factor have been underap- preciated and not studied in sufficient detail or in association with a disease process. Our data suggest that, as a nuclear factor, NFHEV drives ILD. NFHEV is elevated in the lungs of patients with ILD and predominant over the IL-33 form. In these patients, NFHEV is expressed in inflammatory cells and, notably, fibroblasts, which are central to the pathogenesis of ILD. Consistent with this, the expression of NFHEV is elevated in the lungs of mice in the bleomycin model of ILD. Gene delivery of NFHEV in cell culture and in the animal model leads to increased production of MCP-1, IL-6, MMP3, MMP10, and MMP13, all of which are known to contribute to ILD. Gene delivery of NFHEV also induces inflammation and local collagen deposition. Although extracellular IL-33 in patients may also be somewhat elevated, there is an accompanying elevation in soluble T1/ST2, which neu- tralizes IL-33 cytokine activity but has no effect on the function of NFHEV. Gene deficiency of T1/ST2 has min- imal if any attenuating effect on the severity of ILD in the bleomycin model. Based on these data, the Hypothe- sis of this proposal is that NFHEV is a central T1/ST2-independent regulator of ILD, acting through stimulation of proinflammatory and profibrotic gene expression. If successful in validating this role of NFHEV, this study will lay the groundwork for future development of NFHEV-targeting strategies and thus lead to better therapies for ILD. To assess the validity of this Hypothesis, three Specific Aims will be addressed. Aim 1 is to prove, in the bleomycin model of interstitial lung disease, that NFHEV worsens pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis through T1/ST2-independent regulation of proinflammatory and profibrotic gene expression. Aim 2 is to define pathophysiologically important NFHEV-expressing cell types by determining whether ubiquitous and/or cell type-specific deficiency of NFHEV protects against pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in the bleomycin mod- el of interstitial lung disease. This Aim will utilize mice with inducible cell type-specific NFHEV gene knockout. Aim 3 will take advantage of the spatial heterogeneity of inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs of human pa- tients with IPF to determine whether increased expression of NFHEV is associated with active fibrotic foci, cel- lular inflammation, and expression of candidate NFHEV-driven proinflammatory and profibrotic factors. This work investigates unknown aspects of NFHEV biology in association with a deadly lung disease prevalent in Veterans. The results will lay the groundwork for future development of NFHEV-targeting therapies in Veterans and in the general population. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the needs of Veterans and contributes to the VA Healthcare Mission."
"9407683","Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been an alternative source for patients with hematologic diseases who may be potentially cured by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In addition, UCB is an important stem cell source for other promising technologies, such as large-scale ex vivo productions of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived red blood cells and platelets. In the 25 years following the first successful case of transplantation in 1988, more than 30,000 UCB transplantations have been performed with > 600,000 UCB units stored worldwide. Initially, UCB transplantation was mainly performed in children, given the concern of low cell dose. As cell dose is critical for engraftment and survival, infusing two units of UCB has been a popular practice for adult patients. However, this approach makes HLA matching even more challenging. Remarkably, it has been estimated that current total UCB collections represent < 5% of potentially available cords. Therefore, there is an unmet need for innovative and low-cost solutions to increase the number and HLA diversity of banked UCB units, as well as to overcome the cell dose limitation of each UCB unit. Furthermore, an international survey conducted by the World Marrow Donor Association in 2013 revealed that nearly 90% of public UCB banks are not financially sustainable. Recently, we have developed an innovative microbubble- based technology for rare cell isolation in blood that can help resolve these issues. We use perfluorocarbon- filled microbubbles (MBs), which have been used as a safe ultrasound contrast agent, to create targeted agents for sorting. Therefore, this material would be suitable for isolating cells for therapeutic applications. We will create the targeted microbubble based system to isolate HSCs, which leads to substantial reduction of the final product volume (< 1 ml) compared to current standard unit (> 20 ml) for banking. This factor alone will lead to > 20-fold savings on long-term storage in liquid nitrogen. The simplicity of the procedure has been shown in publications, and reduction of the cost may revolutionize the UCB banking industry to facilitate realization of emerging innovations in cell based therapies, aside from more conventional hematopoietic cell transplantation. We have accomplished key feasibility milestones for the phase I grant and will develop a closed system to isolate HSCs from UCB for potential clinical applications, including hematopoietic transplantation and ex vivo blood production. Moreover, this system can also be conveniently adapted for HSC isolation from other sources, including peripheral blood and bone marrow."

"9399807","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This award will enable Dr. Joaniter Nankabirwa to investigate the impact of indoor residual spraying of insecticides (IRS) alone or in combination with mass drug administration (MDA, administration of a full doses of antimalarial treatment to an entire population irrespective of infection status) on the malaria infectious reservoir, host immunity, and drug resistance. The investigations will leverage data and samples from an on- going study in north-eastern Uganda comparing the community impacts of the interventions on malaria morbidity, mortality and transmission. This work will be undertaken with the guidance of an experienced team of mentors with strong expertise in epidemiology, immunology, molecular microbiology, and the design, implementation and analysis of clinical studies. Dr. Nankabirwa will further her career development by; 1) conducting the laboratory assays, 2) attending courses in clinical research, immunology, molecular microbiology, and data analysis, and 3) attending and presenting at international research conferences. This program will be critical in enabling Dr. Nankabirwa to establish a career as an independent malaria researcher in Uganda. In Uganda, malaria control progress has been slow and control gains have been fragile, with increases in parasite prevalence being observed following cessation of implementation of effective control interventions. For improved control and ultimately elimination, interventions should be designed to eliminate reservoirs of malaria parasites, including microscopic and sub-microscopic infections, and yet minimize both the loss of host immunity, and the development of resistance. The project proposed here will focus on the effects of IRS and MDA on sub-microscopic infections, host immunity and development of resistance, as well as the rebound effects of withdrawing the interventions on these markers. Understanding the impacts of these interventions will help to identify the optimal interventions to control and eliminate malaria in Uganda. We hypothesise that implementing IRS will lead to decreased prevalence of parasite infection, and adding MDA will be associated with a further decrease and sustained reduction in the prevalence, but with some loss of host immunity and increase in drug resistance compared to IRS alone. Findings from this study will guide decision making on how best to implement interventions to control and eliminate malaria in Uganda."
"9309000","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is designed to obtain the first comprehensive assessment of epigenetic defects (epimutations) induced by the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in the offspring produced. The genome-wide occurrence of abnormalities in DNA methylation patterns and gene expression patterns will be assessed in mice produced by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using cutting-edge, high-throughput epigenomic and genomic technologies. In addition, the etiology of ART-induced epimutations will be investigated by determining the precise timing of appearance of epimutations in mice produced by ART, as well as by discerning the relative contribution of each of three specific aspects of the ART process - gonadotropin stimulation of folliculogenesis, prolonged culture of preimplantation embryos, and embryo transfer - to the induction of epimutations. Finally, the fate of ART-induced epimutations will be examined to determine if these are consistently corrected by epigenetic reprogramming during either embryogenesis or gametogenesis. The significance of the research proposed in this application is that it will include high (single-base) resolution, comprehensive analyses of the disruptive effects of ART on epigenetic programming genome-wide, and it will facilitate controlled, prospective studies of the genesis, etiology, extent and fte of epimutations induced by ART, including parallel, simultaneous studies of the relative contribution(s) of multiple different aspects of the ART process to the induction of epimutations in the offspring produced. The proposed research is innovative and timely because we are now able to generate datasets of unprecedented scale and resolution describing abnormal epigenetic programming and gene expression in ART offspring, and we can use these to understand the genesis, consequences and fate of ART-induced epimutations in ways that will have significant implications for basic biology and human health. The resulting enhanced understanding of the etiology of ART-induced epimutations will inform future modifications of clinical ART protocols to minimize the induction of epimutations in ART-derived human offspring and thereby reduce the occurrence of epigenetic disorders in individuals produced by this technology."
"9319645","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): LC5A8 was first identified as a candidate tumor suppressor in colon. We showed that it is a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and that its ability to energize the cellular entry of the SCFA butyrate, a bacterial fermentation product of dietary fiber and an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, underlies its tumor-suppressive function in colon. However, in vivo studies with Slc5a8-/- mice failed to support such a function. Now we found that the ability of Slc5a8 to protect against colitis and colon cancer is dictated by dietary fiber content. The transporter is obligatory for the beneficial effects of SCFAs in colonic epithelial cells only when the luminal concentrations of SCFAs are low (low fiber intake). In contrast, the obligatory role of the transporter in mucosal immune cells is not dependent on dietary fiber content. We hypothesize that SLC5A8 is a conditional tumor suppressor in colon and is essential for the maintenance of the tolerogenic phenotype of the mucosal immune system, but the obligation of its role in colonic epithelial cells and LP immune cells is differentially influenced by the dietary fiber content. In addition, we hypothesize that SLC5A8 and optimal dietary fiber protect against bacterial dysbiosis in the gut, which is known to drive inflammation and cancer in colon. We will test these hypotheses by completing the following specific aims: (1A) Show that Slc5a8 is essential for the immunotolerant phenotype of the mucosal immune system by qualitatively and quantitatively increasing the number of anti- inflammatory dendritic cells and immunosuppressive Tregs in colon, and determine the relevance of dietary fiber content to this process; (1B) Delineate the phylogenetic profile of gut microbiota in wild type and Slc5a8-/- mice under low-fiber & high-fiber conditions to determine if bacterial dysbiosis occurs in the gut as a consequence of Slc5a8 deletion and/or low dietary fiber, thus driving the increased severity of colitis and enhanced colon cancer observed in Slc5a8-/- mice under low-fiber dietary conditions; (2A) Interrogate the contribution of Slc5a8 in colonic epithelial cells versus Slc5a8 in myeloid cells to the protection against experimental colitis under low-fiber & high-fiber dietary conditions using conditional knockout mice with selective deletion of Slc5a8 either in epithelial cells or in myeloid cells; (2B) Interrogate the contribution of Slc5a8 in colonic epithelial cells versus Slc5a8 in myeloid cells to the protection against experimental colon cancer under low-fiber & high-fiber dietary conditions using conditional knockout mice with selective deletion of Slc5a8 either in epithelial cells or in myeloi cells; (3) Dissect the changes in histone acetylation and consequent transcriptome landscape in colonic epithelial cells and LP dendritic cells that are responsible for the ability of Slc5a8 to protect against colitis and colon cancer under low-fiber & high-fiber dietary conditions."

Indeed, an important aspect of this Program Project is that in all in vivo studies proposed in this Project, we will adhere strictly to the procedures that we used in the CAESAR Consortium. Specifically: i) all animals will be allocated to treatment group randomly (randomization will be performed by Dr. Kong); ii) all investigators will be blinded to treatment allocation until the final data analysis is released by Dr. Kong; iii) exclusion criteria will be established a priori, before the experiments are started, not during or after the experiments; iv) group sizes will be determined a priori, before the experiments are started (based upon power analysis by Dr. Kong) and will not be changed during or after the experiment; v) the experiments will be carried out until the predetermined sample sizes are achieved, without any knowledge of interim results. After the predetermined sample sizes are achieved, all data will be given to Dr. Kong, where they will be unblinded and analyzed by appropriate statistical methods. These are the same procedures that we have used successfully in CAESAR for the past six years. Use of these methods will ensure rigor and greatly reduce the chance of spurious or misleading results."
"9351192","Leiomyomas are highly pervasive benign tumors of the uterus that have an overall prevalence of 70% in  women by the age of 50. They are the leading cause of hysterectomy in the United States, accounting for  almost 50% of the 600,000 hysterectomies performed annually and $34 billion dollars in annual healthcare  costs. Despite their prevelance and public health impact, the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the  development and growth of leiomyoma are not well understood. Phenotypically, these tumors are distinct  from the adjacent normal tissue largely due to the overproduction of extracellular matrix component. We and  others have demonstrated that amongst the differentially expressed genes between LEIO and MYO, is  EFEMP1, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Among the 20 most differentially expressed  genes, we identified Epidermal-growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix 1 (EFEMP1). EFEMP1  encodes one of the fibulins (fibulin-3; FBLN3), a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins that has been  demonstrated to play roles in angiogenesis, extracellular matrix production, organogenesis, and cell  morphology and growth. Differential expression of EFEMP1 has been implicated in tumor growth,  angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix production in a number of malignancies. Specifically, the downregulation  of EFEMP1 has been demonstrated to promote growth and altered intracellular signaling in prostate, lung,  endometrial, and colorectal cancer. Neither the expression pattern nor the role of EFEMP1 and its protein  product have been investigated in leiomyomas. Our lab has generated preliminary data that demonstrate  that EFEMP1 is markedly downregulated in leiomyomas. Based on its role as a tumor suppressor in various  cancers, we hypothesize that aberrant expression of EFEMP1 contributes to the pathophysiology of  leiomyomas. We propose to test our hypothesis in two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine  the contribution of EFEMP1 to the tumorigenesis in leiomyoma. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine the  mechanism by which EFEMP1 is differentially expressed in leiomyoma versus myometrium. We predict that  the findings generated in this study will bring us one step closer to developing long-term nonhormonal  therapeutic and preventative interventions for these highly morbid tumors, underscoring the translational  potential of this study."
"9545354","Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a powerful platform that combines cutting-edge microscopy methods, image analysis algorithms, microfluidics, and macromolecular synthesis techniques to comprehensively characterize the dynamics of nucleic acids in well-controlled, time-varying biomimetic environments. The long-term vision is to characterize nucleic acid dynamics in the intracellular milieu, with a focus on large naked DNA, specifically motivated by recently engineered nucleic acid complexes for gene therapy and genomes of recently discovered macroviruses. The primary hindrance to understanding intracellular nucleic acid transport is the overwhelming complexity and diversity of macromolecules and networks that crowd cells. While many studies have explored macromolecular dynamics in crowded environments, experiments have largely been carried out either in: monodisperse, steady-state in vitro crowded systems, that fail to replicate the complex intracellular environment; or highly heterogeneous, dynamic in vivo systems, which offer incomplete understanding of the macromolecular components and properties responsible for observed transport. The proposed comprehensive experimental toolset will be designed to bridge this gap, and to directly couple single-macromolecule transport to (i) conformational dynamics, (ii) ensemble transport, and (iii) crowded environment properties. The vital first step towards applying this platform to cells is to design and utilize well-controlled in vitro cytoskeleton networks that can be precisely tuned over a wide parameter space to generate the rich DNA dynamics observed in vivo and to couple observed dynamics to tunable variables that include properties of both DNA and cytoskeleton. Environmental and DNA parameters will be varied and the resulting DNA and network dynamics will be measured using a platform consisting of (a) light-sheet microscopy with methods to probe single-molecule and ensemble DNA dynamics as well as environmental properties, (b) biomimetic cytoskeleton environments comprised of varying amounts of (i) actin and (ii) microtubules, (c) home-built microfluidic perfusion chambers for in situ modulation of polymerization states of (i) and (ii) in real-time, and (d) custom-engineered fluorescent-labeled DNA molecules of varying lengths and topologies. The current research will focus on optimizing and disseminating this robust platform, SLAMMTAP (Spatiotemporal Light-sheet Assisted Multiscale Macromolecular Transport Analysis Probe), and proving its utility and applicability to health-science researchers by identifying the key characteristics of both DNA (size, topology) and cytoskeleton environments (concentration, stiffness, crosslinking density, spatiotemporal heterogeneities) that lead to single-molecule transport, conformational dynamics and collective diffusion of DNA that mimic complex phenomena observed in vivo. Ultimately, in vitro and in vivo studies of DNA dynamics allowable by the techniques developed in this project will shed light on how viral genomes traverse the crowded cytoplasm and will help guide researchers to engineer DNA- or RNA-containing gene therapies with optimal efficacy."
"9345085","Project Summary/Abstract  In the United States (U.S.), African Americans/Blacks (AAs) are the racial/ethnic group most adversely impacted by the HIV epidemic. As such, one of the goals of the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy is to permanently reduce long-standing health disparities in HIV disease. Lower HIV clinic attendance and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) use (i.e., initiation, modification, and adherence) by AAs are likely the main mediators of continually worse HIV virologic responses among AAs compared to Caucasians. However, despite the development and implementation of interventions targeting many known individual-level risk and protective factors for clinic attendance and ART use, substantial racial disparities remain. Persistent disparities may be due, in part, to the adverse conditions that characterize the high risk neighborhood environments (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation and violence) in which HIV+ AAs disproportionately reside. However, despite such adversities some AAs demonstrate resilience (i.e., displaying positive behaviors/outcomes despite adversity) which may be critical to reducing persistent racial disparities. Compared to the risk environment, individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience represent novel and more malleable intervention targets for reducing persistent disparities. Unfortunately, resilience remains understudied in the HIV literature, perhaps due to the absence of a reliable and valid resilience measure for HIV+ adults that captures all resilience components. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a reliable and valid measure of individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience; to document its psychometric properties; and to assess longitudinally whether higher resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs by the level of the risk environment. Data on HIV+ AAs enrolled in the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort and the UAB 1917 Clinic Cohort will be used for the proposed study. Specifically, this study aims to (1) use advanced concept mapping, which is a mixed methods approach, to generate items that capture all components of resilience; (2) perform psychometric testing of concept mapping items to create a reliable and valid resilience measure that includes all components of resilience; (3a) examine whether resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors (e.g., alcohol/drug use, mental illness, and health insurance) are prospectively associated with HIV outcomes (e.g., clinic attendance, ART adherence, and virologic suppression) by the level of the neighborhood risk environment; and (3b) assess for interactions between resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors by the level of the risk environment. This study responds to the critical need to develop a multi-component resilience measure for HIV+ adults and to establish whether resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs. Our important findings may lead to the development and implementation of novel multilevel resilience-related interventions to reduce persistent racial disparities in HIV disease."
"9224329","Project Summary In the last two decades, functional  neuroimaging has providing a stunning window into the function of the human brain. When a person looks around the world, for example, systematic patterns of activity emerge in the cortex, related to both visual properties (e.g. the size or position) and also conceptual properties (e.g. object versus human versus natural scene) of the experience. These patterns of cortical activity are remarkably consistent across different adults, but very little is known about when, or how, they develop. Understanding the timing and mechanism of typical brain development is a necessary foundation for identifying the cause of neuro-developmental disorders that affect cognitive development, and for assessing the ef?cts of early rehabilitation. One reason these questions remain unanswered is the limited methods available for neuroimaging in awake human infants. To measure functional responses in the whole cortex with high spatial resolution, the ideal technique is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); however, it is extremely challenging to acquire high-quality fMRI data from infants while they are awake. One challenge is participant motion. Moving a millimeter is enough to destroy a MR image. Infants cannot be instructed to lie still, and cannot be held tightly because their skulls are soft (and because they must be comfortable during the experiment). The ?rst aim of the proposed research is to address the challenges of fMRI in infants, and collect high quality data from awake human infants while they watch dynamic, bright colored, infant-friendly movies. Technical innovations necessary to achieve this aim include novel ?exible experimental designs, custom-built coil sized for an infant's head, a special protocol for scanning the infant with a parent in the MRI, custom-written quiet MRI sequences, and special procedures for data analysis. The second aim is to compute and compare the responses to 60 blocks of movies (including children's faces and bodies, toys, natural scenes, and textures) in twenty full-term infants aged 4-8 months and in adults. The patterns of responses across movies can also be used to compare the predictions of alternative theories of both initial state and learning mechanisms in infant cortex. Finally, when cortex changes over development, a fundamental question is whether this change is driven by learning from visual experience, or by maturation of the biological mechanism. Because visual experience is extremely limited in utero, a natural dissociation of these factors occurs in the case of moderately preterm birth. Measuring the development of cortical responses in full-term and moderately preterm infants will also provide an important foundation for studies of infants born very preterm, who are at high risk for neurological and developmental disorders."
"9323661","This proposal is the third renewal of our Global Infectious Disease training grant (D43 TW005884) entitled, Training and Research in Severe Malarial Anemia (SMA). Our International Malaria Training and Research Program (IMTRP) was established in 2002 (PD/PI, D. Perkins). During the current funding cycle, trainees were highly prolific in generating peer-reviewed manuscripts and presenting at international meetings. Based on current scientific training needs identified in Kenya, we will focus on thematic target areas: (1) genomics/bioinformatics (2) drug/vaccine discovery and (3) biostatistics and epidemiological/mathematical modeling. The strategic training approach is based on success by past and current trainees who identified genetic pathways that mediate development of SMA, thereby, providing the foundation for discovery of novel treatment options. Engagement of trainees in targeted focus areas that support improved therapeutic options comes at an opportune time since treatment and management of SMA has been met with very limited success. The next phase of activities will continue long-standing partnerships between the University of New Mexico (UNM) and our Kenyan collaborators (Kenyatta and Maseno Universities and Kenya Medical Research Institute), and a new academic site (Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology). We have also included our collaborative partners from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), along with the newly established West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens (WACCBIP), University of Ghana. Formation of WACCBIP is based on two recent capacity-building grants ($15.9M) awarded to a former PhD trainee in the IMTRP. Since the training mission for WACCBIP includes mentoring Kenyan scientists, we will provide joint training and synergize our activities. Moving forward, we propose training for current doctoral students (2) and MSc students (2) who will transition to PhD studies. Through cost-sharing with WACCBIP, we will also jointly train additional doctoral candidates (4-6), and two postdoctoral fellows per year (10 total). Long- term training (12 mos.) will be offered for specialized training at UNM and/or LANL for one postdoctoral fellow/year, and for medium-term training (6 to 9 mos.) of two to three scientists/year. We will also train junior faculty (1-2) in each year of the grant and offer competitively awarded re-entry grants to support transitioning to independent investigator status (1 per year). Short-term, in-depth training in the focus areas will also be offered through annual workshops in Kenya. The overall training paradigm will foster sustained establishment of independent researchers in Kenya. Expansion of our highly successful training program in the next phase is based on over $120M in annual funding for the multidisciplinary team assembled. Collectively, the training platform will also provide the technology transfer and capacity-building required for establishing a critical mass of Kenyan scientists to address the challenging public health problems facing their society."

"9144423","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental question during assisted ventilation in the ICU is how to synchronize the ventilator rhythm with the patient's breathing effort smoothly and effectively. Dyssynchrony could lead to increased/wasted work of breathing, patient discomfort, increased need for sedation, higher rate of tracheostomy, longer durations of mechanical ventilation and reduced number of ventilator-free days, longer ICU and hospital stay, and lower probabilities of survival and home discharge. Current generation ventilators either dictate the breathing rhythm completely with the use of heavy sedation/muscle paralysis (ventilator-based ventilation) or let the patient trigger the ventilator breath by breath (patient-based ventilation). Neither extreme is optimal. We propose a next generation of ventilatory assist (entrainment-based mechanical ventilation, EMV) that is based on the classical physics theory of mutual entrainment between coupled oscillators, which may provide a cost-effective solution to this clinical problem. This innovative technique is motivated by our recent discovery that the brain circuits controlling breathing are capable of entraining to a ventilator and adaptin to it through learning and memory of the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex. In EMV, the patient's spontaneous respiratory rhythm and the ventilator rhythm are phase-locked to one another on the same tempo, just like two individuals dancing together. Under a previous NIH ARRA Challenge Grant (RC1) award we have implemented a prototype of EMV on a widely used mechanical ventilator (Puritan-Bennett Model 840) and demonstrated the feasibility of this novel technique on a computerized lung simulator. Based on these simulation results, a conditional approval for investigational device exemption has been recently granted by the FDA for initial clinical research of the EMV mode. To transition the base technology from the bench top to the bedside, a multidisciplinary research team comprised of a basic researcher/bioengineer (Dr. Poon, PI), a clinician (Dr. Harris, Co-I), a biostatistician (Dr. Schoenfeld, statistical consultan) and a technology developer (Covidien/Puritan-Bennett) has been formed to address the underlying scientific, engineering, statistical and clinical problems. The goal of this pilot projet is to first establish that the proposed EMV mode is both safe and effective in entraining the patient's breathing rhythm over a short (4-hour) period (Aim 1). This phase I clinical research wil allow us to fine-tune the parameters of the EMV mode in order to further minimize risks and maximize the effectiveness of the EMV mode in improving patient-ventilator synchrony over a long period. The second phase (Aim 2) is to establish that the EMV mode is safe and feasible in providing improved synchrony in ARDS patients when used over a patient's entire ventilation weaning period. The proposed phase I/phase II research are both necessary and sufficient for securing FDA approval of a full-scale phase III multicenter trial to be conducted in the future in order to test whether improved patient-ventilator synchrony with the EMV mode may lead to materially beneficial clinical outcomes during ventilator weaning."
"9358021","The immunoinhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIGIT play critical roles in regulating tolerance, and are key mediators of T cell dysfunction in cancer and chronic infections. Anti-PD-1 antibody is now an FDA approved therapy for cancer, while anti-TIGIT is a highly promising target for enhancing anti-tumor immunity. While PD-1 blockade is having impressive therapeutic effects in some cancers, many patients do not respond to single agent immunotherapy. With recent studies showing striking synergies between the PD-1 and TIGIT pathways in regulating T cell dysfunction in vivo, combination therapies are under consideration. Our lab along with our collaborators in this PPG have shown that PD-1:PD-L1 interactions regulate both the induction and maintenance of peripheral T cell tolerance, and that TIGIT has T cell intrinsic inhibitory effects that regulate tolerance. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which these inhibitory pathways work individually, and particularly in combination, to inhibit T cell activation. The goal of Project 3 is to determine the interactions between TIGIT and PD-1 in controlling CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD4+ FoxP3? T cells, and define the genetic circuits underlying these interactions. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis that interactions between TIGIT and PD-1 control Treg function and/or stability, and synergize to have a dominant effect on CD4+ FoxP3- T cells, thereby controlling T cell tolerance. We will examine how combinations of agonists or antagonists to PD-1 and TIGIT alter the function of Treg and self reactive CD4+ FoxP3? T cells in vitro, as well as the pathogenicity of myelin-reactive CD4+ T cells in vivo in the EAE model. We will use TIGIT/PD-1 double conditional knockout mice (cKO) to test synergy within specific cell types. In the second aim, we will infer the transcriptional networks mediating the actions of PD-1 and TIGIT in Tregs and CD4+ FoxP3? T cells, based on the dynamic profiles of RNA expression in activated CD4+ FoxP3? T cells and Treg, and measurements of open chromatin by ATAC-seq. Guided by this inferred transcriptional map, we will systematically perturb and test the functions of candidate transcription factors in vitro during T cell activation or in vivo upon transfer of MOG-specific T cells to induce EAE. The results of this proposal should provide critical insights into how TIGIT and PD-1 interact to modulate T cell activation and tolerance. Furthermore, our results will contribute directly to Projects 1 and 2 by providing explanations for the changes observed in T cell functions in the absence of TIGIT (Project 1) and functional differences in T cells between MS patients vs. malignant gliomas based on PD-1 and TIGIT expression and activity (Project 2). Improvements in our functional and mechanistic understanding of costimulator and coinhibitor interactions should lead to new therapeutic targets and strategies for reducing autoimmunity while increasing anti-tumor immunity."
"9323622","Project Summary Our preliminary studies revealed the dynamic evolution of B cell subsets as a function of age in the human thymus. An initial contingent of medullary B cells present at birth and displaying a phenotype of naive B cells is progressively replaced by antigen-experienced, antibody-secreting, class-switched plasma cells confined within the perivascular space (PVS). Plasma cells start to appear in the PVS a few months after birth at a time that is consistent with early exposure to common endemic viruses and vaccination antigens. We propose that this latter subset results from previous immunization and constitute an important pool of memory B cells and plasma cells. The maturing thymus would therefore represent an unrecognized niche for B cell memory alongside the bone marrow. We also hypothesize that thymic resident plasma cells significantly contribute to the humoral immunity through their constitutive antibody-secreting capacity. Our proposed studies will use a large collection of human specimens obtained from donors aged 0-2 years to further characterize this niche during its early development. Using mice immunized with model antigens, we will then investigate mechanisms whereby PC accumulate in the thymus and contribute to the overall serum immunity. Aim 1. To characterize the thymic plasma cell niche in the human infant thymus. We will examine the kinetics of development of the thymic PC niche in ~250 human thymus specimens from donors aged 0-2 years. Using immunochemistry, multicolor flow cytometry, gene expression profiling and next generation sequencing- based IGVH repertoire analysis, we will characterize the architecture, molecular signature and clonal composition of thymic PC in human infants. A comparison with PC subsets in the spleen and bone marrow of the same donors will reveal whether thymic PC have unique features. Aim 2. To determine the reactivity profile of thymic plasma cells in human infants. In aim 2, we will assess the frequency of thymic PC reactive to a broad range of antigens towards which human infants are exposed. These include vaccination viral and bacterial antigens, common food antigens as well as ABO blood group antigens. The possible correlation between antigen-specific B cells in the thymus and the presence of serum IgG specific to the same antigens will be examined. Aim 3. To verify the origin of thymic PC and evaluate their role in serological immunity. Mice immunized with model T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigens, will be used to verified that thymic PC originate from peripheral immune responses. We will then use a series of genetically-deficient mouse strains to investigate the implication of specific chemokines and chemokine receptors as well as survival factors in the migration and maintenance of thymic PC. Lastly, we will evaluate the capacity of antigen-experienced thymic PC to confer humoral immunity upon adoptive transfer to or transplantation of thymus fragments under the renal capsule of recipient animals."

"9382696","Project Summary The long-term goal of our research is to understand the functional organization of the animal cell nucleus. Specifically, we will concentrate on transcription (RNA synthesis) and splicing in the giant ?lampbrush? chromosomes found in oocytes of frogs and salamanders. Two features make these chromosomes ideal for our studies. First, they are the largest known chromosomes, with individual lengths up to 1 mm. Second, they are involved in active transcription and splicing. The transcribing regions appear as hundreds of chromatin loops, each of which contain one or more active genes. The loops themselves are so large (10s to 100s of mm in length) that one can visualize transcription and splicing of specific genes by conventional light microscopy. Our aim now is to analyze the detailed molecular organization of specific transcription units in lampbrush chromosome loops by a combination of 1) single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), 2) deep sequencing of nascent transcripts on the lampbrush chromosomes, 3) deep sequencing of lampbrush chromatin (ChIP-seq), and 4) super-resolution microscopy of specific loops. The aim is to analyze transcription and splicing on a sufficient number of specific chromosome loops that we can draw inferences about the overall organization of active chromatin. These studies could reveal aspects of RNA transcription and processing that are missed by conventional in vitro molecular studies."
"9360097","Background: The success of liver transplantation with good short-term and long-term survival rates has resulted in its widespread use for treatment of many patients with end-stage liver disease. The current 1-year, 5-year and 10-year survival rates are 84%, 68% and 54%, respectively. According to the American Liver Foundation, more than 6,000 liver transplants are performed each year in the United States. The most common complication in the early post-transplant period is acute cellular rejection (ACR), occurring in 20-40% of patients. Diagnosis of ACR by serum biomarkers is not specific and confirmation requires a liver biopsy, which is invasive and may cause hemorrhage and mortality. In addition, needle liver biopsy samples only about 1/50,000 of the liver and is limited by sampling variability and inter-observer variation in histological interpretation. At the Mayo Clinic, patients receive a liver biopsy on day 7 post-transplant if serum liver enzymes remain elevated. Approximately 60% of biopsied patients have ACR and are treated with additional immunosuppression, followed by a second biopsy on day 14 to evaluate treatment response. A noninvasive biomarker of ACR with high sensitivity and specificity may provide a better alternative to biopsy to reduce complications and facilitate more frequent follow-up and monitoring of the allograft. Our Goal is develop ultrasound-based methods to quantify mechanical properties of the liver for the purpose of noninvasive ACR diagnosis. The field of ultrasound elastography has developed various techniques to measure mechanical properties of the liver, most of which ignore tissue viscosity. All biological tissues are inherently viscoelastic and ignoring the viscous component not only biases the estimates of elasticity but also fails to report a potentially important tissue parameter. Disregarding tissue viscosity also masks potentially complex pathophysiological changes that manifest in structural changes affecting both elasticity and viscosity by grouping the two terms under the elasticity parameter. The omission of tissue viscosity largely stems from the inability to make stable measurements of shear wave attenuation. Several techniques have proposed model-based methods to estimate tissue viscosity by assuming a fixed relationship between wave velocity and attenuation without any knowledge of tissue attenuation. Because it is difficult to measure tissue attenuation in vivo, these models cannot be verified. Thus, the only appropriate approach for true measurements of tissue viscoelasticity requires independent measurements of wave velocity and attenuation. Attenuation Measuring Ultrasound Shearwave Elastography (AMUSE) is a method developed by our group that measures shear wave velocity and attenuation at multiple frequencies independently to provide true model-free characterization of tissue mechanical properties and is the first and only method of its kind. AMUSE is a post-processing method and is compatible with the current ultrasound shear wave elastography system worldwide. Method: We will use acoustic radiation force to generate waves in the transplanted liver and then measure the wave propagation with high frame rate ultrasound imaging. We will analyze the resulting wave motion data and evaluate the shear wave velocity and attenuation at multiple frequencies and compare the results with clinical findings of presence of acute cellular rejection. Approach: To achieve these important goals we will conduct a program with the following two coordinated Specific Aims: 1) To compare ultrasound measurements of shear wave velocity and attenuation in post-transplant liver patients to clinical diagnosis, 2) To study changes in mechanical properties of transplanted livers with acute cellular rejection due to medications and treatment."
"9325026","Establishing a sustainable and CRT-informed overall research environment that more strongly motivates  and prepares students for research careers and reduces the leakages that occur is an essential aim in our  work to help students to successfully navigate these transition points.

Extensive faculty development strategies at CSUN and at our diverse  Pipeline Partner institutions will better enable faculty to develop their own research programs and NIH  proposals that can engage student researchers, with a rigorous mentor training program ensuring a more  culturally competent mentoring approach informed by best practices. Within BUILD@CSUN laboratories,  students and faculty members will engage in their ongoing research in a cooperative social environment  rather than a competitive one - less hierarchical and more inclusive of input from all members of the  laboratory and with attention paid to the social justice implications of one's work. Extensive and multimodal  collaborations with Research Partners who are already deeply engaged in funded research in health issues  in our local community will elevate the scope and impact of our institutional research efforts, and help to  augment our focus on health and health disparities research. Our theoretically-based innovation of  establishing a CRT-informed research program will be further advanced by embracing recent technological  innovation that enables us to link research activities and expertise on a regional and national scale. Online  research-sharing and collaboration tools will not replace traditional in-person mentoring relationships but can  support faculty professional development and enhance and sustain the interdisciplinary approach necessary  to stimulate advances in health disparities research. Entrepreneurial innovation is also an important  component of our proposal.

"9262174","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychosocial distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, is common in post-treatment cancer survivors and associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including sleep disturbance, fatigue and decreased quality of life (QOL). Interventions that are accessible to post-treatment cancer survivors experiencing significant distress are sorely needed, especially in rural areas where psychosocial care is scarce. Recent national guidelines recommend screening all adults with cancer for distress and treating those with moderate to severe symptoms using a stepped-care approach. The purpose of this pilot study is to implement a stepped- care approach in rural community oncology settings using a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol that includes both self-directed and telehealth approaches. Specific aims are to: (1) determine feasibility (accrual, retention, adherence) of a randomized controlled trial of a stepped-care mental health intervention (tailored to symptom level) versus enhanced usual care (EUC) in 90 rural, post-treatment cancer survivors with moderate to severe levels of distress (anxiety and/or depressive symptoms); (2) obtain preliminary efficacy data for reducing emotional distress and improving secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, fatigue, fear of recurrence, QOL); and (3) determine intervention costs. We will recruit 90 adult (age ?18), rural cancer survivors who are 6-24 months post-treatment for female breast, colorectal, prostate, or gynecologic cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and who report clinically significant anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants will be stratified by symptom severity and randomized to stepped-care or EUC. For participants with moderate symptoms, low- intensity, stepped care will consist of a self-guided CBT workbook and biweekly check-in calls to assess changes in symptom severity/immediate need for psychiatric treatment and to provide minimal support. For participants with moderate to severe symptoms, high-intensity stepped care will consist of a CBT workbook and psychotherapy delivered by telephone. Participants randomized to EUC will receive survivorship resources and referral information for local mental health providers. Measures will be administered by telephone and mail at pre-, mid- and post-intervention. The proposed study efficiently builds on prior and current research and leverages the existing NCI-funded Research Base infrastructure. The innovation of this work is its focus on addressing a mental health disparity among rural cancer survivors through a stepped-care intervention. After this study is completed, we will implement a fully-powered study in the community cancer setting. The resultant intervention will have great potential for widespread dissemination since it will be manualized, delivered by telephone, and comprised of modules to allow customized treatments for individuals with different cancer types."
"9380356","Project Summary The goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms underlying the molecular and cellular endocrinology of parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR) signaling as it relates to phosphate and vitamin D balance. PTHR is uniquely expressed on both apical and basolateral membranes of the polarized cells that form renal proximal tubules. The biological consequences of bilateral PTHR expression or its origin are unknown. The premise of the proposal is that characterizing asymmetric PTHR actions will fill a major gap in our understanding of PTHR signaling and function and reconcile conflicting views of PTH action. Pilot studies show that PTHR signals from both basolateral and apical membranes but only basolateral PTHR activation induces transcription of the 1?-vitamin D hydroxylase (CYP27B1). Apical PTHR signaling primarily inhibits phosphate transport. The molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating PTHR actions are incompletely defined. The PTHR interacts at apical membranes with the PDZ scaffolding protein NHERF1, which tethers the receptor and regulates G-protein signaling and function. Absence of NHERF1 or its downregulation causes relocation of PTHR to basolateral membranes with an increased 1,25[OH]2D in mice and humans. Preliminary data show that Scribble, a basolateral PDZ protein, exerts a reciprocal effect, where downregulation causes accumulation of PTHR at apical membranes. We hypothesize that the polarized PTHR arrangement arises from the segregated location of NHERF1 and Scribble. We advance a research program to uncover new aspects of PTHR signaling in polarized kidney cells and test the central hypothesis that polarized PTHR expression is driven by the asymmetric location of the PDZ adaptor proteins, Scribble and NHERF, which in turn underlies the signaling bias of apical and basolateral PTHR actions on vitamin D and phosphate homeostasis. We propose three closely linked aims to evaluate this idea. The first two aims of address the hypothesis that basolateral PTHR activation preferentially stimulates the 1?-vitamin D hydroxylase, whereas apical PTHR signaling primarily blocks Pi transport. Aim 1 will determine the role of Scribble and NHERF in the generation of PTHR polarity and its asymmetric signaling in human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells. Aim 2 uses live-cell FRET microscopy and other state-of-the art fluorescence techniques to characterize basolateral and apical membrane signaling properties of PTHR and the effect of NHERF1 and Scribble on biased G protein signaling. Aim 3 will delineate the in vivo actions of polarized proximal tubule PTHR by testing the role of Scribble on PTHR-dependent vitamin D and phosphate metabolism using a novel, conditional proximal tubule Scribble knockout mouse model that we generated. The outcomes will frame innovative therapeutic approaches targeting disorders of mineral metabolism."
"9339582","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adaptive plasticity is a phrase used to explain how cancer cells gain selective growth and survival capabilities through phenotypic changes in response to their environment. Adaptive plasticity is exemplified by epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) a process, which enables cancer cells to become migratory and invasive as well as having an increase in survival properties. This process can be reversed to a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), which is believed to favor tumor engraftment and growth of cancer cells at metastatic sites. EMT in cancer cells is linked with isoform switching of the transmembrane protein CD44 from expressing the CD44 variant isoform (CD44v) to expressing CD44 standard form (CD44s). In this context we found that treatment of BxPC3 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line with gemcitabine induces EMT and a high level of expression of CD44s with a decrease in expression of CD44v isoforms. This suggests that an adverse effect of chemotherapy may drive EMT, enhancing invasiveness and rendering tumor cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Moreover, we were able to use flow cytometry to select out from a PDAC cell lines (CFPAC-1 and AsPC1) a subpopulation of cells expressing high levels of CD44s. Knockdown of CD44s, in these cells, caused them to undergo MET, to be less invasive and to become more responsive to chemotherapy. These studies suggest that chemotherapy or other environmental stresses may induce a CD44s phenotype that promotes survival and is more invasive; however optimal tumor regrowth following chemotherapy or growth after engraftment of micrometastases may require re-switching to a CD44v phenotype and down regulation of CD44s expression. We hypothesize that CD44s and its variant isoforms are key regulators of adaptive plasticity in pancreatic cancer cells. We further hypothesize that understanding the molecular basis for adaptive plasticity will provide new strategies for improving therapy. These studies represent new data from our laboratory and build on 20 years of research solely focused on the biology and treatment of pancreatic cancer.  To address these hypotheses we propose the following three objectives. Objective 1. Determine the functional relevance of CD44s and CD44v in PDAC. This objective will be addressed using isogenic matched cell line models in which expression of CD44s and CD44v isoforms are regulated. The effects on modulating expression of CD44v and CD44s will be assessed for phenotype, invasiveness, response to chemotherapy, tumor engraftment and growth. Objective 2. Determine the mechanism(s) that regulates CD44 isoform switching and CD44 expression. This objective will determine the potential role of EMT related transcriptional repressors Snail and Zeb1 in suppressing ESRP1 that is required for expression of CD44v isoforms and further identify the mechanisms that lead to the increased transcription of CD44s. Objective 3. Determine whether anti-CD44 antibody prevents CD44 isotype switching or expression level and whether this improves response to chemotherapy and reduces metastasis. These studies will provide important new insights related to adaptive plasticity and determine whether this knowledge can be used to counter act adverse effects of chemotherapy induced phenotypic switching. Inhibiting or reversing the switch towards an EMT phenotype may prove to be an important strategy for increasing the response to chemotherapy and patient survival."
"9464624","Project Summary/Abstract  The functional connectivity within primary visual cortex exhibits heightened sensitivity to visual experience during an interval late in development termed the critical period. Abnormal visual experience during the critical period is the cause of amblyopia, a prevalent childhood visual disorder. Treatment is most effective in children before the close of the critical period. Subsequently, plasticity diminishes and effective therapy is more difficult. In a mouse model of amblyopia, monocular deprivation during the critical period, but not thereafter, both shifts the relative responsiveness of neurons in visual cortex and decreases visual acuity. Analogous to clinical findings, these deficits persist if normal vision is restored after the close of the critical period.  The nogo-66 receptor (NgR1) is required to close the critical period. In mice lacking NgR1, plasticity during the critical period is normal, but it continues such that adult mice display the same plasticity as during the critical period. This proposal investigates how NgR1 closes the critical period. Specific Aim 1 dissects where NgR1 expression is required with cortical circuitry to close the critical period and limit further OD plasticity with a combination of mouse genetics and electrophysiological recordings. Specific Aim 2 exploits the unique plasticity phenotype of NgR1 mutant mice to study how structural synaptic plasticity contributes to OD plasticity with repeated two-photon in vivo imaging. Specific Aim 3 explores whether blocking NgR1 function after the critical period will reactivate OD plasticity and improve visual acuity in amblyopic mice. The goal of this proposal is to improve understanding of how cortical plasticity is governed in the developing and mature visual system."
"9397465","Abstract Alcohol dependence affects at least 4% of the US population, with a financial cost in excess of $100Bn. Prevention of relapse in patients attempting to reduce alcohol consumption is a major therapeutic target, but current treatments are ineffective, and there is an urgent need for new medications. Major factors in causing relapse include the protracted symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol, which are relieved by returning to drinking. Alcohol withdrawal is also implicated in the neurodegeneration that is associated with dependence. There is abundant evidence that the glutamate/NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is a molecular target in alcohol withdrawal, and that inhibitory modulators of the NMDAR are potentially valuable as anti-relapse pharmacotherapy. Target validation identified polyamine enhancement of NMDAR function via the NR2B subunit as a specific target in alcohol withdrawal, and molecular screening identified several lead compounds. JR220 was the most active novel compound from an aryliminoguanidine series, and its cellular effects on neuronal cultures were consistent with NMDAR inhibition via this site. JR220 was then tested in a variety of rodent screens relevant to alcohol dependence, withdrawal and neurotoxicity, including several screens in other laboratories. The drug was highly active in all of these screens, with a potency 5-200x that of acamprosate, which is FDA-approved for the prevention of relapse. JR220 caused mild sedation at higher doses, but there was no overt toxicity even on repeated administration. Pharmacokinetic studies in the rat showed dose dependent elevations of concentrations in plasma after intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and oral administration (oral bioavailability >70%). Concentrations obtained in brain were ~10x higher than plasma, suggesting an active uptake system at the blood/brain barrier. On repeated once daily dosing for 7 days, JR220 did not accumulate in plasma or brain, and no overt toxicity was observed. The only concern is that the plasma half-life following oral administration may be too short for once-a-day dosing in relapse prevention. This can be addressed by formulation as an oral extended release formulation or by a transdermal patch (which would also have other advantages for treatment of alcohol use disorders). Intellectual property in JR220 as a treatment for aspects of alcohol withdrawal and the transdermal patch formulation of JR220 are covered by provisional applications to the USPTO. The preliminary data indicates that JR220 is an excellent candidate as an anti-relapse medication, and the current proposal is to develop the drug further for this use. The aim is now to complete the studies required prior to submission of the drug to the FDA for consideration as an investigational new drug (IND). Thus, in the proposed studies we will complete investigation of metabolism and metabolite identification in vitro, and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion in vivo. The studies will also include a screen for off target actions and studies on safety and toxicology in two species (rats and non-human primates). These studies will include escalating acute dose studies, and sub-chronic studies (to reflect the maintenance of patients on anti-relapse medication). The best formulation and dosing schedule will then be tested in a translational model of alcohol dependence in non-human primates. JR220 will be produced under GMP conditions, and production scaled up to meet requirements for future human trials. If an IND designation is obtained, the objective will then be to partner with a major pharmaceutical company in testing the drug in a human safety trial, and then in clinical trials in alcohol dependent volunteers. The objective is to develop JR220 for relapse prevention and neuroprotection to provide a pharmacotherapy that is more effective for these therapeutic targets than others currently available."
"9384574","Fibrogenesis plays a major role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. Our laboratory has identified Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) as a candidate anti-fibrotic molecule. Originally described as a TGF-? receptor adaptor molecule that facilitates Smad signaling, SARA has a broader role as a scaffolding protein that assembles molecules in complexes to direct cell signaling events. We have shown how SARA participates in endosomal signaling, and that its expression helps to maintain cells in a differentiated state. SARA is downregulated in cells that are subjected to fibrogenic stimuli, concomitant with the cells presenting a fibrogenic phenotype. Overexpressing SARA in these cells prevents the phenotypic switch associated with fibrosis; conversely, knocking down SARA amplifies collagen production in response to TGF-?. In preliminary studies, we show: 1) SARA expression is markedly reduced in kidneys undergoing fibrosis, 2) aristolochic acid-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis is reduced in mice that overexpress SARA in an inducible fashion, and 3) overexpressed SARA prevents fibrosis in a Drosophila larval heart-kidney tube model where fibrogenesis is induced by knockdown of histone-modifying genes. Together, these data support the hypothesis that SARA maintains cells in a fibrosis-resistant state. By regulating the expression of SARA and/or molecules that mediate SARA actions, we can modify the events leading to renal fibrosis. Here, we propose three specific aims to test our hypothesis and will determine: (1) How SARA expression changes during renal fibrosis in mice, and if increasing or blocking SARA expression using transgenic approaches ameliorates or accelerates disease, respectively. (2) How SARA expression is regulated during fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. We have found that the transcriptional repressor, BHLHE40, inhibits SARA expression; and the anti-fibrotic protein, soluble Klotho, stimulates SARA expression. We will determine how these molecules act through SARA to influence the outcome of fibrotic renal disease. (3) How SARA signals downstream to protect cells from the fibrogenic `switch.' We will examine how SARA affects Wnt/?- catenin signaling and seek new effector mechanisms of SARA through RNA-Seq of TGF-?-treated mouse cells, and of Drosophila larvae undergoing pericardial nephrocyte-associated fibrosis.  SIGNIFICANCE: Completion of these studies will elucidate the mechanism by which SARA modulates cellular fibrogenic activity, with a goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets to prevent or slow CKD-associated fibrosis."
"9297405","Project Summary/Abstract  Our goal is to elucidate autophagy-lysosomal mechanism in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).  Early pathological analysis of PD and recent studies of PD-linked genes, such as SNCA, LRRK2, Parkin,  Pink1, GBA and ATP13A2, implicates dysfunctional autophagy-lysosomal pathway in the pathogenesis of PD.  Recent evidence shows that inhibition of LRRK2 or expression of LRRK2 PD mutants causes aberrant  autophagic activity, but the detailed mechanism is unclear. Our preliminary study suggests a link of LRRK2 to  an autophagy kinase, which is essential for autophagy and required for axon/neurite outgrowth. Here we  propose to investigate the molecular mechanism whereby LRRK2 regulates autophagy through directly  targeting autophagy machinery and dysfunctional autophagy as a potential PD pathogenic pathway. We  previously reported that disruption of autophagy in mice leads to age-dependent accumulation of endogenous  ?-Syn in dystrophic axons and altered dopamine transmission, consist with impaired autophagy as one of the  failing cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Emerging evidence suggests that autophagy  not only participates in degradation of ?-Syn, but also is involved in the secretion pathway of ?-Syn, which  underlies the spreading of synucleiopathy. Fibrillar ?-Syn can be secreted through exosomes and/or  autophagosome-related structures. Furthermore, increasing autophagy gene beclin1 or transcription factor  TFEB expression facilitates the autophagic clearance of ?-Syn and offers neuroprotection in rodent models.  However, the precise mechanism for the autophagic clearance of intracellular ?-Syn remains poorly  characterized. Finally, whether LRRK2 also contributes to the control of ?-Syn homeostasis through regulation  of autophagy is unclear. Given the emerging role of autophagy in the exocytosis of ?-Syn, we hypothesize that  autophagy regulates ?-Syn clearance through both degradative and secretory pathways; LRRK2 modulates ?-  Syn homeostasis by targeting autophagy. In Project 3 we propose (1) to determine molecular and genetic  basis for LRRK2-mediated autophagy regulation. We will use biochemical, cellular and animal models to  dissect the role for LRRK2 wildtype and PD mutation G2019S in autophagy control through modulating the  autophagy kinase and SNARE-related protein trafficking; (2) to determine the mechanism that autophagy  and LRRK2 modulate ?-Syn homeostasis by targeting multiple trafficking pathways. We will apply  multidisciplinary approaches to test that LRRK2 and autophagy pathway converge to regulate ?-Syn  homeostasis by targeting secretion and degradation in cell and animal models of PD. Our project 3 will be  conducted in close collaboration with Drs. Jie Shen and Tom Südhof, who have extensive experience in  LRRK2 and ?-Syn research, respectively. Completion of our project 3 is expected to provide timely knowledge  for understanding LRRK2 pathogenic mechanism and developing potential therapeutic strategies by targeting  autophagy-lysosome pathways for the clearance of ?-synuclein."
"9338342","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a progressive and tiered training program that will develop researchers and research teams able to carry out the research agenda in the linked UO1 application (1/2 - GEOHealth Hub for Research and Training in eastern Africa - Ethiopia) and to facilitate the translation of the evidence into impactful actions. The training program will be implemented in collaboration with Addis Ababa University (AAU) in Ethiopia, the Hub institution for the linked application; the Spoke institutions are in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The training program will build the competencies needed to address the research themes identified as most critical in the Situational Analysis and Needs Assessments (SANA) carried out during the planning phase: indoor and outdoor air pollution as the leading theme; occupational health, particularly in regard to temperature and air pollution, and climate change and health as secondary themes. The team assembled for the U2R application includes experienced researchers and educators from the University of Southern California and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-M), both groups having collaborated with AAU previously. The SANAs document a shared need across the Hub and Spokes for enhanced research capacity, along with skills in policy translation in the domestic and regional context. Our approach responds to these broad needs and involves a tiered training program that will create scientific leaders (Lead Scientists) at the national level who can function as principal investigators for research that provides evidence relevant to national and regional issues. They will also be expected to take leadership for locally developed training and to help to assure sustainability. Three cohorts of four will be identified and trained. Beyond these national leads, we anticipate a broad array of shorter-term training opportunities that will prepar the research teams to address the thematic areas of the Hub's research program. The national lead investigators will play a collaborative and progressive role in the design and implementation of the national and regional training initiatives. Given the feasibility restraints posed by financial resources, distance, and the need to integrate training into the ongoing responsibilities of trainees, we plan to use a flexible array of educational modalities that will include stays of limited length at USC and the UW-M; in-country workshops and short courses; distance-based approaches that are both asynchronous and synchronous; and use of selected local courses, e.g., in epidemiology or biostatistics. We will also use innovative approaches to facilitate translation that involve education and engagement of stakeholders. Evaluation will track the success of the participants in meeting their development goals on the short-term and, for the longer-term, successful completion of the proposed research, scientific presentations and papers, and successful funding applications. Through careful case-studies, we will examine the impact of the trainees on policy indicators, such as new air quality standards and guidelines, regulations, and changes in practices."
"9330214","Persistent, synchronous, rhythmic activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical loop is thought to underlie the debilitating motor symptoms of idiopathic and experimental Parkinson's disease (PD). 13-30 Hz b activity is linked to the expression of akinesia, bradykinesia and rigidity, whereas 4-7 Hz rhythmic activity is associated with resting tremor. Motor cortical inputs to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are involved in the generation of this abnormal pattern of activity but the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined.  We hypothesize that in PD loss of direct dopaminergic neuromodulation and alterations in the synaptic and intrinsic properties of neurons in the STN and reciprocally connected external globus pallidus (GPe) am- plify the response of the STN to rhythmic motor cortical inputs, leading to the emergence and propagation of abnormal activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical loop. Indeed, manipulation of motor cortex-STN activity is posited to underlie the therapeutic effects of STN deep brain stimulation in PD. Thus, we propose to apply in control and chronic dopamine-depleted adult mice: 1) optogenetic and genetic approaches to manipulate motor cortex-STN and GPe-STN synaptic transmission and plasticity; 2) electrophysiology and 2-photon laser scanning microscopy to study motor cortex-STN synaptic function/dysfunction and plasticity ex vivo; 3) anatomical approaches at the light and electron microscopic levels and molecular profiling to determine the structural and molecular properties of motor cortex-STN synaptic transmission.  We will address 4 Specific Aims: 1. Determine the synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the motor cortical patterning of STN activity and whether motor cortical inputs exhibit NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation; 2. Determine whether dopamine directly modulates the transmission, plasticity and in- tegration of motor cortex-STN synaptic inputs; 3. Determine whether chronic dopamine depletion increases the strength of motor cortex-STN synaptic transmission through NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity; 4. Deter- mine whether loss of autonomous STN activity and alterations in GPe-STN inhibition following dopamine deple- tion increase the impact of motor cortex-STN inputs.  Together the data arising from this research will refine our model of basal ganglia function and dysfunc- tion and inform in Project 5 the preclinical development of gene therapies that aim, through manipulation of STN and GPe NMDA receptors, to correct the motor symptoms of PD by normalizing the pattern of cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical activity."

Similar to CD28 and CTLA-4, CD226 and TIGIT share ligands (CD112 and CD155) and ligand engagement of CD226 co-stimulates T cell activation while engagement of TIGIT inhibits T cell responses. Over the last few years, TIGIT has emerged as an important co-inhibitory receptor. While initial experiments indicated that TIGIT inhibits T cell responses indirectly by promoting tolerogenic phenotype in dendritic cells, we, and others, have shown that TIGIT has T cell-intrinsic inhibitory functions. We have now found that TIGIT is co-expressed with other co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1,Tim-3,Lag-3) on CD8+ T cells that exhibit dysfunctional/exhausted phenotype in chronic diseases such as cancer and chronic viral infection. Importantly, we find that expression of TIGIT marks the most dysfunctional subset of CD8+ T cells in these conditions, thus raising the important issue of how TIGIT co-operates with other inhibitory receptors to drive severe dysfunctional phenotype in effector T cells. In addition to its role in effector T cells, we have recently identified that TIGIT marks a distinct subset of regulatory T cells (Treg) that exhibit heightened expression of known Treg effector molecules and increased suppressive capacity. Importantly, we find that TIGIT+ Treg are highly enriched in inflamed tissues and that they exhibit specialized function; selectively suppressing pro- inflammatory Th1/Th17 responses while sparing Th2 responses. However, how TIGIT may function in CD8+ T cells to dampen their responses while in Treg function to direct specialized Treg function is not known. Given the data supporting important roles for TIGIT in regulating effector T cells and Treg, it is surprising that nothing is known regarding the molecular signals that induce TIGIT expression. Our preliminary data indicate that the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-27 induces TIGIT expression both in vitro and in vivo. We have now leveraged this information to identify candidate transcription factors that are downstream of IL-27 and may drive TIGIT expression in effector T cells. Based on our data, we hypothesize that TIGIT has a dual role in regulating T cell responses: 1) TIGIT co- operates with other co-inhibitory molecules to regulate effector T cell phenotype and 2) TIGIT drives highly active and specialized Treg phenotype in tissue. We have generated a number of tools including agonist and antagonist antibodies and conditional knock-out mice to study the function of this emerging pathway in the regulation of T cell responses. Our specific aims are: 1) Dissect the T cell intrinsic and extrinsic roles of TIGIT in regulating T cell activation and dysfunction 2) Determine the role of TIGIT in directing Treg function in inflammatory conditions"
"9339464","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Breast cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases in women. According to American Cancer Society about 230,480 women in the US were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2011 and about 40,000 died in that year. Also, a 2009 study by the Walter Reed Army Med. Ctr. suggested that women in the army are 20-40% more likely to develop breast cancer. Therefore, a greater understanding of breast cancer and better therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. This proposal focuses on the fork-head box transcription factor FoxM1 that is over-expressed in the aggressive forms of breast cancers, including the Basal type(s) of breast cancer. Moreover, over-expression of FoxM1 coincides with metastasis and is a biomarker for poor prognosis. In this proposal, we plan to evaluate the functions of FoxM1 in normal mammary gland as well as in the mechanisms that lead to the development of aggressive breast cancer. In addition, we will determine whether targeting FoxM1 using a specific peptide-inhibitor inhibits metastatic progression of breast cancer. The proposal is based on a newly discovered function of FoxM1 in repression of GATA-3 in mammary gland. FoxM1 is expressed at a high level in the luminal progenitor cells. GATA-3 induces differentiation of those progenitors. We will test the hypothesis that FoxM1 controls excessive differentiation during pregnancy, and thus plays an important role in maintaining plasticity of the mammary gland. GATA-3 also is a suppressor of metastasis in breast cancer. Therefore, we will investigate the hypothesis that the repression function of is critical to the mechanism by which FoxM1 contributes to the development of highly aggressive breast cancer. We have characterized a highly specific peptide inhibitor of FoxM1 derived from the tumor suppressor p19ARF that in a cell- penetrating form (ARF-peptide) inhibits metastatic colonization of liver cancer, p53-null sarcoma and p53-null lymphoma. We will investigate whether that peptide-inhibitor efficiently blocks metastatic progression and/or sensitizes breast cancers to available therapies, such as Taxol. The specific aims are:  Aim1: Investigate the roles of FoxM1 in mammary gland.  Aim2: Investigate the roles of FoxM1 in the metastatic progression of breast cancer.  Aim3: Investigate whether the ARF-derived peptide inhibitor of FoxM1 inhibits mammary  tumor progression. This merit review proposal is in response to BLR&D RFA on Women's Health. As more women are entering the US Army, health care at the VA with regards to invasive breast cancer is becoming increasingly significant. Our studies will investigate several novel hypotheses, which will be insightful in understanding and in therapy of metastatic breast cancers."
"9482016","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistence of myofibroblasts (Mfs) in a healing corneal wound leads to scarring and vision loss. Mfs arise by activation of resident keratocytes and bone marrow-derived fibrocytes, which produce excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) and overly contracted tissue. Stromal Mfs are characterized by excess cell surface expression of integrin ?v?5, which increases cell adhesion and activates the fibrotic growth factor, TGF? generating fibrosis. Thus, understanding the regulation of ?v?5 may be key to preventing persistent Mfs. Unbiased screening of corneal Mfs revealed that the gene expression of the deubiquitinase (DUB), USP10 was increased, implicating ubiquitin removal as a possible mechanism for ?v?5 accumulation. When we overexpressed USP10 we found a posttranslational increase in ?v?5 protein and fibrotic markers (?SMA and fibronectin-EDA). In corneal organ culture, USP10 increased concomitantly with ?SMA, integrin ?v?5, and FNEDA? Conversely USP10 knockdown with targeted USP10 siRNA after wounding reduced these markers to control levels. In the following 3 specific aims we now propose to examine the mechanisms underlying the USP10 function in antiscarring therapy using primary human corneal Mfs, ex-vivo porcine organ culture and in-vivo rabbit studies. In Specific Aim 1 we will test whether USP10 binding to and deubiquitination of ?v?5 results in ?v?5 accumulation on the cell surface, inducing integrin-mediated TGF? signaling and downstream FAK/AKT/FNEDA (antiapoptotic) signaling that leads to persistent Mfs. In Specific Aim 2 we will test whether interaction with p120RasGap and G3BP1 (shown to bind to integrin and USP10 in other systems) drives integrin ?v?5/USP10 to the cell surface. Furthermore, we will test whether the increased USP10-mediated recycling (reduced degradation) of the internalized integrin/ECM complex contributes to fibrotic ECM accumulation and impacts focal adhesion turnover and cell migration. In Specific Aim 3 we will silence USP10 gene expression in rabbits after wounding by anterior corneal keratectomy. The effect on Mf persistence, corneal clarity and thickness, as well as other fibrotic endpoints will be quantified. Together, our proposed studies will provide a rigorous test that will determine the value of DUB USP10 as a potential novel target for corneal antiscarring therapy."

"9312227","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea. Genital gonorrhea is common in both genders, but has significant morbidity for women who are more frequently asymptomatically infected. Gonococcal infection in women has a range of symptoms that starts with dysuria and discharge and can end in conditions including pelvic inflammatory disease, internal abscess, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility. Infected individuals do not develop protective immunity, and the bacteria are rapidly developing antibiotic resistance. It is conceivable that soon we will not have an effective way to treat gonococcal infection. This issue has resulted in an increased incentive to develop a vaccine to prevent gonococcal disease.  This study seeks to add to the field by exploring gonococcal properties that can be exploited for human vaccines or therapies. Interestingly, this pathogen has evolved to exclusively infect humans. In so doing, it has adapted unique methods of obtaining nutrients, including hijacking human proteins to acquire the essential nutrient iron. The gonococcal transferrin-iron acquisition system is composed of an integral, outer-membrane, TonB dependent transporter (TbpA), and a surface exposed lipo-protein (TbpB). This system is an ideal target for vaccine and drug development because it is plays a role in bacterial essential nutrient uptake, it is surface exposed, and the protein sequences are well conserved across strains. Previous studies have shown that gonococci lacking the transferrin iron acquisition system are incapable of initiating infection in human males. In addition, whole protein and epitope specific vaccine formulations derived from these proteins have shown growth inhibitory and bactericidal properties. Recently, crystal structures have been solved for TbpA and TbpB from the closely related pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. With a high level of sequence conservation between these two species, these crystals have been used to predict the three dimensional structure for the gonococcal proteins. This new information dramatically enhances the ability to target Tbp functional domains, which has significantly moved this field forward.  This study will employ site specific mutagenesis of surface exposed loops of TbpA to assess key structure- function relationships in its interactions with human transferrin. In addition, several surface exposed loop peptides will be synthesized and will be used to immunize mice. The original peptides and the resulting sera will independently be characterized for their ability to interfere with TbpA-transferrin interactions. The goals of this study are to contribute to the understanding of how this receptor complex functions and to determine optimal targets for vaccine and drug development, such that new therapies can be developed for gonococcal infection before current treatments are rendered obsolete by acquired antibiotic resistance."
"9339524","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, remain one of the most debilitating inflammatory disorders of the western world. It is estimated that more than 1.5 million Americans suffer with IBD, with incidence rates on the rise in many populations. Among military veterans, IBD has one of the highest hospitalization rates of all diseases. Moreover, IBD-related cancer incidence is on the rise in some veteran populations. The precise etiology of IBD is not known.  Inflammatory responses associated with IBD are characterized by precise molecular interactions between epithelial cells and leukocytes, including neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Our ongoing studies have revealed that migrating neutrophils establish microenvironmental control of metabolism within inflammatory lesions. Under such conditions, epithelial cells have the capacity to dynamically control mucosal resolution and do so with a high degree of fidelity.  It is only recently appreciated that inflammation-associated changes in metabolism are central to the inflammatory response. Indeed, the interactions of metabolism with the transcriptional and translational machinery significantly influence disease outcomes. The precise mechanisms by which metabolic pathways control resolution, however, have yet to be established.  Work in progress has revealed that localized oxygen depletion (hypoxia) during inflammation significantly influences the metabolic demands of the tissue. In ongoing work, we have focused on defining how the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) shapes the microenvironment of the inflammatory lesion. Using global chromatin immunoprecipitation promoter arrays (ChIP-chip) in conjunction with detailed NMR-based metabolomics, we have identified tractable HIF-specific targets in intestinal epithelial cells that control barrier function, particularly as they relate t rapid energy utilization (e.g. creatine kinase and the generation of phospho-creatine).  In this proposal, we will define how epithelial metabolism molds the microenvironment during inflammation in the GI tract. Our project will place a particular emphasis on early events of the inflammatory response. Three synergistic specific aims are directed at testing the hypothesis that inflammation-associated changes within the microenvironment establishes metabolic control inflammatory resolution. In Aim 1, we will define the functional implications of creatine metabolism in acute colonic inflammation. Aim 2 will focus on the contribution of acute inflammatory cells to microenvironmental control of metabolic in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will elucidate the role of epithelial HIF-1 and HIF-2 specific metabolites and extend these findings to understand how such changes translate in chronic inflammation.  It is our hope that these results will reveal new insights into innate regulation of mucosal inflammatory resolution and that extensions of this work will lead to targets for experimental therapeutics."

NICHD has agreed to be the lead institute and in supporting annual meetings in 2013-2017.  The SBSRN is now a well established network of social and behavioral scientists, many of whom are affiliated with the CFAR program although anyone is welcome to attend these meetings regardless of CFAR or other affiliation.  For this series of meetings, we also intend to expand the SBSRN by reaching out to the NIMH AIDS Prevention Centers and the NICHD supported Population Studies Centers for their support and increased participation in the future meetings.   The structure of the SBSRN meetings has been and will continue to be centered about a mentoring day that has traditionally preceded the two day scientific meeting.  This has been particularly well received in the past and participating mentees have found the mentoring day to be invaluable.  We have secured agreements from five CFARs or DCFARs to host each of the meetings beginning with the District of Columbia DCFAR at George Washington University in 2013, UCLA in 2014, the Chicago DCFAR at the University of Illinois in 2015, the University of Miami CFAR in 2016, and finally the UCSF CFAR/CAPS in 2017.  Each of these meeting has a unique theme that reflects  the particular strengths and interests of the host institution and communities, and is  centered on the work of their social and behavioral scientists engaged in HIV research, as  well as focusing on sharing state-of-the science findings, themes, and innovations more  generally. These promise to continue to be as valuable a set of scientific meetings as those that have preceded them. We believe the SBSRN has been extraordinarily productive, has helped to sustain a productive network allowing exchanges of ideas, methods, and findings among social and behavioral scientists working in the area of HIV/AIDS, encouraged inter-CFAR collaborations, and helped to mentor the next generation of scientists in the field."
"9327083","Abstract: Activation of Transcriptional Neuroprotective Programs in Nematode Excitotoxicity Excitotoxicity is a leading mechanism of necrotic neurodegeneration in stroke/brain ischemia, triggered by the exaggerated activation of Glutamate Receptors (GluRs). The complex labyrinth of signaling cascades that are suggested to lead from GluR over-activation to neurodegeneration prevents full understanding of the significance of core mechanisms. Surprisingly, GluRs also act to subdue toxic events by activating signaling cascades that lead to the transcription of pro-survival genes. Though these cascades offer an escape route from excitotoxic neurodegeneration, their identity is also shrouded in doubt and controversy. A few transcription factors (TFs) such as CREB & FoxO were suggested to be involved, but the study of their role needs to be re-examined more carefully: recent data suggests CREB?s & FoxO?s mechanisms of activation might be very different than previously proposed, and each one on its own might be too widely used to offer sufficient specificity. Accurate information on the mode of CREB and FoxO activation or their ability to mount a concerted transcriptional neuroprotective program in excitotoxic necrosis is missing, partially due to the confusion caused by the extensive crosstalk and redundancy in mammalian signaling cascades. We address these gaps by studying how both CREB and FoxO are regulated during excitotoxic necrosis and how they mitigate Glu overstimulation. We use C. elegans, a powerful, genetically accessible model where signaling cascades are simplified, but their core is conserved. We make novel observations on both cascades, suggesting that the insulin/FoxO signaling cascade is a novel conduit for GluR regulation of neuroprotective transcription, and that activation of CREB in excitotoxic necrosis is non-canonical. We aim to determine if GluRs connect through Tamalin & Cytohesin to Insulin/FoxO signaling as a novel conduit to induce neuroprotection. We will use fluorescent tags and co-IP in transgenic animals to test for colocalization & interaction. We will over-express interaction domains to disrupt exiting interactions and test the effect on excitotoxicity; We further aim to determine if CREB activation in excitotoxicity is non-canonical. We will study the involvement of candidate components by KO, express phosphorylation-site mutants in transgenic animals, and monitor the effect on neurodegeneration ; Lastly, we aim to identify transcriptional targets co-regulated by FoxO & CREB that protect from excitotoxicity. We will perform a transcriptome analysis specifically in cells at risk of degeneration, compare excitotoxic to neuroprotective conditions, and select candidate targets for future research using evaluation by a well-defined set of criteria. Put together, we will illuminate the pathways used to trigger neuroprotection in response to Glu overstimulation, and detect mediators of neuroprotection in excitotoxic necrosis. Understanding the concerted neuroprotective signaling cascades and identifying conserved mediators of neuroprotection in the nematode can provide novel insights into similar processes in mammals, ultimately inspiring new therapeutic interventions in stroke / brain ischemia."

The PMC also reflects a major new direction by including resources and technologies for model creation: The Transgenic and Gene Targeting Facility (TGF), will cover a broad range of mouse and pluripotent stem cell transgenesis and mutagenesis methods. These new technologies will now have prominent roles in providing the PMC with extensive capabilities for generating cellular and organismal models of IDD. This core builds on a solid history of providing effective, highly valued resources and services to KIDDRC programs. The current application advances prior capabilities by incorporating important new services in model creation and phenotyping. A novel feature is the complete integration of services to provide a continuous pipeline of core technologies beginning with cellular and rodent modeling and extending through behavioral assays, metabolic and biomarker phenotyping, cellular and subcellular analysis, and transcriptional analysis, with ancillary analysis as appropriate. We believe that this approach will yield well characterized cell and rodent models to facilitate our understanding of IDD and to guide us in the development of new therapeutic modalities.  "

"9324341","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies of asthma patients clearly demonstrate a diverse population based on symptoms and the character of inflammation displayed in clinical settings. Thus, in addition to allergic patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation that are generally controlled through corticosteroids, studies have identified growing populations of patients that are much more difficult to treat, including steroid refractory severe patients displaying both eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammatory disease variants. This greater diversity of immune responses is mediated, in part, by allergen-specific T cell plasticity of pulmonary responses. Significantly, our concurrent studies in the mouse have suggested that eosinophils have under- appreciated roles in pathways necessary for immune regulation and the character of the inflammatory events occurring in the lung. This work originated with our early studies using eosinophil-deficient mice (PHIL), however, our more recent studies using a newly created inducible eosinophil-deficient mouse (iPHIL) have led us to suggest that eosinophil activities at the time of allergen challenge are linked to the diversity of T cell subtypes driving pulmonary inflammation (i.e., eosinophilic, neutrophilic, or mixed variants). The proposed studies capitalize on these preliminary data as well as our creation of a next generation mouse model (eoCRE) allowing eosinophil-specific gene knockouts and targeted gene overexpression. We will test the central hypothesis that eosinophil activities contribute to the character of alleric respiratory inflammation by (i) direct effects on neutrophil recruitment/accumulation in the lung and by (ii) modulating allergen-specific T cell subtype selection, polarizing responses to Th2 in the presence of eosinophils and Th17/Th1 in their absence. In the long term, our goal is to identify potential mechanisms that may explain the diversity of disease phenotypes in patients and confounding issues surrounding current therapies such as the use of corticosteroids and Mepolizumab. The objectives of this proposal will test our central hypothesis by the completion of the following Specific Aims: (1) To demonstrate that eosinophils directly suppress the level of allergen-induced airway neutrophils through the expression of anti-inflammatory lipids derived from 12/15- lipoxygenase activities; (2) To define the significance of eosinophil-derived IL-4 and TGF? expression as mechanisms modulating T cell subtypes leading to Th2 dominant vs. neutrophilic mixed Th2/Th17/Th1 immune responses; (3) To determine if steroid refractory neutrophilic subsets of allergic respiratory inflammation arise from eosinophil-ablating effects mediated by corticosteroids or as a combined consequence of targeting eosinophil and Th2 T cells."
"9339528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         GRB7 is amplified and over-expressed in breast cancer with chromosome 17q11-12 amplification. GRB7 can interact with multiple signaling molecules and is implicated in breast cancer biology. GRB7 can facilitate HER-2 mediated signaling and tumor formation. Studies, including that of ours, have shown GRB7 protein overexpression, rather than that of HER-2, is an adverse prognostic factor in breast cancer. Moreover, GRB7 protein is the only adverse prognostic marker, from among 374 studied, in triple negative breast cancer.  We hypothesize that GRB7 directed signaling is functionally important in breast cancer with chromosome 17q11-12 amplification. Targeting GRB7 signaling therefore represents an important and novel therapeutic strategy for HER-2 positive and triple negative breast cancers that are otherwise clinically aggressive.  The objectives are: (1) to investigate the dependency of breast cancer cells on GRB7 signaling by determining if inhibition of GRB7 signaling functions leads to suppression of breast cancer cell growth; (2) to develop isogenic pairs of breast cancer cell lines with shRNA mediated GRB7 knockdown and perform Induced Essentiality screening with small molecule inhibitor libraries; (3) to perform screening with a siRNA library that covers the whole actionable kinome with cell spot microarrays and a novel reverse transfection technology to identify and validate targets whose knock down displays GRB7-dependent effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and/or migration/invasion; and (4) to investigate the functional involvement of candidate cell cycle kinase(s) in GRB7 signaling and their roles as therapeutic targets.  Our approaches are the following: GRB7 knock down has been achieved by transient siRNA transfection in multiple breast cancer cell lines with chromosome 17q11-12 amplification. GRB7 protein depletion decreases cell proliferation in cell lines irrespective of their sensitivityto currently available HER-2 targeted therapies. Stable GRB7 knock down has been achieved by shRNA expression in breast cancer cell lines and its effect on cell growth in culture and in orthotopic mouse xenograft models will be assessed. Stable GRB7 knock down creates a 'sensitized' cellular context to screen for therapeutic targets and molecules whose signaling functions depend on GRB7 expression. We will screen for signaling molecules whose inhibition is sensitized by GRB7 over-expression- i.e. induced essentiality. In addition, signaling molecules whose inhibition displays differential sensitivity according to their GRB7 status will unravel the functional complexities of GRB7 signaling in breast cancer. The novel cell spot microarray coupled with siRNA reverse transfection will be used to screen actionable targets of the whole human kinome. We are able to expand this cell based functional genetic screen to include more siRNA constructs, allow combinatorial siRNA analyses, and obtain multi-parametric phenotypic readouts and comparative analysis of multiple cell types simultaneously. We will also perform screening of small molecule inhibitor libraries that comprise of compounds that are well characterized and undergoing early clinical development. With screening of small molecule inhibitor and siRNA libraries made up by actionable targets, we are looking for candidates whose inhibition produces distinct phenotypes that depend on the GRB7 expression status. Screen positives will be validated with independent functional assays and in additional cell lines and animal models. Since screen positives are molecules with actionable features or compounds already undergoing early phase clinical development, they can be readily moved forwards in drug development expeditiously. Thorough investigation of these GRB7 dependent signaling molecules and therapeutic targets will produce new therapies and reveal why GRB7 expression predicts adverse prognosis. High throughout screening of actionable siRNA and small molecule inhibitor libraries represents a novel paradigm to elucidate the function of an adaptor molecule and, more importantly, to effectively produce clinically useful, non-toxic therapeutics specifically directed against an oncogenic signaling molecule that is otherwise difficult to target."
"9380827","ABSTRACT Project 3 and is focused on defining immune regulatory genes and their functions that control West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZV) infection using the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse genetic system and human validation studies. WNV and ZV are emerging, neurotropic flaviviruses. WNV serves as a model flavivirus in mice, and we have developed novel CC mouse models of ZV infection. The CC recombinant inbred mouse panel encompasses >90% of all genetic diversity of the mouse genome and effectively models the genetic diversity found in the human population. Our Systems immunogenetics approach has identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) encoding immune-regulatory genes of WNV and ZV control. In this renewal application we will define these QTL and respective gene function in the immune regulation and control of WNV and ZV infection. Our studies of WNV infection reveal that unlike infection of inbred mice, the CC captures the full range of infection/disease outcomes found in humans, and can provide a ZV infection model in wild type CC mice. We screened 110 RI lines for WNV susceptibility and innate/adaptive immune phenotypes, from which we have linked disease and immune phenotypes to genotype. Our preliminary studies identify novel QTL encoding gene(s) linked to immune and disease phenotypes including innate and adaptive immune control of WNV and ZV susceptibility, infection in peripheral tissues, neuroinvasion, and CNS infection. Remarkably, this work reveals the Parkinson's disease gene, Park2, as an innate immune-regulatory gene that governs flavivirus infection. Our main hypothesis is that specific genes within these QTL function to control flavivirus infection and immunity. We will use our systems immunogenetics approach to investigate this hypothesis to define host genes regulating 1) innate immunity, and 2) adaptive immunity to flavivirus infection. Our study design is integrated into the larger U19 program to identify genes facilitated by the Mouse Models and System Genetics/Bioinformatics Cores. Genes we will be functionally validated in WNV and ZV infection studies, and assessed in SARS and influenza A virus studies of Projects 1 and 2) of human cells and targeted gene knockout mice to define immunoregulatory genes of virus infection."
"9339525","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The progressive recruitment of macrophages to adipose tissue (AT) is a hallmark of diet-induced obesity and is thought to be key for the development of insulin resistance both in AT and peripheral tissues. Because of the importance of AT macrophage (ATM) accumulation most investigators in the field have focused almost exclusively on the molecular mechanisms mediating their recruitment. However, AT is one of the most plastic tissues in the body, with the capacity to expand and contract dramatically during positive and negative energy balance. It was therefore reasoned that ATM accumulation is likely to be a dynamic event reflecting a balance of ATM recruitment, retention, and removal. This led to the consideration that the accelerated accumulation of macrophages in AT during its expansion might in fact primarily reflect a defect in ATM removal rather than simply reflecting increased recruitment. In this application exciting new preliminary data is presented showing that ATM cell death may be an important physiological mechanism mediating ATM turnover and contributing to AT homeostasis during weight loss. First, Western blot analysis shows that apoptosis markers are lower in macrophage-enriched SVFs of AT from obese compared to lean mice. Second, immunofluorescence staining demonstrates decreased TUNELpos;F4/80pos (apoptotic macrophages) in obese compared to lean AT. The higher levels of apoptosis in lean ATMs suggest that ATM cell death may be a physiologically regulated process in lean AT that becomes impaired during obesity. In support of the concept that ATM turnover is regulated, our data demonstrate that ATM apoptosis is restored during weight loss. These novel observations have led us to consider the possibility that apoptosis is essential to ATM turnover and removal to maintain healthy AT. Thus, the hypothesis to be tested in this application is: apoptosis contributes to the homeostatic maintenance of macrophage numbers in AT. Implicit within this hypothesis is that a decrease in ATM turnover during weight gain occurs in parallel with increased recruitment of new macrophages and may contribute to the retention of macrophages within AT during obesity. This hypothesis is striking in that it focuses on recruitment-independent mechanisms for ATM accrual in obesity. Our studies will address a critical void in the current understanding of mechanisms by which the immune system responds to the metabolic stresses incurred during weight gain and loss. Our hypothesis will be tested in the following aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the temporal and spatial regulation of ATM apoptosis. We hypothesize that ATM apoptosis is impaired during positive energy balance and restored during negative energy balance. Specific Aim 2: To determine whether eosinophils regulate ATM apoptosis. We hypothesize that eosinophils regulate the apoptosis and turnover of ATMs. Specific Aim 3: To determine the physiological consequences of impaired ATM apoptosis. We hypothesize that inhibition of macrophage apoptosis will result in increased ATM content as well as local and systemic IR."
"9110279","DESCRIPTION In vivo fluorescence imaging, allowing the visualization of physiological processes in an intact living organism, has been an indispensable preclinical tool for fundamental understandings of disease pathology and development. More recently, it has also been translated into clinical trials to improve surgery outcomes and lower health-care costs. However, delivery of in vivo fluorescence imaging into preclinical kidney research and surgery remains highly challenging because of undesired in vivo behaviors such as rapid kidney clearance and high accumulation in background tissues of current NIR emitting contrast agents. As a result, in vivo kidney imaging remains heavily relied on high-cost radiological imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), which not only limits fundamental kidney research but also makes it challenging for surgeons to conduct imaging-guided kidney surgery in the future. The objective of this application to address these critical challenges by developing a class of renal clearable near infrared (NIR) emitting nanoprobes with high kidney-targeting specificity, tunable kidney retention time and minimum accumulation in normal background tissues and reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs, so that both noninvasive and invasive kidney imaging can be achieved at high contrast with desired detection time window."

"9395654","Project Summary/Abstract The striatum is a subcortical brain region that is involved in the regulation of important physiological processes such as locomotion, motivation and stimulus-reward learning. The neuromodulator dopamine (DA) regulates striatal activity via its five receptors (DARs), which are distributed in a complex manner throughout a highly interconnected striatal network. The dysregulation of striatal DA and its receptors has been implicated in disorders such as Parkinson?s disease, schizophrenia and addiction, highlighting the need to better understand the mechanisms underlying DA-dependent striatal processes. However, our understanding of striatal DARs has been hampered in part due to our inability to selectively target and thereby understand the function of individual receptor subtypes. Traditional pharmacological and genetic approaches that are used to study receptor function target receptors non-selectively, in a cell-type independent manner and/or with poor temporal resolution. Recently, powerful optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools (i.e., optoXRs and DREADDs) have been developed that address these limitations. However, because these tools lack features that are specific to individual DARs, they would likely provide incomplete representations of DAR function in vivo. I recently developed genetically- encodable, light-gated DARs (LiDARs) that can be used to control individual DARs in a cell-type specific and spatio-temporally precise manner. These near-native proteins are engineered to bind covalently to azobenzene- containing, photo-isomerizable ligands that activate/block receptors in response to light. Herein I propose to develop this toolkit further by enhancing LiDAR photo-activation and -blockade using novel azobenzene analogs. Furthermore, I propose to use these tools to better understand the role of individual DARs on striatal physiology and DA-dependent behaviors."
"9376920","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Health risks, outcomes, and care quality for people with / at risk for diabetes mellitus (DM) are profoundly affected by non-clinical factors called ?social determinants of health? (SDH). Diverse public health leaders and initiatives ? including the Institute of Medicine, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, the Medicare Access & CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2016 Quality Strategy ? emphasize the importance of documenting patients? SDH data in electronic health records (EHRs), and using this data to inform care. However, little is known about how to help primary care teams routinely collect and act on SDH data using EHR-based tools. This knowledge gap is particularly problematic for the community health centers (CHCs) serving our nation?s most vulnerable patients, whose DM prevalence and risk (notably, obesity rates) are higher than the general population?s, and whose health is particularly impacted by SDH. The proposed trial builds on an NIDDK-funded pilot study in which we developed a suite of EHR-based SDH data management tools for primary care CHCs. In June 2016, these tools went live in 440 CHCs that are located in 19 states, but share a centrally-managed EHR. Having demonstrated that ?SDH data tools? can be built for CHCs, we now propose to assess: whether and how pragmatic implementation strategies that support other types of practice change will also help CHC teams systematically identify and take action on the SDH-related needs of adult patients with / at risk for DM; and, the impact of doing so on DM risk management. We will do this as follows. Step 1: Evaluate current EHR-based SDH data collection in 440 CHCs; use those formative results to hone a set of approaches for helping CHCs routinely collect SDH data and integrate it into care plans. Step 2: Conduct a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial. Thirty CHCs will be randomized to one of five 6-month wedges, with staggered timing for receiving the intervention: a scalable implementation support package including technical assistance, training, and six months of access to an ?SDH Implementation Team? that will tailor support to meet each CHC?s needs. Step 3: Conduct a realist evaluation of how the impact on: (i) integration of SDH data collection into workflows; (ii) integration of SDH data into care; and (iii) DM risk management (controlled BP, HbA1c, BMI, lipids, etc.; up- to-date recommended care). Per PAR-15-157, we will test implementation strategies that are pragmatic, replicable, delivered under routine conditions, use existing resources, and target standard care processes. Our multidisciplinary team includes experts in SDH, implementation science, informatics, and primary care transformation. Study deliverables will include scalable strategies; results will inform SDH data collection and action implementation guidelines and materials for use by CHCs and primary care providers nationwide."

"9360249","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elucidating the genotype-to-phenotype map is a primary goal of human genomics research. However, a fundamental gap in knowledge exists regarding African genomic and phenotypic variation, resulting in a lag in biomedical research in these populations. African populations harbor immense amounts of genetic diversity and exhibit substantial amounts of phenotypic variation, including body size, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism that are associated with risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, partly due to adaptation to diverse environments. Here, we propose to perform field studies to collect novel biological samples as well as detailed phenotypic data on anthropometric and metabolic traits from short statured Pygmy hunter-gatherers in Cameroon and neighboring tall-statured Bantu-speaking farmers. We will apply an integrative evolutionary genomics approach incorporating genomic, metabolic, and gene expression data to better understand the genetic basis of complex adaptive traits, including body size and metabolism, in these under-represented ethnically diverse Africans. Specifically, we will identify novel genetic variants using high coverage whole genome sequencing. We will also use genome-wide SNP arrays to identify targets of natural selection in these populations and to look for genetic associations with anthropometric, hormonal, and cardio-metabolic traits in Pygmy hunter-gatherers and Bantu farmers. We will use functional genomics approaches to identify new candidate loci and to study the impact of candidate variable sites on gene expression in vitro using high-throughput reporter assays in appropriate cell lines. These data will enable us to test the hypothesis that short stature in Pygmies may be a byproduct of selection for traits influenced by genes with pleiotropic effects on metabolism, reproduction, and immunity. The biological samples and data collected will be an important resource for the biomedical research community. In addition, our data will generate a deeper understanding of African genomic diversity, population structure, and patterns of linkage disequilibrium which are critical for the successful application and interpretation of genome wide association studies in African-descent populations. Furthermore, this study will have important implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits in Africans, etiology of short stature as well as other traits and diseases influenced by the GH/IGF1 pathway, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, longevity, and cancer. Lastly, our study will shed light on human evolutionary history and evolutionary forces shaping patterns of genomic variation in ethnically diverse humans."
"9323549","PROJECT SUMMARY  Low-income preschoolers are more likely to be overweight than their peers of higher socioeconomic status. Many low-income children spend 30 or more hours per week in childcare programs. However, there are few studies about the factors in these settings that impact early childhood obesity, particularly those driven by the classroom teacher. Pilot observations and the available literature suggest there are several areas related to obesity prevention in which educators routinely exhibit behaviors counter to best practice. We hypothesize that these negative behaviors are the result of internalized ideas about food consumption, perceptions of the role of the preschool teacher, and deficient programmatic policies. Further study is needed to systematically explore teacher-held attitudes originating from their personal experiences and how those attitudes translate to classroom behaviors that predict child obesity outcomes.  The objective of this application is to articulate and test key components of a novel theoretical model that describes the potential influence of the early childhood educator (ECE) in obesity prevention. The central hypothesis is that educators' own experiences and beliefs are associated with their interactions with children in the same way parents' personal experiences impact their parenting (i.e., Belsky's determinants of parenting model, 1984). Two specific aims are proposed: (1) Assess ECEs' personal history and beliefs around nutrition and the perceived role of ECEs in obesity prevention. Using an exploratory sequential mixed methods design, we will operationalize key constructs through in-depth interviews, design survey items based on thematic analysis, and assess generalizability to a broader sample; and (2) Test key components of the proposed theoretical model. We will pair the survey instrument developed in Aim 1 with structured classroom observations. Multi-level structural equation modeling will test the theory-implied associations against observed data regarding ECEs' history, beliefs and manifested interactions in the classroom. Demonstrated links will inform the design of future projects to link teacher behaviors with child outcomes and generate policy that impacts teaching Interactions."
"9297101","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Data from the Centers for Disease Control indicates that over 4-million adult drivers and passengers are treated in US emergency medicine departments annually for whiplash as the result of a motor-vehicle accident. While it is expected that many (> 50%) will recover within the first 2-3 months post injury, some (25%) will never fully recover. Estimated costs for medical and rehabilitative care for the 25% patients with poor functional recovery are ~$100 Billion annually and no treatments have shown to positively influence their outcomes. Unfortunately, in the vast majority of whiplash cases, structural damage on objective imaging is rarely present. Currently, the prevailing opinion is that poor functional recovery is largely influenced by social, psychological and behavioral factors and not biological. While this may be the case in some, our pilot data and previous work has, as a first, demonstrated the rapid and early expression of muscle fatty infiltrates on MRI, signs of disturbed descending control, and muscle weakness in the 25% of individuals with whiplash associated disorders (WAD) with poor functional recovery. The 75% of individuals that recover spontaneously following a whiplash do not manifest such signs and symptoms, suggesting a more severe injury with a biological etiology, in the chronic group. These complex signs and symptoms bear striking similarities to non-WAD patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI); raising the possibility that chronic WAD is an expression of an initial mild injury to the spinal cord. Both groups present with a paralleled expression of muscle fatty infiltrates, signs of disturbed descending control, psychological distress, and muscle weakness. As such, the goal of this proposal is to test our central hypothesis that chronic WAD is an expression of a mild iSCI. We propose to combine biomechanical, electrophysiological and radiological measures to demonstrate that losses in spinal neural substrate, increased fatty infiltrates in select neck and lower extremity muscles, and the inability to properly activate ankle muscles in patients with chronic WAD is an expression of a mild iSCI. The long-term goals of this research is to improve outcomes in WAD, but before this can be realized, it is crucial we 1) understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying poor functional recovery in the 25% of individuals with a seemingly more complex injury and 2) consider and integrate the bio-psycho-social drivers of the clinical course on a patient-by-patient basis. This new knowledge will set the stage for future studies investigating more objective and integrated assessments as well as the development of targeted science-based interventions for a cohort that does not respond well to current intervention strategies."
"9547627","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An altered profile of surface glycans is a well-known feature of tumor cells; however the molecular mechanisms by which specific glycans and associated glycosyltransferases regulate tumor cell behavior remain elusive. Work from our group has determined that the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase endows ovarian cancer (OC) cells with the ability to avoid apoptosis induced by multiple stimuli including galectins, death receptor activators and chemotherapeutic drugs. In this proposal we show for the first time that ST6Gal-I protein is upregulated in the great majority of human ovarian tumors, including the lethal papillary serous adenocarcinoma subtype. Upregulation of ST6Gal-I correspondingly causes hypersialylation of selected receptors including the ?1 integrin, Fas and TNFR1. In paradigm-shifting mechanistic studies, we find that ST6Gal-I-mediated sialylation of Fas and TNFR1 prevents receptor internalization, causing a shift in the signaling of these receptors toward survival rather than apoptosis. Additionally, ST6Gal-I activity confers resistance to apoptotic galectin-3 and the chemotherapeutic, cisplatin. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that ST6Gal-I overexpression underlies two crucial factors contributing to OC lethality: tumor cell resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy (Aim 1), and OC cell protection against immune stimuli within the peritoneal tumor microenvironment (Aim 2), which is rich in gal-3 as well as ligands for Fas and TNFR1. Preliminary studies show that ST6Gal-I promotes OC cell survival within patient peritoneal ascites fluid; this finding is significant in that OC cells metastasize va peritoneal transit. AIM 1: ST6Gal-I-mediated receptor sialylation in chemoresistance. We will define molecular mechanisms responsible for ST6Gal-I's role in cisplatin resistance, and determine whether receptor sialylation controls chemoresistance within the intact tumor microenvironment. Efficacy of cisplatin treatment will be evaluated for orthotopic tumors established in mice from OC cells with differential ST6Gal-I expression, and in vivo delivery of RNAi will be used to implement therapeutic knockdown of ST6Gal-I to restore cisplatin sensitivity. ST6Gal-I will be quantified in chemosensitive vs. chemoresistant human tumors to assess its prognostic potential. AIM 2: Contribution of ST6Gal-I to tumor cell survival within the peritoneal microenvironment Mechanisms underlying ST6Gal-I-dependent OC cell survival within ascites will be elucidated, with a focus on gal-3/ ?1 integrin, FasL/Fas, and TNF?/TNFR1 interactions. ST6Gal-I-mediated protection of OC cells from cytotoxic immune cells will be examined, and human ovarian tumors screened for an association between ST6Gal-I and immune cell infiltration. The growth of orthotopic tumors +/- ST6Gal-I will be monitored in immunocompetent mice. The studies will have impact by showing that ST6Gal-I is a master regulatory molecule controlling tumor/ microenvironmental interactions that regulate the balance between elimination vs. persistence of OC cells that drive tumor recurrence. Innovation lies in the elucidation of: (1) novel glycosylation-dependent tumor mechanisms, and (2) a new molecular player in OC pathogenesis and biomarker for patient chemoresistance."
"9301298","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to improve our understanding of how variations in hormone levels and reproductive tract microbes contribute to HIV acquisition risk in women. These are significant areas of research because more than half of new HIV infections are acquired by women, predominantly through heterosexual transmission. The goal of the proposed research project is to define how hormonal variation during the normal menstrual cycle (endogenous hormones) and with DMPA contraceptives (synthetic progestin) and bacterial vaginosis affect protein expression in ectocervical CD4+ T lymphocytes and their susceptibility to fusion and productive infection with HIV. These studies are powered to allow determination of hormonal effects, microbiota effects and interaction effects between hormones and vaginal microbes. We have found that bacterial metabolites called short chain fatty acids (SFCAs) that are present in healthy cervicovaginal fluid and increase dramatically during BV, strongly heighten the susceptibility of CD4+ T cells to productive HIV infection through the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Finally, we will investigate a novel strategy to reduce HIV transmission by making cells more resistant to HIV infection. The three overlapping areas to be investigated in this project are: 1. Determine the effects of hormone levels and BV on susceptibility and activation state of CD4+ T lymphocytes from ectocervical biopsies. Ectocervical CD4+ T cell susceptibility to fusion and productive infection by HIV will be directly measured using our combination reporter virus system by flow cytometry. Activation states of CD4+ T cells will be quantified by flow cytometry and label-free proteomics, an unbiased and powerful strategy for identifying specific activation pathways. Advanced bioinformatics will be used to identify specific activation pathways that contribute to HIV replication in ectocervical CD4+ T cells. 2. Quantify bacterial species and metabolites present in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples and correlate metabolites with specific species or groups of bacteria. CVL samples will be analyzed for bacterial species and for bacterial metabolites-including short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are present in the healthy female reproductive tract and elevated in BV. We have recently found that SCFAs enhance HIV infection of CD4+ T cells via a mechanism involving inhibition of HDACs. Advanced bioinformatics will be used to identify correlations between bacteria and their products and ectocervical CD4+ T cell protein expression and susceptibility to HIV. 3. Determine the ability of garcinol to reduce the susceptibility of ectocervical CD4+ T cells to HIV ex vivo in women with different hormone patterns and cervicovaginal microbiota. Garcinol, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, reverses the effects of SCFA-mediated HDAC inhibition of HIV susceptibility in vitro, and actually reduces infection even in unstimulated cells. These findings suggest that garcinol, or similar compounds, may represent a novel strategy to reduce heterosexual transmission of HIV by inhibiting productive infection of ectocervical CD4+ T cells."
"9339580","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and its animal model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE) are autoimmune disorders of the CNS, and are considered to be mediated by myelin reactive T helper cells (TH1, TH2, Treg and TH17). The present proposal is to investigate S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)-mediated immuno- modulation and neuroprotection/neurorepair mechanisms in EAE disease models based on our novel finding that: 1) GSNO attenuated disease in three different EAE disease models; SJL mice immunized with PLP139-151, C57BL/6 mice immunized with MOG35-55, and Lewis rats immunized with MBP; 2) GSNO inhibited TH17 polarization/effector functions and induced Treg polarization/effector functions without obvious effects on TH1 and TH2; 3) GSNO-mediated post-translational modification of STAT3 (S-nitrosylation at Cys259) inhibited STAT3 activation which plays a critical role in TH17/Treg polarization/effector functions and disease progression of EAE/MS; 4) GSNO inhibited NFkappaB activity and iNOS expression which play a critical role in oxidative/nitrosative damage of the CNS under inflammatory conditions;.5) GSNO induced astroglial expression of neurotrophic factors that play a critical role in the neurorepair process. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that GSNO-mediated mechanisms attenuate the EAE/MS disease by S-nitrosylation and inhibition of STAT3 and also promote neuroprotection and neurorepair processes in EAE by attenuation of NFkappaB/iNOS-mediated nitrosative/oxidative stress while still supporting cellular requirements for GSNO/NO with supplementation of GSNO. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis by investigating the role of GSNO in TH17/Treg polarization and neuroprotection/neurorepair processes and in EAE disease processes using genetic (iNOS knockout and GSNO reductase knock mice) as well as pharmacological approaches by using inhibitor of GSNO reductase (N6022) to increase endogenous GSNO and by supplementation of exogenous GSNO. Cellular homeostasis of GSNO is maintained by its redox based synthesis from GSH and NO and its enzymatic inactivation/degradation primarily by GSNO reductase (GSNOR). The proposed studies are: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of exogenous vs. endogenous GSNO on Treg/TH17 specific immunomodulation in an active EAE disease model. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of exogenous vs. endogenous GSNO on Treg/TH17 specific immunomodulation in the adoptive transfer passive EAE disease model. Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the efficacy of GSNO on neuroprotection and neurorepair in the EAE disease model. The novelty of the study is the promise of new therapeutic targets for TH17-mediated immune response and neuroprotection (protection of blood brain barrier and CNS) and promotion of neurorepair without affecting natural immuno-surveillance mechanisms mediated by other TH cells (e.g. TH1 and TH2). We expect that study of the S-nitrosylation-based regulatory mechanisms of TH17/Treg polarization/effector functions and neuroprotection/neurorepair in EAE disease will not only delineate the NO/GSNO mediated mechanisms in autoimmune disease, but also its clinical relevance as novel NO based therapeutics either alone or in combination with approved drug for MS. GSNO is a natural component of the human body and its exogenous administration in humans was not associated with any adverse effects. Therefore, potential use of GSNO by itself or in combination with present day medications as a translational drug for MS is promising and highly relevant to Veterans' health and the VA mission."

Our goal is aid our PIs in their work on identifying the role of particular genes in the  development of the nervous system and in modelling intellectual disability and  neurodevelopmental disorders, with a view in particular of identifying preclinically, novel  biomarkers of these disorders and for evaluating the efficacy of new therapeutic approaches.  Although manipulation of the mouse genome has been well established for several decades  using homologous combination in embryonic stem cells for gene targeting and random insertion  of DNA in zygotes for making transgenic mice, and this Core has very effectively used these  approaches to generate many mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, during the  course of the present grant cycle transformative advances have been made in our capacity for  genome editing. This core has enthusiastically embraced and mastered the new CRISPR/Cas9  technology for disrupting gene expression by base insertion/deletion (INDELS), and using  homology directed repair (HDR) for introducing mutations, inserting reporters, Cre or Flp drivers  and indeed making many kinds of changes to the genome ? in a manner that is both efficient  and fast. We will continue to offer our standard technology since there are users and uses that  favor this but anticipate that CRISPR/Cas9 and its evolution will largely take over. The  technology has caused immense excitement in the IDDRC community and the demand for our  services are set to increase substantially, so that the IDDRC can provide parallel preclinical and  clinical phenotyping and efficacy studies. To aid in the uptake of genome editing the core will  offer consultation services on the best approach for PIs to use for particular projects, advice on  selection of guide RNAs, genotyping and colony management, as well as a new  cryopreservation service. Collectively the new services will offer the IDDRC mouse models  faster and cheaper with the capacity to preserve these for alter use or sharing."
"9350168","Project Summary Health risks such as smoking, physical inactivity, heavy alcohol consumption, obesity, high blood pressure, and inflammation are important determinants of premature mortality among U.S. adults. Further, these risks are socially patterned. Research has shown that educational attainment, marital status, fertility patterns, and employment status are all associated with adult health behaviors and outcomes (Cutler & Lleras-Muney 2010; Pampel et al. 2010; Umberson et al. 2010; Waite & Gallagher 2002). Yet, we know relatively little about how the aforementioned health risks are patterned by combinations of these social statuses, even though they are interdependent. For example, entering the workforce is often a competing alternative to further education, or individuals may delay parenthood until after marriage. This project focuses on how the transition to adulthood, defined as the sequencing and combination of different markers of adulthood, influences the health risks of young adults. The overall objective of this research project is to understand the development of differential health risks of young adults aged 26 to 32 in the United States.  The specific aims of the project are to: (1) distinguish unique transition to adulthood profiles of U.S. young adults through examination of the timing, sequence, and grouping of adulthood markers; (2) identify health risk profiles among U.S. young adults through determining how health behaviors and outcomes are patterned across individuals; (3) identify relationships between transition profiles and health risk, and (4) estimate the moderating effects of race/ethnicity, nativity, sex, and class background on the transition-health risk relationships. To accomplish these aims, the project will use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Add Health is uniquely suited for this project because it: (1) is recent, (2) is longitudinal, (3) spans the transition to adulthood, (4) offers detail on health risks including biomarkers, (5) provides geographic information, and (6) offers genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. This project will use the most appropriate and contemporary quantitative methods to accomplish the aims. The results will provide a more comprehensive description of health risk patterns of U.S. young adults. The project will move forward our understanding of how combinations of individual, family, and social factors influence the health risks of young adults in the United States, an especially important topic in the context of today's widening health disparities and changing health risks.  The fellowship period includes a number of activities to support the proposed research and prepare the applicant for a productive career conducting interdisciplinary research that integrates biological and social approaches to health. The two years will include coursework, formal and informal mentoring, training in specific methodological and theoretical approaches, and support in professionalization, the ethical conduct of research, and networking."
"9412063","PROJECT SUMMARY Diabetes mellitus, a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by hyperglycemia, affects over 29 million individuals in the United States and 415 million worldwide and is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, blindness, end-stage renal disease and death. Maternal pre-existing or gestational diabetes is also associated with risk for poor pregnancy outcomes. Highly penetrant genetic forms of diabetes including maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), neonatal diabetes, and syndromes that comprise both diabetes and developmental and intellectual disabilities account for at least 1% of diabetes, or over 290,000 cases nationwide. Distinguishing these genetic forms of diabetes from type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) demonstrably improves glucose control and quality of life by enabling replacement of invasive insulin treatment and/or ineffective oral treatment with less invasive and more efficacious etiology-based oral or dietary treatment for the patients and their affected family members. In some cases, the individualized treatment can ameliorate neurological dysfunction. However, a recent U.S. population-based study provided evidence that only 6% of MODY in diabetic individuals age 20 and younger was properly diagnosed as such, with a likely even lower percentage in adults. There are several barriers to improving the diagnosis rate, including lack of awareness, clinical overlap with other diabetes types, expense of testing, genetic heterogeneity and predominance of rare variants. With the advent of next generation sequencing techniques, testing is becoming increasingly feasible and cost-effective, but for its true potential to be realized, a systematic process for the pooling, annotation and curation of variants is needed. We are a group of investigators from academic and non-academic institutions around the world (University of Maryland School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Northshore University Health System, and Geisinger Health System in the United States; University of Exeter in the United Kingdom; and University of Auckland in New Zealand) who are developing innovative approaches to identifying, diagnosing and promoting individualized therapy for monogenic diabetes. Together we will develop an approach to centralize the annotation and curation of variants in genes known to be implicated in monogenic diabetes; develop and implement a sustainable process for systematic consensus review of monogenic diabetes variants for pathogenicity and submission to ClinVar; and lay the groundwork for a Diabetes Clinical Domain Working Group that will enable the use of genetic tools in the diagnosis and management of more complex forms of diabetes as the field matures."
"9339538","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Abstract Recent re-evaluation of the results of the Women's Health Initiative shows that estrogen replacement within 10 years of the menopause reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction by 34%. This did not occur if women were started on HRT more than 10 years after the menopause. Others and we showed that estrogen reduces the incidence of cardiac hypertrophy and rescues the heart from ischemia/reperfusion injury in cell and mouse models. In our studies to date, estrogen (E2) acts through ERss to reduce blood pressure, prevent cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and preserve cardiac function in the setting of angiotensin II (AngII) infusion, as a model for human disease. We propose that E2/ERss blocks Ang II or endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced transition of the cardiac fibroblast to myofibroblast and blocks TGFss activation, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and matrix mettalloproteinase production. This occurs by estrogen signaling through AMP kinase, blocking Rho/ROCK activation. The ultimate result is decreased collagen gene transcription, as well as other genes that contribute to fibrosis, and all will be tested in isolated cardiac fibroblast and mouse models As a second focus, we propose the idea that E2/ERss up-regulates the apelin/APJ receptor system to block cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and we will test this concept in myocytes and the apelin KO mouse to establish importance of this interaction. An important transcription factor that represses hypertrophic genes is KLF15. We propose that AngII and ET-1 inhibit the production and nuclear localization of this anti-hypertrophic factor, but E2/ER? (and the ER? specific ligand, B-LGND) prevent all this, as a novel mechanism for estrogen action. In part this occurs through E2-induced nuclear localization of HDAC5 that de-acetylates and hence maintains the repressive effect of KLF15 on myocardin, preventing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In the final Aim, we propose to test a novel ERss agonist from GTx Inc in a mouse model of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, using wild type and ERss knockout female and male mice. The hypothesis is that this ligand will be effective in preventing and treating AngII-induced cardiovascular diseases in WT mice, and in both sexes. These data may justify in the future initial translational trials in post-menopausal women, including veterans."
"9336849","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary Multiple myeloma (MM) grows in and attacks the skeleton, causing pain and bone-related pathologies, such as fracture, as well as contributing to death. Many interactions between the tumor and the bone microenvironment are understood, but none involves pathways unique to bone, and myeloma bone disease (MBD) remains largely incurable. We asked whether factors made only by bone acted specifically on myeloma cells. MM cells, both laboratory cell lines and from patients, expressed the receptor for the hormone fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, which is made by osteocytes, abundant cells in bone. In newly diagnosed patients, intact serum FGF23 was 3X higher in MM than in controls. Recombinant FGF23 increased heparanase mRNA 5-18x in 2 MM cell lines at 24hrs. Heparanase is a secreted enzyme that enhances tumor homing and growth in bone and is a marker of poor MM prognosis. It increases bone destruction via the factor RANK ligand and suppresses bone formation, releases growth factors from bone matrix and modifies the MM protein syndecan-1. We propose a new vicious cycle of myeloma bone disease: A) MM cells stimulate osteocytes to secrete FGF23; B) FGF23 increases heparanase expression by MM cells; C) Heparanase alters the bone microenvironment and increases RANK ligand, Dkk1, osteolysis & tumor growth; D) Heparanase increases hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in bone, which additionally stimulates MM cells; E) FGF23 may enhance MM adhesion to bone. The two Investigators combine extensive individual interests in cancer:bone molecular interactions (JMC) and the biology of clinical myeloma (AS) with a shared interest in the etiology and improved treatment of myeloma bone disease. We propose Four Specific Aims: 1: Determine the cellular pathways by which MM increases FGF23, including testing if known factors made by MM cells regulate FGF23 production, or if it is regulated by heparanase, HGF or the approved MM treatment bortezomib. 2: Determine the role of circulating FGF23 in MM patients, asking if FGF23 & heparanase concentrations are correlated in MM patients and testing if MM cells from patients increase bone release of FGF23. 3: Determine the importance of FGF23-increased heparanase in MBD. 4. Determine molecular mechanisms that control heparanase expression in the bone microenvironment. The project uses a new experimental model of myeloma:bone interactions. In EVOCA (ex vivo organ culture assay), human MM cells are cultured on mouse bone, which supports growth of cell lines and patient samples (which dramatically increase FGF23 in bone). We will make MM cell lines with promoters driving secreted luciferases to analyze changes in gene activity over time in the tumor:bone microenvironment. Experiments with live animal are avoided, lowering costs & increasing efficiency, along with elimination of animal pain & suffering. EVOCA enables new studies in Aim 2 with primary samples to test the importance of the FGF23:heparanase vicious cycle in MBD in individual patients. Inhibitors of FGF23 & heparanase are in clinical trials. Our studies will guide their future application to the treatmentof myeloma bone disease and other cancer bone metastases."
"9324081","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Greater than 80 lysosomal proteins have been characterized, and mutations in genes encoding these proteins result in over 50 clinically distinct lysosomal storage diseases. Of these disorders, eight are due to the impaired degradation of glycosphingolipids. The traditional approach for treating these disorders has been through the use of mannose or mannose-6-phosphate terminated recombinant proteins as the basis for enzyme replacement therapy. An alternative approach, now clinically proven for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease, is the use of substrate reduction therapy. By targeting the first synthetic step in glycosphingolipid synthesis, catalyzed by glucosylceramide synthase, potent small molecule inhibitors have been developed as oral agents for the treatment of Gaucher type 1 and Fabry disease. One compound in the PDMP series, eliglustat tartrate, has been demonstrated to be at least as efficacious as imiglucerase in phase 2 and 3 trials and in August, 2014 was approved by the FDA for Gaucher disease type 1. Because eliglustat tartrate does not cross the blood brain barrier, it is unsuitable for the treatment of several glycosphingolipidoses with CNS involvement that include Gaucher disease type 3. Through the use property-based design, a series of analogues have been synthesized and demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo work to evade pgp1 and cross the blood brain barrier, effectively lowering brain glucosylceramide content in both normal and diseased mice. We now propose through the UH2/UH3 funding mechanism to optimize this compound and conduct further development for clinical trials for Gaucher disease type 3. Specific aim 1: We will conduct a one year UH2 preparatory and feasibility phase program that will establish a general investigative plan. The goals of this preparatory phase will include the identification and establishment of a lead development team, the establishment of a minimum acceptable profile to guide final lead optimization, the determination of the scope of enabling studies, and the identification of the academic laboratories or contractors that will perform these studies. Specific aim 2: The lead development team will conduct a multi-year UH3 development phase program that will include the final lead optimization of the CNS permeant glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, the performance of biological testing and proof of concept studies in a suitable model of Gaucher disease type 3, development of a scalable, patentable synthetic route suitable for generation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for good laboratory practice, toxicology studies, investigative new drug enabling studies, the design of phase one trials in healthy subjects."
"9356348","ABSTRACT ? (Title: Dynamic Neural Mechanisms of Audiovisual Speech Perception) Natural speech perception is multisensory; when conversing with someone that we can see, our brains combine visual (V) information from face, postural and hand gestures with auditory (A) information from the voice. The underlying speech processing is extremely rapid, with incoming AV units (e.g., syllables) arriving every few hundred milliseconds that must be encoded and passed on before the next syllable arrives. Finally, this bottom-up sensory information is combined with a top-down cognitive component: what we perceive is strongly influenced by its context. Speech is fundamentally human, and thus, its brain mechanisms are usually studied with noninvasive fMRI, EEG and MEG. Because each method has critical limitations in spatial or temporal resolution, identifying the specific brain mechanisms of speech perception - AV integration, precise and rapid information encoding and top-down control - is a nearly intractable problem.  This three-year U01 project will sidestep the problem using direct recording of neuron ensemble (electrocorticographic or ECoG) activity and single neuron activity, along with direct stimulation of selected sites in the brains of surgical epilepsy patients as they process AV speech. Our collaborative ECoG team embodies expertise in multisensory integration and speech perception and leverages the skills and perspectives of neuroscientists, neurosurgeons, engineers, neuropsychologists, neurologists, and ethicists across three leading epilepsy centers: Columbia University Medical Center, Baylor College of Medicine and Northshore-Long Island Jewish Medical Center. By combining the expertise and patients available at all three centers, we will be able to tackle problems that are inaccessible to individual investigators.  Our overarching hypothesis, building on our past work and supported by preliminary data, is that fluctuations in the excitability of neurons?oscillations?play a key role in speech processing. Aim 1 tests the general hypothesis that delta/theta range (2-8 Hz) neuronal oscillations play a key role in the integration of auditory and visual speech information. Aim 2 tests the general hypothesis that high-frequency activity (50 Hz and above) encodes representations of auditory and visual speech information, reflecting both bottom-up and top-down influences on perception.  The concept employed in this proposal of oscillatory dynamics as mechanistic instruments (Aim 1) that organize the encoding of information in neuronal firing patterns under dynamic top-down control (Aim 2) are part of a paradigm shift in speech science. The broad goal of this proposal is to contribute key foundations for this new paradigm, and set the stage for a comprehensive understanding of the brain circuits and physiological processes underlying natural speech perception, including complex social settings."
"9301431","Preclinical studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism of action or establishing the proof-of-concept of function promoting therapies (FPTs) in animal models are predicated critically upon the ability to measure the effects of FPTs on whole body and regional skeletal muscle mass and quality, muscle mechanics and performance, energetics, blood flow, and physical function. Based upon surveys of core users, and in consultation with OAIC's Advisory Board, the Executive Committee established a Small Animal Resource Core (SARC) in year 3 of OAIC's first cycle. Additional feedback from the SARC users led to the recognition that the physician scientists, especially geriatricians with limited experience with laboratory animals, needed substantial guidance in the selection of appropriate animal model, genetic model identification, outcome selection, experimental design and the execution of FPT studies. Accordingly, the consultative role of the SARC core was expanded and the core was re-named the Preclinical Discovery Core (PDC). In its initial brief funding cycle, the PDC supported 3 PES projects, 2 REC project, and 7 external projects. The studies utilizing the PDC infrastructure have resulted in 17 peer-reviewed publications, including several high- impact publications in leading journals including PNAS (2 papers), Cell Metabolism (1 paper), Blood (1 paper), Diabetes (1 paper), and Aging Cell (2 papers), and $8.42 million dollars in grant funding. The specific aims of the PDC are to provide the infrastructure, consultative support, and standardized methods to assess whole body and regional skeletal muscle and fat mass, muscle performance and energetics, metabolic outcomes, and physical function in preclinical models of aging and illness. The PDC will develop novel non-invasive imaging methods to measure myofibrillar space, perfusion, energetics, and regeneration in preclinical models of FPT action. The PDC will implement rigorous quality control by personnel training and certification in standardized procedures for assessment of muscle performance and physical function, and by maintaining equipment calibration. The developmental project (DP3) will develop an innovative non-invasive method for quantitative assessment of myofibrillar space, muscle perfusion, energetics, and muscle oxygen uptake, using 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. The PDC has introduced several innovations, including: integration of new T1 and T2 sequences for improved precision of body composition assessment by NMR; coupling of core body thermogenics with energy expenditure assessment; integration of high sensitivity motor electronics to improve the precision and accuracy of ex-vivo strength measurements; and improving the precision of grip strength measurements. The highly specialized services and expertise offered by PDC is unique among OAICs, and central to the successful execution of several external and OAIC projects."
"9325532","PROJECT SUMMARY The Mutation Generation and Detection Core (MGD) specializes in providing reagents for targeted genome editing. Services include knocking out specific genes, creating genes with limited or altered expression patterns, and tagging genes to express specific proteins sequence tags. Investigators can order custom TALEN and Crispr-Cas9 DNA nucleases to induce targeted mutations in a genomic region of interest. These targeted nucleases are a cutting edge technology for performing reverse genetic studies in multiple model systems, including, but not limited to, Zebrafish, Drosophila, C. elegans, mice and mammalian tissue culture. The Core continues to develop new technologies to offer investigators the most efficient reagents and methods possible. Through the Center for Iron and Heme Disorders (CIHD), investigators can be trained in the design, construction and delivery of the genome editing reagents. Additionally, the Core will assist users in designing strategies to analyze correct targeting and ensure that there are no off-target events. The staff will also offer CIHD-sponsored workshops/training sessions for junior investigators. This technology will also be made available to other national NIDDK-sponsored research programs. The primary goal of the MGD Core is to expand the use of these genome-editing technologies to NIH-funded investigators. "
"9339515","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary Rationale: Diabetes is epidemic in our society. Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive pathology characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Cardiovascular pathologies that are the sequelae of this disorder are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in our Veteran population.  Atherosclerosis is a major consequence of diabetes and one particular characteristic of atherosclerois is inflammation. Studies suggest that chronic insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia contribute to atherogenesis by augmenting the effects of the inflammatory cytokines, thereby increasing the secretion of additonal inflammatory cytokines and expression of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs).  Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF?) activity has been shown to be linked to insulin resistance. Pathways that mediate the effects of TNF? may also regulate intracellular insulin signaling and thus correlated to atherogenesis. TNF? is known to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). In contrast, insulin's role in atherogenesis is debated. Some contend that insulin stimulates the increase of nitric oxide (NO). Others argue that hyperinsulinemia increases the proliferaton of vascular cells and the inflammatory response. The question we asked here is, does insulin dampen or augment the effects of TNF? on VCAM-1 expression and what mechanisms are attributed to these effects?  In vitro and in vivo animal model experiments have examined some of the signaling pathways that mediate CAM expression, but there is a significant gap in our understanding between identifying pathways and their molecular interactions or cross talk within cells and tissues in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and inflammatory cytokines. Significance: We are interested in determining the molecular mechanisms that regulate insulin and TNF? stimulation of VCAM-1 expression and thereby help define novel drug targets. These findings may provide healthcare strategies that will allay vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis in Veterans. We hypothesize - that in the state of metabolic insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia exaggerates the effects of TNF?-associated inflammation via increased expression of VCAM-1. These effects are mediated in part by multiple signal pathways, in which ERK5 plays an important role in VCAM-1 expression, NF?B activation and vascular inflammation. Goals of Research: To further our knowledge of vascular inflammation we plan to use the findings from the current proposal to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vascular inflammation by characterizing the roles of key players in insulin and TNF?-stimulated VCAM-1 expression. Specific Aims: (1) Determine the role of kinase pathway crosstalk in hyperinsulinemia and TNF?-stimulated increases in VCAM-1 expression. (2) Determine the role of ERK5 in hyperinsulinemia and TNF? stimulated increases in VCAM-1 expression. (3) Determine the role that hyprerinsulinemia plays in VCAM-1 expression in carotids of diabetic rats."
"9339557","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Exaggerated scarring, or fibrosis, complicates a spectrum of diseases, occurs in all organs, and can be relentless, debilitating, and deadly. It is particularly prevalent in older patients and thoe who have experienced military exposures, posing a serious problem for veterans. Exaggerated innate and adaptive immune responses drive fibrosis, yet the exact mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recent findings suggest a role for interleukin (IL)-33 in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. IL-33 exists in two forms and has a dual activity. Intranuclear IL-33 (INIL33) is bound to chromatin and appears to regulate gene expression. By contrast, extracellular IL-33 (EXIL33) acts by binding to the cell-surface receptor T1/ST2 and facilitating Th2 responses. The activities of EXIL33 are under active investigation, whereas the activities of INIL33 have been underappreciated and not studied in detail or in association with disease. Our data suggest that fibrosis is driven primarily (yet not exclusively) by INIL33. The levels of INIL3 are elevated in tissues of patients with fibrosis as well as in the mouse model of bleomycin injury, in which the INIL33 form predominates over EXIL. Gene delivery of INIL33 in cell culture and in the animal model leads to collagen accumulation, increased production of profibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, as well as Smad3 activation, all of which are known to contribute to fibrosis. When combined with bleomycin injury, INIL33 potentiates collagen accumulation and the expression of profibrotic cytokines. There is minimal, if any, conversion of INIL33 to EXIL33, no signs of Th2 activation, and gene deficiency of T1/ST2 has minimal, if any, attenuating effect on INIL33-driven fibrosis. We hypothesize that INIL33 is a T1/ST2-independent, Th2-independent, upstream activator of multiple profibrotic mechanisms and that elevated expression of INIL33 in fibroblasts contributes to collagen deposition by these cells through direct and indirect mechanisms. The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1. Functionally map the IL-33 molecule to identify regions in this protein that confer nuclear localization, chromatin binding, and transcriptional regulation in cultured primary human fibroblasts and in mice in vivo. 2. Define the relative roles of direct mechanisms (binding to the collagen promoter and upregulating collagen gene transcription) and indirect mechanisms (both T1/ST2-dependent and -independent regulation of profibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases) of profibrotic regulation of fibroblasts by IL-33 in cell culture. 3. Delineate the pathophysiological roles of fibroblast-specific expression of IL-33 and of the T1/ST2 cell-surface receptor in vivo by determining the effects of fibroblast-specific IL-33 deficiency, ubiquitous IL-33 deficiency, and ubiquitous T1/ST2 deficiency on inflammation and fibrosis in the bleomycin injury model. Successful completion of these studies will clarify the role and mechanisms of fibroblast activation by INIL-33, laying the groundwork for future development of rational IL-33-targeting antifibrotic strategies."
"9548478","Spinal cord injury causes many bladder complications for life, such as impaired bladder emptying, recurrent urinary tract infection and stones, kidney damage, and incontinence, which impair health and quality of life and result in considerable cost to health care systems, in spite of state of the art management using medications, appliances and surgery. These complications are often due to unco-ordinated and unwanted contractions of the bladder and the external urethral sphincter, the muscle that restricts the flow of urine out of the bladder through the urethra. Contraction of the sphincter has been managed by cutting the sphincter or the nerves to the sphincter, inserting cylindrical metal mesh stents to keep it open, and injection of muscle toxins into the sphincter, but none of these is ideal and some have significant complications, and many patients require intermittent or indwelling catheters to remove urine from the bladder, and these too have their complications. Recently a technique has been developed and refined to block conduction in nerves rapidly and reversibly using electrical stimulation, and this has been used in animals with chronic spinal cord injury to prevent contraction in the pudendal nerves to the sphincter and to allow reliable emptying of the bladder. This project proposes to test this technique for the first time in human subjects with chronic spinal cord injury, using electrodes that can be inserted through a needle and left in place for several days and used to apply electrical stimulation while measuring the ability of human subjects to empty the bladder in the laboratory. After making these measurements the electrodes will be removed by pulling gently on them. If this project is successful it will justify the development and testing of a stimulation system that can be fully implanted by surgery to provide long term management of this problem."
"9339688","Tinea capitis (scalp ringworm) is a fungal dermatophyte infection of scalp hair follicles that afflicts 3-8% of the U.S. pediatric population. Tinea capitis is a major health care disparity because it occurs predominantly among individuals with a disadvantaged socioeconomic background and sub-Saharan African descent. Diagnosis of tinea capitis is currently dependent on culture and microscopy. Both are expensive, take time and require considerable expertise. The goal of this project is an immunoassay that will rapidly identify the presence of dermatophyte fungi in skin scrapings and hair. The target population will be individuals, primarily disadvantaged children, with a clinical presentation of tinea capitis. The approach will be an immunoassay for cell wall galactomannans as biomarkers for dermatophyte fungi. The product will be a rapid and inexpensive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). The LFIA platform is familiar to health care workers and patients alike because the format is identical to that of the home pregnancy test. As a consequence, there would be ready acceptance of the test by all stakeholders. In preliminary studies, a multi-step research-grade LFIA was produced that is reactive with galactomannans of all major dermatophytes as well as extracts of clinical samples from patients with dermatophyte infection. The objective of this Phase I proposal is to move the current research-grade LFIA to a format suitable for point-of- care (POC) use. This objective will be completed by pursuit of three specific aims. Aim 1 will optimize procedures for sample treatment and extraction of galactomannan from dermatophytes. Aim 2 will optimize a prototype lateral flow immunoassay for detection of galactomannan in a single-step POC format. Aim 3 will evaluate a prototype tinea capitis LFIA using clinical samples. If successful, this study will produce a diagnostic test that is efficient, effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and deliverable to sites that serve health disparity populations. The result will be rapid diagnosis and treatment of an infection that stigmatizes children, keeps them from school until treatment is initiated, and adds a considerable cost to the health care system."
"9430531","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis remains the most commonly used illicit drug, and its use is on the rise among young adults. Changes in legal status, perceptions of low associated risk and ease of availability in social settings have been associated with increased rates of recreational cannabis use. With increased exposure comes the increased likelihood of detrimental impacts on psychological and behavioral outcomes. Previous laboratory research has found acute effects of cannabis use on impulse control and social functioning but very little is known about the real world effects of recreational and regular cannabis. It is also unknown whether momentary cannabis use effects relate to long-term detrimental changes associated with cannabis use, effects such as lowered quality of life, diminished psychosocial functioning, and increased or hazardous use of cannabis. The proposed study will address this knowledge gap by implementing ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine within- person responses to cannabis use in real-world contexts in order to understand what effects cannabis is having on the daily psychological and behavioral experiences of non-dependent recreational and regular cannabis users. This proposal will use intensive, repeated assessments delivered on smartphones to assess occasions of cannabis or other substance use (alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs), and within-person fluctuations in impulse control and social interactions in 120 recreational and 120 regular cannabis users (18-30 years). We hypothesize that (1) occasions of cannabis use will increase impulsivity, hostility, and risk behaviors and decrease positive social interactions relative to occasions where no use occurred. We also hypothesize that (2) frequency of use (recreational vs. regular) will moderate the acute response such that more frequent users will experience the greatest acute increases in psychological and behavioral effects. Using a novel approach, we will also examine (3) whether an individual's real-world responses to cannabis use can predict future changes in cannabis use, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life over the course of two years of follow-up. This study is innovativ in its method and approach to assessing pathways by which detrimental effects occur after cannabis use, how these pathways are enhanced by increasingly frequent cannabis use, and determine if effects within the same individual over time can be used to predict long term effects on psychosocial functioning and the onset of cannabis use disorders. This knowledge is vital to identifying the under-recognized impacts of cannabis use on psychological and social functioning. If our hypotheses are supported, we will identify how, and for whom, recreational and regular cannabis use leads to detrimental short term and long term functioning outcomes in young adults. Through this work, we hope to discover novel approaches for monitoring and determining future risk of hazardous cannabis use. These targets may then be used in developing innovative strategies for prevention and intervention of cannabis use in young adults; approaches that can be delivered via `just-in-time' mechanisms on smartphones."
"9324360","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a patient-oriented career development proposal designed to provide the candidate with advanced training, protected research time, and mentored research experience. Major depressive disorder is a serious and debilitating mental illness that affects over 15% of the population and leads to an increased risk of suicide. Yet, available treatments have limited efficacy and there are no FDA-approved rapid-acting antidepressants. The candidate's long-term career goal is to improve the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders by using novel technologies to guide rational drug development. To continue his progress toward these goals, the candidate proposes: (1) a training plan to gain expertise in translational clinical investigations and in advanced MR methods with a focus on 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C-MRS). (2) A mentoring team with extensive expertise in drug development, neuroimaging, and neuroscience to provide the candidate with the resources and supervision needed to advance toward his research goals. (3) A sequence of supervised research projects that will establish and validate a pharmaco-imaging paradigm to study the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine.  Ketamine is an anesthetic agent, recently found to exert a rapid and potent antidepressant effect in severely depressed patients. However, its psychotomimetic effects, which may model core pathophysiological processes in schizophrenia, limit its widespread use in major depression. Mounting evidence indicates that a ketamine-induced surge in glutamate neurotransmission, particularly in the frontal cortex, plays a crucial role in the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of the drug. The proposed research projects take advantage of recent developments in frontal 13C-MRS - a method to measure glutamate/glutamine cycling noninvasively in vivo - to determine the effect of ketamine on glutamate neurotransmission cycling in a group of healthy volunteers (Aim 1 & 2), and in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (Aim 3). The research group hypothesize that subanesthetic doses of ketamine will induce a rapid increase in glutamate/glutamine cycling in the frontal cortex and that the ketamine-induced glutamate changes will correlate with the psychotomimetic effects of the drug. Moreover, the pilot data generated by Aim 3 studies will provide insight into the role of glutamate neurotransmission in the antidepressant effect of ketamine. These studies will provide key insight both into the mechanism of ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects in humans and the psychotomimetic effects that recapitulate core phenomenology of schizophrenia, thus contributing highly significant advances relevant to two devastating mental illnesses affecting millions of patients around the world."
"9209900","Project Summary/Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was recognized as a significant illness on the Saudi Arabian peninsula in mid-2012, and the causative agent was rapidly identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), termed MERS-CoV. MERS has a high mortality (~35%), associated with severe lung disease. Similar to the SARS virus that caused an epidemic in 2003-4, there is ongoing global concern due to MERS high fatality rate. To date, cases of MERS have been reported in 26 countries. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) is the receptor for MERS-CoV. Epidemiologic studies have established that MERS is zoonotic in origin, with evidence for a closely related virus in dromedary camels on the Arabian peninsula and throughout Africa. Spread from camels to people is documented, as well as person-to-person spread among health care workers in hospital settings. A lack of autopsy studies from MERS fatalities has hindered understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Thus, MERS is the most recent confirmation that coronaviruses can jump from their animal hosts, infect humans, and cause severe disease of global significance. There is a pressing need to better understand MERS disease pathogenesis and to develop vaccines and therapies. There are 3 specific aims. Aim 1. To understand how an in vivo evolved MERS-CoV causes lethal lung disease. We developed mice that have the human receptor for MERS-CoV. Using these animals we developed a mouse-adapted virus that causes significant lung disease. These studies will advance our knowledge of the causes of MERS-related lung disease. Aim 2. To investigate how adaptive mutations in MERS-CoV contribute to increased virulence. We sequenced the mouse-adapted virus strains and assembled their genomes. We will use this genetic information to investigate relationships between the virus gene products and the host responses that lead to severe lung disease. Aim 3. To investigate how DPP4 abundance and function influence MERS disease pathogenesis. DPP4 has enzymatic activity that cleaves two amino acids off of target protein substrates, thereby changing protein functions. DPP4 abundance and enzymatic activity may contribute to disease. These experiments will advance our knowledge of how DPP4 activities may underlie to disease outcomes."
"9503997","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop and train Nephrology fellows in Precision Medicine Research for Kidney Diseases. In the majority of patients with kidney disease, the diagnosis is based on clinical information, and sometimes by kidney biopsy. However, genetic and acquired forms of disease are usually indistinguishable based on clinical tools and frequently, the precise etiology of kidney failure remains undiagnosed. In recent years, advances in genomic, proteomic and data sciences have enabled more precise delineation of molecular mechanisms of disease, allowing reclassification of renal disorders based on primary molecular pathogenesis, and sometimes. As these advanced technologies are being incorporated into clinical practice at an increasingly rapid rate, they are bridging basic research with clinical investigations and the daily practice of Medicine. These technologies promises to have transformative effect in the care of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), because kidney disorders are frequently diagnosed based on clinical assessment alone, and late diagnosis or misclassification may cause uncertainty in identifying the etiology of disease. These advances indicate that there are major opportunities and for treeing young investigators in precision Medicine Research in Nephrology. To achieve this aim, we brought together participating a high-qualified faculty members, who bring a diverse expertise that span the full spectrum of research in Precision Medicine. They hold multiple appointments in participating departments, the Department of Medicine, The Department of Biomedical Informatics, the Center for Translational Immunology, the Department of Pathology, The Department of Genetics and Development, the Department of Systems Biology, the Center for Behavioral and Cardiovascular Health, the Department of Physiology, the Department of Biomedical Engineering, the Department of Epidemiology in the Mailman School of Public Health, and all play crucial roles in this application. All of the mentors are well funded, the vas majority with NIH funding and have a track record of successfully mentoring trainees to independent careers in investigation. This program will prepare the next generation of investigators in kidney disease research, to simultaneously acquire multidisciplinary expertise and a strong domain- specific knowledgebase to effectively design and implement research within Nephrology."
"9367544","Genetically encoded molecular tools are having impact throughout neuroscience. However, each genetically encoded molecular tool is a feat of protein engineering, requiring extensive effort to design and optimize. One appealing thought is that it might be possible to create a small number of modular protein building blocks, which then could be organized in patterns, and achieve user-programmable functions, by being scaffolded together on strands of RNA. We recently derived from the Pumilio homology domain (PumHD) protein, 4 building blocks, each of which prefers one of the 4 bases of RNA, so that for any RNA of interest in a cell, a chain made out of the 4 building blocks in a defined sequence can be created to bind to that RNA (bringing along any protein payloads that are fused to that chain). We propose to adapt this Pumilio based (or ?Pum? for short) strategy to create RNA-scaffolded molecular tools that address two major classes of problem in neuroscience ? the targeting of gene expression to specific cell types in the mammalian brain, with high specificity, without requiring transgenic animals (Aim 1), and the ability to image multiple independent fluorescent reporters of physiological activity within individual neurons without crosstalk (Aim 2). We will assess, and optimize, these scaffolded molecular tools in mice (Aims 1, 2) and a non-genetic model organism (macaques), aiming to open up new frontiers of neuroscience experimentation (Aim 3). Our grant is a fast- paced, 4-year grant, which brings together experts in neurotechnology development (Boyden), primate systems neuroscience (Desimone), and nucleic acid technology (Adamala). We will share all tools freely with the neuroscience community, in order to broadly accelerate neuroscience progress."
"9339561","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          PepT1 is a member of the Proton Oligopeptide Transporter (POT) superfamily. PepT1 is well known to transport di/tripeptides, but not free amino acids or peptides with more than three amino acid residues. It is also well recognized that PepT1 is mostly expressed in epithelial cells of the small intestine and is present at low levels, or not at all, in such cells of the normal lare intestine. When we initiated our studies on PepT1, no known human pathology was associated with the transporter. Since the inception of our research, we have demonstrated that the human intestinal di- and-tri-peptide transporter, hPepT1, which is expressed in inflamed but not non-inflamed colonic epithelial cells, mediates the transport of small pro-inflammatory bacterial peptides such as formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and L-Ala- -D-Glu-meso-DAP (Tri- DAP), into the cytosol of colonic epithelial cells. Once in the cytosol, these small bacterial peptides can interact with members of the Nucleotide Binding Site-Leucine-Rich Repeat (NBS-LRR) family of intracellular receptors and initiate intestinal inflammatory responses. Importantly it has been shown (by another group that extensively cited our work) that a PepT1 polymorphism is associated with IBD. Overall, our studies have revealed that PepT1 may be associated with the pathogenesis of intestinal bowel disease (IBD) in humans. Our overall hypothesis is that colonic PepT1 plays a critical role in initiating and perpetuating intestinal colitis and consequently participate to the development of colitis associated cancer. The initial aim of this proposal is to investigate the PepT1-NOD2 signaling pathway(s) in colitis associated cancer. Second, we will explore the role of colonic PepT1 expression in weakness colonic barrier function and affecting wound healing that may an important determinant of colorectal cancer development in IBD. Finally, using nanotechnology approaches, we will investigate the targeting of PepT1 for treatment of intestinal inflammation and colitis associated cancer. It is envisaged that the planned work will identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional role of PepT1 in colitis associated cancer and allow development of therapeutic strategies targeting intestinal inflammatory conditions. Impact on Veterans Health care: Over one million adults in the US, including members of the VA population, suffer from IBD, and about 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year (according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The VA IBD patients have a much higher rate of colorectal cancer compared to the general population (2.9% vs. 0.1%; from National Center for Health Statistics data). Thus, attaining an understanding of the etiology of IBD and the relevant pathological mechanisms are major aims of research seeking to develop effective future treatments will directly benefit the veteran population."
"9522411","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In spite of decades of basic and clincial research, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death and the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American women . A major breakthrough for prevention and cure has been the appreciation that breast cancer is not one disease, rather a collection of cancer subtypes becoming better defined by improved methodologies based upon histopathologic, genetic and molecular signatures. Over time we have applied histological type, grade, tumor size, lymph-node involvement, and estrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2/neu receptor status to help define prognosis and probability of response to therapies, yet these alone have not fully captured the varied behavior of breast cancer. The field is now rapidly progressing with gene expression and proteomic signatures that will help personalize our interventions for individuals. This same concept is relevant to interventions for primary or secondary prevention and is the focus of our translational grant application. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a strong benefit for dietary ?-3 fatty acid rich fish oil for the inhibition of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) mammary tumors in a transgenic mouse model showing decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and glandular atypia. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the development of aggressive breast cancer sub-types such as of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(-) (i.e. triple negative) disease may be uniquely responsive to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the long chain ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in fish oil. As a first step towards a future definitive prevention trial in women, we propose to test the efficacy of an ?-3 rich fish il supplement to modulate breast biomarkers indicative of anti-carcinogenic action. We will randomize high risk survivors to a placebo-low dose or high dose ?-3 rich fish oil capsule treatment and employ our breast fine needle aspiration techniques to obtain cells and tissue for analysis of biomarkers of exposure and efficacy. Our multidisciplinary team has developed the following Specific Aims to: (1) Determine the effects of dietary ?-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor breast cancer +/- HER-2/neu overexpression; and (2) Define the role of dietary ?-3 PUFAs in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis as a novel mechanism for the effects of ?-3 PUFAs. Development of these biomarkers of ?-3 PUFA exposure and response will enable the assessment of this bioactive food component in future large-scale prevention trials for women at risk for recurrence of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or triple negative breast cancer."
"9247591","There is a fundamental gap in understanding how the millions of known regulatory elements functionally contribute to gene regulation and phenotypes. Continued existence of that gap is an important problem because, until it is filled, it will remain extremely difficult to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying the thousands of observed genetic associations with disease phenotypes. Our long-term goal is to understand how and to what extent gene regulatory elements alter target gene expression and impact phenotypes. The objectives of this particular proposal are to functionally characterize all regulatory elements contributing to the differentiation of CD4+ T cells. In doing so, we will identify the causal regulatory mechanisms that modulate the immune system. The rationale for this work is that understanding those mechanisms will be the foundation for future efforts to therapeutically modulate the immune system, and will establish a discovery platform for determining the mechanisms underlying countless other model systems. Specifically, we will characterize three complementary components of regulatory element activity: (i) the capacity of regulatory elements to drive expression of a reporter gene, (ii) the effect of each regulatory element on the expression of one or more target genes, and (iii) the contributions of regulatory elements to phenotypic function, namely differentiation. We will accomplish those goals across three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will quantify the activity of all regulatory elements that have evidence of differential activity between subtypes of mouse CD4 T cells. We will do so using a capture-based high-throughput reporter assay that allows us to assay larger (>500 bp) fragments from specific genomic regions of interest. In Aim 2, we will quantify the effects of regulatory elements on target genes using a novel strategy that combines high-throughput CRISPR/ Cas9-based epigenome editing screens and targeted high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. In Aim 3, we will determine which regulatory elements are necessary or sufficient for CD4 T cell differentiation using high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome-editing screens combined differentiation into particular CD4 T cell subtypes. Each aim will provide functional characterization of all of the regulatory elements implicated in CD4 T cell differentiation. Together, the aims will provide a comprehensive, multi-layered, and systematic understanding of the ways that gene regulatory elements modulate the immune system. The result will be an actionable set of targets for designing strategies to modulate immune system activity for therapeutic benefit. Because the approach is general to any model system, the same strategy can be readily transferred to diverse systems including differentiation and disease models. Therefore, we expect that this project will have both immediate and long-term benefit for determining the ways that regulatory elements contribute to health and disease."
"9233416","Project Summary We have developed a system in which Gain-Of-Function (GOF) mutant p53 makes living cells fluoresce and luminesce (GOF Mutant p53 Beacon System). This powerful tool allows us to instantly assess the presence or absence of mutant p53 in living cells and is not affected by wild-type p53. It also provides a means to assess activity and properties for a large variety of mutant p53 alleles in cell lines. We propose to test the utility of the Beacon System for assessing small molecule mutant p53 inhibitors and wild-type p53 reactivators. We will adapt the Beacon System for use in high throughput screening of inhibitors such that when mutant p53 is inhibited, the cells will fluoresce and luminesce. The utility of the system for identifying cellular modulators of mutant p53 will also be investigated by adapting the system so that when mutant p53 is inhibited, the cells become resistant to puromycin. The ultimate phase of developing this tool is to make transgenic mice in which cells that acquire p53 mutations fluoresce and luminesce. This advance should allow us to visualize any tumor growth in the living mouse as cells acquire p53 mutations and as the tumor cells grow, evolve, invade, and metastasize and establish glowing cell populations at new locations. The mouse system will also be adapted such that cells that acquire p53 mutations will express a cell surface streptavidin tag making it easy to purify the cells at various stages of cancer development to study cellular properties, stem-cell properties, genetic events, and the evolution of these events at early to late stages of cancer. Development of this system should create opportunities for a simple and rapid screening for cancer therapeutics that target mutant p53, one of the most prevalent cancer-causing dominant defects in all cancers. A mouse in which the tumor glows in the living mouse will provide a powerful real-time analysis of cancer progression. This tool will advance our knowledge of how tumors grow and tumor cells migrate, and how they respond to therapeutics."
"9356541","MOLECULAR GENETICS CORE (CORE F) ABSTRACT The fields of molecular genetic and genomic technology, instrumentation and data handling/analysis have undergone revolutionary changes in the previous 5 years of the IDDRC grant to Boston Children's Hospital. Many of these changes, including a dramatic reduction in price, has made exome or genome sequencing within reach of individual laboratory investigators and clinicians. It is now possible to obtain exome/genome sequences on families or individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and determine the underlying genetic cause of the problem-- leading to more accurate diagnoses and targets for therapeutic intervention. The technology and interpretation of the output data is very complicated, and is often beyond the expertise of individual laboratories or clinicians. The Boston Children's Hospital's IDDRC Molecular Genetics Core laboratory has evolved with these revolutionary changes and represents a central location to which IDDRC investigators can obtain advice on project design and outsourcing to the best and least expensive vendors. Additionally, IDDRC investigators can receive training and assistance in analyzing the resulting data, such that they will have a smooth path to new gene discovery. This benefits both their NIH supported research as well as individual patients and their families. Some investigator needs have not changed over the past 5 years. There is still the need for confirmatory sequence verification, as well as advice on functional studies. The demand for our economical array-based transcriptome studies and PCR analysis continues to grow. Sometimes laboratories or cores can collaborate on projects, saving time and money for all parties, but need assistance on how to find a suitable partner. The Molecular Genomics Core facilitates all of the above and more; all of these functions are combined in one central laboratory available easily to all IDDRC investigators and their lab members. This produces an economy of scale and a place for training and collaboration. The Molecular Genetics Core Laboratory will emphasize the following specific aims: Aim 1: Provision of general design, implantation, and interpretation of IDDRC studies. Aim 2: Obtaining the best available price, quality, and turnaround time for Next Generation  Sequencing (NGS) for the study of IDD/Neurodevelopment. Aim 3: Producing high quality Array and other Services on demand. Aim 4: Training and intellectual development for our researchers and clinicians. Aim 5: Assisting in collaborations within and outside the Boston Children's Hospital IDDRC."
"9325523","PROJECT SUMMARY The Administrative Core of the Center for Iron and Heme Disorders (CIHD) will be responsible for oversight of the operational and financial management of the proposed CIHD. This will be accomplished through an Executive Committee, an associated External Advisory Board, core staff, and close collaboration with NIDDK program staff. The Executive Committee will meet to monitor and guide core usage, core services offered, program membership, training opportunities, expanding the research base, expanding core use, and review of applications for Pilot and Feasibility Program funding. The External Advisory Board will be chosen with input from NIDDK program staff, directors of the proposed cores, and the Executive Committee. The functions of this body are to 1) ensure that stated policies are followed, 2) assist in Pilot and Feasibility funding decisions, and 3) work with other NIH-funded investigators to expand the research base. Overall the Administrative Core will ensure that the CIHD adheres to its mandate and remains focused on the goals of the Center."
"9359608","The Cell Biology Core will be a critical resource to this PPG. It will provide the four Projects with access to a wide array of reagents, procedures, and analyses, including fully characterized cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMCs) and CMC-derived extracellular vesicles (CMC-EVs, hereafter referred to as EVs) isolated from mice and pigs, assays of CMC function in vitro, and characterization of EVs (e.g., arrays of EV-related non-coding RNAs, particle size analysis, protein assays). Specifically, the Core will i) isolate CMCs from mouse and pig hearts; ii) perform comprehensive CMC characterization, including proliferation, population doubling time, morphometric analysis (cell length and area), clonogenicity, analysis of marker expression, secretome analysis, and gene profiling; iii) isolate EVs from mouse and pig CMCs; iv) perform characterization of EVs, including particle size analysis, validation of markers expression, and RNA and protein profiling; v) isolate cells utilizing multiple markers; vi) assess cell viability; vii) determine changes in cell signaling; and viii) quantify cells at each phase of the cell cycle. The individual Projects do not have the facilities or expertise needed to isolate and characterize CMCs consistently or to perform the extensive EV characterizations. Consolidation of all CMC/EV work into a Core facility will decrease the costs of supplies and equipment because the Core will make bulk purchases of supplies (thereby reducing expenses) and because waste and unnecessary duplication of supplies, reagents, and equipment will be eliminated with the maintenance of centralized stocks and inventories. Consolidating CMC/EV work into a Core facility is also time-effective because the techniques involved in this work are very labor intensive and require dedicated, skilled personnel. Core C will make available to the four Projects the tremendous experience and expertise of the Core personnel in the preparation and analysis of CMCs and EVs. The Core staff, a strong team of dedicated individuals under the immediate supervision of the Core Leader, will provide consistency and reproducibility of analysis. This is crucial, because it will ensure that all four Projects will use CMCs isolated and expanded the same way, thereby making the results comparable. A single source of CMCs and EVs with rigorous standardization to ensure consistency will result in transplantation of uniform CMC and EV populations in all four Projects and thus is extremely important for the integration and comparison of results from each of the Projects. This will make it possible to compare results of different experiments within the same Project and among different Projects.  In summary, the Core will ensure quality control and, by eliminating duplication of effort and maximizing the use of personnel and supplies, will enable an efficient use of resources."
"9339567","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed study is designed to determine how distinct subsets of melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) we have identified are regulated and maintained in the stem cell state and contribute to neural crest-derived cell regeneration. The rationale for the study is based upon our discovery that MSCs not only populate a region of the murine hair follicle (HF) termed the bulge, also the site of keratinocyte stem cells (KcSCs) of the HF, but also the secondary hair germ (SHG), a transient structure at the base of the telogen, or resting, HF adjacent to the dermal papilla. Our laboratory has developed methods to separate and study these two cell subsets in the viable state using a combination of a unique transgenic mouse system and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).The objectives of our studies are to discover specific markers of these stem cell subsets and to determine whether CD34+ MSCs in mice, and their cellular analogs in humans, can regenerate functional glial and neuronal cells, as suggested by preliminary data. We will also determine both in vitro and in vivo whether the CD34+ MSC subset, which exhibits an expanded developmental potential compared to CD34- MSCs, can regenerate neural crest- derived glial and neuronal cells. Information obtained from murine experiments will be used to identify comparable stem cell populations from human skin. These studies will be accomplished a unique, bitransgenic mouse line we have developed, Dct-H2BGFPki, in combination with the FACS facility and other core resources associated with my research laboratory located in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The results of these studies should have a positive impact on the health care of Veterans. Our discovery that the CD34+ MSC subset selectively expresses glial and neuronal markers may provide a strategy for using cells easily obtained from human skin to be used to support Veteran recovery from neurological injury and neurodegenerative disease."
"9339473","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Obesity is a major worldwide health problem and highly prevalent among our veteran population. Therapeutic options are limited. Lifestyle change is effective but difficult to implement and available drugs are minimally effective and/or unsafe. Surgical therapy can be effective, but requires a major operation and is associated with several long-term complications.  In spite of the problems with drug therapy to date, we believe there is an intriguing approach that needs further evaluation. That approach is to target mitochondria with agents that induce mild respiratory uncoupling. As discussed in the body of this application, mitochondrial uncoupling has the potential to divert caloric intake to heat production rather to energy storage as fat mass. Although vigorous uncoupling is likely dangerous, mild uncoupling (over time) could lead to safe weight loss in a manner that has been likened to exercise.  Coenzyme Q (CoQ) has been advocated as an antioxidant and metabolically active compound offering health benefits. However, CoQ does not, or very poorly, penetrates mitochondrial membranes and has not proven effective. Therefore, attempts have been made to target CoQ to mitochondria. A common approach is to shorten the CoQ side chain and add a covalent attachment consisting of the positively charged cation, triphenylphosphonium (TPP). This has led to compounds we refer to as mitochondrial-targeted CoQ analogs (MTQAs). The prototype is the compound, mitoquinone (MitoQ), which has been developed as a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant and is now under investigation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, aging, hepatic steatosis, and other disorders.  In recent VA supported work, my laboratory has found prominent metabolic effects of MTQAs. This does not seem surprising, given the mitochondrial targeting. However, to date, there has been relatively little interest in examining these metabolic effects as applicable for therapeutic purposes. In preliminary and published work to date, we found that MTQAs manifest dose-dependent effects to induce mitochondrial respiratory uncoupling in cultured cells. Moreover, we have preliminary evidence that they are effective in preventing obesity in mice. Somewhat surprisingly, we have data suggesting that this occurs, not only through enhanced energy expenditure, but also by inhibiting energy intake at the level of the central nervous system. This has led us to an overall hypothesis that a MTQA compound acting at the mitochondrial level can prevent obesity with minimal toxicity, and, ultimately, prove sufficient for clinical use. Briefly stated, the three specific aims of this application are: 1. Examine the effects of selected MTQA compounds for therapeutic potential based on metabolic studies in cultured cells. We propose to examine MitoQ, SKQ1, and compounds representing MitoQ and SKQ1 but with two side chain modifications for each parent compound (six compounds total). 2. Evaluate 2-3 selected compounds for their actions in a rodent model of obesity with attention to effects on energy expenditure and energy intake. 3. Select 1-2 compounds for more detailed mechanistic study directed at understanding the in vivo effects observed in aim 2. Significance and Innovation: The clinical importance of obesity among veterans is obvious. Our approach to addressing this issue is innovative. As will become clear, we will apply new and innovative methodology to look for previously unidentified mechanisms underlying the effects of MTQAs. We point out that we have no interest in the commercial development of MTQAs and, therefore, no bias towards any one particular compound. Our interest is in the scientific aspects of mild uncoupling as a possible treatment for obesity."
"9380823","Abstract Mouse models provide highly tractable models with which to assess, identify and mechanistically characterize the role of genetic variants on infectious disease responses. The Mouse Genetics Core has been at the forefront of designing experimental crosses, sequence datasets and other mouse resources with which to investigate and perturb polymorphic immune networks. Following the identification of polymorphic host genome regions, aberrant mouse lines, and discordant immune spreads or candidate genes and pathways from human studies (in close collaboration with the Projects and the Systems Genetics and Bioinformatics core), we will generate a variety of mouse experimental models for the Projects to further assess, identify and characterize these processes. These models will include F1 panels contrasting variant disease alleles, F2 mapping populations, and mouse strains with modified candidate genes. Concurrently, designing the appropriate experiments for the study of viral disease requires an understanding of the underlying immune composition of individuals. Therefore, the Core will identify and further characterize genetic variants impacting basal immune responses; both intra-cellular as well as at the whole-organism level. These data will be provided to the projects to enhance their assessment of antiviral and/or perturbed response."
"9209901","SUMMARY To prevent deadly CoV infections we propose to study the molecular basis of coronavirus- induced lung edema and its resolution, through the identification of (i) Signaling pathways resulting in severe lung disease to inform inhibitors as antiviral candidates; and (ii) Virus virulence genes. Deletion of these genes will lead to attenuated vaccine candidates. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1. To determine the factors involved in edema induction and resolution during CoV infection. We have shown that both E and 3a proteins of SARS-CoV, and proteins E and 5 of MERS-CoV include two sequence domains involved in virulence, one containing a PDZ binding motif (PBM), and another one encoding ion channel (IC) activity. The binding of the SARS-CoV E protein PBM to proteins containing the PDZ motif causes Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome in infected animals. The importance of the PBM is likely associated with its ability to bind to more than 400 cellular proteins and, therefore, to regulate many cell signaling pathways. We will study the whole-proteome interactions between PBMs in MERS-CoV, and cellular PDZs. This interactome will be the basis for the identification of peptides interfering with PBM-PDZ binding, using peptide libraries. The mechanism of inflammasome activation by MERS-CoV proteins with IC activity will be studied. Edema resolution is possible by two enzymatic activities: epithelial sodium channel activity (ENa+C) and Na+/K+ ATPase that move Na+ ions from the alveolar fluid into the interstitium promoting water elimination. We showed that SARS-CoV E protein binds Na+/K+ ATPase and have postulated that this binding reduces Na+/K+ ATPase activity, leading to lung edema; this will be investigated in this project. Aim 2. We propose to identify viral and host non-coding RNAs involved in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and lung inflammation, as potential targets in antiviral and anti-edema strategies. Aim 3. To develop safe live-attenuated vaccines for MERS-CoV. The construction of MERS-CoVs defective in propagation, and the generation of attenuated, dissemination competent rMERS- CoVs are proposed. Maximizing biosafety and genetic stability of the vaccine candidates are main goals of the project."
"9544473","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma incidence has increased in the last 30 years and over 800,000 people have a previous diagnosis of melanoma in the US. Melanoma has a high likelihood to metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) and accounts for 80% of the skin cancer-related deaths. As a result, many melanoma survivors constantly fear when their cancers might come back and spread. Currently, there is no active means to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis for melanoma survivors. Evidence strongly suggests that inflammation is associated with unfavorable clinical prognosis such as tumor progression and recurrence. We have found that human metastatic melanoma cells show a special form of inflammatory response called autoinflammation because of constant activation of a unique inflammatory platform called inflammasome. This autoinflammation is mediated by IL-1?, a pro-inflammatory cytokine inducing a large portfolio of genes. EGCG is an active ingredient in green tea and has many biological effects including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pathogen properties. Because many inflammatory mediators reported to be inhibited by EGCG are controlled by active IL-1? (secreted form), we hypothesized that EGCG might inhibit IL-1? activation, thereby controlling other mediators that are important for tumor progression and metastasis. We indeed found that a practical and physiologically achievable dose of EGCG (1 µM) suppresses IL-1? secretion in human metastatic melanoma cells that carry a feature of autoinflammation. We propose to explore the molecular mechanisms of action of a practical dose of EGCG in regulating IL-1? activation in human metastatic melanoma in vitro, and analyze the effects of EGCG on a tumor cell population [putative cancer stem cell (CSC) population] that has a high tendency to initiate tumor formation and recurrence. We also propose to study the biological effects of EGCG on melanoma recurrence using a spontaneous metastasis model in vivo. We will use patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model (avatar model), one of the best models in human cancer research that recapitulates complex tumor microenvironment. We will also use cells from a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of metastasizing melanoma. PDX and GEM tumor cells will be labeled with a modified labeling method with enhanced brightness, high detection sensitivity, high transduction efficiency and stable labeling. State-of-the-art multimodality imaging will be used to longitudinally monitor tumor recurrence at the initial tumor site, lymph nodes and distant metastatic sites. Tumor cells will be examined to define the effects of EGCG on IL-1? pathway, CSC traits, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Because IL-1? plays a critical role in tumor progression, such studies will elucidate the mechanisms of action of EGCG on regulating dysregulated cytokines in cancers and will lead to the development of effective chemopreventive agents with limited to no toxicity that can be taken by cancer survivors to control tumor recurrence and prolong their lives."

"9348986","ABSTRACT HIV incidence is still increasing in the U.S. despite intense efforts to: (i) diagnose HIV infection as early as possible, (ii) engage newly diagnosed individuals into care and (iii) start antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all infected persons. The San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium (PIRC) has been tackling the evolving challenges around these issues for twenty years. The PIRC is the largest, most intensively studied and well-characterized cohort of acute and early HIV infected (AEH) individuals in the United States. It has provided essential support to over 325 peer-reviewed original research manuscripts, spanning a wide range of fields, and including many NIH priority areas for HIV research, including: HIV incidence, strategies to improve HIV testing and entry into prevention services, etc. This application represents a renewal of our PIRC R24 (AI106039) with the proposal to continue this highly productive program, supporting the infrastructure needed to identify, characterize, and share clinical and biological data with scientific colleagues whose research objectives rely upon access to these biological samples and data. The proposed R24 renewal application includes a new collaboration between PIRC and the Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) to develop an expanded and synergistic resource to serve biomedical research in the area of AEH. Overall, the PIRC supports: 1) an HIV screening program to detect and stage acute, recent and chronic infection, 2) partner services to identify sexual contacts of newly HIV diagnosed AEH participants (i.e., ?index? subjects), 3) immediate provision of ART, 4) prompt linkage to care, 5) monitoring of ART adherence and continued engagement in care, 6) methods to estimate putative HIV transmission and 6) an AEH biorepository. This entire biorepository and data associated with these well characterized participants are available to qualified investigators, requiring only internal review and approval of a concept proposal. The proposed R24 renewal application will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Community HIV Testing and Acute and Early HIV (AEH) Infection Staging. We propose to identify 120 newly HIV diagnosed persons per year at the University of California San Diego: 47 AEH infected and 73 chronically infected participants. Aim 2. Improve Continuum of HIV Prevention and Treatment. We will evaluate temporal changes in the HIV treatment cascade in response to coordinated efforts to support immediate ART in newly HIV diagnosed PIRC participants. Subjects identified during AEH will be followed for up to 5 years, while chronically infected subjects will be followed in clinic for up to 90 days. Aim 3. Shared Resources. We will leverage AEH specimen and participant resources to support additional NIH research collaborations related to primary HIV infection. Co-enrollment of AEH participants in CNICS will leverage the clinical monitoring of validated outcomes and longitudinal resistance data provided by CNICS. The PIRC will serve as a resource to support high quality basic, clinical and translational research related to AEH."
"9297410","Abstract   Dopaminergic mechanisms, particularly the function of the nigrostriatal pathway, are strongly implicated in  dystonia. Clinical studies and postmortem studies have shown reductions in dopamine receptor ligand binding.  Acute treatment with dopamine antagonists can induce dystonia in normal individuals. Studies in animal  models have shown diminished extracellular striatal dopamine and impaired dopamine release in response to  sympathomimetic agents. Genetic defects in dopamine synthesis can also cause dystonia, and these rare  forms often respond to dopamine replacement. In most forms of dystonia, however, simple dopamine  replacement treatments are ineffective. From a clinical perspective, the most effective medications available for  dystonia are anticholinergic drugs. These non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists are clinically effective  but produce a range of anticholinergic side effects and are not well tolerated. Studies in mouse models of  DYT1 dystonia have provided experimental support for the concept that dystonia may be related to  abnormalities of cholinergic transmission, with downstream effects on dopamine release and synaptic plasticity  in the striatum. We have found that animals with transgenic expression of mutant torsinA have profound  abnormalities of cholinergic neuron function, with paradoxical excitation in response to dopamine D2 activation.  These same effects are reproduced in animals with selective deletion of torsinA from cholinergic cells,  demonstrating that the effect is at least in part cell autonomous. Recently, two additional genes causing  dystonia have been discovered by our P01 collaborators: mutations in the transcription factor THAP1 and  heterozygous deletion of GNAL, encoding the G?olf regulatory G protein. All three genes produce a similar  phenotype. Mechanistically, these may be related in that THAP1 may regulate torsinA expression and  abnormal G protein signaling seems to be a downstream consequence of torsinA dysfunction. Our central  hypothesis is that abnormal cholinergic function and downstream signaling is responsible for abnormal striatal  signaling in dystonia, and that selective modulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors can normalize striatal  physiology. We will explore this in mouse models of these three forms of genetic dystonia. Our studies will  determine if DYT1, THAP1, and GNAL dystonia share common cholinergic mechanisms, whether this leads to  disrupted dopaminergic function, and whether these abnormalities can be reversed by modulation of the  cholinergic system and by modulation of downstream signaling. We incorporate studies of a novel series of  cholinergic antagonists and modulators which provide a potential pathway to translate these findings into  therapies for human dystonias."

"9332371","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autoimmune diabetes is characterized by the selective destruction of the insulin secreting ?-cells of the pancreas. Environmental factors, such as viral infections, have been proposed to initiate ?-cell damage during autoimmune diabetes development. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) induces diabetes in susceptible strains of mice. EMCV-stimulated diabetes induction is associated with macrophage activation and the expression of inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1?) and nitric oxide. The broad goals of this research are to identify mechanisms by which virus infections contribute to ?-cell damage. The C-C chemokine receptor CCR5 has been identified as a signaling receptor activated in response to EMCV infection and is responsible for regulating expression of IL-1?, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in macrophages. While CCR5 participates in regulating macrophage activation in response to EMCV infection, non-leukocyte cell populations (including ?-cells) do not express this receptor. Consistent with a lack of ?-cell expression of CCR5 is the identification of two micro-RNAs that reside within type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci that are predicted to target CCR5. CCR5 has also been previously identified in Genomic Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to be in a susceptibility locus of type 1 diabetes. Therefore, this research proposal will examine CCR5 as a potential susceptibility gene to virus-induced diabetes by studying the CCR5-dependent signaling pathways required for macrophage activation, the cellular regulation of CCR5 expression by micro-RNAs, and whether CCR5 contributes to susceptibility to EMCV-induced diabetes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), in a CCR5-dependent manner, regulate the activation of macrophages in response to EMCV infection. Mouse models lacking CCR5 will be generated to test the potential role of CCR5 in regulating mouse susceptibility to EMCV-induced diabetes. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that micro-RNAs limit the expression of CCR5 in ?-cells and thereby attenuate the expression of inflammatory mediators known to cause ?-cell damage in response to EMCV infection. Experiments will determine the role of micro-RNA(s) in preventing CCR5 expression in ?-cells. The potential role of CCR5 expression in ?-cells as a mechanism to increase ?-cell susceptibility to virus- induced death will also be examined, as aberrant CCR5 expression may lead to ?-cell iNOS expression during EMCV infection and thus potentiation of virus-induced damage. This proposal will elucidate mechanisms by which CCR5 controls expression of soluble mediators known to damage ?-cells, by studying mechanisms of macrophage activation in response to viral infection and how micro-RNAs may suppress ?-cell expression of CCR5. These results may provide information on precipitating events associated with the induction of diabetes."
"9380699","Increasing evidence links obesity-related health problems, such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and impaired tissue repair, with chronic inflammation. Although dysregulated hematopoietic stem progenitor cell (HSPC) responses are known to be involved, the mechanism(s) underlying obesity-induced dysregulation of inflammation and its downstream impact on healing following ischemia remain unclear. The long-term goal of this study is to understand mechanisms though which obesity and insulin resistance impairs healing after ischemic injury, with a specific focus on epigenetic regulation of HSPCs and dysregulation of inflammation. We hypothesize that obesity and insulin resistance induces HSPC dysregulation that leads to increased supply of inflammatory monocytes, which in turn contributes to prolonged inflammation and impaired healing after ischemic tissue injury. Our preliminary data suggest that this pathway involves mitochondria (mit)-reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced epigenetic dysregulation in high fat diet (HFD)-induced prediabetic mice. In this study, we propose: (1) To determine the role of prediabetes-induced ROS in histone-3 lysine-4 (H3K4) methylation in HSPCs. We hypothesize that HFD-induced mit-ROS increases H3K4me3 in HSPCs by inducing SET7/9 methyltransferase and inhibiting JARID demethylase activation. (2) To determine the role of prediabetes-induced ROS in HSPC monopoiesis following hindlimb ischemia. We hypothesize that HFD increases inflammatory monopoiesis of HSPCs via mit-ROS-induced H3K4me3. (3) To determine the cell autonomous role of prediabetes-dysregulated HSPCs in tissue recovery following hindlimb ischemia. We hypothesize that prediabetes-dysregulated HSPCs enhance inflammation and impair tissue recovery after hindlimb ischemia in a cell-autonomous and mit-ROS-dependent manner. Our proposed study will begin to elucidate the mechanisms involved in HSPC dysregulation in obesity-related conditions and its impact on inflammatory responses and healing following ischemic injury. If successful, our data will implicate mit-ROS and downstream H3K4 methylation as a key pathway for inducing prediabetes-induced epigenetic memory in HSPCs, and will provide insight into novel therapeutic targets for ischemic cardiovascular diseases in patients with prediabetic pathology."

"9547111","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to gather, collate and present genomic information for echinoderm species including the reference, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sp) through an easily managed web information system (http://spbase.org). These efforts are directly focused to provide the bench scientist with up to date information on the genome sequence, gene structures, expression data and functional information in order to facilitate experiments to study gene regulation in development. Originally a draft sequence for the reference was undertaken by the Baylor College of Medicine, Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM-HGSC) and published in 2006 (Sea Urchin Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2006). Today efforts in this area are both    challenging and interesting in view of the large body of emerging sequence information on the reference and allied species. An entirely new assembly of the Sp genome has been submitted to Genbank and awaits further annotation at SpBase. However, preliminary measurements indicate that this version is so much more complete that it can reveal scientifically interesting elements of genome organization that were unattainable previously. Individual laboratory transcriptome sequencing projects for many species are appearing at a great rate. These datasets are seldom analyzed past the experimental question for which they were originally conducted, yet they can provide genome wide information on gene structure such as tissue specific splicing isoforms. In support of the BCM-HGSC, we have provided material for additional genome sequencing projects including Allocentrotus fragllis, S. franciscanus, Lytechinus variegatus, Eucidaris tribuloides and Patiria miniata. New sequence data for all of these species has been procured and in some cases already posted to Genbank. This is the material that will enrich the offering of SpBase provided it is carefully managed and posted."
"9403965","PROJECT SUMMARY Sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) is home to the fastest growing and youngest population in the world and includes countries with the highest HIV prevalence globally. More than half of sSA's population is under 25 years of age. Men and women aged 10-24, defined as `young people' by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), represent one third of the sSA population and this proportion continues to grow. Young women in sSA who are economically and educationally disadvantaged are at high risk of engaging in transactional sex. Sex workers under 16, new to sex work are much more vulnerable than their older colleagues to violence, STIs and HIV. As sex work is illegal in Uganda, this contributes to the risk these young women face. Effective STI and HIV prevention, care, support, and reproductive health services are critical. Evidence on interventions that address uptake and adherence to HIV prevention services for high-risk populations is limited, but interventions that address YWHR are almost non-existent. In response to RFA-MH-17-560, we are proposing a R34 to develop a comprehensive intervention including PrEP and HIV self-testing for HIV-uninfected women 15- to 24-years old who engage in high-risk sexual activity in Kampala, Uganda, and conduct a pilot trial to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability and potential effect on PrEP uptake and adherence as well as repeat HIV self-testing. We will embed this study within our existing cohort study (NIMH R01 HD085805-01, PI King) that has revealed the need for greater attention to young sex workers soon after their initiation into the profession given early results in our mobilization efforts that have shown much higher HIV prevalence than expected. The intervention will focus on increasing initiation of PrEP with enhanced adherence support, uptake of repeat HIV testing by self- test, and motivation to adopt and sustain sexual risk reduction behaviors for STI, HIV, and unplanned pregnancy. The specific aims are (1) To conduct formative research to enhance our understanding of the dynamics of the social and sexual networks, and context of women (aged 15-24) engaged in high risk sexual behavior in Kampala, Uganda and barriers and opportunities for PrEP uptake and adherence as well as repeat HIV testing by self test; (2) To develop and test a socially and culturally acceptable and feasible prevention intervention on uptake and adherence to PrEP and HIV self-testing for young women at high risk for HIV; (3) to translate lessons learned in the pilot study into the design of a larger RCT. The proposed project is responsive to several priority areas of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the World Health Organization regarding HIV prevention among young people. Our proposal represents one of the first studies to develop an integrated bio-behavioral-structural approach to HIV prevention among young women at high risk in resource- limited settings."
"9318303","RFA-HD-13-002 requires the inclusion of a Clinical Translational Core within each IDDRC,  addressing a combination of activities that includes: (a) recruitment of research participants, (b) subject  assessment, phenotyping, or treatment, (c) development of biomarkers, (d) manufacturing services, (e) highthroughput  screening, and/or (f) collection of samples from individuals with IDD for biobanking. As described in  our Introductory Overview and the following Core descriptions, many of these activities are supported by other  Cores and existing resources within the large and multidisciplinary research environment developed within our  Institutions over the years. Therefore, the overall objective of the Clinical Translational Core is to complement  those resources and coordinate access for IDDRC-supported investigators. This will contribute to our primary  goal of enhancing the conversion of basic science discoveries into effective, commercially available disease-altering  therapies for children and adults with genetic and acquired intellectual and developmental disabilities.  The Core will be structured to complement our Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), a program established three years  ago in response to the increasing emphasis on translational research within our IDDRC and the broader  research program it supports. The CTU is focused on the development of treatments targeting developmental  disorders, including conducting investigational dmg trials at all phases. The Clinical Translational Core will  expand upon CTU capabilities to provide expert resources including consultation on biostatistics and protocol  design, pre-review prior to submission of protocols to the institutional review board (IRB) and hands-on advice  and help with carrying out investigational protocols by experienced clinical trials faculty, research coordinators  and administrative staff."
"9280218","Collaboration and Service Project Summary The primary technology of the National Resource for Cell Analysis and Modeling, the VCell modeling and simulation tool, is freely available for use as an internet resource. Thousands of individuals use the software each year, creating models and simulation results that are computed on NRCAM servers and stored within the VCell Database (VCDB). Our collaborations largely arise from dissemination and training efforts as users develop more sophisticated and complex models and seek a range of interaction and help from the VCell team; these collaborations result in published VCell models of a range of biological mechanisms. User statistics show that VCell usage continues to increase unabated, and that users avail themselves of all the different types of modeling applications available within the software. The VCDB contains a growing number of publically available models and simulations available to the entire research community. New technologies proposed in TR&D3 promises to greatly expand VCDB as a modeling resource well beyond the VCell userbase, providing well-annotated model components (?ModelBricks?) that can be easily ported to any model to enable the creation of well-annotated models from component parts. Additional service provided by the resource includes the strong effort of the VCell Team in the development of community standards for modeling in computational cell biology, and the use of VCell as the software of choice in a growing number of graduate and undergraduate courses that teach modeling methods in biology and biomedical engineering."
"9483382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NE-CAT Center for Advanced Macromolecular Crystallography operates two undulator beamlines at Sector 24 of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Our mission is to develop advanced technologies for challenging problems in structural biology. These problems come to us as Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs), selected for their groundbreaking science. Examples include membrane channels, transporters, and receptors; cell signaling proteins; enzymes catalyzing complex cellular processes; structural biology of translation, transcription, recombination and repair; lare RNA molecules and RNA-mediated gene regulation, and large protein complexes such as nuclear pores. These projects often confront microcrystals, inhomogeneous crystals, poorly diffracting crystals, or pathologies such as multiple lattices. To address these problems we will develop technology in three interdependent areas: (1) microbeam diffraction, (2) beamline automation, and (3) low resolution structural biology. Microbeam diffraction builds on our successful microcrystal diffraction program. We will develop technology for small (2- 5 |j,m), intense and stable microbeams, for use with microcrystals and for measuring data from selected regions of inhomogeneous crystals. We will also work out how to improve sample stability, which often limits data quality. For inhomogeneous samples we will develop optimal data-collection protocols. Beamline automation will focus on new, rapid screening protocols, automated procedures to determine the best data collection strategies, especially for multiple crystals and flexible kappa geometry, and methods for automated data processing and analysis. Low resolution structural biology is growing rapidly, driven by structural studies of multicomponent complexes and membrane proteins. We will develop technology to obtain the best possible signal-to-noise at the resolution limit while still measuring the lowest order reflections. We will develop protocols to optimize data-collection strategies and data processing, especially for multiple crystals. We will also develop on- site methods to improve the resolution of existing crystals. During the past five years we have maintained a very productive collaboration and service program. We expect the number of users (including DBPs) to remain constant at about 1000 per year. We will make our new technology available to all users as early as possible. A strength of our Center is user training. We will continue our extensive training program, while developing new approaches to train remote access users. We will continue dissemination of both technology and scientific results through mechanisms that include our web site, presentations at meetings, workshops, publications, and one-on-one contacts."
"9324126","PROJECT SUMMARY  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common lethal muscle wasting disease caused by dystrophin deficiency. There is no effective treatment exists for this disease. The current therapeutic strategies aimed to either replace or compensate for the lack of dystrophin also face major challenges such as targeting cardiac and respiratory tissues and fibrosis. Therefore, recent studies are focused to prevent directly the consequences of dystrophic process. Identification of such alternative therapies could complement the existing strategies and enhance the effectiveness of treatment for this lethal disease. Abnormal intracellular Ca2+ overload is an important, early pathogenic event that initiates and perpetuates disease progression in DMD. We recently found that sarcolipin (SLN), a potent inhibitor of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), is significantly increased in the skeletal and cardiac muscles of mouse models of DMD. Similar to rodents, SLN levels are high in myoblasts and muscles of a canine model of DMD and in muscle biopsies of DMD patients. In muscle cells, SERCA accounts for ? 70% of Ca2+ removal from the cytosol during excitation- contraction coupling. Therefore in dystrophic muscles, chronic inhibition of SERCA by high-levels of SLN could majorly contribute to the abnormal elevation of cytosolic Ca2+. Accordingly, reducing SLN expression is anticipated to improve SERCA function, restore intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and reduce dystrophic pathology. Towards this goal, we genetically ablated SLN expression in mouse models of DMD. Preliminary studies suggest that reduction in SLN expression is sufficient to improve SERCA function and mitigate DMD. Here, we propose to evaluate the potential mechanisms by which SLN reduction mitigates skeletal muscle pathology and cardiomyopathy in mouse models of DMD. In addition, we propose to determine whether targeting SLN expression mitigate DMD in preclinical settings. We will specifically test the following hypotheses: 1) SLN overexpression limits skeletal muscle regeneration in DMD, 2) Reduction in SLN expression can improve cardiac SERCA function and prevent cardiomyopathy, and 3) Postnatal AAV mediated SLN gene silencing therapy can ameliorate DMD. The outcomes of these studies will identify SLN as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of DMD and associated cardiomyopathy."
"9321948","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the importance of fruits and vegetables (FV) as essential components of a healthy diet, most children do not consume the recommended number of servings of these foods. School meals account for a significant portion of children's overall dietary intake and play a major role in reducing food insecurity, a problem paradoxically linked with pediatric obesity. Changing the school nutritional environment is a cost-efficient and effective method for improving dietary intake and can significantly impact the pernicious problem of pediatric obesity. The 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) mandated enhanced focus on FV in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and specifically requires children to take a fruit and/or vegetable at meals (the ?serve? model). However, there are significant concerns over increased FV plate waste under this mandate. Simultaneously, there is also great national support for school salad bars as a means to increase FV intake within the NSLP. Salad bars might be a particularly effective approach within the ?serve? model, as they foster choice, which is linked to increased FV consumption in children. However, little empirical research has investigated the impact of salad bars on FV intake in schools. Further, although FV consumption can facilitate healthy weight management if these foods replace items high in calories, there is a great need to better understand how increasing FV intake relates to children's overall diet quality and obesity risk. This is particularly important to investigate in low income and racial/ethnic minority children, who face disproportionate obesity risks and are most likely to be impacted by school obesity policies, such as the HHFKA, given their reliance on school meals. In this application, two matched, randomly selected Title 1 elementary schools, serving predominately African American and Hispanic children will be selected; one school has a salad bar (Intervention) and one serves proportioned FV only, standard under the revised NSLP (Control). Under the Community Eligibility Provision of the HHFKA, 100% of students are eligible to receive free meals. We will conduct plate waste assessments (~1600 meals over 4 days) and compare FV selection and consumption between schools. Further, given the unclear role of FV in obesity prevention, we will also conduct nutrition analyses to investigate if higher FV intake displaces calories from other sources, thus informing obesity prevention efforts. Results will make a significant contribution to obesity policy research by investigating the effectiveness of efforts aimed at increasing FV intake within the serve model, standard under the NSLP. Results will also inform related nutrition policies aimed at alleviating pediatric obesity. Data will inform a larger trial related to enhancing the effectiveness of the NSLP under the HHFKA. No prior studies have examined the effects of salad bars on FV and caloric intake in students attending schools with universal free meals, a setting with a powerful role in children's dietary intake. As such, this study has the potential to inform school nutrition policies and programming designed to enhance dietary intake in students at high obesity risk."
"9318458","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The inability to achieve sufficient intratumoral concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs in is one of the primary causes of treatment failure in patients with glioblastoma. We have shown in a Phase 1 clinical trial that a topoisomerase inhibitor, topotecan, can be safely and effectively delivered by convection enhanced delivery into patients with recurrent malignant gliomas as a means of overcoming systemic delivery limitations. In this proposal, we will improve this treatment strategy by validating an innovative method for non-invasive monitoring of drug distribution and expanding the duration of infusion by innovating the use of an implantable microinfusion pump. At the conclusion of these studies, the expected outcome will be a novel, measureable strategy to treat patients with recurrent glioblastoma via an implantable pump that can chronically deliver high doses of topotecan into the tumor and surrounding brain to avoid the limitations imposed by conventional systemic delivery. On a broader level, we will have demonstrated, for the first time in humans, the ability to chronically achieve a local-regional distribution of a drug directly into the brain parenchyma."
"9540182","The overall goals of the Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer (YSPORE) are to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of melanomas by performing translational studies in four subjects: a) (Genomic sunlight dosimeters for melanoma prevention (Project 1); b) The B7-H1/PD-1 pathway in melanoma immunity (Project 2); c) Molecular diversity of melanomas and response to targeted (Project 3); and d) The RACil pathway as a target for melanoma therapy (Project 4). The program includes Developmental Research and Career Development Programs, Biospecimen Resource and Bioinformatics/Biostatistics Cores that support the translational research needs of all investigators in the YSPORE. The YSPORE is led by an Administration Core that coordinates and manages the program on a daily basis. One of the overriding themes of the YSPORE is to reveal biomarkers and targets for therapy based on Information from Next-Generation (Next-Gen) DNA sequencing, genomics and proteomics analyses. This approach will be used to identify: 1) regions of the genome that are sensitive indicators of long-term accumulation of DNA damage and mutations resulting from sunlight exposure; and 2) the molecular basis of resistance of melanomas to targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). We will use structure function analyses to identify druggable targets in resistant cells (Project 3) and in a novel RAC1 pathway that we have identified in melanoma (Project 4). Project 2 is dedicated to one of the most promising immunotherapy for melanoma, anti PD-1, and is focused on tumor/stroma interactions to reveal mechanism of evasion of cancer immunity. The studies in this project should have direct impact for current development of B7-H1/PD-1 blockade as a novel and promising approach for melanoma therapy. The expected translational outcomes of the program are: 1) Development of biological indicators for sun exposure risk to be used in melanoma prevention; 2) The identification of predictive biomarkers for therapeutic blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and the role of this pathway in resistance to other types of immunotherapy, leading to potentially more effective combination immunotherapy; 3) The development of molecular tests that will guide treatment for BRAFi; 4) The classification of melanoma according to therapeutic options based on mutations in 'driver' pathway; 5) identification of small molecule that can target the RAC1 pathway; 6) The implementation of new national initiatives such as the CaTISSUE, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the MRF National Consortium for melanoma clinical trials."
"9387018","Project Summary/Abstract Despite the high incidence of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion in youth, there are no standardized evidence-based treatments available and there is a dearth of trials examining early treatment approaches. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop highly usable management strategies to support recovery. To address this need, we propose to develop and assess an innovative, gamified mobile learning environment (GMLE) for youth with mTBI to promote real-time symptom self-management and self-efficacy that is not possible with traditional, intermittent medical follow-up. Youth are the ideal targets for an eMedicine approach due to their risk of persistent symptoms, aptitude for technology, and advancing independence with increasing personal efficacy. Despite successful application of self-management principles to several chronic conditions, there are no current reports of a program designed to facilitate active problem solving and self- management in youth with mTBI. As a prototype, we will use our recently developed web-based program, Self- Management Activity-regulation and Relaxation Training (SMART), which integrates real-time self-monitoring of symptoms and activities (from patient web-based entry) with modules designed to increase self-efficacy through psychoeducation and training in problem solving/problem-focused coping strategies. In the first phase, we will incorporate feedback from prior work and input from a collaborative design team to transform the original SMART prototype into a GMLE. Planned modifications include an avatar-based pedagogical agent to act as a virtual coach and digital badging to incentivize completion. Following usability testing and iterative refinements, in the second phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial involving 100 youth with mTBI, ages 11 to 18, and their parents to assess safety and feasibility, and estimate effects on coping and psychological functioning as compared to usual care. Outcomes will be assessed at weekly intervals over a month timeframe following baseline via online links. We hypothesize that participants receiving SMART will report high usability and satisfaction with the program and no adverse effects. We further hypothesize that participants in the SMART intervention group will report higher levels of active coping, greater self-efficacy, sense of well-being, and quality of life and lower levels of distress than those receiving usual care. Exploratory analyses will examine group differences in post-concussive symptom resolution over time. Given the lack of evidence-based interventions to promote self-management and recovery following pediatric mTBI, this study targets a critical social and scientific concern. Findings from this study will inform subsequent larger scale trials that could ultimately transform management of pediatric mTBI."

"9395979","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main goal of this research proposal is to identify the functional contribution of cellular oxygen sensing mechanisms through prolylhydroxylases (PHD1-3)1 to renal protection from acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and novel treatment options are urgently needed2. Renal ischemia is a very common cause of AKI3. Therefore, we established a murine model of renal ischemia to induce AKI4-7. This model allows us to examine pharmacologic or genetic approaches to identify novel treatment forms for AKI.During renal ischemia, shifts in the metabolic supply and demand ratio - particularly for oxygen - result in severe tissue hypoxia. Cellular responses to hypoxia are regulated by enzymes that sense cellular oxygen levels and coordinate transcriptional responses to hypoxia or ischemia. Central among these enzymes are three oxygen sensing prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3). Limited oxygen availability results in inhibition of PHDs with subsequent stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Activation of HIFs drives a transcriptional response that steers cellular metabolism towards hypoxia adaptation and survival. Thus, we hypothesized that genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of PHDs mediates kidney protection from ischemia. To pursue this hypothesis, we exposed gene-targeted mice for Phd1, Phd2 or Phd3 to AKI and assessed renal function by measuring GFR or histology. Surprisingly, we found a selective phenotype in Phd1-/- mice with remarkable protection from ischemic AKI. To gain mechanistic insight into how Phd1 deletion protects the kidneys from ischemia, we performed microarray studies. The most profound difference in gene expression was an over 10 fold repression of Atp4a, when comparing ischemic kidneys from Phd1-/- mice with controls. Subsequent studies with pharmacologic ATP4A inhibitors mimicked the kidney protection from ischemia seen in Phd1-/- mice, and highlight a novel function for ATP4A inhibitors in conserving renal energy levels during ischemic AKI. Therefore, we will define the contribution of PHD1 expressed in renal epithelia to kidney protection from AKI, utilizing mice with tisue specific Phd1 deletion (Aim1). We will go on to dissect the role of HIFs in PHD- mediated ATP4A repression during ischemia (Aim 2), and finally study functional consequences of Atp4a deletion/inhibition in kidney protection from AKI (Aim 3). We believe these studies are highly significant for the treatment of patients suffering from ischemic AKI. PHD inhibitors and inhibitors for proton pumps (e.g. esomeprazole) are used clinically for the treatment of acid reflux. They efficiently inhibit renal ATP4A and have a great safety profile. If successful, our findings could be readily translated into the clinical treatment of AKI."
"9325846","PROJECT SUMMARY: RNA repair pathways rely on RNA ligases to maintain or manipulate RNA structure in response to purposeful breakage events inflicted during physiological RNA processing (e.g. tRNA splicing; mRNA editing) and under conditions of cellular stress (e.g., virus infection, unfolded protein response). The goal of this project is to illuminate the mechanisms and structures of enzymes that repair broken RNA ends. Our proposed studies embrace two RNA repair systems that exploit ATP-dependent RNA ligases. (1) Fungal and plant tRNA ligases are essential for tRNA splicing and for mRNA splicing during in the unfolded protein response. A multifunctional tRNA ligase enzyme heals and seals the ends of the tRNA exons via the sequential action of 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiesterase, 5' polynucleotide kinase, and ATP-dependent RNA ligase catalytic domains. The defining feature of fungal/plant tRNA ligases is their requirement for a 2'-PO4 to synthesize a 3'-5' phosphodiester bond. The structural basis for this requirement is uncharted. Because mammals rely on a completely different biochemical pathway of tRNA exon splicing, and mammalian proteomes have no homologs of the fungal ligase domain, we regard fungal tRNA ligases as promising targets for antifungal drug discovery. To advance that end, we propose to structurally characterize the catalytic domains of tRNA ligases from several fungal species, including the human pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, and Coccidioides immitis. (2) Naegleria gruberi RNA ligase (NgrRnl), is the founder of a new family of RNA nick-sealing enzymes ? found in bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa ? in which a nucleotidyltransferase module (common to all ATP- dependent ligases) is fused to a signature N-terminal module not found in any other RNA ligase clade. Our structures of the NgrRnl·ATP·(Mn2+)2 Michaelis complex and the NgrRnl-(lysyl-N)?AMP·Mn2+ covalent intermediate suggest a two-metal mechanism of ligase adenylylation. We will use these structures to guide functional studies of the ligase reaction mechanism. To understand the basis for nick recognition and phosphodiester synthesis, we propose to capture structures of NgrRnl in complexes with nicked duplex substrates."
"9339481","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Psychosis occurs in 40-60% of subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD) and contributes to increased costs of caring for Veterans with AD. Current efforts to treat psychosis in AD with medications used for similar symptoms in patients without dementia have largely failed, potentially because of lack of biologic specificity. Importantly, three independent replications have found that psychosis in AD is familial, with an estimated heritability of 61%. Current genetic data support a model in which genetic variants that increase the risk for AD do so equally in AD subjects with or without psychosis. Additional variants increase the risk for psychosis, contingent on the development of AD, with the most rapid increase in onset of psychosis in early to middle stages of AD. The genetic variants for psychosis in AD overlap with those that contribute to psychosis risk in schizophrenia. Numerous studies have found that AD subjects with psychosis (AD+P) have more rapid cognitive decline, preceding psychosis onset, than AD subjects without psychosis (AD-P). Because synapse loss is the strongest correlate of cognitive decline in AD, greater synapse loss is thus likely to underlie the AD+P phenotype. The emerging picture of AD indicates that loss of dendritic spines and their synapses are driven by soluble oligomeric amyloid beta (A?) species. Soluble A?-induced spine loss depends on phosphoTau (pTau) and engages molecular mediators of synaptic plasticity, resulting in depletion of glutamate receptors (GluR, NMDAR) from the post-synaptic density (PSD). During the initial funding interval we evaluated AD-P and AD+P subjects for brain levels of kalirin protein, a RAC/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor with critical roles in dendritic spine maintenance and growth. These properties, and evidence of kalirin's association with psychosis risk in schizophrenia, made it a strong candidate molecule for psychosis in AD. In Braak stage 3-5 subjects, kalirin-9, and kalirin-12 were selectively reduced in AD+P. Reductions in kalirin-7 were present in both AD-P and AD+P, but markedly accelerated in AD+P. These reductions occurred despite soluble A?1-42:A?1-40 ratios that did not differ between AD+P and AD-P subjects in these stages. However, a number of critical questions remain. Kalirin-7, -9, and -12 are found in PSD fractions, however, -9 and -12 have significant expression in other compartments. Thus, determining which isoforms contribute to pathology in AD+P requires evaluating compartmental-specific expression. Although kalirin reduction is known to deplete PSD GluR1, NMDAR2B, and cause spine loss, it is not known if reduced kalirin accelerates these effects in the presence of increased soluble A?. Conversely, we and others have shown that increased expression of kalirin- 7 and -9 increases spine density. However, whether increased kalirin expression can protect against A?-induced spine loss is also unknown. We now propose to address these questions by combining human tissue studies with examination of causal relationships in animal and in vitro models: 1.To quantitate post-synaptic levels of kalirin isoforms in AD+P and AD-P; 2. To compare post-synaptic levels of glutamate receptors in AD+P and AD-P; 3. To determine if kalirin reduction enhances A?-induced spine loss. The proposed studies are highly innovative in their focus on the AD+P phenotype which is clinically important, heritable, and confers liability to a more rapidly progressive course, thus providing a novel approach to discovery of disease modifying mechanisms. Methodologic innovations include: the use of the kalirin knockout mouse developed by our consultant, Dr. Penzes; crossing the kalirin mouse with a PSAPP model of A? overproduction, and; the use of LC-SRM/MS quantification. Findings from the proposed studies will provide the basis for future studies assessing the specific pathways downstream of kalirin, and whether in vivo interventions to increase kalirin signaling may prevent or reverse A?-induced impairments in spines. Ultimately, elucidating these mechanisms may lead to cognitive and behavioral benefits for Veterans with AD+P."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a progressive and tiered training program that will develop researchers and research teams able to carry out the research agenda in the linked UO1 application (1/2 - GEOHealth Hub for Research and Training in eastern Africa - Ethiopia) and to facilitate the translation of the evidence into impactful actions. The training program will be implemented in collaboration with Addis Ababa University (AAU) in Ethiopia, the Hub institution for the linked application; the Spoke institutions are in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The training program will build the competencies needed to address the research themes identified as most critical in the Situational Analysis and Needs Assessments (SANA) carried out during the planning phase: indoor and outdoor air pollution as the leading theme; occupational health, particularly in regard to temperature and air pollution, and climate change and health as secondary themes. The team assembled for the U2R application includes experienced researchers and educators from the University of Southern California and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-M), both groups having collaborated with AAU previously. The SANAs document a shared need across the Hub and Spokes for enhanced research capacity, along with skills in policy translation in the domestic and regional context. Our approach responds to these broad needs and involves a tiered training program that will create scientific leaders (Lead Scientists) at the national level who can function as principal investigators for research that provides evidence relevant to national and regional issues. They will also be expected to take leadership for locally developed training and to help to assure sustainability. Three cohorts of four will be identified and trained. Beyond these national leads, we anticipate a broad array of shorter-term training opportunities that will prepar the research teams to address the thematic areas of the Hub's research program. The national lead investigators will play a collaborative and progressive role in the design and implementation of the national and regional training initiatives. Given the feasibility restraints posed by financial resources, distance, and the need to integrate training into the ongoing responsibilities of trainees, we plan to use a flexible array of educational modalities that will include stays of limited length at USC and the UW-M; in-country workshops and short courses; distance-based approaches that are both asynchronous and synchronous; and use of selected local courses, e.g., in epidemiology or biostatistics. We will also use innovative approaches to facilitate translation that involve education and engagement of stakeholders. Evaluation will track the success of the participants in meeting their development goals on the short-term and, for the longer-term, successful completion of the proposed research, scientific presentations and papers, and successful funding applications. Through careful case-studies, we will examine the impact of the trainees on policy indicators, such as new air quality standards and guidelines, regulations, and changes in practices."
"9397137","Project Summary Unnatural amino acids, by virtue of unique chemical or physical properties not found in the standard twenty amino acids, can bestow novel properties to the proteins into which they are incorporated. Thus, technologies that enable their incorporation have been developed, and unnatural amino acids have found widespread use in the development of novel protein therapeutics. However, existing methods of unnatural amino acid incorporation have limitations that arise from the fact that they all repurpose the natural genetic code. We hypothesize that orthogonal expansion of the genetic code through the introduction of a third, unnatural base pair (UBP), and subsequent use of this third base pair to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins, will circumvent these limitations. The development of a semi-synthetic organism (SSO) capable of replicating, transcribing, and translating UBPs to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins is the central goal of this proposal. In specific aim 1, mechanisms that enforce UBP retention will be examined. Specific aim 2 will explore the UBP-mediated incorporation of NCAAs using orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pairs in E. coli. Lastly, specific aim 3 will examine the translational efficiency and fidelity of all 96 possible new codons containing a single UBP. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the fundamental processes that underlie information storage and retrieval in living organisms. Furthermore, the proposed work has the potential to revolutionize the field of protein therapeutics by providing a robust platform for the incorporation of one or more unnatural amino acids into proteins."
"9339514","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Obesity and its co-morbidities cause about 400,000 deaths and cost $140 billion per year in USA. In veteran patients, obesity is even more prevalent with over 75% of patients overweight or obese. However, currently available therapies are either ineffective or with significant risks o morbidities and mortality.  In this project we propose a method of intestinal electrical stimulatio (IES) for treating obesity. Preliminary data have suggested a therapeutic potential of IES for obesity, attributed to its accelerative effect on intestinal transit that leads to reduced absorptin and its effects on peripheral and central hormones/peptides that lead to reduced food intake. To make the IES therapy more potent and practical, we further propose 1) a synchronized IES method (SIES) that has been shown to improve intestinal contractions and is therefore more potent in speeding up intestinal transit; 2) an automatic food intake detection method with which IES/SIES can be delivered automatically upon food ingestion. Our long-term goal is to prove the clinical application of the proposed SIES/IES method for treating obesity. The major objectives of this project are to {optimize IES methodology such that it is most potent in producing weight loss without inducing side-effects, to prove the safety and efficacy of chronic IES/SIES and to explore multiple mechanisms involving gastrointestinal motility and hormones, and central satiety neurons and satiety/appetite-related peptides in diet- induced obese (DIO) rats (a well-established rodent model of human obesity).}  {The first series of experiments will be performed in DIO rats to derive best stimulation parameters for IES and best stimulation configuration and best treatment regimen. The second series of experiments are designed to prove that chronic IES/SIES is safe and effective in producing weight loss and improving metabolisms in DIO rats. The third part of the project is to explore multiple mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effect o IES on body weight. Experiments are designed to prove the primary hypothesis that IES reduces body weight by decreasing nutrient absorption via acceleration of intestinal transit. Experiments will also be performed to study the secondary mechanisms associated with satiety signaling, including gastrointestinal hormones, central neuronal responses and central satiety/appetite-related peptides. Advanced technologies will be used for all experiments such that the IES treatment could be given under normal physiological conditions with no or little stress effects. } A comprehensive and competitive team has been assembled with expertise in electrical stimulation, gastrointestinal motility, obesity, surgery, basic laboratory research and statistics. The accomplishment of this project will enhance our understanding on the effects and mechanisms of IES and may lead to a novel therapy for obesity."
"9388011","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal requests funding for a phase IIa clinical trial of rifampin, an FDA-approved antibiotic, for safety and efficacy as a treatment for idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH). IIH is an uncommon metabolic condition characterized by elevated plasma levels of the activated form of vitamin D, calcitriol, and consequently increased intestinal absorption of calcium that leads to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Although IIH typically presents in infancy, patients manifest a life-long defect in vitamin D metabolism that results in hematuria, renal calcification, and renal insufficiency. Biallelic inactivating mutations of CYP24A1, the gene encoding the 24- hydroxylase enzyme that represents the principal pathway for inactivation of vitamin D metabolites, cause the most common and severe form of IIH. The loss of this degradative pathway allows plasma levels of calcitriol to rise excessively and overcomes negative feedback mechanisms that should downregulate production of calcitriol. There is at present no specific long-term treatment for patients with CYP24A1 mutations and IIH, and conventional care consists of minimizing sunlight exposure, a low calcium diet, and avoidance of vitamin D-rich foods and vitamin D supplements, but this approach does not reduce the risk of renal calcification and renal insufficiency. Thus, there is a significant unmet medical need for safe and effective treatments for this disorder. We have compelling data supporting a novel therapeutic approach that repurposes rifampin to induce expression of CYP3A4, an enzyme that is expressed in the liver and intestine and when over expressed provides an alternative pathway for inactivation of vitamin D metabolites. The long-term goal of this project is to use knowledge of enzymatic pathways that regulate vitamin D metabolism to develop novel strategies for medical treatment of patients with IIH and other forms of hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis that are associated with elevated plasma levels of calcitriol. The objective in this application is to determine the optimal safe and effective dose of rifampin that normalizes serum and urine levels of calcium and reduces intestinal absorption of calcium (primary outcomes). Our complementary goals are to evaluate the extent to which these primary outcomes are related to plasma levels of rifampin, induction of CYP3A4, polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene, and changes in plasma levels of vitamin D metabolites. Our central hypothesis is that induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin will reduce levels of calcitriol, in the plasma and/or intestine, and thereby decrease intestinal absorption of calcium. We expect that overall benefits will be strongly associated with the extent of CYP3A4 induction. Our secondary aim is to use our results to drive a clinical trials simulator that will inform our development of a protocol for a larger, Phase IIb pivotal trial of rifampin for IIH. We have access to the necessary study subjects and the expertise and resources to pursue these studies. Our approach is innovative because it proposes to repurpose a well-characterized and safe medication to a new role as a primary therapy for a disorder that currently lacks an effective treatment."
"9344439","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed CDU-CRECD Mentored Postdoctoral Training in Translational Research and Biomedical Informatics Program at Charles R. Drew University (CDU) is a mentored clinical research and career development program designed to develop a diverse cadre of clinical and translational investigators who conduct innovative research on the underlying causes of diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations in the United States (e.g., cancer, drug use and addiction, and mental health/psychiatric disorders), and to foster and facilitate professional development activities in clinical and translational sciences. Over the proposed 5-year program period, the CDU-CRECD Program will accept a total of 12 minority postdoctoral trainees at the junior faculty level at CDU. Phase I is comprised of two years of structured mentoring and support for earning a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Urban Health Disparities with a dual focus on the fields of Biomedical Informatics and Community Participatory Clinical Translational Research. Phase II is comprised of a clinical/translational research project to continue working toward establishing their own independent research program as clinical research scientists leading to applications for individual mentored career development (K) or research grant (R series) awards. The CRECD Program will be embedded within the existing, extensive clinical research and training infrastructure at CDU, and thus will mutually leverage resources with other CDU research education and career development programs so as to achieve maximal cross-program synergies as well as efficiencies from utilizing already-in-place education and training curricula and related resources germane to the CRECD agenda. The CRECD Program will also carve out a unique niche of training and career development opportunities within the broader CDU science- generating ?critical mass? by (1) focusing exclusively on urban health disparities and mastery of biomedical informatics and community-partnered participatory methods in the research and research training agenda and (2) providing to each trainee an intensive and community-immersive mentoring configuration that includes CDU faculty from both the conventional Academic Career track and the Community Faculty track. This intensive mentoring innovation directly emerges from, and formalizes and systematizes into a signature trainee mentoring configuration, a long and fruitful history of community-engaged research, training, and educational curricula at CDU. As an integrated research training and career development package, this approach is designed to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of molecular and clinical research. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the impact of community-academic partnered research through comprehensive dissemination of research findings so as to encourage and facilitate implementation of evidence-based treatment and prevention practices within health care organizations and the communities most in need of reliable access to high-quality care."
"9513871","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of the lifespan, from development through aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female- specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Each of the two Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interests. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either their known higher incidence and/or differential expression in women than men and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers. By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we believe that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health."
"9546468","DESCRIPTION:   Meprin ? and ß are members of a superfamily of metzincin proteases implicated in systemic sclerosis. Studies indicate that the overexpression of Meprin ? and ß is correlated with increase deposition of fibrillar collagens in skin and other organs and tissues. This can potentially lead to kidney, lung, and heart fibrosis and eventual failure and death.  The main obstacle in studying Meprin ? and ß role in systemic sclerosis is the lack of selective inhibitors. Most of the Meprin ? and ß inhibitors developed to date feature Zn-binding moieties that target the active site Zn. There are approximately 70 known human metalloproteases that have Zn in their active site, which leads to an off-target toxicity of Zn-binding inhibitors.  Base on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that Meprin ? and ß selective inhibitors will be effective research tools in systemic sclerosis where Meprin ? and ß are implicated. There are currently no publicly available selective inhibitors of Meprin ? and ß metalloproteases.  The overall aim of this project is to develop selective inhibitors of Meprin ? and ß. The specific aims of this proposal will focus on (1) HTS of the Scripps library which consists of > 640,000 compounds; (2) Medicinal chemistry and in vitro characterization of selective probes of Meprin ? and ß.  Our laboratory is uniquely positioned to achieve these goals due to expertise in biology, biochemistry and drug/probe discovery for metalloproteases. We discovered a novel class of metalloprotease ADAM17 inhibitors that spare its closest analogue, ADAM10, and most common anti-targets (MMP-14 and -8). To our knowledge, we are the first laboratory to report ADAM17 inhibitors with such unique selectivity. Additionally, we discovered novel selective non-zinc-binding inhibitors of another metalloprotease, MMP-13 implicated in osteoarthritis. Most germane to the present proposal, both discoveries were made utilizing HTS either of NIH or TPIMS libraries in close collaboration with Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (co-headed by Dr. Scampavia and Mr. Spicer) and Dr. Fields. We strongly believe that HTS of Scripps library will result in discovery of much needed first-in-class selective inhibitors of Meprin ? and ß. We will also collaborate with experts in the fields of peptide synthesis, HTS, and medicinal chemistry.  Our expected outcome is a clear understanding of the role of Meprin ? and ß in systemic sclerosis, which will lead to a more comprehensive knowledge about the mechanisms that regulate its progression and potentially result in the development of novel therapies."
"9503274","ABSTRACT: Modulation of RUNX2 Activity by ER? in Osteoblasts The bone-sparing properties of estrogens are mediated by ER? in a variety of cell types, including cells of the osteoblast and osteoclast lineages, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, there are contrasting reports on how estradiol (E2) affects RUNX2, an osteoblast master regulator that has been implicated in human bone mass control through GWAS. RUNX2 plays critical roles in the osteoblast lineage to stimulate both autonomous cellular differentiation (and thus bone formation) and osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis (and thus bone resorption). While this project initiated with a focus on inhibition of RUNX2 by E2, the present renewal application aims to take genome-wide approaches to understand why E2 does not inhibit RUNX2-driven transcription uniformly. We show that RUNX2 activity upon various targets is modulated differently, with most targets inhibited, but others not inhibited and some even cooperatively stimulated, to various extents, by RUNX2 and E2. Locus-dependent differential modulation of RUNX2 is expected to ultimately change the balance between RUNX2-mediated osteoblast differentiation and RUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis. Our preliminary data also demonstrate that both raloxifen and lasofoxifene poorly mimic E2 in modulating activity of RUNX2 at different loci. Mechanisms underlying the locus- and ligand-dependent modulation of RUNX2 by ER? are completely unknown. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that ER? differentially modulates RUNX2 across the osteoblast genome depending on local relative positions of sites occupied by RUNX2 and ER? and the ER ligand. Additionally, we hypothesize that local collaborating transcription factors (TFs), as well as specific cognate motif sequences for RUNX2, ER? and collaborating TFs shape local effects of ER? on RUNX2. We will first investigate by ChIP-seq analysis of histone marks how E2 modulates RUNX2-driven changes to the chromatin activation status at every genomic locus. The mutual effects of ER? and RUNX2 on occupying their target loci will also be determined genome-wide by ChIP-seq. Computational models will then be developed to explain the locus-specific combinatorial transcriptional regulation by RUNX2 and ER?. These models will be tested, first computationally and then experimentally, for their ability to predict effects of E2 on RUNX2 activity. Finally, since ER? in pre-osteoblasts protects female cortical bone in mice, and since raloxifen and lasofoxifene, SERMs commonly prescribed in the US and in Europe, respectively, only reduce the risk for vertebral (predominantly trabecular) osteoporotic fractures, but not non-vertebral fractures, we will also decode how raloxifene- and lasofoxifene-bound ER? modulate RUNX2 activity genome wide. Principal genomic determinants will be identified, which explain the differential modulation of RUNX2 activity as a function of the locus (different targets) and the ligand (E2 vs. raloxifen vs. lasofoxifene). This project will help understand how E2 differentially modulates RUNX2 activity at different loci to potentially alter the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Gene sets will be identified where SERMs mimic, or do not mimic E2. While unveiling the underlying genomic codes, tools will be generated for future investigation of how E2, or any SERM, modulate RUNX2 activity at prototypic loci to differentially regulate specific gene sets."
"9322553","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the rapidly increasing capacity to sequence human genomes, our incomplete ability to read and interpret the information content in genomes and epigenomes remain a central challenge. A comprehensive set of regulatory events across a genome - the regulome - is needed to make full use of genomic information, but is currently out of reach for practically all clinical applications and many biological systems The proposed Center will develop technologies that greatly increase the sensitivity, speed, and comprehensiveness of understanding genome regulation. We will develop new technologies to interrogate the transactions between the genome and regulatory factors, such as proteins and noncoding RNAs, and integrate variations in DNA sequences and chromatin states over time and across individuals. Novel molecular engineering and biosensor strategies are deployed to encapsulate the desired complex DNA transformations into the probe system, such that the probe system can be directly used on very small human clinical samples and capture genome-wide information in one or two steps. These technologies will be applied to clinical samples and workflows in real time to exercise their robustness and reveal for the first time epigenomic dynamics of human diseases during progression and treatment. These technologies will be broadly applicable to many biomedical investigations, and the Center will disseminate the technologies via training and diverse means."
"9359953","PROJECT SUMMARY: At present, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects 5 million in the US alone, with numbers projected to double by 2050. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and there are no disease-modifying therapies. Biomarkers ? objective measures of physiological of pathophysiological states ? can accelerate therapeutic development by making clinical trials more targeted and more efficient. However, successful biomarker development requires availability of biosamples from well-characterized patient populations, attention to detail in sample collection and handling, and quality control (QC) for sources of preanalytical variability. The recently-renewed Penn ADCC follows a longstanding clinical cohort of cognitively normal subjects, subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), patients with early AD, and patients with AD related diseases (ADRD), numbering 500 individuals total. We propose to form a stand-alone Biomarker Core (Core G) to augment efforts of the existing 6 Penn ADCC cores by creating a systematic resource for biofluid samples, an accompanying set of baseline biochemical data, and QC tools to enable biomarker discovery. To do this, we propose four specific aims.  ? SPECIFIC AIM 1: Oversee and direct all banking and dispersal of biofluid samples from Clinical  Core B. These biofluids will consist of CSF, plasma, and serum collected at each visit.  ? SPECIFIC AIM 2: Characterize biochemical biomarkers previously reported in the literature to  confirm diagnosis of AD, predict outcome in early (or prodromal) stages of AD, indicate target  engagement with an experimental therapeutic, or monitor disease progression. Specific markers that will  be assayed in all 500 ADCC Clinical Core subjects at baseline include CSF A?1-42, CSF t-tau, and CSF  p-tau181, CSF neurofilament light chain (NF-L), CSF ferritin, plasma NF-L, plasma epidermal growth  factor (EGF). Moreover, biochemical biomarkers emerging from early investigations in ADNI (such as  CSF total and phospho-?-SYN, neurogranin, and Vilip1), may be incorporated if data from ADNI appears  sufficiently promising.  ? SPECIFIC AIM 3: Create and maintain reference pools of CSF, plasma, and serum samples from  the ADCC Clinical Core cohort as well as cohorts of patients with ADRD from other Penn clinics, making  them available to investigators within the ADCC, and throughout the wider AD research community.  ? SPECIFIC AIM 4: Create biomarker readouts for quality of sample handling from protein profiles  obtained from systematic sample perturbations. We will leverage separately-funded investigations in  which replicate plasma aliquots are systematically perturbed (left at room temperature, subjected to  freeze-thaw) prior to interrogation on an aptamer-based platform for >1000 protein analytes. Through  these separately-funded investigations, we will be able to identify many protein candidates that change in  a predictable way with these systematic perturbations. In this Aim, we will develop assays for these  candidate proteins, creating ?readouts? for poor sample handling."
"9319819","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women in South Africa have an annual HIV incidence of 6-10% and are a high priority group for combination HIV prevention, including HIV testing, condoms and risk reduction counseling, partner HIV testing, modest cash transfers and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP has demonstrated efficacy (44-75% in randomized trials, >90% with high adherence) and is user-controlled, yet young African women in two blinded, placebo-controlled trials of PrEP had very low adherence, resulting in no demonstrated effectiveness in the context of very high HIV incidence. These results raise key questions for HIV prevention in women about perception of low HIV acquisition risk, lack of motivation in a placebo-controlled trial, barriers to taking a daily pill, partner support or lack, or low interestin HIV prevention. Programs that deliver combination prevention to young South African women need a better understanding of what motivates them to use combination prevention, how they recognize their risk, evaluate evidence and apply this to adoption of prevention strategies. We will conduct formative research about how women understand their risks and the role of intimate partners, which we hypothesize, are central determinants of intention, motivation, adoption of and adherence to HIV prevention strategies. We will use complimentary frameworks of the Information-Motivations-Behavior (IMB) skills model for qualitative inquiry and behavioral economics (BE) for quantitative approaches to identify levers to change prevention decisions and develop practical messaging and interventions. We will use qualitative methods and experimental HIV risk vignette surveys among young HIV-negative women in Cape Town, South Africa to assess risk perception and motivations to adopt HIV prevention interventions. Findings will inform development of a pilot intervention designed to provide proof of concept that an intervention based on better communication about risk and partner engagement facilitates uptake of combination prevention including PrEP, and a short-lived modest cash incentive conditional on presence of detectable PrEP drug levels, will enhance persistent adherence among women initiating PrEP. The intervention to improve HIV risk evaluation and partner involvement for HIV prevention adoption, including CCI for PrEP adherence, will be evaluated in a cohort of 100 HIV-negative women in Cape Town. Our Specific Aims are to: Aim 1: Conduct formative research about male partners, related social factors and motivators that facilitate young South African women's uptake of and adherence to HIV prevention. Aim 2: Pilot strategies for testing the partners of young South African women and evaluate whether partner testing is associated with uptake of prevention by women. Aim 3: Implement a prevention intervention among young South African women using research findings about risk evaluation and other motivators and assess whether these interventions together with short-term CCI will enhance PrEP uptake and adherence in the presence or absence of partner involvement. These knowledge gaps must be addressed for future trials of biomedical prevention strategies and implementation of combination prevention with effective interventions for young African women."
"9340914","Summary  This Phase 1 SBIR study aims to provide primary care practitioners (general internists, family physicians, geriatricians, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners) with a prototype of Wise Drinking for Aging Patients, an online educational program that is designed to aid clinicians in improving the quality of care they provide to older drinkers. Most primary healthcare practitioners acknowledge that potentially risky alcohol use in older adults is a growing public health problem, but many do not have the knowledge or skills to identify or treat their older drinking patients who are hazardous (at risk for problems) or harmful drinkers (experiencing problems). Older adults can incur alcohol-related risks and problems even at relatively low consumption levels because of metabolic and central nervous system changes. Also, alcohol interacts adversely with many older adults' declining health, increasing medication use, and diminishing functional status. Wise Drinking for Aging Patients will be flexible so that consumers can match their learning style and learning platform (smartphones, tablets, or computers). The educational model will consist of an adaptation of Spaced Education (SE), an evidence-based approach to provider education that presents material entirely in a test-question format. With SE, new information appears when the correct answer is explained and elaborated upon. Typically, a course contains 20 to 40 questions, spread across one to two months. The spacing depends on the learner's answers: an incorrectly answered question might repeat one week later, and a correctly answered one after three weeks. After two consecutive correct answers, a question is retired. The questions in this project will be linked to topics and ?take-home? messages that together constitute knowledge and skills associated with high quality of care for older patients who drink. The messages will be derived from extensive literature and subject-matter expert reviews and the formal consensus of an RAND/UCLA ?Expert? Panel of generalist practitioners and will be tested for feasibility with potential users. The project is consistent with NIAAA's interests in 1) ?the development and evaluation of educational materials designed to intervene with the elderly around specific age-related risks for alcohol problems,? and 2) the development and evaluation of innovative materials for integration into existing programs (such as primary care). The product has commercial potential because with the aging of the population, primary care providers will inevitably care for an increasing number of older drinking patients, and this program will be directly targeted to their practice needs, and they are reimbursed for screening and counseling. The product is innovative in its incorporation of diverse user perspectives, its emphasis on improving quality of care for an underserved but growing population, and its foundation on evidence-based behavioral strategies."
"9330240","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Brain Machine Interfaces (BMIs) allow the nervous system to directly communicate with external devices in order to mitigate deficits associated with neurodegeneration or to drive peripheral prosthetics. There has been substantial progress using penetrating microelectrode arrays and optogenetics strategies; however, these approaches are limited in that they generally rely on placing non-organic electrodes/optrodes into the brain, inevitably leading to an inflammatory foreign body response that ultimately diminishes the quality of the recording and stimulation. In an alternative strategy, we are utilizig advanced micro-tissue engineering techniques to create the first biological living electrodes for chronic BMI. Novel micro-Tissue Engineered Neural Networks (micro-TENNs) serve as the living electrodes, which are composed of discrete population(s) of neurons connected by long axonal tracts within miniature tubular hydrogels. These living micron-scale constructs are able to penetrate the brain to a prescribed depth for integration with local neurons/axons, with the latter portion remaining externalized on the brain surface where functional information is gathered using a next-generation optical and electrical interface. Following transplant into rats, we have previously shown that micro-TENN neurons survive, integrate with local host neurons, and maintain their axonal architecture. These features are exploited in the current proposal to advance living electrodes as a functional relay to and from deep cortical layers. In this radical paradigm, only the biological component of these constructs penetrates the brain, thus attenuating a chronic foreign body response. Moreover, through custom cell and tissue engineering techniques, we may influence the specific host neuronal subtypes with which the micro-TENN neurons form synapses, thereby adding a level of specificity in local stimulation and recoding not currently attainable with conventional microelectrodes. In this proposal, we will utilize electrophysiological, optogenetic, and advanced microscopy techniques to reveal evidence of micro-TENN synaptic integration with brain neural networks and cross-communication with micro-TENN neurons on the cortical surface in rats. These studies will demonstrate the ability of this versatile platform technology to read out local sensorimotor activity and provide input to affect neural activity and function. This will be the first demonstration of tissue engineered living electrodes to functionally integrate into native neural networks and to serve as a conduit for bi-directional stimulation and recording. This potentially transformative technology at the interface of neuroscience and engineering lays the foundation for preformed implantable neural networks as a viable alternative to conventional electrodes."
"9543063","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The leading cause of cancer-associated deaths is tumor metastasis, the ability of the primary tumor to invade distant sites. Thus, an understanding of the underlying mechanism for tumor metastasis, and the factors that control it, is a major challenge studying oncogenesis. Metastasis is a complex involving both tumor-intrinsic factors (genetic or epigenetic alteration to the tumor cells) and extrinsic factors provied by the tumor microenvironment. These extrinsic factors can include cytokines expressed by tumor-associated stromal cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells, changes in the extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor, and alterations in blood and/or lymphatic vessels within the tumor. These factors combine to create a microenvironment that can both promote tumor growth, through the expression of cytokines and the generation of tumor-specific immune suppression (regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells), and the production of factors, such as proteases, capable of breaking down the matrix and allowing the tumor to escape and metastasize. However, it remains unclear how these various processes are regulated. We have found that the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is critically involved in the control of metastatic breast cancer. TSLP expression by both the tumor and the host regulates tumor metastasis; and loss of TSLP, either genetically through gene disruption or via neutralization, dramatically reduces tumor growth and inhibits metastasis. TSLP can also induce the development of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and increase their ability to suppress immune responses. Based on this preliminary data, we propose to: 1. Determine the role of TSLP in tumor growth and metastasis; 2. Identify TSLP-regulated factors that are involved in tumor progression; 3. Determine the role of TSLP in the development and function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These studies will provide important insights into the role of TSLP in metastatic breast cancer, and allow for preclinical evaluation of TSLP blockade as a therapeutic intervention in breast cancer."
"9541037","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells tend to shed flavivirus long after the acute phase has been resolved. In these cells, flavivirus replicates in autophagosomes, which are upregulated by the virus. The mechanism is unknown. We find that Dengue-2 or Modoc (a murine flavivirus) NS4A is the sole viral protein upregulating autophagy, and that autophagy is important to virus replication in epithelial cells. NS4A-induced autophagy protects infected cells against death, a prerequisite for the establishment of viral persistence. We propose to explore how NS4A induces autophagy, increase in viral production, and establishment of persistent infection. We hypothesize that NS4A insertion into the ER induces ER stress, leading to induction of ROS. This increased ROS then activates the ATM pathways, thus downregulating M-TOR and leading to autophagy. Our hypothesis of a linear pathway is certainly oversimplified but starting with a simple model and expanding to incorporate complications will be more productive than attempting a potentially overwhelming analysis. For these investigations we propose to: AIM I: CHARACTERIZE CELLULAR AND VIRAL COMPONENTS LEADING TO AUTOPHAGY AFTER VIRAL INFECTION. We will first ask if what we see with Dengue 2 and NS4A is unique to this strain of Dengue or if NS4A functions similarly in all forms of Dengue. A: Determine if the autophagy and subsequent protection of cells from death produced by Dengue-2 is generalizable to all Dengue strains? B: Identify the domain(s) of Dengue NS4A responsible for inducing autophagy. By finding which part of this molecule is responsible for this induction we can then attempt to block it, thus interfering with the ability of the virus to survive and persist. AIM II: INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH DENGUE INDUCES AUTOPHAGY. Here we will test each step of our hypothesis. We will: A: Confirm the involvement of ATM and M-TOR pathways in NS4A-induced autophagy. B: Establish if NS4A expression leads to ER stress. C: Determine whether NS4A infection leads to ROS production. D: Identify the domain of NS4A responsible for ER stress. E: Use yeast as a complementary model to determine the regulatory pathway involved in NS4A-mediated autophagy. Our findings should lead to an understanding of how flavivirus persists in its host, thus suggesting a target and potential means of reducing viral load and persistence. Furthermore, since we directly examine a means by which autophagy is regulated, these studies should lead to new insights into the means of activating and suppressing autophagy, an important question in cell biology and a potential therapeutic target in many other diseases in which autophagy is critical for cell survival, such as in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer."

"9345650","In spite of resuscitation, hypovolemic shock is responsible for major portion of posttraumatic death. Most of these deaths occur during the first six hours of trauma and many of these deaths are preventable. There is an urgent need for better treatment options in hemorrhagic shock. We pioneered that centhaquin (2-[2-(4-(3-methylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)] ethyl-quinoline) is a highly effective resuscitative agent. It acts on ?2B and ?2A adrenergic receptors with more selectivity towards ?2B adrenergic receptors. We carried out comparative studies between centhaquin and status quo resuscitative agents grouped into 3 different categories: (1) fluids such as Lactated Ringer?s, hypertonic saline; (2) adrenergic agents such as norepinephrine and (3) fresh blood. Our results using (1) a rat model of fixed pressure blood loss, (2) rabbit model of uncontrolled bleeding with trauma, and (3) a pig model of massive blood loss indicate that centhaquin is highly effective in reducing the mortality following hypovolemic shock. Unlike other resuscitative agents (vasopressors) centhaquin increased mean arterial pressure by increasing stroke volume and cardiac output; and decreased heart rate and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The proposed mechanism is that centhaquin (1) acts on venous ?2B adrenergic receptors to produce constriction and increase venous return to the heart; (2) stimulates sodium sense in the brain (through brain ?2B adrenergic receptors) to increase the intravascular blood volume; and (3) stimulates central ?2A adrenergic receptors to produce a decrease in SVR. We have prepared highly pure water soluble (>99.6%) centhaquin citrate and completed chemical and physical characterization studies. Identification, analytical method development and validation for centhaquin have been completed. Stability studies show that centhaquin is stable at 5 ± 3 ºC when stored in amber glass vials for more than 36 months. Toxicological studies, as per OECD guidelines, in mice, rats and rabbits show LD50 >100 mg/kg, 79.43 mg/kg and 9.55 mg/kg, respectively. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (N.O.A.E.L.) of centhaquin in mice, rats and rabbits was found to be 1.0 mg/kg compared to effective dose of 0.01 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate a short half-life in rat and dog. Pharmazz had a type B pre-IND meeting (PIND127938) with the USFDA and received the comments with recommendation to conduct a repeated dose toxicology and toxicokinetics in dogs with at least 3/sex/dose in the main group and 2/sex/dose for the recovery groups. We therefore, plan to conduct toxicity and toxicokinetic studies of centhaquin in Beagle dogs as required by the USFDA. Toxicological and toxicokinetic studies of this novel compound may reveal metabolic pathways and metabolites that are innovative and provide better understanding of the pharmacological actions of centhaquin."
"9318306","The Behavior Science Core includes facilities and expertise from complementary disciplines at the Kennedy  Krieger Institute (KKI): Behavioral Psychology. Neuropsychology, and Motion Analysis. The Behavior Science  Core integrates the combined experience and expertise of these three major resources. The scientists who  utilize the Core work in various disciplines but share a broad focus on research relevant to the effects of  various factors that influence CNS development and functioning. In all of these studies, the objectives of the  investigators are dependent on Behavior Science methods for objectively measuring specific aspects of  performance or behavior. The Behavior Science Core supports these projects by guiding selection of  appropriate measures, training participants to cooperate with testing, assessment and protocol-based  intervention procedures. The Core helps ensure that the methods being employed are appropriate for  addressing project hypotheses as well as for use with the population under study, and that they are  implemented according to best practices. The specific objectives of Core F are to: 1 )Enhance the integrity of  the independent variable in research involving human subjects (especially children and youth) where  cooperation (compliance, adherence) represents a serious confound or barrier to the fidelity with which the  research protocol can be implemented; and, 2) Expand the range and type of dependent variables available to  investigators by providing access to state-of-the-science methods to: (a) objectively quantify behavioral  dependent variables, especially those specific to IDD; (b) identify, track and compare cognitive, behavioral and  developmental characteristics of individuals with genetic and/or medical disorders, syndromes or diagnoses,  (c) track participants' behavioral responses as outcome measures to document response to intervention  approaches, and (d) relate these measurements of behavior, cognition, and motor function to brain structure  and function.  The first objective is achieved by behavioral techniques involving antecedent stimulus control procedures (e.g.,  role playing, re-design of equipment behavioral exposure therapy, counter-conditioning) and contingency-based  shaping procedures (differential reinforcement with music, video, token or point systems, etc.). The  second objective is achieved by the proper selection and use of: a) systematic behavioral, neuropsychological  and motor function assessment procedures, b) direct observation techniques typically employed in behavior  analytic research, c) specific performance tasks designed to assess behavioral, psychological (e.g., cognition,  learning) and human motion variables, and d) systematically relating these behavioral data to neuroimaging  results reflecting brain anatomy and function.  The process by which the Core objectives are achieved involves three phases: (a) development and selection  of appropriate methods, (b) pilot testing, redesign, refinement, and initial implementation by Core staff to  demonstrate feasibility (when previous relevant experience is limited), and, (c) training investigators' staff to  implement the protocols and methods developed and to incorporate them as a standard component of their  research protocols.  For those projects where the science has advanced to the point of testing interventions aimed at ameliorating  the effects of CNS insult on development and functioning, the intervention typically requires training  participants to cooperate with medical interventions (oral medication, respiratory support, pharmacotherapy,  etc.). To ensure the success of these studies, the Core assists investigators with developing environmental  and behavioral interventions to increase participant adherence to the medical protocol. Finally, in order to  validate the benefits of the investigators' intervention protocols, repeated assessment with developmental,  behavioral, neuropsychological, and/or movement measures must be conducted. The Behavior Science Core  collaborates in selecting or developing these procedures, as well as in the analysis and interpretation of the  resulting data."
"9339572","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Androgen deprivation therapy is the standard treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Unfortunately this treatment is only palliative and eventually patients will relapse with castratio resistant tumors, which cause death. Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal activation of androgen receptor (AR) and development of apoptotic resistant cells contribute to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) growth. AR activation in CRPC may occur by a variety of mechanisms that alter the sensitivity or specificity of AR. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate that NF-?B2/p52 (p52) is overexpressed in prostate cancer and overexpression of p52 facilitates CRPC progression through activating AR signaling and protecting cells from apoptotic death induced by androgen deprivation therapy. p52 interacts with and activates the AR under androgen deprived conditions and increases expression of many androgen regulated genes including prostate-specific antigen (PSA). p52-activated AR binds to the distal region, but not the proximal regions of the PSA promoter, whereas, DHT-activated AR binds to both the proximal and distal enhancers of the PSA promoter, suggesting that p52-activated AR is conformationally different from DHT-activated AR. We further demonstrate that p52 decreases the expression of microRNA let-7 and increases the expression of Lin28, a master negative regulator of let-7. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that NF-?B2/p52 plays a critical role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. There are three specific aims of this proposal. 1. Determine the functional roles of p52 in prostate cancer. This aim focuses on defining the role of p52 in AR activation and prostate cancer progression using androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell models that expresses a wild-type AR and p52 in a physiological range. p52 will be inducibly expressed in the androgen-responsive, p52-negative LNCaP and LAPC-4 (expressing wild type AR) human prostate cancer cells to further test the effect of p52 on androgen-mediated prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we will determine the causal role of p52 in prostate cancer development and progression in the established transgenic mouse model. 2. Characterize the p52-activated AR transcriptional com-plexes. ChIP-Seq analysis will be used to perform comprehensive, high-resolution mapping of p52-activated AR genomic recruitment sites and to compare the resulting profile with that of the classical, steroid-activated receptor. 3. Characterize the p52-mediated signaling pathway in prostate cancer. We will determine whether p52 regulates let-7c expression by direct transcriptional repression of its promoter or indirectly via its effect on Lin28, the master regulaor of let-7c processing. We will then determine whether let-7c mediates p52-induction of AR activation through c-myc. We will examine the effects of Lin28/let-7c on p52- mediated prostate cancer cell growth and progression in vitro and in vivo. Completion of these studies will provide the vital role of p52 signaling network in prostate cancer, and will likely present excellent diagnostic and/or prognostic indicators and potential therapeutic targets for prostate cancer."
"9297409","Project Summary / Abstract  This multidimensional project is directed at identifying common etiologic pathways in  three early onset dystonias, DYT1 (torsinA; TOR1A), DYT6 (Thap1; THAP1) and DYT25  (G-alpha-olf; GNAL). A three tier strategy will be employed to: 1) encompass candidates  by expression profiling in human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells  (iPSCs) from patients (Aim 1, Bragg); 2) test candidate modifying genes in a living  organism by RNAi screening of locomotion and dopamine metabolites in dtorsin-null  Drosophila (Aim 2, Ito); and 3) evaluate implicated biologic processes in cultured  neurons from a mouse model of DYT1 and neuronally differentiated iPSCs from patients  (Aim 3, Breakefield). Our unifying hypothesis is that defects in these genes interfere with  neurotransmitter receptor signaling in the brain, especially via acetylcholine and  dopamine, with consequent compromise of synaptic plasticity known to be altered in  DYT1 patients. In the case of DYT1 we hypothesize this results from compromise of the  nuclear egress of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) carrying mRNAs locally transcribed  at synapses; for DYT6 from altered transcription of genes related to synaptic proteins,  and for DYT25 from disruption of G coupled protein receptor signaling through dopamine  receptors. Gene candidates will be further informed by molecular genetic analyses in  dystonia patients (Project 1 and Core B) and by developmental and physiologic analyses  in mouse models of these forms of dystonia (Projects 3). Insights into common pathways  across dystonias will inform therapeutic strategies."
"9356336","Project Summary ? Project 1 In this project we are studying how the communication between brain structures is changed in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, compared to normal control mice. In particular, an important output pathway of the ba- sal ganglia is directed towards the motor cortex. This pathway passes through the ventral motor thalamus be- fore it reaches cortex. The main hypothesis of this research is that processing of basal ganglia signals in motor thalamus is altered in the parkinsonian state. We will address this hypothesis in three specific aims that exam- ine changes in the cellular and signal processing properties of neurons in the motor thalamus in the parkin- sonian condition, using the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model of dopamine depletion in mice. In aim 1 we will analyze in a brain slice preparation which properties of thalamic neurons and synaptic inputs are changed in the parkinsonian condition using electrophysiological intracellular recordings. In aim 2 we will examine with electrophysiological recordings from neurons in the motor thalamus of awake behaving mice whether electrical activity patterns in parkinsonian mice differ from those in control animals during motor behavior. We will also use optogenetic stimulation techniques to trace specific signals along the basal ganglia-thalamocortical route. These stimulation techniques will also be studied with respect to their potential use as counteracting pathologi- cal patterns of activity seen in the parkinsonian animals. Finally, in aim 3, we will synthesize the results from aims 1 and aim 2 by building a detailed computer model of how neurons in the motor thalamus of parkinsonian mice process input from the basal ganglia and how this differs from the normal condition. We will test the validi- ty of this model with accompanying brain slice experiments, in which real neurons are subjected to the same synaptic input patterns that are used in the computer simulations. This allows for a direct comparison between spiking activity patterns generated by the computer model and those seen in recordings.  This research will result in new insights concerning the mechanisms that lead to the expression of patho- logical neural activity patterns in the parkinsonian state. In particular little is known about the involvement of the motor thalamus in the pathophysiology of parkinsonism, and our results will make a substantial contribution to filling this knowledge gap. Further, our research results are expected to inform us about potential new tech- niques of optical deep brain stimulation with a positive effect on thalamic signal integration that could amelio- rate parkinsonian signs and symptoms. Our computer model will be made publicly available and will allow oth- er researchers to improve brain network models of how different pharmacological and deep brain stimulation interventions affect basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry and provide therapeutic function. This project is high- ly synergistic with project 2, which address parkinsonian pathology in the same circuit in a non-human primate system closer to the human disorder, while our rodent studies can provide more mechanistic detail. The ana- tomical studies in project 3 in turn will allow a close comparison of rodent and primate circuitry."

The Administrative Core will serve as the organization and  communication center for the proposed Udall Center. There are three Specific Aims for the Administrative  Core. In Aim 1, the Administrative Core will oversee the overall function and integration of the proposed Udall  Center, and will coordinate scientific directions and research activities among the Research Projects and the  Research Core. The Administrative Core will be responsible for allocating resources and research budgets, will  work with the PIs to coordinate the preparation and submission of the annual progress reports, and will  coordinate all of the Center meetings including the annual symposium, Executive Committee, Internal and  External Advisory Committee meetings, and monthly teleconferences and videoconferences. In Aim 2, the  Administrative Core will establish and oversee training activities in our Udall Center. We will accomplish our  training goals through a combination of Udall-specific and community-based programs. Our Udall-specific  efforts will provide training in Parkinson's disease (PD) research, and will also help integrate our trainees into  the larger community of local PD researchers. We will take advantage of the wealth of high-quality educational  programs available at our host institutions. Our Udall trainees from all three laboratories will gather together in  Boston during our annual Center retreat and receive extensive didactic training in translational PD research,  clinical neurology and neuropathology of movement disorders, and career development in addition to a one-  day symposium where latest discoveries of PD research will be presented. Creation of Individual Career  Development Plans for each trainee, formulated as collaborative efforts among the trainee, the trainee's PI and  the Training Director, represents a key, innovative aspect of our career development program. These trainee-  specific plans will ensure that educational activities congruent with the trainee's previous educational history,  current training environment and specific goals are identified and utilized. In Aim 3, the Administrative Core will  coordinate our public outreach activities. We will organize our annual symposium as part of our annual Center  retreat in Boston. In addition to the Project PIs, leading PD experts whose latest work are highly impactful will  be invited to present in the annual symposium. The Center Outreach Program Director will coordinate  additional outreach activities, including participation in local PD patient-oriented symposia at Beth Israel  Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Massachusetts General Hospital as well as national symposia  organized by the National Parkinson's Foundation and the Parkinson's Action Network. The Administrative  Core will also create and maintain our Udall Center website and social media to disseminate our Udall  research findings to the general public in a timely fashion, and will partner with the established BIDMC website."

"9339556","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of luteolin in preventing progression of prostate cancer and to uncover the molecular basis of its anticancer effects. Post-translational modification of histones is critical for regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex (PRC)-2, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing through its catalysis of the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27). EZH2- mediated epigenetic gene silencing plays an important role in prostate cancer initiation and progression. Increased EZH2 expression promotes neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells and cancer progression. Mechanistically, EZH2-mediated trimethylation of H3K27 results in silencing of a large number of tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A/p16, CDH1/E-cadherin, Disabled homolog 2-interacting protein (DAB2IP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-3 in prostate cancer. Functional assays have demonstrated EZH2 to be a bonafide oncogene. Our preliminary data suggest that: i) progressive increase in EZH2 during prostate cancer progression and its differential expression in cancer vs. corresponding normal/benign tissue, ii) from in silico studies, the plant flavone luteolin binds to the active site of EZH2, iii) interactin of luteolin with EZH2 and H3k27me3 proteins-ex vivo studies, iii) luteolin inhibits EZH2 expression and H3K27me3 in prostate cancer cells, iv) luteolin alters transcriptome and miRNA expression, v) luteolin decreases proliferation and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells, and vi) luteolin induces re-expression of tumor suppressor genes. Our working hypothesis is that luteolin-mediated suppression of EZH2 and its histone-lysine N- methyltransferase activity inhibits progression of prostate cancer not only through changes in histone methylation, but also through epigenetic modifications in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and post-translational changes in the levels of EZH2-regulatory miRNAs. We propose four complementary specific aims to determine: (1) the effects of luteolin on EZH2 and other PRC2 complex proteins, (2) the ability of luteolin to reverse EZH2-mediated epigenetic gene silencing, (3) the effects of luteolin on the regulation of specific miRNAs affecting EZH2-mediated changes in prostate cancer cells, and (4) the effects of luteolin-mediated EZH2 inhibition and associated molecular mechanisms on relevant in vivo situations using the TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model, which recapitulate human disease. Prostate cancer is highly prevalent and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States. The knowledge generated by completion of these studies has the potential to provide the VA healthcare system with unique opportunities for effective treatment strategies for VA men diagnosed with low- grade, low-volume prostate cancer. Such novel strategies are necessitated by the current realities that histologically identical cancers in different patients cn exhibit widely variant biologic behavior, and prostate cancer patients are more likely to have significant comorbidities than the general population. In conclusion, we will define the 1) role of EZH2-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in driving prostate cancer progression, as the EZH2-H3K27me3 epigenetic pathway appears to be very important for repression of tumor suppressor genes, and 2) the beneficial effects of luteolin, which will set a new paradigm in the management of prostate cancer patients undergoing active surveillance or at risk for biochemical recurrence."
"9322561","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the rapidly increasing capacity to sequence human genomes, our incomplete ability to read and interpret the information content in genomes and epigenomes remain a central challenge. A comprehensive set of regulatory events across a genome - the regulome - is needed to make full use of genomic information, but is currently out of reach for practically all clinical applications and many biological systems The proposed Center will develop technologies that greatly increase the sensitivity, speed, and comprehensiveness of understanding genome regulation. We will develop new technologies to interrogate the transactions between the genome and regulatory factors, such as proteins and noncoding RNAs, and integrate variations in DNA sequences and chromatin states over time and across individuals. Novel molecular engineering and biosensor strategies are deployed to encapsulate the desired complex DNA transformations into the probe system, such that the probe system can be directly used on very small human clinical samples and capture genome-wide information in one or two steps. These technologies will be applied to clinical samples and workflows in real time to exercise their robustness and reveal for the first time epigenomic dynamics of human diseases during progression and treatment. These technologies will be broadly applicable to many biomedical investigations, and the Center will disseminate the technologies via training and diverse means."
"9280215","TR&D3 Dynamical Modeling Project Summary Experimental data now accumulates at a rate that far exceeds the current ability to assimilate that data, and the number of elements and complexity of mathematical models is rapidly increasing to understand and explore that data within the context of complex biological mechanisms. However, large mechanistic models are difficult to build, understand and validate, often resulting in poor predictive value of the models. The challenges with highly complex models are: (1) the structure of large network models can be difficult to understand, (2) large models are almost always under-constrained, having not enough data to measure or fit numerical parameters, and (3) the underlying biological mechanism are either not well established or differ in different contexts. These challenges can severely limit the predictive power and usefulness of the models and simulations. We propose two aims two address these challenges. To help build, organize, and navigate complex models, we propose to create ModelBricks, fully annotated modules that can be added to a model, and assembled into larger models. The introduction of a rule-based modeling approach into VCell, coupled with the integration of VCell with public databases via Pathway Commons, provides the basis for developing a new modular model building capability that will leverage both the power of the VCell database and community resources. We will develop a VCell architecture for ModelBricks that creates the fundamental design elements required to enable packaging of model elements into structures that can be queried in the database and used within VCell BioModels or exported to other modeling formats. An impressive set of eleven DBPs will help the VCell team to seed a growing library of common ModelBricks of common physiological processes such as ion pumps and channels, phosphorylation reactions, and GTP/GDP cycling of G proteins. This initial library will serve as a core for community-driven development: ModelBricks will be a powerful aid to building models of all types and complexity, and spawn the development of well-annotated models that can be searched, reutilized and recombined. A second aims attacks the problem that the traditional approach of fitting parameters to experiment fails when limited amounts of experimental data do not sufficiently constrain the parameter space of large models. There exist, however, novel sophisticated analytical techniques that can help validate and discover unexpected predictive powers of such models. Three approaches will be developed within VCell to address model uncertainty; (1) methods for steady-state analysis such as steady state computation, stability analysis, sensitivity analysis; (2) ?Sloppy Model? approaches that derive parameter combinations that drive model behavior in the context of specific observables of interest even when unconstrained; and (3) methods to explore uncertainty in model structure using simulation and analysis of ensembles of closely related model variants matched to specific observations. These approaches will rely on strong technical collaborations with Mendes and Brown and be driven by DBPs with Bader, Fournier, Heinen, Mayer, and Iyengar."
"9390021","PROJECT SUMMARY DISEASE MODELING PROJECT (DMP)  The overall goal of the Indiana University/The Jackson Laboratory Alzheimer's Disease Precision Models  Center (IU/JAX ADPMC) is to develop, characterize and distribute more precise preclinical models for  Alzheimer's disease (AD). The IU/JAX ADPMC Disease Modeling Development and Phenotyping Project will  use CRISPR genome editing to generate mouse models that carry different combinations of human risk alleles  for late-onset AD (LOAD). In addition, some of the most widely used existing models for AD will be fully  characterized to develop more clinically relevant phenotyping platforms. We have assembled a team of experts  in human and mouse genetics, mouse models of AD, genome editing, genomic approaches to understand  complex diseases (including sequencing and computational modeling) and various biological processes  implicated in AD (including APP processing, cholesterol trafficking, neuroinflammation and vascular biology).  We have three specific aims. Aim 1 is to fully characterize APP/PS1, 5xFAD and hTau, three of the most  widely used mouse models of AD. APP/PS1 and 5xFAD carry a combination of mutations in amyloid precursor  protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1) that cause early-onset AD (EOAD) in humans. APP/PS1 and 5xFAD  have been widely used to study amyloidosis and neuroinflammation. hTau carries human wild type microtubule  associated protein Tau (MAPT) in the absence of mouse Mapt and develops age-related MAPT  hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, and some neurodegeneration. We will also extensively characterize a new  model of LOAD that we have created that carries the two greatest genetic risk factors for LOAD, APOE?4 and  TREM2R47H. We will prioritize clinically relevant endpoints including in vivo imaging, blood and tissue  biomarkers and genomics, and compare these to more traditionally used endpoints such as behavioral assays  that have not proven reliable when translated to the clinic. In Aim 2, we will generate mice carrying 40 new  allelic variants identified through the Bioinformatics and Data Management Core and use an efficient in vivo  screening strategy to determine the promising models to pass through to deep phenotyping. In the early years  of the center we will prioritize understanding GWAS variants (ABCA7, BIN1 and CR1) as well as variations in  two genes identified by us from analyses of the AD Sequencing Project (NANOS1) and AD Neuroimaging  Initiative (IL1RAP). All models created will be made available at the earliest opportunity through the JAX AD  Mouse Mutant Resource (ADMMR). In Aim 3, we will fully characterize models that show important AD-  relevant phenotypes including amyloid deposition, tau pathology and neurodegeneration using the deep  phenotyping strategy described in Aim 1. All new findings will be validated in human tissues. Throughout this  funding period, we anticipate 40 new models will be generated and distributed, and up to 8 new and 4 existing  models will be extensively characterized. Our strategy closely integrates human and mouse data, so these new  AD models will show a high degree of clinical translatability for preclinical testing of new therapeutic targets.   "
"9339577","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         No large-scale immunomodulatory clinical therapies currently exist for heart failure (HF). To date, the primary focus of therapeutic immunomodulation has been to neutralize inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-?, an approach that unfortunately failed in clinical trial. Recently, we described profound remodeling of the global immune cell network and a heretofore-unappreciated adverse cardiosplenic axis in chronic ischemic HF that promotes immune cell-mediated tissue injury in the failing heart. This novel discovery suggests that directly targeting specific leukocyte populations that are altered in HF may represent a better approach to therapeutic immunomodulation. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are CD4+ T-lymphocytes that express the forkhead box protein-3 (Foxp3) transcription factor and suppress immune cell responses in a contactdependent, antigen nonspecific manner; their pathophysiological role in chronic HF is unknown. In our preliminary studies, we have unexpectedly discovered that in HF, Tregs robustly infiltrate the failing heart, and rather than being anti-inflammatory and thereby cardioprotective, paradoxically exhibit pro-inflammatory features and function prominently as disease mediators, imparting substantial anti-angiogenic, pro-fibrotic, and pro-inflammatory effects. Based on these data, we hypothesize that dysfunctional Tregs are essential for left ventricular (LV) remodeling, capillary rarefaction, inflammation, and disease progression in HF, and thereby    are key cellular targets for immunomodulation. Three Aims will test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will delineate global Treg trafficking and alterations in Treg pro-inflammatory signaling in C57BL/6 mice with coronary ligation and HF, and in sham-operated controls. Tregs, and other T-cell subsets, and their inflammatory profiles will be defined in heart, blood, spleen, and mediastinal lymph nodes by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry at serial time points after ligation, and correlated with LV and splenic remodeling and inflammation. BrdU labeling will index Treg proliferation in vivo. Moreover, using human HF biosample repositories, we will determine the abundance and distribution of Tregs in human failing hearts, and profile circulating Tregs (and other T-cells) in ambulatory patients with HF (with reduced ejection fraction) versus matched non-failing controls. In Aim 2, we will establish the role of Tregs in LV remodeling and neovascularization by selectively (and reversibly) depleting Tregs in Foxp3-DTR Tg mice with chronic HF, and then evaluating the effects on immune cell profiles, inflammation, circulating and bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells, in vivo angiogenesis, and LV    remodeling. In parallel studies, the relative anti-angiogenic effects of splenic Tregs from sham mice, HF mice, and HF mice with ablation and subsequent reconstitution of Tregs will be compared using in vitro tube formation assays. In Aim 3, we will define whether dysfunctional Tregs are important mediators of the injurious cardiosplenic axis in chronic HF. CD45.2 mononuclear splenocytes from Foxp3-DTR Tg mice with either early or late HF, (corresponding to different stages of Treg dysfunction) will be adoptively transferred into CD45.1 naïve mice, with or without Treg ablation prior to transfer. The long-term effects of cell transfer on LV/splenicremodeling, inflammation, and T-cell/immune cell profiles will then be measured in recipient mice. In parallel, we will evaluate the ability of splenic Tregs from HF and sham mice to suppress activation of CD4+ and CD8+ splenic T-lymphocytes in vitro, and the role of TNFR signaling in HF Treg dysfunction via similar studies using splenic T-cells from TNFR1-/- and TNFR2-/- HF mice. By conclusively defining the role of Tregs in pathological cardiac remodeling, these studies will further our understanding of the cellular basis for inflammatory activation in chronic ischemic HF, and provide innovative perspectives as to the fundamental underpinnings of the recently discovered pro-inflammatory and tissue-injurious cardiosplenic axis. Moreover, by providing direct    evidence for Tregs as anti-angiogenic and (paradoxically) pro-inflammatory mediators in HF, these studies will identify new targets for cell type-specific, rather than cytokine-specific, immunomodulation."
"9390020","PROJECT SUMMARY PRECLINICAL TESTING CORE (PTC)  The Preclinical Testing Core (PTC) of the IU/JAX Alzheimer?s Disease Precision Models Center will establish  and validate a preclinical testing screening strategy pipeline with predetermined go/no-go decision points using  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic biomarkers and functional assessments in biologically and pathologically  relevant AD mouse models that allow standardized and unbiased assessments of potential therapeutic agents.  The Core is led by experts in preclinical imaging, neuropharmacology, and animal model characterization at  IU?s Center for Neuroimaging and JAX?s Mouse Neurobehavioral Phenotyping, In Vivo Imaging, and  Physiology Core facilities, and supported by IU?s Clinical Pharmacology Analytical Core. The pipeline?s primary  and secondary screens focus on generating pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker  assessments in two new generation AD mouse models with construct validity. Only test compounds that  demonstrate target engagement in the biomarker screens will move to tertiary screening for in vivo symptom  modifying effects and determination of the novel compound?s therapeutic window. The specific aims of the  PTC are (1) the establishment of a standardized testing pipeline, the development of the assay protocols and  methods, the creation of the data repository and back-translating clinical compound failures; (2) validating the  pipeline with two compounds currently in clinical trials in two biologically and pathologically relevant animal  models; (3) the evaluation of novel test compounds through the pipeline which allows investigators in the  greater AD research community with unprecedented access to a validated pipeline, standardized testing  protocols, and resources to screen compounds of interest."
"9325502","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatotoxicity due to prescription medications and herbal supplements is increasingly recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the developed world. Due to its idiosyncratic nature, variable presentation, and the vast number of potential causative drugs as well as herbal and dietary supplements, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is often diagnosed late in its course when patients present with severe liver disease. This makes diagnosis and characterization of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of DILI, difficult and does not allow accurate assessment of the epidemiology and risk factors associated with DILI. Since one of the main concerns with the current DILIN is the late presentation of cases, future investigation should focus on accruing cases where the liver injury is detected early on. The aims of the Mount Sinai membership in the NIDDK DILI study are as follows: 1) To rapidly increase the number of enrolled adults and children with DILI, particularly among under-represented minority groups in the current DILIN prospective and retrospective databases; 2) To enroll patients early in the course of DILI by closely monitoring high risk groups; and 3) ultimately to investigate preventative measures to prevent DILI among high risk groups. The inclusion of Mount Sinai in the DILIN will lead to an increase in the number of DILI cases from Hispanic, Black and Asian patients. The significant number of Asian and Hispanic patients who will be recruited from the New York area may provide insights into the mechanism of liver injury related to the use of herbal and dietary supplements as these populations are known to be frequent users of these complementary and alternative medicines. A major component of the Mount Sinai DILIN will be focused on the recruitment of elderly patients with DILI, and importantly also on a control population taking these supplements, a population not well represented to date in the network. Similarly, Mount Sinai's large population of 4,000 HIV infected patients will provide cases and controls to represent the large population on antiretroviral therapy. The large number of patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment followed by the many Mount Sinai oncologists represents another ideal source of prospective DILI cases and controls. Mount Sinai is a member of eMERGE, a national consortium to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches using electronic medical records (EMR) systems to genomics research. A current projects in eMERGE is to develop an electronic algorithm to identify cases of DILI in EMR systems. If just 1 percent of the 100,000 eMERGE DNA samples have a history of DILI, then the DILIN could double its DNA sample database overnight. Investigators at Mount Sinai are well-qualified and poised to contribute to ancillary studies that arise from the wealth of available data and samples of the collective DILIN. Combined with outstanding infrastructure to collect detailed information through exploitation of the EMR and Data Warehouse, the partnership of the Personalized Medicine program, and involvement of a multi-disciplinary team across the institution and its affiliates, we bring tremendous manpower to bear upon this urgent problem."

"9321459","The overall goal of the Cincinnati Rheumatic Diseases Resource Center (CRDRC) is to promote biomedical research that yields insights into fundamental processes and pathogenic mechanisms of rheumatic diseases in children, which can lead to innovative treatments for these diseases. The aims of the CRDRC are to 1) to provide resources that enhance the scope and breadth of the overall research community to advance the understanding of pediatric rheumatic disease and 2) to foster collaborations and interdisciplinary approaches to promote laboratory discoveries, generate translational research opportunities that ultimately impact patient care. The CRDRC will support projects with potential to advance the national research agenda related to rheumatic diseases, and that represent an area of tremendous strength and resource investment at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. The CRDRC will offer four innovative research-based resources, including a Pediatric Rheumatology Tissue Repository, a Single Cell Phenotyping Core, a Functional Genomics Core and a Rheumatology Informatics Core. Collectively, these resources form a powerful infrastructure that fosters development of precision and predictive medical approaches based on genomics and disease mechanisms. The CRDRC will support disease-based research across the continuum of discovery, where laboratory findings generate translational studies that lead to clinical trials. In addition to advancing knowledge of pediatric rheumatic disease, the goals of the CRDRC include recruitment of established investigators to bring new expertise to the field, cultivation of collaborations within the local and national research community, and encouragement of young investigators committed to pursuing research careers focused on pediatric rheumatic disease. These goals of the CRDRC are particularly well supported by a Pilot & Feasibility Study Program that will transcend the Cincinnati research community to include pediatric rheumatology investigators across the US. The CRDRC also will strengthen the research community through an enrichment program of local seminars, workshops and symposia. A highly accomplished and collaborative community of researchers is already in place creating fertile ground for accomplishing the goals of the Cincinnati Center, and ultimately to accelerate research to benefit pediatric rheumatic disease patients in their care."
"9318604","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Combined ultrasound and tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy, or sonothrombolysis, has been shown to improve recanalization in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Effective methods of enhancing thrombolysis have been examined in an attempt to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic events. In our ongoing studies, we have demonstrated that significant enhancement of thrombolysis correlates with the presence of stable cavitation and this type of gentle bubble activity can be sustained using an intermittent infusion of a contrast agent. In addition, we have demonstrated encapsulation and ultrasound-triggered release of nitric oxide and other bioactive gases to promote vasodilation, and neuroprotection. These preliminary data strongly support the central hypothesis of our proposal that ultrasound enhances thrombolysis primarily via mechanical mechanisms. To test this hypothesis we propose to investigate three Specific Aims: In Aim #1, we will develop a dual-element annular array transducer to facilitate simultaneous 220-kHz pulsed ultrasound exposure and passive cavitation detection in vitro and in vivo. The ability to monitor stable cavitation throughout treatment will aid in the automated control and optimization of thrombolytic enhancement. In Aim #2, we will demonstrate the efficacy of 220-kHz ultrasound- enhanced thrombolysis using t-ELIP or rt-PA and a contrast agent through in vivo studies in a porcine hemorrhagic stroke model. As a novel approach in Aim #2, we will also evaluate the degree of neuroprotection achieved by treating the intracerebral hemorrhage with ELIP loaded with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide, a neuroprotectant, and octofluoropropane to nucleate bubble activity, and compare to ELIP loaded with a mixture of xenon, a neuroprotectant, and with a smaller amount of the bubble nucleation agent. In Aim #3, we will investigate the potential of echogenic liposomes to deliver rt-PA and nitric oxide, a bioactive gas, in a porcine arterial thrombus model. Successful completion of the proposed studies will elucidate the utility and potential risks of ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis and ultrasound-mediated delivery of vasodilatory or cytoprotective gases and will provide important new information to assist the design of targeted agents to improve thrombolysis and neuroprotection in acute stroke treatment."
"9386889","ABSTRACT Depressive and anxiety disorders affect 20-30% of school age youth, contributing to poor developmental and academic outcomes. Psychosocial evidence-based practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can improve outcomes in these disorders, but numerous barriers limit access. Students access mental health services at schools more than anywhere else, but school professionals (SPs, e.g., counselors, social workers) are generally not trained to deliver CBT. Efficient and successful implementation of CBT in schools requires scientific study of implementation strategies designed to optimize uptake, addressing student, SP, and community barriers. Replicating Effective Programs (REP), Coaching, and Facilitation are three previously established implementation strategies, but vary in intensity and theoretical foundation. REP combines customized intervention packaging, didactic training, and technical support to improve provider knowledge. Coaching extends didactic training via ongoing, live supervision to improve provider competence and acceptance. Facilitation mentors providers in strategic thinking to promote self-efficacy in championing the use of effective practices and securing administrator support. Coaching and Facilitation can be expensive and may be unnecessary for early adopters. An adaptive implementation intervention can be used to provide the more intensive implementation strategies only to those who need them. The primary aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two adaptive implementation interventions on the frequency of CBT delivered to students by SPs (primary outcome) and on student depressive and anxiety symptoms (secondary outcomes). Schools will first be randomized to receive REP or REP + Coaching. Schools in need of additional assistance will subsequently be randomized to continue with REP or REP+Coaching or to receive added Facilitation. Secondary aims include determining moderators of implementation effects (e.g., social determinants, leadership support), determining the cost of early introduction of Coaching and/or augmentation with Facilitation, and identifying the mechanisms by which Coaching and Facilitation improve CBT use among SPs and impact student outcomes. This five-year implementation trial will apply a novel sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design across a network of schools in all 83 counties in Michigan, involving over 100 schools, 200 SPs, and over 2000 students. Web-based tools will facilitate data collection from SPs and students. This will be the first study to test implementation of a transdiagnostic EBP for school-age youth, at a statewide level, delivered by school staff ? taking the treatment to populations with limited access. The proposal addresses two national health priorities: 1) reducing mental health care and provider capacity gaps affecting youth, and 2) enhancing the knowledge base of implementation science in community settings; and NIMH strategic goal 4: strengthening public health impact of research through community partnerships (4.2) and implementation strategies (4.3)."
"9232354","Project Summary Although numerous ribonucleases have been identified over the past 40 years, most have been associated primarily with the biological reaction that was used for their identification. Thus an enzyme like RNase P has been assumed to be strictly involved tRNA processing. Likewise the RNase Z family of enzymes has also been thought to be only involved in tRNA processing, while RNase III type proteins, at least in prokaryotes are considered rRNA maturation enzymes. However, more recent experiments have demonstrated that most of these ribonucleases have multiple functions in the cell. When one carefully looks at what is known about the pathways of rRNA maturation, tRNA processing and mRNA decay, it becomes clear that many of the existing models for these processes are too simplistic and in some cases probably incorrect. In addition, not much is known regarding the enzymatic overlap among these important pathways. For example, during the current grant period, we have demonstrated the existence of multiple new pathways for tRNA processing that require either RNase P or polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) as the first step in processing tRNA precursors rather than RNase E. Furthermore, we hve shown a link between polyadenylation and functional tRNA levels as well as the existence of a previously unidentified endonuclease. Accordingly, this application describes a series of experiments that will focus on developing a more complete understanding of post-transcriptional RNA metabolism in the model prokaryote, Escherichia coli. Our approach will be to use a combination of unique bacterial strains, high density tiling microarrays as well as other molecular biological, biochemical and bioinformatic approaches. Specific experiments include: 1. Transcriptome-wide analysis of the initiation of mRNA processing and decay; 2. Detailed analysis of the role of tRNA nucleotidyl transferase in RNA metabolism and identification of structural features for exonuclease-independent tRNA maturation;3. Characterization of YhgF endonuclease activity and the molecular mechanisms of RNase III- independent 30S rRNA processing. With the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, the need to better understand the overall mechanism of post-transcriptional RNA metabolism is becoming increasingly important. Information gained from this work could be instrumental in the identification of potential new drug targets."
"9394639","ABSTRACT The proposed study will examine the chronic hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy subset of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) to connect skeletal muscle ultrastructure and biochemistry to symptoms, quality of life, and functional capacity. Conditions including hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, muscular deconditioning, and obesity result in a variety of cellular changes, such as cardiac hypertrophy, neurohormonal dysregulation and derangements in protein homeostasis. These processes result in the development of HFpEF with the downstream sequelae of dyspnea and fatigue, decreased functional capacity, and structural muscle damage. Hypertension is one of the greatest contributors to cardiac-related mortality and is a primary cause of HFpEF as a result of left ventricular hypertrophy. This study hypothesizes that that heart failure (HF) symptoms and functional capacity are connected to skeletal muscle ultrastructure and biochemistry in persons with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This 2-year cross-sectional study will enroll 40 participants with HFpEF and use stored samples from healthy controls to examine skeletal muscle structure and function. Patient questionnaires will be used to assess fatigue, dyspnea severity and quality of life in persons with HFpEF. In addition, perceived barriers to and benefits of exercise will be assessed via questionnaire. Functional status will be assessed using the six-minute walk test and an exercise treadmill test. Muscle biopsies will be performed to study structural and functional aspects of skeletal muscle that determine functional capacity including the conventional assessment of quantification of fiber types, cross- sectional area, capillary density, and mitochondrial function, and to further explore a novel finding that examines a putative mechanism of myocyte ultrastructural damage, chymase-induced breakdown of desmin and mitochondrial dysfunction, as an important factor of functional capacity in persons with HFpEF. By focusing on a subset of patients with well-defined hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, data from this study can be used to create precision medicine in HFpEF prevention and treatment, targeted therapies, and better prediction of outcomes in this high mortality population."
"9336844","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most devastating conditions that affect older Veterans today, and despite decades of intense research, there is still no effective treatment. Convincing epidemiologic evidence suggests that cancer survivors have a lower risk of AD, and that people with AD have a lower risk of cancer. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that this inverse association may hold the key to new approaches to prevention and treatment of AD. Our pilot data in a national cohort of Veterans shows that survivors of many cancer types have a decreased risk of AD that is independent of cancer treatment, and that those who receive chemotherapy have an even lower risk. The protective effect of chemotherapy did not seem to be explained by earlier death or less frequent diagnosis of other conditions among cancer patients. It is quite plausible that anti-cancer treatments could decrease AD risk, since some common drugs are known to improve outcomes in mouse models of AD through multiple mechanisms including stabilization of microtubules and dissolution of tangles. Other cancer drugs interrupt the cell cycle in its early stages, and may thus prevent neuronal cell death. Furthermore, cancer and AD share many key pathophysiologic features, including oxidative stress, metabolic dysregulation, DNA damage, and inflammation. Agents that suppress these pathways might be used as chemoprevention for both diseases. One example is the diabetes drug metformin, for which there is emerging evidence of both anti-neoplastic and neuroprotective effects. In this proposal, our multidisciplinary research team will further explore the epidemiologic and biological link between AD and cancer using the rich resources of the Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center and the Department of Statistical Genetics at the Harvard School of Public Health. In Aim 1 we will investigate the association between 20 different cancer types and AD in our national dataset of over 3.5 million Veterans. We will refine our pilot analyses by validating a more accurate definition of AD, confirming the cancer diagnosis through the VA Cancer Registry, and requesting linked Medicare data. In Aim 2, we will examine the relationship between particular classes of anti-neoplastic therapy and the risk of AD in both the national VA dataset and our more detailed pharmaco-epidemiology database. We will also determine whether regular users of metformin have a lower risk of AD. In Aim 3, we will perform genome-wide meta- analyses of published studies on cancer and AD to identify shared genetic variants of both diseases. We will gain insight into common biological pathways using novel techniques such as gene-set enrichment, pathway and network analysis. Successful completion of these studies will generate important hypotheses about drugs that could be repositioned as treatment or chemoprevention for AD, and lead to clinical trials that would directly benefit US Veterans. Characterization of the biological overlap between cancer and AD will likely yield new pathophysiologic insights and could identify new targets for therapy."

"9331768","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In our planning grant we found that agricultural workers in Thailand (42% of the working population) were self- employed (informal sector), with little economic security, no formal occupational health & safety protections and significant exposures to pesticides. Thus they represent a population in need of research to policy initiatives. The initial research of our GEOHealth HUB (Mahidol University, Thailand & University of Massachusetts, USA) will focus on the agricultural health research question of whether some pesticides, widely used in Southeast Asian agriculture, act as endocrine disrupters, altering endocrine hormone homeostasis and resulting in increased risk of metabolic syndrome and associated diseases such as diabetes, stroke and coronary heart disease, all of which are on the rise in Thailand. In the paired research application (1/2-GEOHealth HUB: Improving Agricultural Health in Southeast Asia-Thailand), we hypothesize that disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormone homeostasis is a biomarker of risk for the development of metabolic disorders, and that several widely used pesticides act as HPT/HPA disrupters. To evaluate our hypothesis we will: 1) Use the Thai Universal Health Care System data to conduct a cross-sectional study of metabolic disorders by occupation; 2) Evaluate sub-chronic changes in HPT & HPA hormones longitudinally among Thai organic and pesticide using farmers; 3) Examine the acute endocrine impacts of pesticide spraying events for selected insecticides & herbicides; 4) Evaluate the impact of genetic polymorphisms on pesticide metabolism. This proposed research project represents the initial focus of our GEOHealth Hub, but future projects will extend the range of agricultural health research and expand into other related occupational & environmental health topics (climate change, other chronic diseases, neurobehavioral health and other work sectors). The matched training program for the GEOHealth Hub focuses on institutional capacity building through a program of mentored research training for 15 junior faculty and medical staff over 5 years at our partner institutions (initially Mahidol University and the Thai Ministry of Public Health). Each trainee will have a Mentorship Team (Thai and U.S. mentors). The training program will include: a) 1 month Introduction to GEOHealth program at Mahidol; b) 6 months of research specific training and mentorship in the U.S. (UMass, Rutgers or Mt. Sinai), resulting in a funded interdisciplinary project that extends the research being conducted in the paired research application; c) data collection, analysis and manuscript(s) from the approved research project, supported by Mentorship Team. The program is designed to establish an international, interdisciplinary collaborative research group that will continue to work together in the future. The training program will link with our proposed research project through extensions of the current project aims and pilot projects that extend the scope of the research in agricultural health, aiding the GEOHealth Hub to expand its research capacity. As the Hub develops, we will add new training partners from other Thai and Southeast Asian universities and institutions. We will use short term training to recruit future institutional partners through existing public healt networks (ThaiPHEIN, SEAPHEIN & APACPH) and to create opportunities for Hub members to interact and develop ideas for new approaches to agricultural health research. Research findings and tools, as well as training materials will be disseminated via our website and through our short term training workshops and seminars. We expect increased research capacity will be reflected in publications (number and quality), extramural funding, multidisciplinary collaborations, development of new research areas and agricultural health policy changes."
"9316690","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes mellitus affects over 25 million individuals in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. At least 1% of diabetes (>250,000 individuals) results from high penetrant single gene defects, in HNF1A, GCK and HNF4A and several other genes. Unfortunately, as a result of phenotypic overlap with more common forms of diabetes, lack of awareness and/or techniques for identifying them among health care providers, and the cost and labor historically involved in sequencing several genes as required to make a diagnosis, the vast majority of cases of highly penetrant and genetic diabetes are misdiagnosed as type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Published evidence shows that diagnosing highly penetrant genetic forms of diabetes enables personalized treatment resulting in improved glucose control, better prediction of prognosis, and an enhanced familial risk assessment. To meet this need, we propose to implement and evaluate in four diverse health care settings our Personalized Diabetes Medicine Program (PDMP). The PDMP is currently based at the University of Maryland Center for Diabetes and Endocrinology and will be disseminated to UM Family Medicine and three partner centers: the Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center (BVAMC, with opportunities to disseminate nationally), Geisinger Medical Center (an integrated health system) and Bay West Endocrinology Associates (a community-based private practice group). We will also engage the community through advertisements and site visits to local primary care practices by our genetic counselor/diabetes educator team. The PDMP consists of: a simple patient screening questionnaire, chart/electronic health record (EHR) review, an algorithm that includes utilizes questionnaire data, routine lab testing, and family history review to identify patients most likely to have highl penetrant genetic diabetes; customized multiplex gene panel sequencing of eligible patients followed by confirmation of diabetes-causal mutations in our CLIA-approved Translational Genomics Laboratory; incorporation of mutations and decision support in the EHR; genetic counseling; implementing a mutation-based treatment strategy; and family screening. Deliverables include EHR-based implementation tools, the sequencing panel and contribution of genotype/phenotype data regarding diabetes-causal variants and variants of unknown clinical significance to ClinVar and other similar public resources. We will track implementation metrics of the PDMP and conduct an impact evaluation, including evaluation of clinical outcomes as measured by changes in glycemic control in patients diagnosed with a genetic form of diabetes. Finally, we will engage a Payer Advisory Panel in the development of the impact evaluation process to enhance our ability to collect meaningful evidence to inform clinical practice recommendations and guide insurance coverage decisions as a first step to enabling diagnosis of inherited forms of diabetes across the United States and more broadly, genomic diagnosis and treatment of highly penetrant genetic forms of other common diseases."
"9280685","The Keck School of Medicine (KSOM) of USC recruits locally and nationally to achieve a diverse student body. In 2011, a summer research program known as Bridging the Gaps (BTG) was instituted to increase underrepresented minorities (URMs) matriculating at KSOM. The objectives were several-fold, 1) to increase awareness of the roles of physician scientists and biomedical scientists, thereby serving as a catalyst to ignite interest in choosing these particular career paths, 2) to evoke interest in those areas of research in which minorities are severely impacted, serving as a potential mechanism to reduce health disparities, 3) to enhance the potential for successful matriculation into a doctoral program, serving as a pipeline to attract talented URMs to KSOM. The current proposal, Summer Program in Diabetes and Obesity Research (SPIDOR), complements and expands the stated objectives of BTG. The novelty of SPIDOR is our interdisciplinary model that emphasizes diabetes-related research in basic science, clinical and engineering fields. The preceptors of this grant represent a balanced mix of full, associate, and assistant professors who are members of our USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute (DORI). These faculty members have proven records of student training and a history of collaborative research. We have carefully selected a group of faculty who not only have productive research programs, but have consistently demonstrated strong dedication to student mentoring and to increasing diversity at KSOM. We are excited to leverage experiences and established strong relationships with BTG toward the recruitment goals of this proposal. Through our undergraduate pipeline recruitment network, we have developed relationships with local Hispanic-serving institutions within the California State University and University of California systems. We have also fostered strong relationships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (e.g., Morehouse, Spelman, Howard and Xavier). SPIDOR will be a 10 week residential program in biomedical research and didactic instruction. Our primary objectives are to recruit and expose URM students to an integrated approach to diabetes and obesity research and increase their competitiveness for entry into a doctoral program. Towards these goals, we will provide an intense 2-week didactic for complete immersion into the various research settings. To facilitate entry into a doctoral program, we will offer; MCAT and GRE preparatory sessions, instruction on program admissions processes; application preparation; interviewing skills, including mock interviews and scholarship/financial aid opportunities. Topics covered in courses, workshops and seminars will be taught by our DORI faculty, an interdisciplinary team in diabetes, obesity and engineering. This interdisciplinary teaching model will serve to instill the importance of teamwork in delivering optimal outcomes."
"9349609","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A non-invasive method that provides quantitative data on the microscopic condition of muscle could revolutionize the management of patients with neuromuscular diseases, ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to muscular dystrophy. While imaging techniques such as ultrasound and MRI can provide useful and important measures of gross muscle size and the presence of edema or fatty infiltration in the muscle, these modalities provide minimal information on the microscopic condition of the muscle itself. One technological approach that could potentially come close to serving as a virtual muscle biopsy is electrical impedance myography (EIM). Impedance measurements have long been known to provide indirect measures of cell size, extracellular milieu and, with the application of very high frequency current, intracellular structure. The recent development of EIM, a muscle-focused, non-invasive impedance technique, now makes this new objective possible. Obviously, it is unreasonable to expect that a non-invasive technique can achieve all that is possible with actual muscle tissue, such as immunohistochemistry and biochemical analysis. Yet, it may be possible to obtain a wealth of quantitative information about the microscopic condition of muscle in order to assist with initial diagnosis and, more likely, disease monitoring during therapy trial in a wide variety of neuromuscular conditions. The underlying hypothesis of this research is that by applying multifrequency electrical impedance measurements in conjunction with finite element and electrical equivalent circuit analytic techniques, we can obtain quantitative information on certain microscopic features of muscle non-invasively. We plan to test this idea by studying a variety of mouse models. In our first aim, we will focus on the accurate measurement of muscle fiber size by establishing a relationship between impedance parameters and muscle fibers of varying size, including those from immature animals, drug-induced hypertrophy, and a disease model. The second specific aim will focus on the measurement of the extracellular space by assessment of low-frequency data in several models including the mdx mouse, the db/db obese mouse, and a model of drug-induced inflammation. In the third specific aim, we will focus on identifying intracellular abnormalities, including abnormal mitochondrial content, abnormal accumulations of glycogen, and vacuolization. In the fourth aim, we will utilize the developed analytic techniques to evaluate groups of animals to which the researchers are blinded. Finally, as part of our research sharing plans, we will develop an online user interface that will help ensure that the results of this work are widely available to researchers including those with only a passing familiarity with electrical impedance methodologies."
"9463239","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with autologous human saphenous vein (HSV) is the best available treatment for severe coronary heart disease, but long-term graft patency is problematic. The per patient vein graft failure 12-18 months after CABG was 45% in the recent PREVENT IV trial (N=1,920). Vein graft failure predisposes patients to additional operations, myocardial infarction, recurrent angina, limb loss, and death. Graft failure is primarily attributable to intimal hyperplasia (IH), the process by whic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) migrate, proliferate, and deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) into a neointima that causes stenosis. We have identified MAPKAP kinase II (MK2) as a potential target for pharmacological intervention for preventing vascular graft IH. MK2 is activated directly by p38 mitogen activated kinase (MAPK), which is triggered by the mechanical and environmental stresses on the graft during transplant. Because p38 MAPK functions are diverse, p38 inhibitors cause undesirable side effects. Thus, MK2 is a logical target for inhibitin a proximal trigger of IH, and the central hypothesis of this proposal is that sustained intracellulr pharmacological inhibition of MK2 will prevent IH and improve long-term graft patency. A cell- penetrating peptidic MK2 inhibitor (MK2i) developed by project collaborators has high specificity and low toxicity, but barriers against intracellular delivery hinder its efficacy. Mechanistic studies support the notion that MK2i has promising anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity, but its potency and longevity of action are limited by internalization into and sequestration within intracellular late endosomal vesicles. To overcome the endosomal barrier, a novel polymer-based MK2i nanoplex (MK2i-NP) design has been developed in the PI's lab that improves cell internalization and endosomal escape of the MK2i peptide. Our published data verify that formulation of MK2i into endosomolytic MK2i-NPs increases peptide intracellular delivery and produces more potent and longer-lasting bioactivity relative to treatment with the free peptide. Rapid uptake and durable intracellular retention of MK2i-NPs are key criteria for this application because a brief (30 minute) treatment of the HSV tissue at the time of explant, during the period when the surgeon is preparing the site where the anastomosis will be placed, must protect the graft throughout the post-surgery healing phase. This project seeks to optimize and better elucidate the mechanism of MK2i-NPs and then to test this therapy for efficacy in inhibiting IH pathogenesis in advanced preclinical models."
"9339581","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the 10 most common malignancies in both men and women. Since 2009, over 30,000 Veterans have been diagnosed with this malignancy. Unfortunately, progress in the treatment of patients with advanced disease has been incremental, and new treatment approaches are warranted. Altered metabolism, an established hallmark of malignancy, may provide novel therapeutic opportunities. However, the molecular mechanisms by which kidney tumors remodel metabolism remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence demonstrates coordinated remodeling of mitochondrial metabolic pathways in renal cancer, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This remodeling could lead to a shift toward glycolysis (i.e. the Warburg phenotype). The long-term goal is to identify the molecular basis by which kidney cancer remodels metabolism and to use this knowledge to rationally develop new therapeutic approaches that improve patient outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to define the transcriptional basis by which RCC remodels mitochondrial metabolism and to determine the effects on tumorigenesis. Our central hypothesis is that epigenetic silencing of the transcription factor PRDM16 (PRD1-BF1-RIZ1 homologous domain containing 16) promotes a metabolic switch in RCC that drives tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data of patient-derived samples (normal kidney, primary tumor, and metastatic tumor deposits) by the applicant's laboratory that demonstrates PRDM16 loss among the most significantly altered gene expression changes in this malignancy. The rationale for the proposed studies is that understanding the molecular basis by which tumor metabolic remodeling occurs will uncover compensatory pathways and vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically exploited. Our central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data, will be tested through pursuit of the following specific aims: 1) Determine the transcriptional basis by which PRDM16 regulates the expression of TCA cycle enzymes; 2) Determine the mechanisms by which PRDM16 loss promotes a shift in tumor metabolism; and 3) Determine the epigenetic basis by which PRDM16 is lost in RCC and the contribution of this loss to tumorigenesis. The proposed research is significant because it will identify novel drivers of the metabolic shift in RCC in the context of targetable pathways. The approach is innovative because it will establish a link between the epigenome and tumor metabolism. Ultimately, the knowledge gathered has the potential to improve the efficacy of treatment for Veterans with advanced RCC, an unmet need challenging the contemporary management of this disease."
"9297293","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Exposure to gadolinium-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast is a major risk factor in the acquisition of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a severely debilitating disease first recognized in patients with acute or chronic renal impairment. MRI contrast agents heretofore were considered safe in these patients and thus indiscriminately used. Gadolinium-based contrast agents remain a mainstay for MR imaging and alternatives are still lacking.  The overall objective of this proposal is to identify candidate mechanisms that trigger the aberrant pattern of fibrosis after exposure to gadolinium-based MRI contrast in the setting of renal insufficiency. The central hypothesis is that in the setting of real insufficiency, MRI contrast exposure triggers a pro-fibrotic state in target organs, such as the skin. Subsequent generation of specific chemokines activate and recruit bone marrow-derived and circulating mesenchymal precursor cells, or fibrocytes, to the affected areas. These cells compound the fibrotic process by synthesizing and reducing the generation of extracellular matrix and inducing the proliferation of resident cells. Experiments will address the following Specific Aims. 1a, Determine the mechanism by which gadolinium-based contrast induces NSF. 1b, Demonstrate that gadolinium-based contrast induces an increase in circulating fibrocytes. 2a, Identify the chemokines and receptors responsible for recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to specific tissues.

"9444117","Contact PD/PI: Sherwin, Robert S. 1. Overall Project Summary- The Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) was created in 2005 to strengthen Yale's infrastructure for clinical and translational research, based on the recommendation of a Medical School strategic planning committee. Soon afterwards, when NIH launched its new program of Clinical & Translational Science Awards, YCCI applied and became the home of the Yale CTSA. Since then, one of its major priorities has been to support the education and career development of the next generation of clinical and translational investigators. As described in the present application, this initiative has met with great success, underscored by the fact that graduates of YCCI's K-Scholar program have received 47 individual NIH K Awards, 43 NIH RO1 awards, and 65 Foundation grants, published >1,800 papers, and obtained >$240 million in independent research funding. Remarkably, 98% of the program's graduates have stayed in academic medicine or pursued research careers in the biotech or pharmaceutical industries. YCCI has also made substantial progress in its push to accelerate the translation of disease-related discoveries into the clinic. As will be described, it provides Yale investigators with key assistance in areas including biostatistics and bioinformatics, study design, protocol development, regulatory approval, patient recruitment, access to inpatient and outpatient research facilities, and budgeting support, and gives them ready access to pilot grants and state-of-the-art research cores. The result has been a significant upsurge in the number and scope of clinical research projects throughout the Medical Center. In the next grant cycle, YCCI will build upon these achievements with an emphasis on team-based T1 to T4 research, including studies across the lifespan. YCCI will also pursue new partnerships with the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science to develop an innovative technology transfer program called the Center for Biological and Innovative Technology (CBIT) and with the School of Organization & Management to offer a novel program of leadership training for clinicians and physician-scientists. In addition, YCCI will take active advantage of the recent expansion of clinical services by Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), which now has 1,540 beds and more than 1 million outpatients visits per year, and the growth of the Yale Medical Group (YMG), which has a network of >1,200 practicing physicians in >100 clinical specialties. The resulting clinical volume (~4 million patient records) gives Yale researchers access to a large, diverse patient base for outcomes studies and clinical trials. Overall, YCCI will leverage Yale's outstanding scientific and clinical environment and work with other CTSA hubs to foster the growth of multidisciplinary team science, to develop innovative strategies for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics, and to implement results for the benefit of the health care system and the population as a whole.

"9330027","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) provides Georgia and the region with comprehensive clinical, research, and educational programs. This renewal application outlines our success in building an environment that encourages and supports innovative projects with a general theme of discovery and translation of new targets and mechanisms to enable early identification, early interventions, and ultimately prevention of AD. Given the well documented disparities in clinical research participation and burden of disease for AD in the African American community, the Emory ADRC focuses special effort to understand and address inter-individual differences in AD, ranging from ethno-racial factors to personal differences in genetic and protein variation. We benefit from generous institutional support from Emory, one of the nation's fastest growing research academic medical centers, the generous Atlanta community, and a highly collaborative team from more than 20 departments and centers. Five Cores (Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics, Neuropathology, and Outreach Recruitment and Education), coordinate activities to effectively recruit, evaluate, and engage a diverse cohort of volunteers who actively participate in a wide variety of research studies that aim to better define the trajectory from normal cognitive aging to symptomatic stages of disease. Data from the Cores are captured and stored for distribution to local researchers and for national collaborations. Our biospecimen banks include well-characterized neuropathological case materials, blood and CSF, and DNA. These valuable resources are distributed widely for a variety of approved studies of genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and pathological investigations. The ADRC educational programs reach a broad audience of students, health care professionals, and the public. Three cutting edge research projects are closely integrated with ADRC Cores: Project 1, AD Biomarkers and Endothelial Dysfunction in Caucasians and African Americans, is a longitudinal biomarker study with full integration into the ADRC Clinical Core and OREC, leveraging a unique community based Registry for Remembrance to facilitate recruitment of African Americans; Project 2, A Proteogenomic Approach to Understanding AD GWAS Results, proposes to use state-of-the art targeted gene resequencing and mass spectrometer-based protein sequencing to advance understanding of genetic risk of AD by genetic loci by linking novel gene variants at 20+ recently identified loci directly with the encoded and expressed protein variants in AD brain in an allele specific manner; Project 3, Defining the Properties of Pathogenic A? strains in Alzheimer's Disease, takes an interdisciplinary approach to build on pioneering work showing AD brain extracts are transmissible in animal models, by investigating how structural differences in A? strains from asymptomatic vs. symptomatic stages of AD vary in their seeding and propagation in yeast and animal models."
"9385981","On average, diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occur after the fourth birthday, missing critical early intervention opportunities. Many children with ASD are referred to state early intervention agencies for possible developmental delay, but unless their ASD is identified, intervention services are generally low intensity and not specific to their core ASD symptoms. However, implementation of screening to detect ASD poses considerable logistical challenges. This can result in inaccurate or altered administration, which may hinder successful detection. While the importance of accurate and reliable early detection procedures in the ASD field is widely acknowledged, no study thus far has examined the issue of procedural fidelity (i.e., adherence to the prescribed protocol) in ASD screening. Another critical research gap concerns the proximal outcomes of ASD early detection procedures, such as how screening results relate to autism referrals and specific intervention services. As the ultimate goal of early screening is to facilitate timely access to appropriate intervention programs, it is critically important to examine the rates of referral and uptake of services for children who screen positive. The proposed project aims to address these critical gaps and increase scientific knowledge, focusing on the implementation of the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Revised with Follow-up (M-CHAT-R/F) in the context of a large urban high-risk preschool sample. Most research using the M-CHAT and the M-CHAT-R/F screened children during pediatric well-child check-ups (e.g., Chlebowski et al., 2013), although several studies have examined the performance of the tool with high-risk toddlers and preschoolers (e.g., Charman et al., 2015; Snow & Lecavalier, 2008). Overall, sensitivity is adequate when the M-CHAT is administered to samples of preschoolers at risk for developmental delay, although specificity ranges from poor to adequate. In order to test the study research questions we will extract intake, multidisciplinary evaluation (MDE), and service/placement data from Elwyn Special Education for Early Developmental Success (SEEDS), the agency providing intervention services to children age 3-5 in Philadelphia County, PA. SEEDS estimates that 5,000 children were screened January-December 2015. The first aim will examine the procedural fidelity of the M-CHAT-R/F implementation, by examining accuracy and completion data over time. Both inaccurate and missing data will be examined for barriers and biases. The second aim will examine the proximal outcomes of screening, namely the relationship between M-CHAT-R/F scores and MDE results, autism evaluation results, and services and placements offered to children in the SEEDS program. This study will be the first to examine fidelity of screening procedures in a high-risk setting. Identification of barriers or systematic bias may inform alternate approaches to more successful screening, improving care of children with ASD. This study also uses a novel approach to relate screening results to proximal outcomes, which will increase understanding of the role of screening in early intervention agencies."
"9350305","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary incontinence, urinary tract infections, pelvic pain, urological complications of obesity and diabetes, and other disorders of the lower urinary tract (women's lower urinary tract dysfunction [WLUTD]) severely impact a woman's quality of life and can be a major burden to the U.S. Healthcare system. It is anticipated that growth in the elderly female population and individuals with obesity, will lead to a significantly increased prevalence of WLUTD over the next few decades. To fully understand the mechanisms of WLUTD and to improve care for the millions of affected women, multidisciplinary research teams are required. This proposal seeks to establish a mentoring program for junior faculty from diverse scientific and clinical backgrounds with an interest in WLUTD. The Case Incubator for Multidisciplinary Urologic Research Groups (CIMURG) program will recruit 1 MD- and 1 PhD-level Scholars annually to develop a sustainable system for the development and retention of multidisciplinary researchers and research teams with a common goal of advancing the understanding, prevention and treatment of women with benign LUTD. The CIMURG program will include an integrated program of didactics, seminars and mentoring to prepare Scholars for successful design, implementation, and leadership of clinical and/or translational research projects involving multidisciplinary teams AND receipt of independent funding. The principal investigator is a surgeon scientist with a long history of NIH funded research in WLUTD and urological training. In addition, CIMURG program includes 24 outstanding basic science, translational, clinical, and technology mentors from 14 different departments. CIMURG Scholars will have a primary Clinical and a Basic Science mentor, a secondary mentor from a translational science discipline and a Technology Mentor. This combined mentoring approach will ensure a mentoring relationship that focuses on developing the skills necessary for translating basic or behavioral urologic research findings from bench to bedside, to community. This includes an understanding and working knowledge of the scientific method, particularly hypothesis development, experimental design, statistical methods, and the responsible conduct of research. In summary, Case Western Reserve Urology is a member of one of the largest, well- organized medical research centers with vast resources and has both the capabilities and the desire to support the career development of competitive new investigators in multidisciplinary research in WLUTD through the proposed CIMURG program."
"9533820","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Nausea and vomiting occur with numerous medical treatments and diseases, including cancer chemotherapy and diabetic gastroparesis, which can lead to reduced appetite and nutritional imbalance.  Activation of a gastric vagal neural circuit i believed to play a primary role in emetic signaling; however, gastric vagal emetic signaling essentially remains a black box. The following fundamental mechanistic questions are unanswered:  (1) how are emetic signals coded in the vagus by activation of specific fiber subtypes, temporal patterns, or gastric receptive fields?  (2) Do different emetic stimuli produce the same vagal emetic message?  (3) What are the mechanisms responsible for the history-dependence of the gastric emetic system?  The goal of this project is to develop joint electrophysiology and infrared (IR) technology that will permit detailed functional neural circuit mapping for the control of the gastric emetic pathway as a potential therapy for nausea and emesis.  Our team has the unique expertise to achieve this goal.  Dr. Horn has developed a system to interrogate and analyze the activity of individual vagal units while recording the emetic reflex in the musk shrew (emetic reflexes are absent in rats and mice).  Drs.  Jenkins and Chiel have initiated work using an IR technology that can stimulate or inhibit sub-populations of axons with high spatial precision.  Dr. Lewis has expertise in selectively activating/inhibiting vagal su-populations and in monitoring the molecular biological mechanisms associated with vagal activity.  We will complete two AIMS:  (1) Develop electrophysiology/IR mapping technology and apply it to characterize the topography and fiber types of gastric afferents within the vagus.  To determine how fibers carrying gastric afferent signals are organized topographically within the vagus, we will develop a novel electrophysiology/IR mapping technology.  We will develop a multi-optical fiber device that allows illumination of different regions circumferentially, and combine this with an electrophysiological technique that examines individual units in vagal fascicles.  (2) Extend the electrophysiology/IR technology to determine and control temporal patterns of vagal activity in response to classical versus clinically relevant emetogenic stimuli.  We will examine the patterning of activity in the vagus, and role of IR laser inhibition, in response to stomach-related emetic stimuli, mechanical distension, chemical irritation (using copper sulfate), and the cancer chemotherapy agent cisplatin.  Our approach is innovative because we are combining cutting edge electrophysiology and IR technology to develop spatial and temporal maps of the gastric vagal organ system.  This project is significant because it will elucidate precise vagal emetic mechanisms that must be modulated to control emesis; therefore, producing the critical knowledge base urgently needed to facilitate the development of new strategies to treat patients with intractable nausea and vomiting.  More generally, the technology could have great utility for understanding other aspects of vagal and peripheral nerve function."
"9330211","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Northwestern University Udall Center of Excellence in Parkinson's disease Research, now in its 10th year. In the last award period, this highly productive research team made fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease, resulting in over 50 peer-reviewed publications. Our studies also motivated a successful Phase II clinical trial with isradipine. The program continues under the direction of Dr. D. James Surmeier. There are 4 scientific projects, 1 translational project, an administrative core and a molecular biology core built around 2 central themes: 1) the determinants of selective neuronal vulnerability in Parkinson's disease and 2) the determinants of the network pathophysiology responsible for the core motor symptoms of the disease. Project 1, directed by Dr. Surmeier, builds upon ground-breaking work in the last grant period to pursue the role of the pedunculopontine nucleus and nicotine in regulating oxidant stress in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Project 2, directed by Dr. Savio Chan, pursues the mechanisms governing the emergence of synchronous rhythmic bursting in globus pallidus neurons in Parkinson's disease, focusing on a novel class of these neurons that project to the striatum. Project 3, directed by Dr. Mark Bevan, explores the role of cortical and pallidal input t the subthalamic nucleus in driving oscillatory behavior in Parkinson's disease. Project 4, directed by Dr. Charles Wilson, explores the mechanisms underlying the symptomatic benefit of deep brain stimulation. Project 5, directed by Dr. Richard Miller, is a translational project; this  project will test the neuroprotective potential of a novel selective antagonist of Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels, as well as two anti-inflammatory agents; this project will also test the ability of  novel gene therapy targeting GluN2D-containing glutamate receptors to produce symptomatic relief in a Parkinson's disease model. These projects make use of advanced molecular, optogenetic, pharmacogenomics, imaging and electrophysiological approaches to achieve their aims. The administrative core will oversee the program budget/subcontract arrangements, biannual meetings, external and internal advisory committees, archiving and distribution of program publications, compilation and submission of annual NIH program renewal applications, and maintenance of a program web page. The molecular core will provide gene expression analysis for each of the projects, provide consultation and assistance for genotyping, and provide assistance in the design and construction of viral vectors for gene knockdown and to provide assistance in the design and construction of viral vectors for gene delivery. The successful attainment of our programmatic goals should bring us closer to meeting the two grand challenges facing the Parkinson's disease research community: to develop a disease-modifying therapy and to develop better, longer lasting symptomatic therapies."
"9340034","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is suggested to play a critical role in cognition through its extensive glutamatergic innervation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These MD terminals provide AMPA-mediated excitation to both excitatory pyramidal neurons and gamma-aminobutyric (GABA)-ergic inhibitory interneurons. GABAergic interneurons, particularly the parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking subtype, are fundamental in regulating the output of their neighboring pyramidal neurons, maintaining the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, and coordinating synchronous activity in populations of neurons. Interestingly, this neuronal subtype receives MD inputs, and their activity has been linked to working memory, attention, and executive functions associated with the PFC. However, how inhibitory interneurons are modulated by MD thalamocortical input remains unknown. We hypothesize that MD afferents drive mPFC inhibitory activity, aiding in the regulation of local circuit activity and thus optimizing performance on mPFC dependent tasks. This is based on feedforward inhibition observed not only in primary thalamic relays, but also recent evidence of this phenomenon in the anterior cingulate cortex. Given this, we propose that downregulation of MD activity will impair GABAergic activity in the prelimbic mPFC, causing dysregulation of local circuit activity, and cognitive deficits. To explore this possibility, we utilize Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) that allow us to selectively target glutamatergic MD neurons, and transiently inhibit their activity in adult rats by expression of the inhibitory hM4D receptor. Using pharmacogenetics, we can evaluate the consequences of MD inhibition by two primary methodologies. With the designer ligand, Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO), we will treat animals systemically and explore the effects of MD inhibition on mPFC-dependent behaviors using a working memory and cognitive flexibility task. We will also take slices containing the mPFC and MD afferents, bath apply CNO, and determine resultant changes in the circuitry using whole cell-recordings. Thus far, we have successfully demonstrated that MD inhibition resulted in a significant decrease of GABAAR-mediated IPSCs in PFC pyramidal neurons. This loss in IPSCs appears to be greater at ?1- GABAARs. Further, these decreases of GABA activity in the PFC are associated with cognitive dysfunction in our MD-inhibited animals. Using a T- maze delayed-alternation task, we have shown that MD inhibition impairs working memory performance, which can be rescued by treatment with the GABAergic ?1-positive allosteric modulator, indiplon. These findings raise intriguing questions of how MD inhibition mechanistically influences mPFC local circuitry, and whether the MD regulates the mPFC through PV interneurons to impact cognition. We will further address these questions using a combination of surgical, electrophysiological, behavioral, and pharmacogenetic techniques."

"9324221","HUMAN IMAGING CORE SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The focus of the Human Imaging Core (Director: Dr. Bradley Erickson) is to provide critical human imaging capabilities to MTPC investigators and extended national and international faculty by making a variety of services available. These include imaging protocol development; image transfer, management and storage; volumetric and other quantitative analysis (cyst distribution, cyst parenchyma-surface area, Dual energy CT) and advanced MR imaging analysis (renal blood flow measurements, intracranial aneurysm detection, and MR elastography) of affected organs in ADPKD. During the past grant cycle to date, the Human Imaging Core has provided image analysis for six NIH, two PKD Foundation, five industry, and three Mayo funded clinical studies or trials. These include volumetric analysis of 2,669 CT and 2,434 MR scans of kidneys or livers, in addition to MR measurements of RBF and other image analyses in a smaller number of patients. The volumetric analysis alone has taken approximately 5,613 hours. The Human Imaging Core has also assisted in the design and management of MR images from Mayo patients with ADPKD participating in multicenter clinical trials (CRISP and HALT) and the protocol development for DIPAK 1 (a clinical trial of Lanreotide supported by the Dutch Kidney Foundation and IPSEN Pharmaceutica). In addition, six new core services that were developed during the prior period: automated kidney segmentation from stereology, image-based classification of patients, magnetic resonance elastography, dual energy CT to characterize renal stones, renal blood flow, cyst- parenchyma surface area, are now available to researchers. Furthermore, the Human Imaging Core actively develops new technologies to enhance the breadth of offerings or the value of the current services. Technologies under development include: novel imaging methods for characterizing PKD (magnetization transfer imaging, diffusion, and blood-oxygen level determination) and differentiating cysts and parenchymal tissues. In addition to providing the services, the core offers training in these techniques. The core has educated and trained a large number of individuals from across the world on the proper use of tools to measure TKV and has also shared some of our algorithms developed in the past grant cycle. For these reasons, we believe that the Human Imaging Core is a critical resource for the study of PKD, and is a unique strength of the current application, as no other PKD Center has such a core."
"9457280","Project Summary/Abstract Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a progressive and fatal disease. Sustained pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling are the major causes for the elevated PVR and PAP in IPAH patients. An increase in cytosolic Ca ([Ca ]cyt) in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) is a major  2+ 2+ trigger for pulmonary vasoconstriction and for pulmonary vascular remodeling due to its stimulatory effect on PASMC proliferation and migration. Abnormally enhanced Ca2+ entry in PASMC because of upregulated expression of membrane receptors (e.g., CaSR) and Ca2+ channels (e.g., TRPC6/C3) contributes to the development and progression of PAH. Downregulation of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel expression and decrease in Kv currents (IK(V)) in PASMC contribute to a) increasing PASMC contraction, proliferation and migration by inducing membrane depolarization that opens voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and raises [Ca ]cyt and b) inhibiting PASMC apoptosis by attenuating apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and maintaining 2+ high [K ]cyt to inhibit caspases. Enhanced PASMC proliferation and inhibited PASMC apoptosis both contribute  + to pulmonary vascular wall thickening. Our data show that selectively increased miRNAs are involved in posttranscriptionally downregulating Kv channels to stimulate PASMC proliferation and inhibit PASMC apoptosis in IPAH patients. Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G protein-coupled receptor that can be activated by extracellular Ca2+, is upregulated in IPAH-PASMC compared to normal PASMC. Activation of CaSR in IPAH-PASMC induces receptor-operated Ca entry (ROCE) via diacylglycerol (DAG), while IP3-mediate active 2+ depletion of Ca2+ from the SR results in store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Extracellular Ca2+-induced CaSR activation also inhibits Kv channels and activate other signal transduction pathways to induce cell proliferation. The overall goal of this research program is to continue to investigate: i) the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the posttranscriptional downregulation of Kv channels and other K+ channels by miRNAs that are enhanced in PASMC from IPAH patients; ii) the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional upregulation of CaSR and receptor-operated (ROC) and store-operated (SOC) Ca2+ channels (e.g., TRPC3/C6, TRPV1, Orai1/2 and STIM1/2) in PASMC from IPAH patients; iii) the cellular and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the CaSR-mediated functional activation of TRPC/Orai channels (and STIM1/2 oligomerization and translocation) and functional inhibition of Kv channels in PASMC from IPAH patients; and iv) the potential targets involved in the pathogenic Ca2+ signaling that can be used to develop novel therapy or combination therapy for PAH. Our laboratory has extensive research and technical experience in studying pathogenic mechanisms of IPAH and pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxic lung disease. The forthcoming results from these studies will provide highly impactful insights into developing novel therapies for IPAH and other forms of pulmonary hypertension."
"9410597","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Career Goal: My career goal is to become a leading epidemiologist focused on improving engagement in HIV care in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Through this K99/R00 proposal, I hope to merge my training as an epidemiologist with the field of implementation science. With this skill set, I plan to build a career focused on implementing interventions to retain or re-engage HIV-infected women in HIV care in the peripartum period. Career Development: I will focus on training in implementation science and professional development during the mentored (K99) phase of this award. Training in implementation science will focus in 3 key areas: 1) core concepts and theories 2) using technology to implement more effective HIV program monitoring systems, and 3) qualitative research to inform implementation strategies. Professional development training will include coursework, seminars, building my reputation as an emerging HIV researcher, and a detailed plan for a successful transition to a tenure-track position. Research Project: The scale-up of antiretroviral treatment (ART) to all pregnant and breastfeeding women under Option B+ has the potential to change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic. However, in order for the potential of Option B+ to be realized, women must be retained in HIV care and those who are lost to follow-up (LTFU) must be re-engaged in care. Few efforts to re-engage women in HIV care exist. Routine HIV program monitoring is an evidence-based intervention that is vital to track women's engagement in HIV care under Option B+, but is limited in its ability accurately distinguish women who are LTFU from those who have transferred to another HIV clinic. Identifying women who are LTFU is essential for timely re-engagement in HIV care. The goal of the proposed project is to evaluate whether enhancing HIV program monitoring with technology may be an implementation strategy to accurately identify women who are LTFU. The project goal will be achieved through the following four Specific Aims: K99/1) To explore attitudes towards using technology for HIV program monitoring, K99/2) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of 3 implementation strategies to improve HIV program monitoring, R00/3) To evaluate enhanced HIV program monitoring as an implementation strategy, R00/4) To evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced program monitoring to improve the accuracy of HIV program monitoring. Mentorship: A highly accomplished, multidisciplinary team of experts will mentor me in the first two years of this award and provide ongoing guidance as I transition to independence. This mentoring team includes: Dr. Mina Hosseinipour (Primary Mentor, Department of Medicine, UNC; UNC-Project Malawi), Dr. Vivian Go (Co-mentor, Department of Health Behavior, UNC) and Dr. William Miller (Co-mentor, Department of Epidemiology, Ohio State), and Dr. Lisa Hightow-Weidman (Adviser, Department of Medicine, UNC). Future Directions: The training and research in this proposal will prepare me to submit an R01 application that uses technology-enhanced HIV program monitoring to identify women who are LTFU and develops a re-engagement in HIV care intervention."
"9339554","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The etiology and pathophysiology of Gulf War Veterans' Illness (GWVI) remain poorly understood and treatments are lacking. Most studies suggest that GWVI may be the result of exposure to drugs designed to protect military personnel from a chemical warfare attack and from insects. These drugs include: 1) pyridostigmine bromide (PB) - a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) - that prevents nerve agents, such as sarin, from inhibiting AChE permanently; 2) permethrin (PET) - an insecticide whose mechanism of action is to block neuronal sodium channels; and 3) DEET - an insect repellent. These drugs target the nervous system and in particular, via the inhibition of AChE, the cholinergic system. Although these drugs are safe at the doses given to GW personnel, it has been hypothesized that their combination together with the stress encountered during the GW deployment may have contributed collectively to generate the multi-symptom disease, GWVI. This has been tested in toxin/stress animal models with considerable success. Recent landmark studies performed on GW Veterans and non-deployed Veterans indicate that pathophysiology of GWVI involves abnormalities in the function of the cholinergic parasympathetic system. Moreover, cognitive and sleep disturbances that characterize GWVI are consistent with a dysfunction of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) whose normal activity is central to the processes of memory, attention and sleep. Together the data point to the possibility that the GW-associated exposure to the above-listed drugs and to stress caused a long-term dysfunction of cholinergic neurons within central nervous system (CNS). Therefore it would be desirable to design treatment modalities that could restore the normal functioning of cholinergic neurons and their targets in patients with GWVI. One strategy to accomplish this goal would be to use trophic factors that support neuronal viability and function. Specifically brain derived neurotrophic facto (BDNF) that signals via its receptor, TrkB. The central parasympathetic neurons and BFCN express TrkB. BDNF increases BFCN survival and elevates their cholinergic marker expression in cell culture and it is necessary for postnatal maturation of BFCN in vivo. BDNF prevents axotomy-induced degeneration and loss of cholinergic marker expression in BFCN in rats. However, BDNF does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is a potent and selective TrkB agonist that readily enters the brain. Beneficial effects of 7,8-DHF have been reported in models of PTSD, PD, AD and Rett syndrome. We found that 7,8-DHF is effective in mouse models of ALS and AD. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to test the hypothesis that administration of 7,8-DHF and/or moderate exercise (MEX) - interventions known to generate a trophic neuronal environment - will cause a recovery of brain function in a mouse model of GWVI optimized for the studies of cholinergic neurons. Specifically, we will use the CHGFP transgenic mouse line that expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP) exclusively in cholinergic cells. This permits the purification of these cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and facilitates their visualization with microscopic imaging techniques. These mice will be exposed to the GWVI- associated drug combination (PB/PET/DEET) together with restraint stress, and then to our therapeutic regimens (i.e. 7,8-DHF and/or MEX) that will be employed immediately after the exposure, or after a delay of 4 weeks to treat an established illness. These studies incorporate principles of rational pharmacology and behavioral evaluation combined with state-of- the-art MR imaging and spectroscopy, physiological telemetry as well as neuropathological, neurochemical and gene-analytic techniques to define the therapeutic benefits of a novel neurotrophic compound that crosses the BBB as well as a non-pharmacological treatment modality in a unique GWVI mouse model. In addition, our studies will contribute to our understanding of the basic biology of cholinergic neurons and their role in GWVI and further characterize a novel animal model for future use to test therapeutics relevant to patients with GWVI."
"9319253","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often leads to irreversible deterioration of renal function that progresses to End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD). CKD has emerged as a serious public health problem and data obtained from the USRDS reveals that the number of new cases of ESKD in the United States is projected exceed 700,00 patients by 2015. As glomerular diseases secondary to podocyte dysfunction contribute up to 90% of all ESKD, a detailed molecular and genetic approach to identify mechanisms for podocyte development and repair may give us new insights for developing therapeutic agents and targets. Recent evidence suggests that cell matrix interactions are critical during podocyte health and disease, and are regulated by proteases, such as calpain. To further determine the importance, we have also identified that podocyte calapin activity induces endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), an adaptive process put in place to protect cells from pathologic stimuli. In our preliminary data, we demonstrate marked talin1 proteolysis and activation of ER stress following podocyte injury, which are both attenuated with pharmacological inhibition of calpain. In Aim 1, we will define and further characterize the importance of podocyte specific calpain activity in modulating cell matrix regulation. In Aim 2, we will examine the mechanisms of calpain activation leading to ER stress and how it contributes to podocyte dysfunction. By completing these aims, we will have an opportunity to further expand our knowledge of calpain regulation and its downstream effects in podocyte homeostasis."
"9528133","Catalytic cross-coupling methods that form carbon-carbon bonds have become an essential tool of medicinal chemistry and revolutionized organic synthesis, but the need for pre-formed organometallic reagents remains a challenge. Limited commercial availability and limited stability translate to extra steps in synthesis. Because carbon electrophiles, such as organic halides, are more abundant than carbon nucleophiles, an attractive solution to this problem is the cross-coupling of two different electrophiles. Although the dimerization of electrophiles has been known for 100 years, achieving cross-selectivity and understanding its origins remain the central challenges of cross-electrophile coupling. This program?s long-term goals are the development of general, selective cross-electrophile reactions and the explanation of the factors that control selectivity and reactivity. In the proposed grant, a team composed of graduate students, a postdoc, and a lab technician will build upon the advances of the previous grant period to develop cross-electrophile coupling reactions based around two mechanistic models, and develop new ligands to support these efforts. Our guiding mechanistic hypothesis is that selective cross-coupling arises from systems where one persistent intermediate reacts with a transient, reactive intermediate. In the first case, the persistent intermediate is an organonickel species and the transient intermediate is an organic radical. In the second case, the persistent intermediate is an organopalladium species and the transient intermediate is an organonickel species. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) dramatically expand the number of electrophiles that can participate in radical-mediated cross-electrophile coupling and to further study the reactive intermediates in the proposed mechanism; (2) study a new mechanistic model for cross-electrophile coupling, multimetallic cross-electrophile coupling, and develop new cross-electrophile couplings of electrophiles that do not as easily form carbon radicals; and, (3) discover and study new ligands for cross-electrophile coupling through both mechanism-guided design and the screening of novel ligand libraries. The approach is innovative because it focuses on cross-electrophile coupling, a rapidly growing area that is complementary to the better-studied areas of cross-coupling and C-H functionalization. By focusing on an area that has not been extensively studied, there is the potential to discover new types of bond disconnections and new, general mechanisms. The proposed research is significant because it will enable the coupling of easily accessible building blocks in new combinations, simplifying organic synthesis. In addition, our mechanistic studies will shed light on fundamental questions of selectivity and cooperative catalysis, laying a foundation for further development in several fields."

"9395577","PROJECT SUMMARY  Several recent studies have identified that many noncoding regions in the genome are associated with a variety of human diseases. Interestingly, many of these genetic risk regions contain long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, our understanding of the roles that lncRNAs have in normal biology and in human pathologies is lagging far behind. This gap in our knowledge limits the ability to advance the diagnosis and treatment of human disease as well as develop novel therapeutics. My long-term goal is to understand the in vivo functions of lncRNAs in both development and disease by employing novel genetic approaches in mouse models and ex vivo culture systems. Toward this end, I have honed in on a lncRNA, Firre, that has roles in nuclear organization and has been implicated in a poorly understood human developmental brain pathology, periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH), that effects cortical neurogenesis. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether cortical neurogenesis is impaired in a Firre overexpression context and determine the modalities of gene expression. Toward this end, I will overexpress Firre RNA by using a novel mouse model that I have recently generated. Brains from male and female control and Firre- overexpression mice will be assessed at key stages during neural development for cortical thickness as well as for the number and identity of cortical neurons. My preliminary data indicates that Firre-overexpressing mice have smaller cortical regions. Toward determining the molecular consequences of Firre-overexpression in neural tissue, I will perform performing RNA-seq on neural tissues at different neurogenic time points in male and female Firre overexpressing mice. This proposed research is significant because it will, for the first time, directly address the role of the long noncoding RNA, Firre, in neurogenesis as well as in the context of a poorly studied developmental neuronal disease, PNH. Therefore, this novel mouse could serve as a new model to understand the causes and mechanisms for the complex developmental neural malformation, PNH. Collectively, this approach will lead to a much-needed understanding of the physiological roles of lncRNAs resulting from the consequences of their genetic modulation."
"9339969","Abstract  Between 30-75% of cancer patients receiving adjuvant therapy experience a decline in cognitive ability termed Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment (CRCI). These impairments include difficulty with memory and attention, which may impact day-to-day life and work performance. Up to 35% of cancer patients continue to experience CRCI for months to years after treatment completion, suggesting a long-term cognitive deficiency. Developing quantitative methods to detect the neural correlates of CRCI, and treatments to mitigate its symptoms will be imperative to improve cancer patients' quality of life. However, such advances will require a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying CRCI.  Studies on CRCI have demonstrated objective cognitive impairments on neuropsychological exams in patients following cancer treatment. The most frequently impaired cognitive domains include memory, executive functioning, processing speed, and attention. Chemotherapy, hormone therapy and other cancer treatments are thought to impair cognitive functioning by altering specific brain structures and/or impairing connectivity between brain regions. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are known to be integrally involved in memory and executive functioning, and are particularly sensitive to the effects of such treatments. Moreover, structural and functional imaging studies suggest that adjuvant cancer therapies target the structure of brain hub regions within in resting state networks, as well as overall resting state connectivity integrity. While evidence is clear for cognitive decline as well as structural and functional changes in patients treated with adjuvant therapies, the precise mechanism of impairment is poorly understood.  Our preliminary findings revealed shape deformation on the surface of the hippocampus in breast cancer patients. Furthermore our group found that patients exhibit functional hypoactivation in the hippocampus on a task of covert memory, and hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on a task of working memory. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that impairments in hippocampal-PFC and other resting state networks involving the hippocampus contribute to cognitive deficits in CRCI. We will utilize multimodal imaging to examine how structural integrity of the components of the hippocampal-PFC network (Aim 1) and functional connectivity within this network (Aim 2) relate to specific cognitive measures. Finally, we will examine whether other regions and network connections, specifically within resting state networks, account for cognitive impairment (Aim 3). Results of this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of CRCI. Further, this work may aid in the development of markers for cognitive impairment in this population and provide key anatomical targets for effective intervention."

"9241627","ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 1-2% of people over 65. The classic motor symptoms of PD result from selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), resulting in a loss of their long-projecting axonal inputs to the striatum. Current treatment strategies [e.g., dopamine replacement, deep brain stimulation (DBS)] can only minimize the symptoms of nigrostriatal degeneration, not directly replace the lost pathway. Therefore, we propose a novel regenerative medicine solution, whereby custom-built micro-tissue engineered neural networks (TENNs) are transplanted to physically replace the axonal connections from the SNpc to the striatum. Specifically, micro- TENNs will be transplanted in rodent and porcine models of PD to directly replace SNpc neurons, restore axonal inputs to the striatum, and ameliorate motor deficits. Our overarching hypothesis is that preformed micro-TENNs comprised of dopaminergic neurons and long-projecting axonal tracts will survive, synaptically integrate, and thereby physically reconstruct the nigrostriatal pathway to restore motor function in models of nigrostriatal deafferentation. To test this hypothesis, we propose three aims: (1) Determine optimal in vitro techniques to create dopaminergic micro-TENNs, using both differentiated neurons as well as stem-cell derived neurons; (2) Assess micro-TENN capabilities to reconstruct the nigrostriatal pathway, restore dopaminergic inputs, and ameliorate motor symptoms rodents; (3) Apply human-scale micro-TENNs to reconstruct the nigrostriatal pathway in swine. Living dopaminergic micro-TENNs will be constructed with an architecture consisting of a discrete population of neurons with unidirectional long-projecting axonal tracts. Micro-TENN health, phenotype, structure, and function will be optimized in vitro. To enable clinical translation, we will construct human-scale micro-TENNs using human stem cell derived dopaminergic neurons. Preformed constructs will be stereotactically microinjected into neurodegenerative PD rat and pig models to assess circuit reconstruction and motor symptom amelioration. Nigrostriatal pathway reconstruction will be assessed using behavioral, imaging, electrophysiological, and histological outcomes. The proposed work will establish the future clinical potential of personalized micro-TENNs to ameliorate PD motor symptoms by restoring the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. Our micro-tissue engineering strategy addresses a crucial gap in clinical treatment by providing a means to directly replace the nigrostriatal pathway and, as a result, restore motor function following PD neurodegeneration. By virtue of their long axonal tracts, micro-TENNs may be capable of replacing degenerated circuitry to restore dopaminergic inputs to the striatum. Our custom process to generate micro-TENNs enables a precisely engineered structure where the number of neurons and generation of dopamine can be known prior to implantation, thus, alleviating issues of inconsistency historically seen in fetal tissue grafts. Therefore, micro-TENNs may provide a transformative and scalable solution to permanently replace lost neuroanatomy and alleviate the cause of motor symptoms for the millions of patient afflicted by PD."
"9380825","Abstract Severe and emerging respiratory virus infections are responsible for considerable human morbidity and mortality and threaten global health. Importantly, significant individual to individual variation in immune responses after infection regulates disease severity, a process that is heavily influenced by natural host genetic variation in human populations. In this backdrop, new paradigms are needed to achieve the promise of precision medicine, early disease diagnosis/prognosis, susceptibility and risk assessment, and personalized treatment. To address this theme, our research programs leverage forward genetic screens in the newly developed collaborative cross (CC) mouse resource to map, identify, and elucidate the polygenic immune interactions and molecular mechanisms that govern disease severity following highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection. Using the SARS-CoV model, natural genetic variation in the CC expands the range and composition of respiratory disease phenotypes, corresponding to selective forces that have shaped human immunity. Aim 1 seeks to define quantitative trait loci governing immunity to SARS-CoV and related viruses. Aim 2 identifies causal gene candidates within the QTL and seeks to derive mechanistic insights. Finally, Aim 3 integrates these findings across different disease models and between mouse models and human patients. Overall, the goal is to identify the mechanism by which polygenetic traits drive differential disease, to predict and then test disease outcomes in genetically distinct lines that contain different admixtures of susceptibility loci, and to integrate these findings across diverse disease models and species."
"9351189","Leiomyoma (Uterine fibroids) is a major disease that affects women but remains shockingly understudied with  few nonsurgical therapeutic options. Leiomyoma is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular  matrix and enhanced proliferation and tumorigenesis of uterine smooth muscle cells. The roles of estrogen and  progesterone and their nuclear receptors (NRs) and transforming growth factor ???TGF???signaling in  leiomyoma are well established. However, the broader role of the nuclear receptor superfamily and their cross  talk with TGF? signaling pathways in leiomyoma remain as some of the major unanswered questions. The  long-term goal of this project is to establish systematically the roles of nuclear receptors (NRs) and their  ligands and to understand how TGF? signaling is altered in leiomyoma. The goal of this project is to determine  the novel roles of NR4A subfamily members, including NR4A1 (NGF1B), NR4A2 (NURR1), and NR4A3  (NOR1) in leiomyoma. We performed expression profiling of leiomyoma tissues and adjacent normal  myometrium for all 48 human NRs and demonstrated severe deficiency of the NR4A subfamily members,  including NR4A1 (NGF1B), NR4A2 (NURR1), and NR4A3 (NOR1), in leiomyoma. Our preliminary results show  that NR4A functions by regulating expression of key profibrotic factors such as TGF?3 and SMAD3 and key  extracellular matrix components such as collagen 1A1. Furthermore, NR4As regulate proliferation of  leiomyoma primary smooth muscle cells. We hypothesize that the NR4A family of nuclear receptors plays  critical and integrative roles involving TGF?? and SMAD signaling in leiomyoma development by regulating key  proliferation and profibrotic genes. The specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: Determine how NR4A and TGF??  /SMAD signaling pathways interact to regulate pro-fibrotic genes in leiomyoma. Specific Aim 2: Determine the  roles of NR4As and their selective modulators in leiomyoma cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.  The proposed aims will advance our knowledge of this highly prevalent public health challenge for which  treatment options are currently limited at best. The proposed work is scientifically, translationally, and clinically  significant because it provides a new perspective on and better understanding of the mechanisms underlying  leiomyoma development and opens up possibilities for identifying additional therapeutic targets and strategies.  It is innovative because it represents the first systematic exploration of previously unrealized roles of the NR4A  nuclear receptor family in leiomyoma biology."

"9380637","Asthma is a prevalent, chronic inflammatory disease of the airways associated with a range of adverse health outcomes. Sleep difficulties are often viewed as a consequence of nocturnal awakenings due to nighttime asthma symptoms, which will resolve with appropriate treatment of asthma symptoms. However, insomnia symptoms occur even in those asthmatics without asthma-related nocturnal awakenings, thus representing comorbid insomnia. Our prior work suggests that insomnia can negatively impact asthma control by further limiting engagement in activities and quality of life and increasing the risk for future asthma exacerbations and need for emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Our proposed study adopts a novel perspective on the interaction between insomnia and asthma control: targeted treatments for insomnia could improve asthma control and reduce the burden of disease. We propose to test the efficacy of a Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia (CBT-I) intervention on sleep and asthma control in adults. We will compare two randomized interventions: (1) a self-guided, real-world applicable, Internet version of CBT-I, Sleep Healthy Using The Internet (SHUTi), and (2) an enhanced usual care (EUC), involving an educational video on insomnia. The aims of this proposed study are: (1) to compare the efficacy of SHUTi vs. EUC on sleep outcomes at 3 and 6 months after initiation of treatment in adults with asthma and comorbid insomnia, (2) to compare the efficacy of SHUTi vs. EUC on changes in asthma control from baseline to 3 and 6 months, and (3) to determine whether changes in sleep mediate the effects of treatment on asthma control at 3 and 6 months. Our exploratory aim is to determine whether changes in biomarkers of airway inflammation across 3- and 6-month follow-up account for the relationship between changes in sleep (from baseline to 3 months) and improvements in asthma control. The use of an efficacious, low cost, Internet-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention for insomnia can provide a treatment option that could be delivered in real-world clinical settings. Findings from our study could encourage the inclusion of insomnia?as a comorbid condition that affects asthma control, and should be identified and treated?into the current guidelines for the proper management of asthma."

"9357577","Project Summary/Abstract Project 1 of the program is entitled Afferent and urothelial plasticity underlying bladder sensitization in prostatic inflammation (Project Leader: Naoki Yoshimura, Department of Urology). Prostatic inflammation is considered to be an important component of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in addition to androgen-mediated ``static'' prostate enlargement and ??dynamic?? ?-adrenoceptor?mediated muscle tension. Previous studies also suggest that asymptomatic prostatic inflammation associated with the development of histological BPH in involved in the emergence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Thus, the following three key aims utilize unique and innovative expertise available in Pittsburgh to identify the detailed mechanisms of bladder overactivity, urothelial dysfunction and afferent hyperexcitability after prostatic inflammation, which reportedly contribute to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We will also aim to determine whether treatments of local NGF antisense application, COX-2 inhibition or 5?-reductase inhibition can reverse the pathological processes initiated by prostatic inflammation.  In this application, we propose to extend our previously NIDDK P20 research project (DK090919, PI: Wang) entitled ?University of Pittsburgh Planning Center for Benign Prostate Hyperplasia Research?, by critical evaluation of new mechanisms and development of innovative treatment options for male LUTS induced by prostatic inflammation. For this purpose, we will utilize an animal model of prostatic inflammation induced by local injection of formalin, , which was developed in our previously funded P20 project. First, we will study the changes in bladder function and functional/molecular properties of afferent neurons innervating the prostate and/or bladder to identify the role of prostate-to-bladder afferent cross sensitization in the development of LUTS due to prostatic inflammation. Secondly, we will examine whether prostatic inflammation induces bladder urothelial dysfunction, which also contributes to LUTS development. Lastly, we will seek to elucidate whether intravesical application of NGF antisense conjugated with liposomes targeting urothelial NGF production, COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib) or 5?-reductase inhibitors (finasteride) can reverse functional and molecular changes in the bladder, urothelium and prostate/bladder afferent pathways initiated by prostatic inflammation in the rat model.  The long-term objectives of the research program are to identify new and effective targets and methods for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH.

"9276494","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Cell based therapy holds promise for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such Parkinson's disease (PD), by providing replacement cells for dopaminergic neurons lost to disease or through neuroprotection of host tissue. There has been great progress in differentiation of dopaminergic progenitor cells (DAPCs) into replacement neurons as well as in transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to rescue diseased host neurons. However, most animal model and human studies of PD rely on highly invasive intra-cerebral injections to deliver cell based therapy to the brain. Not only do such multiple needle injections pose risks of life threatening complications such as hemorrhage or infection, but their efficacy is usually limited by inadequate migration of cells from the needle track. New methods of cellular delivery that are both less invasive and have superior capacity to distribute stem cells in appropriate brain regions are needed. This study will explore and combine two novel strategies with potential for less harmful and better distributed delivery of stem cells to brain. Previous studies  have used MRI guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) to produce minimally invasive, regionally targeted, safe, and transient opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to enhance brain delivery of therapeutics. Ultrasonic treatment also enhances homing of human MSCs to target tissues, but has not yet been studied in brain. Potentially a dramatic improvement over current methods, FUS mediated BBB opening alone results in a relatively low efficiency transfer of therapeutics from bloodstream to brain. Another complementary technology could enhance efficacy of this transfer. Growing evidence (including our own work) shows that external magnets can influence the retention of stem cells loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) in brain. We will assess the capacity of external magnets to enhance brain delivery and retention of SPION loaded stem cells after FUS mediated opening of the BBB. We will also assess the role of homing in entry of cells into brain during this process. The goal of this first study of it kind is to develop a strategy to deliver stem cells to the striatum and improve brain structure and  function in an animal model of PD using a safe, effective and clinically applicable method. Aim 1) To determine the capacity of an external magnet to enhance delivery and retention of SPION loaded stem cells from bloodstream to brain after MRgFUS mediated opening of the BBB. A) Although injection into the carotid artery is the most efficient route to deliver a blood borne therapy to brain, is this more invasive route required for stem cell delivery after FUS mediated BBB? B) What is the optimal design, strength and timing of application of the external magnet. C) Do cells enter brain after MRgFUS by diffusion through gaps between brain endothelial cells, or does FUS mediate changes to enhance cell adherence or chemo-attraction? We will compare the number and distribution of stem cells within striatum after FUS mediated BBB opening and magnetic attraction using two different types of human stem cells (neural progenitor cells or mesenchymal stem cells) with known differences in capacity for homing to injured tissue. These experiments will be performed with FUS alone and in combination with the application of powerful magnets applied to the head. Aim 2) We will then target the delivery of SPION loaded DAPCs or MSCs to the damaged striatum in a rat model of PD. The region of the affected striatum will be subjected to MRgFUS mediated BBB opening followed by injection of these two forms of beneficial stem cells along with application of an external magnet. Animals will be evaluated with histologic methods to assess DA differentiation and restoration of DA innervation, and for signs of functional improvement in motor behavior. These pilot experiments will determine the feasibility of this minimally invasive strategy to enhance stem cell transplantation for patients with PD."
"9348633","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney disease is worldwide health problem that is becoming increasingly prevalent. Primary glomerular disease, both acquired and genetic, represents a significant proportion of these cases. We are interested in understanding the makeup of the glomerular filtration barrier and how it becomes damaged and leaky to plasma proteins. Our focus over the last sixteen years has been to investigate the composition and function of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), a specialized extracellular matrix that is an integral component of the filtration barrier. The GBM contains laminin, collagen IV, nidogen, and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin. Our studies of mice lacking the laminin beta2 chain suggests that the GBM itself serves as a barrier to albumin and protects podocytes from the injurious effects of plasma proteins, as mice lacking laminin beta2 develop nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Mutations in human LAMB2 have also been shown to cause kidney disease; null mutations cause Pierson syndrome (congenital nephrotic syndrome with ocular and nervous system abnormalities), whereas missense mutations cause congenital nephrotic syndrome with less severe extrarenal manifestations. Our recent studies have shown that some of these missense mutations impair secretion of laminin-521 into the GBM, and that increased secretion of even mutant forms could be beneficial for patients carrying such mutations. The focus of this proposal is to find methods to ameliorate kidney disease in patients with GBM defects due to laminin abnormalities and to better understand the role of laminin polymerization in GBM structure and function. To accomplish this, we will 1) perform high throughput screens of drug libraries to find compounds that can promote secretion of mutant LAMB2 chains in vitro; 2) test these compounds in vivo in our mouse models expressing mutant laminin beta2 chains to look for improved secretion and an improved filtration barrier; and 3) characterize activity and function of a human LAMB2 mutation that affects laminin polymerization. The results of these studies will provide important new insights into laminin and basement membrane biology and lead to potential therapies for human glomerular disease involving GBM defects."

"9461334","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tissue cancers, with over 50 histological sub-types. Regardless of type, virtually all STS are treated the same; i.e. with doxorubicin (DOX) followed by resection, if possible. More than 20% of STS are non-resectable and, of those that are, more than 20% recur. For non-resectable or recurring patients, median survival is a dismal 18 months. Perhaps because of its rarity, no new front-line agents have been developed for STS in decades. Among newer agents being developed for STS, TH-302 is showing exceptional promise. TH-302 is an alkylating pro-drug that is activated only in regions of severe hypoxia, and is currently in a phas III trial in combination with DOX in unresectable STS. The primary endpoint of this trial is overal survival with a secondary endpoint of objective radiological response with RECIST 1.1. RECIST responses rarely correlate with survival responses in soft tissue sarcomas, however. The purpose of this work is to develop MR imaging biomarkers that can predict response to DOX and/or TH-302, with the overarching hypothesis that distinct MRI-defined sub-regions of tumors will have differential responses to these agents. Because these sub-regions are defined by their distinct physiology illuminated by combining multiple MR scans, we have termed these as distinct habitats. Because TH-302 is active only in hypoxia, and hypoxia should be represented by a specific habitat, we specifically hypothesize that imaging of the hypoxic habitat can be used to predict and monitor responses to TH-302. The hypoxia habitat is classified as having low perfusion and high cell density. In contrast, the DOX-responsive habitat should be well perfused (yielding higher drug concentrations) and have high cell density (with more drug targets). This represents a conceptual advance as such habitats may provide a common predictive biomarker across the multiple histological sub-types of STS for patient stratification and therapeutic decision support. The approach will follow on preliminary work, wherein delineated habitats were quantitatively identified across multiple histological types and grades of STS by combining T1, contrast- enhanced T1, and T2 STIR MR images. The current proposal is entirely pre-clinical, with the expectation that findings herein can be rapidly translated to clinial care. Preclinical work is justified in that there is greater flexibility to interrogate a wider porfolio of MRI pulse sequences and treatment strategies that can be related to underlying histology and molecular profiling. Aim 1 will quantitatively compare MR-visible habitats to histology and molecular profiles of xenotransplanted tumors. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that tumors with different habitat profiles will be differentially responsive to DOX and/or TH-302. In Aim 3, we wil investigate the effects of metabolic perturbations to affect the hypoxic habitat and thus improve response to TH-302. At the end of this study, we will have developed a new set of MR imaging biomarkers for predicting and monitoring response in this heterogeneous group of diseases, with the expectation that these finding will inform a follow-on study in the clinic."
"9415137","Project Summary A neural interface is needed that will allow for monitoring the diverse neural anatomy in chronic, behaving animal experiments. The state-of-the-art tools including both flexible surface arrays and stiff penetrating arrays have well-known limitations including low signal-to-noise and unstable recordings over time. The goal of this project is to develop and test a novel device concept that combines stretchable substrates with high-density needles to penetrate through the epineurium of ganglia and peripheral nerves. Nothing in this scale has been demonstrated or attempted to date. This approach has the potential to mitigate the poor fidelity of surface arrays and eliminate damage induced from larger penetrating arrays. Initial validation testing on ganglionic and nerve interfaces will yield a variety of control signals from the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic motor and sensory pathways that innervate the bladder and lower urinary tract. Although bladder dysfunction is a significant healthcare problem, the underlying neural control is not well understood. This shortfall of knowledge results in only partially effective therapies, including drugs and neurostimulators. In Aim 1, microneedle array design and fabrication will yield several device iterations will be evaluated in benchtop phantom experiments to demonstrate insertion effectiveness and ease-of-use. In Aim 2, acute and short-term chronic in vivo experiments will allow us to further evaluate and improve usability, demonstrate signal fidelity, and perform histological evaluation. We expect that this technology and subsequent learning opportunities will lead to significant improvements in neuromodulation devices."
"9389815","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Increased cardiac Ang II activity from intracellular or interstitial formation (autocrine/paracrine  mechanisms) is a cause of cardiac hypertrophic remodeling, arrhythmias, and fibrosis. RAS inhibitors are less effective in blocking Ang II-mediated adverse cardiac remodeling because its production within cardiac myocytes follows non-canonical pathways and the plasma membrane imposes a significant barrier to the external environment. The overarching hypothesis of this Program Project Grant is that the non-canonical pathway for intracellular cardiac Ang II production is mediated by a non-renin/ACE pathway. Cardiac chymase, incorporated into these cells from activated mast cells, acts on an endogenously shorter form of angiotensinogen (Aogen) -angiotensin-(1-12) [Ang-(1-12)] - to generate Ang II. The Project leaders' complementary clinical and basic science expertise in this renewal application will address this concept by examining the intracellular pathways and mechanisms accounting for the chymase-mediated Ang II formation and matrix metalloproteinase activation, the potential role of kallikrein  as the Ang-(1-12) generating enzyme from Aogen, and the provocative new finding that estrogen deficiency, by modulating the cardiac intracellular chymase/Ang-(1-12) axis, contributes to the adverse cardiac remodeling and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in postmenopausal women. The integrated research plan employs genetic models of well characterized altered cardiac function and structure (SHR and congenic mRen2.Lewis hypertensive rats; Projects 1 and 3), a cardiac myocyte cell line (HL-1) that maintains cardiac-specific phenotypes, and human left atrial tissue and cardiac pericardial fluid from subjects undergoing cardiac surgery for the correction of mitral regurgitation (Project 2). The additional novel inclusion of studies in rats expressing the human genes for Aogen, chymase, or both will eventually provide a translational laboratory paradigm for unraveling the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of the distinct biotransformation processes by which the human heart regulates production of Ang II in health and disease. Overall, the combined tightly focused efforts of Drs. Ferrario (Project 1), Dell'Italia (Project 2) and Groban (Project 3) will shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of cardiac Ang II contribution to adverse remodeling and progression to heart failure, the distinct ways by which human and rodent cardiac myocytes differ in terms of the cellular pathways for Ang II production, and how chymase and Ang-(1-12) are regulated by estrogen. These discoveries will identify new therapeutic approaches of higher efficacy when compared to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers."

"9415871","Project Summary Modulating the activity of peripheral nerves innervating specific organs and defined cell types within these organs will help us understand the relationship between neural signals and organ function. We propose to develop and validate the use of non-invasive neural modulation in the peripheral nervous system in vivo. Many tools can be used for temporal regulation of neural activity in the CNS, from light activated channels to designer receptors but these are not universally applicable, particularly in the periphery. Optical methods require permanent implants which may be difficult to fix or even cause damage in peripheral tissues. In addition, these tools only activate local neural populations in a small portion of an organ. In contrast, designer receptors and their ligands can target neurons across a larger area but have a relatively slow time course. Neural modulation with radiowaves or magnetic fields allows remote, rapid activation or inhibition of neural activity across an entire organ. We have recently shown that a distinctive combination of non-invasive radiowave and magnetic field signals, biological ferritin nanoparticles and bioengineered ion channels can be used to remotely activate and inhibit CNS neural activity in freely moving animals. Targeted neurons express genetically encoded nanoparticles tethered to a modified ion channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, TRPV1. Radiowaves or magnetic fields freely penetrate tissue to heat and/or move the nanoparticle and activate TRPV1. Modifications of TRPV1 allow either neural activation or silencing. We will now develop and validate tools for non-invasive activation and silencing of peripheral nerves using viral vectors applicable to several species and we will demonstrate their utility by modulating innervation of the endocrine pancreas. Specifically, we will develop, validate and characterize 1) tools for remote activation and inhibition of neurons innervating the pancreas using viruses with retrograde spread and neuron-specific expression of activating or inhibitory constructs and 2) tools for remote activation and inhibition of specific neural pathways (parasympathetic, sympathetic and sensory) innervating the pancreas. We will develop a range of tools for remote modulation of parasympathetic, sympathetic and sensory peripheral nerves innervating an organ. These tools will be broadly applicable and extend the methods available to investigate the physiological roles of peripheral nerves in regulating organ function."
"9339539","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Heart failure represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality among veterans. Cardiac myocyte loss due to apoptosis plays a significant role in the progression of heart failure. A major goal of my laboratory is to investigate the role of osteopontin (OPN), a matricellular protein, in the development of heart failure. Normal heart expresses low levels of OPN. OPN expression increases markedly under a variety of pathophysiological conditions of the heart. Increased OPN expression associates with increased myocyte apoptosis and myocardial dysfunction. Using streptozotocin-induced model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, we have provided evidence that increased OPN expression in myocytes associates with myocyte apoptosis and myocardial dysfunction. The molecular signals involved in OPN-stimulated cardiac myocyte apoptosis have not yet been investigated. Our preliminary data show that OPN induces apoptosis in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Neutralization of CD44 (one of the receptors for OPN) inhibited OPN-stimulated apoptosis. OPN activated merlin (a linker protein between transmembrane proteins and the actin-cytoskeleton), Mst1 (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1), JNKs, and increased levels of cytosolic cytochrome c. Adenoviral-mediated expression of constitutively active merlin activated Mst1, JNKs and induced myocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of JNKs or DRP1 (dynamin related protein 1; a protein involved in mitochondrial fission) inhibited OPN-stimulated apoptosis. OPN treatment increased expression of Gadd-153 and activated caspase-12, suggesting a role for OPN in induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. RT2-qPCR Array analysis identified increased expression of Bik, a p53-regulated BH3-only pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family capable of communicating between ER and mitochondria, in OPN-treated myocytes. Inhibition of JNKs or p53 inhibited OPN-stimulated increases in Bik expression. In vivo, expression of OPN in the adult mouse heart in a cardiac myocyte-specific manner increased myocyte apoptosis and myocardial dysfunction. We hypothesize that OPN acting via CD44 receptor activates Merlin, and activation of merlin induces ER stress and mitochondrial death pathway via the involvement of Mst1/JNK/p53/Bik pathway. Aim 1 will determine receptor/s for OPN in myocytes, and test the hypothesis that OPN acting via CD44 receptor induces ER stress, mitochondrial death pathway, and apoptosis. Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that interaction of OPN with CD44 receptor activates Merlin, and activation of merlin plays a pro-apoptotic role. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that activation of merlin plays a pro-apoptotic role via the involvement of Mst1/JNKs/p53/Bik pathway. Aim 4 will address, in vivo, the role of OPN and CD44 in myocyte apoptosis and myocardial dysfunction using inducible transgenic mouse system that permits myocyte-specific expression of OPN in the heart, and using OPN and CD44 knockout mice. The proposed studies are vital in defining the role of OPN in myocyte apoptosis and myocardial dysfunction, and may uncover novel strategies for the treatment of heart failure."
"9399733","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed K43 Emerging Global Leader Award is to support Dr. Andrew Mujugira?s research training to develop as an independent global health HIV researcher. Dr. Mujugira is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Infectious Disease Institute in Kampala, Uganda. Conducting the proposed studies in this application will facilitate his training goals to: 1) develop a solid foundation in behavioral science; 2) gain expertise in mobile technologies for behavior monitoring and intervention; and 3) acquire qualitative data collection, analysis and writing skills. This proposal builds on the unique skills he already has in clinical trials, epidemiology and medicine while leveraging a multidisciplinary team of mentors to ultimately become a productive and influential independent investigator focused on HIV prevention in key populations. The research goal of this proposal is to conduct a rigorous proof-of-concept evaluation to test if HIV self-testing (compared to clinic-based testing) motivates PrEP uptake and adherence, and empowers effective prevention decision making in sex workers. Transgender, male, and female sex workers are 49, 21 and 14 times as likely to be HIV-infected as other adults in the general population. In Uganda, sex workers have high HIV seroprevalence (35-37%) and account for 10% of new HIV infections. Two robust, evidence-based, self-controlled HIV prevention tools are available -- HIV self-testing (HIVST) and antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) -- but these are not currently well utilized among sex workers. HIVST and PrEP are complementary tools that could be combined to build self-efficacy and empowerment, increase PrEP adherence and reduce sexual risk behaviors. However, research is needed to show how combination HIVST and PrEP may have a synergistic impact on uptake and use of each prevention intervention. To address these questions, Dr. Mujugira will conduct a randomized trial among sex workers initiating PrEP in Uganda to test if HIV self-testing increases PrEP adherence among HIV- uninfected sex workers (Aim 1), decreases sexual risk behavior in sex workers taking PrEP (Aim 2), and influences prevention choices among sex workers and their partners (Aim 3). He will use novel technologies (real-time electronic monitoring with Wisepill technology and mobile phone surveys) to characterize patterns of PrEP adherence, and assess how use of HIVST and PrEP aligns with sexual risk behaviors. Additionally, he will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews to explore the mechanisms through which combined HIVST and PrEP delivery may be synergistic and empowering. This study will be the first to jointly evaluate HIVST and PrEP in sex workers. Dr. Mujugira?s research goals correspond with his training goals, and by the completion of this award, he will be in an excellent position to submit an R01 application that furthers the research agenda in HIV prevention.  "
"9450407","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-range goal of this work is to improve overall survival in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients by personalizing their conditioning regimen and/or intravenous (IV) busulfan (BU) doses using metabolomics. BU is an essential part of the majority of HCT conditioning regimens, but has a narrow therapeutic index; low BU plasma exposure (caused by rapid clearance) is associated with an increased risk of rejection or relapse, while high BU plasma exposure is associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Although pharmacokinetic (PK)-based dosing to a target BU exposure is often conducted, relapse and toxicity continue to be problematic. Furthermore, shorter IV BU courses necessitate alternative methods to personalize IV BU. IV BU clearance, however, is not associated with polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) A1 and GSTM1, the predominant GSTs in BU conjugation with glutathione. Therefore, we seek to test our working hypothesis that metabolomic signature, which provides novel insight into the in vivo cellular response and metabolite identification, is associated with IV BU clearance. We will first determine if endogenous metabolomics-based biomarkers obtained before BU administration can predict IV BU clearance. We will evaluate endogenous biomarkers using a targeted (glutathione pathway) and global analyses via liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. In addition, we seek to evaluate IV BU metabolism using metabolomics in parallel with gas chromatography-mass selective detection in patients receiving PK-based IV BU. We will evaluate plasma concentrations of eight different metabolites, building upon our experience with tetrahydrothiophene (THT+). We will also evaluate hydroxyTHT, which was just discovered by our group, and two recently identified metabolites that may contribute to BU toxicity: S-glutathione sulfonium conjugate (GS+THT) and ?-glutamyldehydroalanylglycine (EdAG). To complement this metabolomic work, we seek to validate covariates associated with IV BU PK, specifically age and body size, to mitigate a typical challenge for metabolomics research: the lack of understanding of potentially confounding factors. Our center has been a reference clinical laboratory for PK-based BU dosing since 1996 and thus, we have the largest database of IV BU PK. Using population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis, we will validate covariates for IV BU PK to guide future metabolomic studies. This popPK analysis can immediately improve patient care by using covariates to more accurately estimate an IV BU starting dose (i.e., before PK-based dosing) and by creating a limited sampling schedule to more efficiently use PK-based dosing. These complementary aims, which seek to identify novel metabolomics-based biomarkers, could overcome a critical barrier to HCT conditioning of balancing between response and toxicity. Based on our compelling preliminary data, we expect to identify an endogenous metabolomic signature that will influence the choice of an IV BU starting dose with the intention of improving overall survival for patients receiving IV BU-containing HCT regimens."
"9304414","There is now agreement that early life pain and stress are risk factors for subsequent changes in emotional, mood and sensory systems. Nevertheless, painful events continue to occur in the context of neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and other preventable settings. Similarly, a variety of less controllable stressful situations, such as suboptimal parenting conditions, also contribute to subsequent dysfunction. However, the mechanisms by which neonatal adversity leads to later anxiety, depression and sensory hypersensitivity remain unclear. As the consequences of early life trauma tend to emerge during late childhood or early adolescence, in order to design novel treatments and successful interventions, it is critical to examine the effects of neonatal events on behavioral and brain function at various times during development. In order to better understand how early life pain and stress can affect later brain function and behavior, this proposal uses a ?double-hit? model of trauma to test the hypothesis that neonatal trauma alters the developmental trajectory of the amygdala, and subsequently hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary axis function, including the role of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and corticosterone (CORT). In particular, we believe that neonatal trauma alters CRF signaling in the amygdala and perhaps hypothalamus. When exposed to an ?activating trauma? later in life, the anxiogenic or depressive phenotype is expressed. Furthermore, alterations to the amygdala will alter the descending pain system leading to tactile hypersensitivity and a predisposition towards pain. In the current experiments, neonatal rats will be exposed to invasive heel pricks, inflammatory injury or non-noxious handling over the first week of life. Fear conditioning and somatosensory function will then be assessed at multiple ages including early childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Once the behavioral effects are established, we will examine the role of amygdalar and hypothalamic CRF and CORT in these effects. This will be accomplished by measuring CRF and CORT expression, as well as receptor distribution. This will be followed by experiments that disrupt these signals using local and systemic pharmacology. We anticipate that neonatal pain will lead to alterations in subsequent fear conditioning and sensory function. Moreover, changes in CRF/CORT levels and receptor distribution in the amygdala will account for the observed behavioral changes. Although previous work has demonstrated that early life adversity can affect subsequent HPA axis function, the link between those changes and subsequent behavioral alterations that may lead to behavioral dysfunction is not well established. Overall, these experiments will examine the consequences of early-life trauma and offer insight into potential interventions protecting human well being."

Blood analytes include electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, uric acid, lipid screen, hsCRP, intact PTH, and cystatin C. Urine analytes include creatinine, protein, and microalbumin. The CBL has determined optimal conditions for transporting these analytes, and provides ambient shippers for each visit and quarterly dry ice shippers for frozen specimens. The CBL also provides the kits and instructions for collection and shipment of blood, plasma, sera, urine, hair, and nail samples to NIH repositories. Biochemical data from each CKiD visit are reviewed and entered into Nephron, the CKiD data base. The CBL provides training at annual CKID meetings and is readily available to provide information, instruction, and support during CKiD visits, as needed by the site coordinators. The CBL contributes expertise in performing biochemical assays and clinical interpretation of the results. The CBL collaborates regularly with the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to optimize GFR studies and to construct GFR estimating equations used during odd number visits at which no iohexol study is performed, maintain the Manual of Procedures, assure the quality control of all assays, and provide continuity of biochemical assays through changes in instrumentation. The CBL participates in all Steering Committee meetings and conference calls and collaborates with investigators in the generation of abstracts, presentations, and manuscripts, which further document the success of the CKiD study. The aims of the CBL center on continuing to provide accurate, precise, and efficient measures of iohexol-based GFR and biochemical measurements of general kidney health. A pilot study to determine if fingerprick samples can replace serum collections for the iohexol GFR continues during this cycle. We plan to develop better GFR estimating equations, particularly for the children of Cohort 2, who have higher levels of GFR than those of Cohort 1. The CBL has submitted concept sheets to further determine if hyperuricemia predicts renal progression or hypertension, if microalbuminuria is a better predictor of renal progression than urinary protein, and to examine beta trace protein to determine if it is useful in predicting GFR. Finally, the CBL will continue to provide to the participating sites subject- and visit specific- laboratory kits for the collection, handling, and transport of samples, as well as receive, process, and analyze these samples on a daily basis, and provide timely data entry into Nephron. The long term goal is to better characterize the CKiD population biochemically, maintain the integrity of the data, and to optimize the collection of specimens in a manner that maintains recruitment and retention of CKiD subjects."

A comprehensive set of regulatory events across a genome - the regulome - is needed to make full use of genomic information, but is currently out of reach for practically all clinical applications and many biological systems The proposed Center will develop technologies that greatly increase the sensitivity, speed, and comprehensiveness of understanding genome regulation. We will develop new technologies to interrogate the transactions between the genome and regulatory factors, such as proteins and noncoding RNAs, and integrate variations in DNA sequences and chromatin states over time and across individuals. Novel molecular engineering and biosensor strategies are deployed to encapsulate the desired complex DNA transformations into the probe system, such that the probe system can be directly used on very small human clinical samples and capture genome-wide information in one or two steps. These technologies will be applied to clinical samples and workflows in real time to exercise their robustness and reveal for the first time epigenomic dynamics of human diseases during progression and treatment. These technologies will be broadly applicable to many biomedical investigations, and the Center will disseminate the technologies via training and diverse means."
"9339523","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Diabetes damages the retina, and the resulting diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in working-aged adults. Despite this, the pathogenesis of DR is poorly understood. Research done by us and others strongly implicates inflammatory processes in the development of the critical microvascular lesions of DR, and work done during our current Merit research demonstrates that the induction of these inflammatory proteins by hyperglycemia is regulated by protein acetylation. The central hypothesis of our current proposal is that increased acetylation of proteins in diabetes contribute to the degeneration of retinal capillaries via inflammatory pathways, and that leukocytes in particular play a critical role in the pathogenesis of this acetylation-driven degeneration of retinal capillaries. Using 2 models of DR (streptozotocin to induce a Type 1 diabetes, and spontaneously diabetic db/db mice which are a model of Type 2 diabetes), research in this proposal will determine if inhibition of this acetylatin systemically (Aim 1) or in leukocytes only (Aim 2) inhibits development of the characteristic vascular lesions of early DR. These studies will be performed both as prevention trials and as intervention trials. The third aim of this proposal will extend these studies to patients, using leukocytes from Veterans (both diabetic and nondiabetic) to determine if leukocyte- mediated killing of retinal endothelial cells in diabetes can be prevented by inhibiting or reversing acetylation of proteins in leukocytes. We also will begin to explore if the extent of acetylation-mediated killing of retinal endothelial cells by leukocytes from diabetic patients correlates with the severity of retinopathy and might predict which patients are most susceptible to develop advanced DR."
"9346344","SUMMARY More than 300,000 babies are born annually with sickle cell disease (SCD), 90% of which occur in developing countries, with the largest number in Nigeria. A majority of children with SCD die before 5 years, but when early SCD screening is coupled with health care management, mortality can be reduced dramatically. Unfortunately, because universal screening requires blood samples from infants, it is rarely done in resource-limited settings where it is expensive and hard to implement. A simple, economical and portable point-of-care (POC) screening test that is well accepted by families, avoids the need for blood sampling, and is easily integrated into the existing community health care system without diverting time and resources from other healthcare priorities is critically needed. To this end, Capnia has modified the portable CoSense End Tidal Carbon Monoxide (ETCO) Monitor to make it suitable for point of care use as a SCD screening tool in tropical climates. The monitor non-invasively measures carbon monoxide in breath, a byproduct of hemolysis, and clearly distinguishes between children with or without SCD. Because measurements can be made without a forced breath sample, it is suitable for use in infants and young children who cannot reliably follow sample collection commands. Further, the only disposable item required is an inexpensive nasal cannula. Thus, this simple-to-use device meets all of the desirable characteristics for use as a SCD screening tool in low resource settings. In order to fully prepare the device and develop an SCD screening regimen for commercial deployment we propose four aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the optimal age at which infants should be screened using ETCO and a recommended ETCO threshold at which they should be referred for further SCD. We will also define the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SCD in Nigerian children. In Aim 2 we will enhance the usability of CoSense-S to make it suitable for field use in Nigeria and develop training materials to support its commercial deployment for SCD screening. Work in Aim 3 will test the reliability and ease of use of CoSense-S in field conditions in Nigeria. Our goal is to test and validate the modified monitor, CoSense-S, for SCD screening in the field in Nigeria. If successful, we will be ready to commercialize a device that will for the first time make widespread screening for SCD feasible in low resource settings."
"9359613","ABSTRACT Results of several preclinical studies and clinical trials suggest that cell therapy improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction; however, high variability, marginal efficacy, and our poor understanding of the mechanisms by which cell therapy works have precluded its clinical translation. One major knowledge gap is a lack of understanding of how host metabolism impinges on the efficacy of cell therapy. This is important because a pervasive feature of heart failure is insulin resistance, a condition known to affect glucose transport in the myocardium as well as the function of circulating and tissue-resident stem cells. This dysfunction is further exacerbated by frank diabetes, a condition inordinately common in HF patients. Therefore, identification of the metabolic factors that determine the efficacy of cell therapy is required to optimize cell therapy for HF patients. In this project, we will examine how diabetes affects cardiac repair induced by transplantation of cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMCs) or paracrine factors derived therefrom. Our preliminary data indicate that, in contrast to CMCs isolated from non-diabetic mice, CMCs isolated from diabetic mice fail to improve the function of the infarcted heart. The diabetic CMCs show elevated rates of glycolysis associated with expression of Pfkfb3, which in cardiac progenitor cells increases glycolysis by augmenting phosphofructokinase activity and appears to diminish their proliferation and survival. In addition, we find that these changes involve not only glycolytic mediators such as PFKFB3, but mitochondrial effectors such as sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) as well. Building on these observations, we propose to test the hypothesis that diabetes compromises the therapeutic efficacy of CMCs by chronically increasing glycolysis, which alters paracrine mechanisms that mediate cardiac repair, and that Sirt1 improves the repair capacity of CMCs by augmenting mitochondrial activity and thereby decreasing glycolysis. To test this hypothesis, we will i) determine how diabetes affects CMC-mediated myocardial repair, ii) elucidate how glycolysis affects CMC repair competence, and iii) develop strategies to improve CMC therapy in diabetes. This project will provide fundamental knowledge regarding how metabolic disease affects cell therapy and how mesenchymal cells adapt to nutrient stress. In addition, these studies will illuminate mechanisms by which metabolism regulates paracrine factor secretion, thereby generating novel biological understanding of cell-cell communication. Collectively, the knowledge garnered from this project will facilitate the optimization of cell therapy protocols and provide critical direction to ongoing clinical trials."

"9336857","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a complex condition that involves persistent deregulation of multiple systems within the body including the immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular systems. The condition appears to affect both men and women who were deployed to the GW, with up to one-third of these affected Veterans remaining ill today. While treatment of both men and women has involved management of symptomatology, a lack of clear understanding of the underlying dysfunction associated with this condition remains. In an effort to understand the underlying mediators of dysfunction, our research group has developed a dynamic model to identify these mediators of persistence and relapse, with the primary goal of pinpointing the underlying mechanisms of the condition and targeting treatment more effectively. In this application we turn to gender differences. Utilizing this dynamic model that involves challenging a patient with exercise and drawing bloods at multiple times to map out mediators of genomic, cellular, and chemical response, we have studied 50 men and 10 women with GWI illness. While we have been able to analyze the data with enough power to know that the disease is mediated differently in men and women despite clinical similarities between the two genders, we have not been able to model the mediators of persistent illness in women to the point of identifying therapeutic targets as we have in men with GWI, entirely due to our small sample size.  Our previous work in males with GWI has progressed to Phase 1 clinical trials, as supported by a newly awarded DoD consortium grant and a submitted VA clinical trials proposal. The aim of the consortium is to identify signaling mechanisms relevant to GWI in male patients and outline the most promising biomarkers tied to these signaling pathways and to target pathways for intervention studies that would not only improve symptomatology but ultimately reset homeostasis. In addition, we are also funded through the NIH to assess differences in genomic, cellular, and chemical response using a dynamic model among female patients with CFS/ME or fibromyalgia and healthy controls. With these studies underway, we are developing a more detailed understanding of the dysfunction associated with key metabolic pathways involved in GWI in men and in women with a related illness, CFS/ME. The clear missing link is the comparison of women with GWI to outline further differences in response between genders and develop effective tailored treatments for both men and women.  In this merit application, we propose a value added study that incorporates our current research efforts to thoroughly explore sex differences across a platform that enables evaluation of genomic, cellular, and chemical response mediators in women with GWI using a sample size sufficient to support between-group comparisons and modeling of illness-modifying interventions. We also have an existing dynamic data set in women and men with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME), an interesting comparator group when comparing illness models. With existing data and the enhanced female GWI cohort we will be able to compare gender differences in terms of illness, illness mechanisms, and explore gender-specific therapeutic targets. By utilizing this information, we aim to understand the mediators of persistence and relapse in women with GWI and extend our research efforts to clinical trials based on dynamic modeling and therapeutic targets, as we have in men."
"9339493","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Allergic airway inflammation is a hallmark of asthma, one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States. While the contribution of the adaptive immune response, particularly the CD4+ Th2 cell, to the development of allergen-induced airway inflammation has been well described, the contribution of the innate immune response to the allergic phenotype is not clearly defined. The Group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) is a recently described lineage negative (Lin-) cell type that is present in humans and mice. ILC2s are far more potent producers of IL-5 and IL-13 on a per cell basis than CD4+ Th2 cells, and therefore may be critical to both the genesis and amplification of allergic inflammatory responses. So far, there are no known inhibitors of ILC2 cytokine secretion that are approved by the FDA for use in human diseases; however, our in vivo and in vitro preliminary data strongly suggests that prostaglandin (PG) I2 negatively regulates ILC2 function. Using a model of airway challenge with an extract of Alternaria alternata, a fungal aeroallergen that has been associated with severe asthma excaerbations, we found that mice deficient in the PGI2 receptor IP had a significant increase in lung IL-13 protein expression 6 hours after challenge, a time at which innate, and not adaptive, immunity predominates. Our in vitro preliminary data reveals that the PGI2 analog cicaprost significantly inhibited IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression from ILC2 purified from mouse bone marrow. The long term objective of this application is to define the role of PGI2 in ILC2 function in an allergen challenge model in mice and also in human ILC2 cells purified from peripheral blood. In aim 1, we hypothesize that endogenous PGI2 signaling inhibits lung ILC2 cytokine expression and cell number in vivo. Investigating the role of endogenous PGI2 is critical to understanding the effect of cyclooxygenase-inhibiting drugs, one of the most widely used classes of over-the-counter medications in the world, on the innate allergic immune response as these agents inhibit PGI2 production. In aim 2, we hypothesize that airway administration of an exogenous PGI2 analog inhibits lung ILC2 function and proliferation. Investigating the role of exogenous PGI2 is important to understand the potential effects of inhaled PGI2 or its analogs on the innate allergic immune response as such agents are FDA approved and currently used therapeutically for pulmonary hypertension, and therefore could be used to treat allergic respiratory diseases such as asthma. In aim 3, we will determine the effect of PGI2 on human ILC2 cytokine expression and proliferation. The proposed studies are paradigm shifting in that they may identify the first inhibitor of ILC2 and will advance the field by determining the molecular mechanism by which PGI2 regulates ILC2 function."
"9356542","ABSTRACT It is becoming clear that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) likely occurs due to dysfunction of developing synapses and synaptic remodeling. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a monogenetic disease with a high incidence of ASD. To obtain a deeper understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of ASD, we propose to take advantage of a TSC mouse model, which is missing the Tsc1 gene only in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). These conditional TSC mutant mice exhibit the common core characteristics of ASD: lack of interest in socializing, repetitive behaviors, and cognitive inflexibility. Importantly, Tsc1-deficient PCs display increased spine density, a phenotype previously reported in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders; however the neuronal and non- neuronal mechanisms that contribute this process remain elusive. In this project, we will investigate two complimentary mechanisms that contribute to the synaptic and behavioral phenotypes in this newly developed TSC mouse model of ASD. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that impaired autophagy, driven by excess mTOR signaling, prevents normal synaptic remodeling and leads to the increased dendritic spine density on PCs, which contribute to the behavioral abnormalities found in the PC-Tsc1 CKO mice. We will characterize the rate of autophagy including autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy), and modulate autophagy pharmacologically to test whether we can improve the spine and behavioral phenotypes. In Aim 2, we turn to cell-extrinsic mechanisms and ask whether the interaction between mutant PCs and microglia, resident immune cells and key mediators of synaptic remodeling, contributes to the spine and ASD-like phenotypes. We hypothesize that Tsc1-deficient Purkinje cells lead to early disruption in microglia development and function, including their ability to prune and signal to synapses. Moreover, our preliminary findings suggest that microglia activation and inflammatory signaling further contribute to synaptic and ASD like phenotypes.  We are uniquely positioned to explore the spatio-temporal relationship of microglia changes relative to Tsc1-null PCs using a combination of novel transcriptional profiling (single cell Drop-Seq), and functional assays. We will perform the first detailed transcriptional analysis of microglia and neurons from TSC patients and compare these data with mouse models. Finally, we will determine whether specific manipulation of autophagy and microglia dysfunction in PC-TSC cKO mice rescue synaptic and specific ASD- relevant behaviors. We will leverage four IDDRC cores (Cellular Imaging, Molecular Genetics, Neurodevelopmental Behavior and Clinical Translational Cores) and complimentary expertise of co-PIs, Sahin and Stevens and IDDRC collaborators. Together, these experiments will shed light on the cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms mediating synaptic modeling and may inform new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for TSC and related neurodevelopmental disorders."

"9271808","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a slowly progressing multifactorial disease involving genetic ab- normalities and environmental insults. AMD is the leading cause of blindness for Americans over age 60. As the population ages, the prevalence of AMD will reach a maximum risk rate of ~30% at age 75. As smoking increases the risk of AMD and there is a 20% higher incidence of smoking in veterans than in the general US civilian population, the VA system will have to provide care for potentially ?7 million AMD cases. The current concepts of AMD recognize that chronic oxidative stress and inflammation (including complement activation) can trigger pathological changes in RPE, Bruch's membrane (BrM) and choroid. However, what this scheme does not consider is the regionality of AMD. Damage does not start in one location to spread from there, but is triggered in many different locations. This suggests that damage occurs in susceptible areas, while delaying it in more resilient areas (sparing of the fovea). Our research is based on the premise that the RPE is a site of aging and disease. The RPE is an essential support cell of the retina; it is a source for the debris found in drusen and BrM; and th RPE cells form a network of cells, connected via gap junctions (GJ). Hence the RPE is a prime candidate to either spread or limit the stress-response within the posterior pole. Spreading of infor- mation, or the bystander effect, can be mediated by two different mechanisms: transfer of a secreted signal to the recipient (individual molecules or signals contained in exosomes); or the spread of information by means of communication via GJ. Here we will be guided by our overall hypothesis that exosome and GJ-mediated com- munication in RPE monolayers contribute of the bystander effect and mediate regionality of RPE damage. The susceptibility of individual cells to the bystander effects is thought to be determined by their metabolic profile. Hence we further hypothesize that the resting state of the individual cell within a network will determine is sus- ceptibility to stress. [[These questions will be investigated in RPE networks derived from ARPE-19 cells as well as induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells from AMD and control patients with low and high genetic risk factors for AMD]]. In Aim 1, we will determine the effects of messengers contained in exosomes in execut- ing the bystander effect in RPE cells. We have demonstrated that exosomes generated by oxidative stress can serve as signaling vectors for communication between donor and recipient cells in a complement-dependent manner. This mechanism will be explored further to determine the polarity of exosome formation, the activity of exosomes on global and single cell responses, and the process by which exosomes transfer information. Aim 2 is designed to determine the effects of GJ communication in executing the bystander effect. Our preliminary data has shown that local oxidative stress in a donor cell can trigger spread of information leading to changes in mitochondrial homeostasis in a limited number of connected recipient cells. This observation will be further extended to determine the signaling events in donor and recipient cells elicited by local stress as well as the metabolic baseline parameters in recipient cells that correlate with susceptibility to responding to information from a donor cell, and to examine potential messengers that mediate GJ communication."
"9533853","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Through the efforts of the Human Genome Project and other large-scale investigations, it has become clear that the molecular origins of human complexity, disease, and distinctness from other organisms are rooted in more than just the number of genes in the genome. RNA editing, the post-transcriptional alteration of genome-encoded information by chemical modification of individual RNA bases, provides a potentially powerful way to diversify the set of RNAs expressed in an organism's tissues over time. Aberrant RNA editing has been implicated in human neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, depression, suicide, glioma, and cancers, and may have contributed to the evolutionary development of human neurobiology and cognition. While numerous RNA editing sites have been identified to date, we are still far from possessing a complete list of RNA editing targets particularly in the coding regions, thus hindering a full understanding of the complexity of this process and its potential for therapeutic intervention. We propose to extend our recent success at developing experimental and computational frameworks to the generation of a comprehensive atlas of RNA editing sites in humans and mice. By combining multiple validated techniques, we will rigorously quantitate RNA editing in a spectrum of matched human and mouse tissues from multiple developmental stages. We will use this approach to extend our analysis to RNA editing in other primates such as chimpanzees and rhesus macaque monkeys, with the expectation of uncovering the contributions of RNA editing to conserved functions as well as to human-specific neural evolution. We will also carry out large-scale computational analysis to search for RNA editing-related functional elements in the annotated genomic and transcriptomic datasets. Finally, we propose to use a variety of mouse strains mutated for the enzymes that perform RNA editing to elucidate the regulation of RNA editing. Taken together, the goals of this proposed project will deepen our understanding of the molecular basis of RNA editing, generate a set of experimental and computational tools to drive innovation in the RNA editing field, and unravel the network of signals that regulate RNA editing spatiotemporally, thus bringing us closer to the goal of manipulating RNA editing to alleviate human disease."
"9349461","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year more than 100,000 US women seek emergency medical care after sexual assault (SA). Most women do not return for/receive further care related to SA after initial emergency evaluation. Thus the emergency care visit represents a unique opportunity to identify SA survivors for preventive interventions to improve recovery. Cross-sectional studies indicate that chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSP) is reported by many SA survivors and is associated with substantial suffering and poor health outcomes. However, no prospective studies evaluating chronic MSP outcomes after SA have been performed, and therefore a firm etiologic link between SA and chronic MSP has not been established. In a recent prospective pilot study (n = 83), the investigators found that 41% of women SA survivors enrolled developed chronic moderate or severe MSP. Initial pain scores collected from all women approached for pilot study participation showed that more than half of those at high risk of chronic MSP consented and enrolled in the pilot study. In addition, data collected indicate that women SA survivors who participated in the pilot study are the same group of SA survivors who would be willing to participate in preventive intervention trials. However, currently no informatio exists regarding key factors that influence the transition from acute to chronic post-SA MSP to inform the design of such trials. Available evidence suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms may be key factors mediating the transition from acute to chronic post-SA MSP. PTSD symptom clusters have been found to mediate the transition from acute to chronic MSP in other trauma populations, and the investigator's pilot data support these relationships in the study population. Importantly, despite evidence that PTSD symptoms are key factors mediating chronic post-SA MSP development, available data also indicate that not all individuals with acute MSP develop PTSD symptoms, and not all individuals with PTSD symptoms develop chronic MSP. This suggests that important individual differences moderate these relationships. Available evidence, and the investigator's pilot data, suggests that genetic variants affecting the function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and catecholaminergic systems constitute such important individual differences. The investigators propose a prospective cohort study of women SA survivors (n = 900) evaluated 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after SA. A methodological approach including Confirmatory Factor Analyses and Structural Equation Modeling will be used to test the hypotheses that chronic MSP is common in the study population, that PTSD symptom clusters mediate the relationship between acute and chronic MSP after SA, and that the proposed genetic factors moderate these relationships. Results of this groundbreaking study will generalize to a large population of women SA survivors who experience a high burden of chronic post-SA MSP, and will inform the development of preventive interventions for this understudied population."
"9530985","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significance. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Aside from lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies and conservative fluid management, there are no specific therapies for ARDS. A hallmark of ARDS is injury to the alveolar epithelium, including cell death, primarily of alveolar type (AT) I cells, resulting in permeability and the influx of edma fluid, which in turn leads to refractory hypoxemia. This injury phase is followed by a reparative response during which surviving ATII cells spread onto the denuded basement membrane, proliferate, and transdifferentiate into ATI cells, thus restoring barrier integrity. Importantly, epithelial repair is a primary determinant of recovery from ARDS. Innovation. Historically, basic ARDS research has focused on the injury phase; unfortunately, therapeutic interventions designed to mitigate injury have generally been unsuccessful. Investigations into reparative mechanisms have explored ATII cell proliferation. In this proposal, we focus on ATII cell spreading onto the denuded basement membrane after the sloughing of ATI cells. This phenomenon has been recognized since the 1970s but has not been well studied in animal models. We define spreading as an increase in surface area resulting in increased coverage of the denuded basement membrane. We have developed a novel method to rigorously measure spreading of genetically-labeled ATII cells using stringent stereologic techniques. We will characterize ATII cell spreading after mild and severe injury in relationship to proliferation, transdifferentiation, and the restitution of barrier integrity. Hypothesis. Based on our preliminar data, we hypothesize that Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) 1? promotes ATII cell spreading and the restitution of barrier integrity via CXCR4/SDF1 signaling. Research Plan. Aim 1 will test whether in limited lung injury, rapid, pre-mitotic ATII cell spreading is associated with barrier restoration; in addition, after severe injury, requiring proliferation to replace lost cells, whethr post-mitotic spreading correlates with barrier restoration. Aim 2 will determine whether HIF1? is critical for spreading. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that CXCR/SDF1 signaling promotes and mediates the role of HIF1? in ATII cell spreading. We will use both gain- and loss-of-function techniques, including ATII cell specific gene deficient mice. Our primary readout will be morphometric measurement of spreading (area of alveolar surface covered) using stereologic techniques. We will directly link in vivo studies to mechanistic spreading assays in cultured primary ATII cells. Conclusion. Here, we study repair of the injured alveolar epithelium by ATII cell spreading with an emphasis on the restitution of epithelial barrier integrity, a highly cliniclly relevant outcome. These studies will identify novel therapeutic targets to accelerate epithelial repair in ARDS, ultimately promoting the resolution of pulmonary edema and clinical recovery."
"9302266","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our long-term goal is to reveal systematically how the musculotendon mechanics, spinal cord and brain interact to produce able and pathologic finger function. The prior grant revealed many necessary neuromechanical interactions for finger function and dysfunction. This compels and enables us to study spinal neurophysiology and neuromechanics as a step before tackling brain function. The immediate goals of our team of scientists and surgeons are to (i) test the extent to which the known somatosensory feedback and spinal interneuronal circuitry is sufficient, on its own, to account for critical features of fst isometric fingertip forces without requiring on-line supraspinal modulation; and (ii) understand how botulinum toxin (BTX) injections to reduce spasticity and dystonia in hemiplegic CP and iSCI interact with that circuitry. We will test theories of spinal reflexive and excitation-inhibiton mechanisms using synthetic analysis and physical implementation, which in our view is a strong test of our understanding of a system. That is, we will confront the very challenge the nervous system faces by controlling the tendons of cadaveric fingers with an autonomous neuromechatronic system of microprocessors and motors that implements the known motor and somatosensory spinal circuitry and muscle properties of healthy subjects and patients. Aim 1: Characterize H-reflex and performance of Single Joint and Whole Finger fast isometric tasks in control subjects, and pre-&post-BTX in patients. (Exploratory test on CP patients undergoing tendon transfers and musculotendon length changes will validate other physiological processes and model components in the later phases of the research.) Then, actuate tendons of cadaveric fingers to (i) find feasible tensions to replicate that performance and (ii) quantify robustness to errors in tendon tensions. Aim 2: Implement in real time the known connectivity and dynamics of spinal neurons, muscle proprioceptors and muscle fibers of a single afferented muscle. Validate against data in the literature. Single Muscle Hypothesis: Muscle function (e.g., tone, stretch reflex) emerges naturally from specific combinations of neuronal background activity and pathway gains. Test how physiologically tenable disruptions and BTX lead to, or mitigate, pathologic behavior (e.g., spasticity and clonus). Aim 3: Implement the hypothesized neural connectivity and dynamics across muscles to reproduce the H- reflex and performance of fast isometric tasks seen in control subjects, and pre-&post-BTX in patients. Replicating the behavior measured in Aim 1 by driving tendons of cadaveric index fingers will identify how clinically tenable disruptions lead to pathologic behavior, and the extent to which BTX (and preliminarily tendon transfers and musculotendon length changes) can mitigate those pathologies. a) Single Joint Hypothesis: Single-joint function (e.g., fast time-varying torques) emerges naturally from background activity and pathway gains across motoneuron pools of a pair of antagonist muscles. Test the emergence and BTX mitigation of single joint spasticity, clonus, instability, and deficits in single joint tasks. b) Whole Finger Hypothesis: The fast time-varying fingertip force tasks recorded in Aim 1 emerge naturally from physiologically tenable interactions across all finger muscles. Test the emergence and BTX mitigation of whole-finger spasticity, clonus, abnormal postures, and deficits in whole fingertip force tasks."

We will evaluate our program by determining whether these goals have been fulfilled during the grant period."
"9381275","RBC transfusion is the single most common therapeutic modality given to patients in America, with approximately 1 out of every 70 Americans being transfused each year. Some chronically transfused patients become alloimmunized against many of the over 340 RBC alloantigens, leading to morbidity and mortality due to lack of sufficient compatible RBC units. In addition, RBC alloantibodies can lead to hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Thus, issues of RBC alloimmunization are of high significance to a large number of patients. Antibodies have traditionally been considered part of the adaptive immune system, which forms a response only after exposure to antigen; however, in recent years a new class of pre-existing antibodies (naturally occurring antibodies (nAbs)) have been described that bridge the gap between innate and adaptive immunity. Most nAbs are IgM (nIgMs) that have a limited range of specificities, including autoantigenic determinants on damaged tissues. All units of RBCs that are transfused are stored first, resulting in characteristic patterns of cell damage, including expression of known nIgMs targets. In animal models, we have reported that storage of RBCs increases RBC alloimmunization upon transfusion, a finding that has been observed in some follow up human studies. In this context, this applicaiton will test the hypothesis that nIgMs, pre-existing in naïve animals, are involved in increased immunogenicity of stored RBCs through binding conserved motifs that are increased on the RBC surface of stored RBCs, leading to altered antigen presentation, T cell activation and B cell maturation. In addition to nIgMs, normal adaptive IgG to RBC alloantigens can be detected as early as 7-12 days; however, transfused RBCs continue to circulate up to 100- 120 days in humans (50 days in mice). Thus adaptive IgGs can bind to circulating RBCs during a primary immune response, with the potential to affect ongoing RBC alloimmunization. Indeed, we present novel data that anti-RBC IgG, has regulatory effects upon ongoing RBC alloimmunization. In this context, the proposed studies will also test the hypothesis that adaptive anti-RBC IgGs affect ongoing alloimmunization by shuttling antigen to more immunogenic antigen-presenting cells, activation of the antigen-presenting cells, and increased subsequent immunity. These two hypotheses are investigated in the context of 3 specific aims: Specific aim 1: Determine the role of nIgM in initiating adaptive alloimmunity to RBC transfusion Specific aim 2: Mechanisms by which anti-RBC antibodies alter adaptive humoral alloimmunization. Specific aim 3: Test the effects of anti-RBC alloantibodies upon ongoing RBC alloimmunization in a humanized mouse model. These aims use innovative approaches to test mechanistic biology, at both the cellular and molecular level, and also generate an initial bridge to translation into human studies in aim 3."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kisspeptin and neurokinin B are both critical gatekeepers for reproductive maturation but there is still much to learn about how these neuropeptides stimulate GnRH secretion. This grant will anchor a collaboration between two investigators uniquely positioned to study the physiology of these peptides in non-human primates and humans in vivo. In the male monkey, the contributions of kisspeptin and NKB to GnRH secretion will be explored across puberty using novel assays and receptor agonists and antagonists. In the adult human male, exogenous kisspeptin administration to patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) will be assessed as a predictive tool for spontaneous recovery of GnRH pulsatile secretion. In the adolescent human male, exogenous kisspeptin will be explored as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between constitutional delay of puberty (CDP) and IHH. By focusing on the pubertal transition, and incorporating normal and pathophysiologic states, this grant will develop insights into reproductive maturation and develop diagnostic tools for pubertal disorders."
"9534289","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population and yet they are underrepresented at all levels in the scientific community. According to the 2010 Census, 53.5% of the population of the Bronx was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin. The Bronx-Einstein Training in Teaching and Research (BETTR) program is a three-year post-doctoral scholars program, which couples training in independent research with training in innovative teaching techniques and the experience in and guidance for hands-on teaching. Traditional training in research methodologies will be based at Einstein, and mentored teaching training will take place at two neighboring partner institutions in the Bronx, each Hispanic-serving and both part of the City of New York (CUNY). Our scholars will experience a diverse educational experience through mentored training at these two different types of undergraduate institutions: Hostos, a two year Community College, and Lehman College, a large four-year undergraduate college. Prior to matriculation in the BETTR program, scholars will spend a year at Einstein immersed in establishing their research project. During the first year in the program (second year in postdoctoral training), scholars will additionally choose a teaching mentor and develop teaching skills at both of our partner institutions while developing curricula, participating in pedagogy workshops and experimenting with different teaching strategies, such as co-teaching and peer- led teaching. During the second year, scholars will develop a course in collaboration with their mentors, which they will teach during the third year. Scholars will work to achieve research excellence by actively pursuing their own research projects, presenting at scientific conferences, and attending research-focused workshops, all of which culminate in the submission of a career development grant application. Scholars will share their research expertise at Hostos and Lehman through mentoring undergraduate students. In parallel, scholars are expected to gain teaching skills aligned with the learning styles of minority populations at urban settings. Additional events, such as Research Days at Hostos and Lehman and research collaborations among the faculty at all three institutions, will provide research opportunities for both students and faculty. The goals of the BETTR program are to enhance the research collaboration culture with our partner institutions, enable our partners to revitalize their science curricula, provide our scholars with experience and expertise as scientist/educators, and, thereby, encourage underrepresented minorities to pursue science careers."
"9322506","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CKiD Study is a multi-center, cohort study of children aged 1 to 16 years with mild to moderate impaired kidney function. Two clinical coordinating centers (CCCs) (at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City), a central biochemistry laboratory (at the University of Rochester), and a data coordinating center (at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health) have formed a cooperative agreement to conduct a prospective study of chronic kidney disease in children. Since its inception in 2003, the scientific aims of CKiD have been to determine the risk factors for decline in kidney function and to define how progressive decline in kidney function impacts biomarkers of risk factors for cardiovascular disease; neurocognitive function and behavior; and growth failure and its associated morbidity. The purpose of this application is to request funds to continue the cohort study from August 2013 to July 2018. The substantive scientific aims are described in the application from the collaborating CCCs. This application describes the role that the Kidney Disease in Children Data Management and Analysis Center (KIDMAC) will perform as the Data Coordinating Center of the study. We will continue to provide leadership in study design, coordination and conduct, data management and analytical methodology and thereby enhance the scientific scope of CKiD. The specific aims of KIDMAC are: 1) to continue providing biostatistical and epidemiological study design expertise including methods to appropriately nest case-cohort sub- studies; 2) to continue providing the Steering Committee, the two clinical coordinating centers, the central biochemistry laboratory and the scientific subcommittees with an infrastructure to coordinate and conduct CKiD research activities, data acquisition and protocol and form development and revisions; 3) to continue maintaining and enhancing the KIDMAC-developed web-based system to manage the data of CKiD; 4) to continue providing biostatistical and epidemiological leadership in the analysis, interpretation and presentation of study-wide initiatives including the development of methods for the appropriate analyses of the CKiD data (e.g., usage of time since CKD diagnosis as time scale for analysis, non-linear trajectories, joint survival and longitudinal data analysis, and methods fr causal inferences); and 5) to continue implementing a quality assurance program that integrates expertise in data management, study coordination, statistical methodology and scientific disciplines. KIDMAC investigators have expertise in research design, coordination, data management, quality assurance and epidemiological and biostatistical methods for complex longitudinal and survival data."
"9312318","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender women (assigned `male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART adherence, lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines, and report fewer positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result, TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco; in Los Angeles, TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk group. In our formative work, we have identified culturally-specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH, including prioritization of transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment, avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences, misinformation about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones, intensified HIV stigma, low levels of social support, and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk factors, including substance abuse, high numbers of sex partners, engagement in sex work, and high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment, and that the public health consequences for poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable and marginalized population. We propose a randomized controlled trial of a theory- driven, population-specific, piloted intervention to improve engagement in care for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment, the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. We have developed and piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity, mortality, and transmission of HIV."
"9290199","ABSTRACT Regulated exocytosis is a fundamental and critical cell biological process during which specialized secretory cells release cargo proteins in response to specific stimuli. This process has broad implications for human health, as dysfunction of regulated exocytosis results in many disorders, including the conspicuous example of impaired insulin secretion in diabetes mellitus. Developmental growth disorders, asthma, and thyroid dysfunction are also caused by abnormalities in regulated exocytosis. However, despite this critical importance for human health, major steps in the regulated exocytosis pathway remain poorly understood. There is a particular lack of understanding of mechanisms regulating maturation of cargo-carrying secretory granules, a step that is critical to render these specialized organelles competent for exocytosis and to ensure that the secreted cargo is biologically active. Progress has been inhibited largely because of a lack of a genetic context in which to study secretory granule maturation; previous studies have relied largely on visual observations via electron microscopy (EM) and biochemical separation and purification of secretory granules. Importantly, we have identified a novel, highly-conserved regulator of secretory granule maturation, named hobbit, with associated severe defects in regulated exocytosis in both neuroendocrine and epithelial cells. The long-term goal of this project is to identify and characterize novel proteins, including hobbit, that are required for regulated exocytosis. The overall objective of this application is to understand the function of hobbit and hobbit-dependent granule maturation during regulated exocytosis. Our central hypothesis is that hobbit, a novel component of the regulated exocytosis pathway, cooperates with the ESCRT machinery and Rab proteins to regulate the progression of secretory granules through the process of maturation. We intend to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of this proposal by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) What is the function of hobbit in regulated exocytosis; and 2) Define the molecular pathway in which hobbit functions. The focus of Aim 1 is to uncover the function of hobbit in secretory granule maturation. The focus of Aim 2 is to identify critical members of the hobbit-dependent secretory pathway, and to identify other new regulators of regulated exocytosis. Our contribution is significant because we have identified a previously uncharacterized regulator of secretory granule maturation, allowing us to genetically dissect the molecular pathway regulating this process. We expect this work to provide new mechanistic insights into the regulated exocytosis pathway, which will have important implications for our understanding of the etiology of secretion-related diseases, including diabetes."
"9301435","Research and Education Component (REC): Summary The overall goal of the Research Education Component (REC) of the Boston OAIC is to train future independent research scientists who have the knowledge and the skill to translate fundamental mechanisms of disease and disability into novel interventions that can improve the health, physical function, and well-being of people as they age. The REC will achieve this by selecting the most promising early career scientists from clinical and basic science disciplines, and providing them with both collective and individual educational activities, research experiences, mentoring, and career guidance that will enable them to acquire future career development or research awards and ultimately become leaders in translational research devoted to the discovery of function promoting therapies (FPTs). The REC's specific aims are as follows: 1. To select at least 3 talented early investigators from diverse clinical and basic science disciplines who have strong potential to become independent investigators devoted to translational research. 2. To provide these trainees with a two-year mentored interdisciplinary research experience focused on the development of function-promoting therapies for people as they age. 3. To enhance the career development of these trainees through research seminars and lectures, formal coursework in relevant curricular areas, participation in OAIC's scholarly activities, and specific training in the importance of diversity in science and the protection of human and/or animal subjects. By the conclusion of the proposed 5-year funding period, we will have completed the training of at least 6 new investigators in the field of aging (and initiated the training of 3 more), who will acquire the necessary research experience and skills to generate and test new hypotheses regarding FPTs and compete successfully for independent funding for their future research. These individuals will enhance the nation's workforce with future leaders who will continue to develop new interventions to promote physical function in old age, and also train the next generation of investigators to continue important work on this important theme."
"9325530","PROJECT SUMMARY   The Metabolomics Core will provide analytic measurements of biologic building blocks, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids and carbohydrates to investigators of the Center for Iron and Heme Disorders (CIHD). Metabolomics is the unbiased survey of metabolites found within a tissue, biological fluid, organism, culture or other biological source. Currently metabolomics is a comparative science; typically an analysis is performed to identify the differences found between biological samples that have been subjected to a treatment or condition. This can be a genetic mutation, drug treatment or environmental constraint. No one method is fully capable of completely profiling the metabolome of a cell or tissue. To maximize the number of metabolites observed, the Core is equipped with three chemical analysis platforms, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. The research base of the CIHD focuses on questions that can easily be addressed with these services. The staff of the proposed Metabolomics Core will assist investigators in training sessions for sample preparation, equipment use and analysis. Program staff will also assist users in preparation of materials for publications and presentations within the CIHD and externally to national and international meetings."
"9339500","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Every year approximately 40,000 Americans are diagnosed with RCC including military personnel, their family members, and U.S. Veteran population. It is expected that 54,390 new cases of kidney cancer would be diagnosed and 13,010 affected individuals would die in the U.S. in 2012. Approximately 50% of patients with metastatic RCC have a survival rate of less than one year. In addition, cancer contributes approximately 10% to mortality in diabetic patients. More than 23 million persons in the United States with diabetes and predicting by 2025 will be increase to 25 million and that may increase the risk of solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma. We show recently that 25.4 % of kidney cancer patients have history with diabetes from San Antonio Hospitals. The mechanism by which diabetes enhances certain pathways to develop cancer is largely unknown. In addition, there is no valid biomarker for the early detection of the incidence of cancer in diabetic patient. Hypothesis: we hypothesize that the chronic exposure to high glucose (hyperglycemia, HG) and/or insulin (hyperinsulinaemia, HI) activates the cell survival kinase, Akt and lead to inactivates tumor suppressor protein, tuberin (protein encodes by TSC2). Inactivation of tuberin resulted in (1) activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTOR) mTORC1 to blocks and degrades insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS- 1) and (2) activation of mTOC2 to activate Akt through feedback loop. On the other hand, activation of mTORC1/C2 resulting in downregulation of the DNA repair enzymes 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) to inactivates cell apoptosis. Inactivation of OGG1 and PARP resulted in accumulation of oxidative DNA, 8-oxodG. DNA damage (8-oxodG) enhances DNA methylation and mutagenesis and predisposes kidney and other organs to cancer. To better understand the mechanism of biological plausibility by which hyperglycaemia and/or hyperinsulinaemia increasing cancer risk and find a biomarker for early detection of cancer in diabetic patients, we proposed the following specific aims. SPECIFIC AIM 1: To determine the mechanisms by which chronic exposure of high glucose or high glucose+high insulin regulates cell survival/apoptosis/proliferation and DNA damage/repair pathways to prompt DNA methylation/mutations in proximal tubular cells, where renal cell carcinoma originates. SPECIFIC AIM 2: To explore the effect of hyperinsulinemia+hyperglycemia on the rate of development and severity of renal cell carcinoma in TSC2+/- in our new TSC2+/-/dbdb mouse model (model of type II diabetes). SPECIFIC AIM 3: To determine the relevant effect of hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia+ hyperglycemia identified in cell culture and animal to diabetic patients. In addition, find a candidate gene(s) that can be used as a biomarker for early detection of cancer in diabetic patients."
"9359612","Despite the dearth of mechanistic insights into precisely how cell therapy works, preclinical studies commonly report a reduction in fibrosis. Thus, to understand how cell therapy limits remodeling, we must first appreciate how reparative cells interact with the stromal compartment. In the normal heart, fibroblasts are essential in maintaining the extracellular matrix. Following infarction, fibroblasts assume an active role in acute wound healing. Although this phenotypic activation is necessary for the acute post-ischemic injury response, fibroblasts become chronically activated, which contributes to post-ischemic pathology. Project 3 will elucidate whether and how cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMCs) interact with the recipient heart and will identify CMC- mediated changes in fibroblast activation. Because the post-MI heart is characterized by a shift in the balance of hyaluronan (HA) metabolism in which more HA is produced than is degraded, HA accumulation may contribute to persistent fibroblast activation and support unresolved inflammation. Furthermore, we reason that cell therapy effects myocardial repair by restoring balance to dysregulated HA metabolism, which is largely propagated by activated fibroblasts. We will perform proof-of-concept studies to show whether and how HA metabolizing enzymes in reparative cells may regulate their competence in in vivo models of post-ischemic myocardial repair. We will identify specific receptor-ligand interactions that confer reparative competence to therapeutic cells. Although the aforementioned goals are worthy of pursuit on their own, we argue they should be examined further through a translational lens because preclinical studies of reparative cells use healthy animals as cell donors; however, clinical trials of autologous cells use heart failure (HF) patients as both donors and recipients. This preclinical/clinical dichotomy creates a sizeable translational barrier. Because significant changes occur in the stromal compartment following infarction, reparative cells derived therefrom likely differ from naïve reparative cells. Indeed, our preliminary data indicate that heart failure-derived CMCs lack reparative competence, which may stem from their inability to properly metabolize post-MI stromal components, such as HA. We will identify and correct defects in incompetent, heart failure-derived CMCs. Thus, our central hypothesis holds that reparative cells attenuate ventricular remodeling through recognition of and response to specific stromal components, which are lost in CMCs derived from failing hearts. We will test this hypothesis through these synergistic aims: 1) Elucidate the impact of CMCs on fibroblast activation; 2) Determine how CMCs interact with the recipient heart to limit maladaptive remodeling; 3) Identify and rescue defective mechanisms in heart failure-derived reparative cells. Thus, we will show, for the first time, how CMCs shape the post-MI stroma to limit fibroblast activation. We will also identify reasons for reparative incompetence in heart failure-derived CMCs and restore their competence by rescuing their capacity to metabolize HA. Collective insights from Project 3 will fundamentally change future cell therapy studies."
"9328332","Project Summary Microbial dysbiosis is known to alter physiologic homeostasis and contribute to pathogenesis. Though morphine and other narcotics are the most widely prescribed therapy for moderate to severe pain, they have been noted to alter microbial composition and promote bacterial translocation to other tissues. Translocated microbes may then modulate local cell signaling and gene expression. One of the most immediately vulnerable compartments following bacterial dissemination is the intestinal wall, containing many terminal processes of extrinsic primary afferent neurons (EPANs) from dorsal root ganglia (DRG). These neurons play an integral role in a major limiting factor of narcotic use, analgesic tolerance; however, the impact of gastrointestinal microbiota on the development of tolerance in these cells has not been well characterized. This F30 fellowship application seeks to investigate the interaction between the gastrointestinal microenvironment and morphine tolerance of dorsal root ganglion nociceptors. Using voltage-clamp electrophysiology, we will test whether tetrodotoxin-resistant Na+ channels are involved in morphine responses and tolerance in these cells, and if microbial manipulation via antibiotic treatment impacts these processes. Using supernatants from mouse colon tissue samples, we will assess whether the gut microenvironment can independently alter morphine tolerance in naïve DRG nociceptors. Finally, to assess the translational capacity of our findings, we will attempt to recapitulate these findings using supernatants from human colon biopsy samples. In carrying out our research strategy, we hope to improve treatment outcomes by promoting maintenance of analgesic efficacy and reducing the need for clinical dosage escalations."
"9344678","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a progressive enlargement of the abdominal aorta with a prevalence of ~9% in the male population of age 65 years and above. The disease accounts for over 15,000 deaths each year in the US alone. Moreover, the only treatment option for AAA is surgical intervention, which comes with an associated financial burden. With 25,000 surgical repairs occurring in the US annually, the total expenditure runs into billions of dollars thus impacting economic burden of the society. Only with an increased understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the development of AAA will novel non- surgical therapies be devised to reduce AAA progression. While multiple factors are involved in disease pathogenesis, the critical stimulus is the differentiation and infiltration of naïve macrophages (Mf). A typical response to aortic injury elicits differentiation of a classic M form of macrophages from Mf, which produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to phagocytize apoptotic cells and damage- associated debris. However, their uncontrolled production damages the healthy tissue leading to aortic dilation and death of vascular cells. In contrast, Mfs have also the potential to be programmed to an alternative differentiation termed M2-like macrophages. These M2 macrophages have the ability to inhibit the inflammatory response and promote tissue repair. Although the roles of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages have been well characterized in various vascular diseases including AAA, little is known about the critical factors that initiate the differentiation of Mf into M2-phenotyp and their potential roles in AAA. Our lab has recently identified Notch1 as one such which factor promotes M2-differentiation of Mf. The long term goal of our research is to determine the roles for M2-differentiated macrophages in vascular diseases. The objective of this proposal is to determine if Notch1 deficiency in macrophages prevents AAA progression by increasing M2 differentiation of Mf. Based upon our preliminary studies and published literature, we hypothesize that deficiency of Notch1 will increase differentiation of Mf into M2-phenotype by TGF-ß2 dependent mechanisms. We plan to test our hypotheses with the following Specific Aims: i) Determine if myeloid-specific inducible- Notch1 haploinsufficiency can prevent AAA progression; ii) Determine if M2-differentiated macrophages protect against AAA development in mice and iii) Determine if TGF-ß2 is a critical requirement for Notch1-mediated M2 differentiation of Mf. These Specific Aims are designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the regulatory role of Notch1 signaling on M2 differentiation of Mf in the setting of AAA. Our approach is innovative as we are proposing a series of experiments using double mutant mice generated in the lab, cell culture and human aortae obtained from AAA patients to achieve our goal. The proposed research is highly significant because it may provide the necessary steps for the therapeutic application targeting Notch1 to increase M2 population of macrophages for the prevention of AAA growth."
"9538389","ABSTRACT Trauma or congenital defects of bone, including the craniofacial skeleton, are particularly damaging to physical and psychological well-being. There is an unmet clinical need to improve existing technologies designed to enhance bone formation: to treat traumatic bone injury, reverse age-induced bone loss, and relieve symptoms of heritable disorders of bone metabolism. Notch is a developmental cell-cell signaling pathway with myriad functions that is highly conserved through evolution. Coordinated changes in Notch ligand/receptor presentation alter bone metabolism in a manner dependent on cellular origin and differentiation state. We hypothesize that contextual interactions between the 5 different Notch ligands and the 4 different Notch receptors regulate cell fate decisions driving bone healing, and that Notch ligand gain-of-function may be used to promote therapeutic intramembranous bone formation. This study aims to answer significant yet unexplored questions concerning the role of Notch signaling in adult stem cell biology: 1) What are the specific Notch ligand/receptor interactions driving osteoblastogenesis? 2) How are Notch ligand deficiencies compensated, and what is the resulting bone phenotype? 3) Can modulation of Notch signaling drive therapeutic bone formation? To answer these questions, we will utilize two mouse models of adult bone regeneration: calvarial defect as a translational model of craniofacial bone regeneration following acute trauma and femoral marrow ablation to model rapid intramembranous bone formation in compartmentalized long bone. In Aim I we propose to characterize the Notch ligand/receptor interactions governing mesenchymal progenitor cell differentiation toward bone. In Aim II we propose to elucidate modifications and compensatory mechanisms implicated in Notch ligand deficiencies altering bone regeneration. In Aim III we propose to assess therapeutic modification of the Notch pathway to improve healing of critical-size craniofacial defects. Bone formation in wild-type and conditional Notch ligand single/double knockout mice will be evaluated following these procedures, and outcome variables will include gene expression analysis, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, histomorphometry, super-resolution confocal microscopy and micro-computed tomography. Elucidation of Notch ligand/receptor interactions driving osteoblastogenesis holds significant promise for informing safe and efficacious pharmacological intervention improving bone healing. Using modern molecular biological techniques, biophysical chemistry and advanced imaging, this comprehensive cross- sectional small animal study will provide essential pre-clinical data on therapeutic ligand delivery for craniofacial bone healing. Successful completion of the proposed project will improve outcomes of reconstructive surgeries involving the skull and reduce morbidity associated with conventional bone grafting."
"9297400","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  (Overall Abstract) Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder with most cases having a hereditary predisposition. Our overall goal is to elucidate the molecular, cellular and neuronal circuitry defects in hereditary forms of early onset  dystonia and to find common pathways in their etiology and potential targeted drugs for therapeutic intervention. Members of our team discovered three genes underlying early onset dystonia, TOR1A (DYT1), THAP1 (DYT6) and GNAL (DYT25) and have developed and characterized mouse and Drosophila models of DYT1 dystonia, as well as initiating studies on mouse models of DYT6 and DYT25 dystonia. We hypothesize that the core pathophysiology lies in abnormal neurotransmitter signaling, primarily in the striatum, which manifests throughout life as abnormal synaptic plasticity. Studies will analyze neuronal cultures, as well as neurophysiology in these dystonia mouse models, as well as enhancer/suppressor genes in Drosophila mutants. Common themes include cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter interactions in the striatum, transcriptional and functional control of signaling proteins, and transport of mRNAs in ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for translation at synapses. We will approach these themes with an armamentarium of research tools, including state-of-the-art human molecular genetics, primary neuronal and iPS cell-derived neuronal cultures, and Drosophila and mouse models of dystonia examined using genetic and cell biologic methods and electrophysiologic analysis of slice explants and microdialysis in mouse models. This highly integrated P01 will be led by Dr. Xandra Breakefield, Director and Laurie Ozelius, Co-Director and includes: Project 1 - Genes and susceptibility factors in primary torsion dystonia (PI Dr. Laurie Ozelius, Mt. Sinai Sch. Med.); Project 2 - TorsinA as a key link in receptor-mediated signaling (PI Dr. Xandra Breakefield, Co-Is Drs. D. Cristopher Bragg and Naoto Ito, Mass. Gen.

Birmingham); Core A - Administration; and Core B - Clinical Core (Dr. Nutan Sharma, Mass. Gen. Hosp.). Clinical information and samples feed directly into Projects 1, 2 and 3. These studies will elucidate common molecular pathways involved in human dystonia to inform therapeutic advances."
"9360141","Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells."

The training will be conducted by established vision science and clinical science researchers, primarily mentors in the Group in Vision Science who are also faculty members in the UC Berkeley School of Optometry. Each trainee will be engaged in one short-term training period (summer), following completion of their first year of optometry school. In the past, most trainees in the current grant period were appointed during the summer after the 1st year, with a limited number of UC Berkeley-based students reappointed after their 2nd year. Similar appointments for non-Berkeley students were precluded by summer clinical training requirements of their respective programs. Recent changes to the 3rd year curriculum at UC Berkeley now also preclude formal reappointment of local trainees although students are encouraged to continue their research with support from their faculty mentor and/or as part of UC Berkeley Honors Research Program. The training program is designed to attract talented students to clinical and/or translational research by developing their interest, awareness and enthusiasm for a career in biomedical or behavioral research. Training will be provided within the laboratories of 23 mentors in the School of Optometry, where currently 38 pre-doctoral students and approximately 20 postdoctoral fellows are involved in the Graduate Program in Vision Science. The mentors also train graduate students in other disciplines (e.g. neuroscience, computer science, molecular and cell biology, psychology and infectious disease). The Research Program in Vision Science has been in existence for over 65 years on the Berkeley campus and has graduated more than 200 trainees with advanced degrees (almost all PhDs) - the majority now actively engaged in vision research. In the past 15 years, the program has attracted many clinicians to its Ph.D. training program. The same mentors that train PhD students will also mentor optometry students on this short-term training grant. A wide range of basic science as well as clinical research projects are on-going in the laboratories of the mentors offering numerous opportunities for involvement by the short-term trainees. Optometry schools from across the country are targets of our recruitment efforts aimed at attracting a diverse pool of talented health professional students to our short-term training program. The long-term goal is to encourage clinicians to pursue advanced research training and/or continue involvement in research after completion of their professional training."
"9306038","An inherent challenge within cancer research is the cataloguing of fundamental information on what is generally fatal metastatic disease within vital organs. Treating metastatic progression remains a formidable task due to an inability to monitor specific differential molecular adaptations that allow for the cancer to survive and thrive within different tissue types. Hence, an important consideration is the divergence of the metastatic cancer cells growing in visceral organs from the primary tumor. To address this problem, we have established isogenic human metastatic breast cancer cell lines, which are representative of the common metastatic sites of lung, bone, liver, and brain observed in breast cancer patients. Our preliminary biological evaluations of these new metastatic cell lines strongly indicated that they exhibit site-to-site phenotypic distinctions that ultimately reflect genetic diversity as well as drug resistance differences. In addition, we have preliminary label-free Raman spectroscopy and metabolomic characterizations that provide objective evidence of the distinct biochemical differences that specifically identify each of the cell lines. Importantly, we have carried out label-free Raman spectroscopy on human breast cancer tissue microarray slides and obtained defined spectral biochemical signatures that differentiate normal from metastatic breast tissues. The importance of this finding is that we have now established objective molecular methods that will permit the identification of unique signatures of breast cancer metastatic lesions. The central hypothesis is that identification of molecular signatures that can be assigned to site-specific breast cancer metastatic lesions will facilitate optimal treatment strategies to increase overall survival. In this application, three specific Aims have been proposed to test the above hypothesis. In specific Aim 1, we will establish Raman spectral signatures of newly established isogenic organ-specific metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro. In specific Aim 2, we will validate Raman spectral signatures in preclinical models of breast cancer metastasis and in matched primary and metastatic human breast cancer samples. In specific Aim 3, we will determine chemotherapeutic efficacy of FDA approved oncological drugs in a site-specific manner based on Raman spectral signatures."
"9298641","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glomerular dysfunction is a common basis for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a condition with significant comorbidities and mortalities. Recent studies highlighted the role of podocyte actin cytoskeleton and the slit diaphragm in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB), and the development of albuminuria (AU) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The key role of cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) signaling in podocyte function and the above pathologies is established, however our mechanistic understanding of podocyte [Ca2+]i dynamics is limited to a few players (angiotensin II, TRPC5/6). Most P2 purinoceptors including P2Y2 that bind extracellular ATP signal via [Ca2+]i and have been implicated in a variety of (patho)physiological functions in many organs including paracrine cell-to-cell crosstalk, tissue injury and sclerosis. While the important function of the P2Y2 receptor in renal tubular transport and blood flow autoregulation is well established, its role in podocytes/glomerulus is largely unknown. Here we propose to study podocyte [Ca2+]i dynamics in vivo in the intact kidney in health and disease and to characterize the role and therapeutic relevance of a novel [Ca2+]i signaling mechanism in podocytes that is mediated by P2Y2 purinergic receptors. We hypothesize that P2Y2-mediated elevations in [Ca2+]i is a robust and key novel mechanism in primary podocyte injury, and also that its cell-to-cell propagation between podocytes results in amplified focal segmental dysfunction of the GFB and the development of AU and FSGS. The overall theme, to study the role of P2Y2 in podocyte/GFB injury and the effect of P2Y2 blockade on AU and FSGS, will be addressed by applying a novel imaging approach that employs intravital multiphoton microscopy (MPM) combined with new mouse models of fluorescent podocyte labeling and tagging. These studies may potentially change the current view of the pathogenesis of glomerular disorders and may also provide a clinically and immediately available, novel therapeutic approach for glomerular kidney diseases. The specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the role of P2Y2 signaling in podocyte [Ca2+]i dynamics and GFB/glomerular function in response to podocyte injury/disease. (2) Establish the amplifier function of P2Y2 signaling in the propagation of podocyte injury. (3) Test whether P2Y2 blockade can blunt/reduce the development of podocyte injury, AU and FSGS."

"9339531","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, and is one of the most frequent indications for hospitalization within the Veterans Health Care System. The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3IP2 (TRAF3-interacting protein 2; also known as CIKS or Act1) is an adapter molecule that activates both IKK and JNK, and amplifies autoimmune and inflammatory responses by inducing NF-B- and AP-1-responsive cytokine, chemokine, adhesion molecule and MMP expression. Our preliminary data show that ischemia/reperfusion (IR) upregulates TRAF3IP2 expression in the mouse heart. Notably, TRAF3IP2 gene deletion in a cardiomyocyte-specific manner blunts myocardial injury (infarct size) and dysfunction post-IR (genetic approach). Further, an ultrasound-targeted TRAF3IP2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide markedly attenuates myocardial infarct post-IR in wild type mice, and was superior to targeting its downstream effectors p65 and JNK1 (interventional approach). Based on these preliminary but critical observations, our central hypothesis is that IR-induced oxidative stress and cytokine expression converge on TRAF3IP2, resulting in the activation of IKK/NF-B and JNK/AP-1 pathways that ultimately lead to myocardial IR injury, dysfunction, and adverse remodeling. Our immediate goal is to understand the expression, regulation and role of TRAF3IP2 in IR injury, and develop strategies to target its expression in a clinically relevant time frame. Our long-term objective is to delineate the causal role of TRAF3IP2 in other models of myocardial injury and inflammation. To address our HYPOTHESIS, the following specific aims are proposed:  Specific Aim 1:  Define the critical role of TRAF3IP2 in IR-induced myocardial injury and dysfunction in vivo using genetic and interventional approaches Specific Aim 2:  Demonstrate that TRAF3IP2 is critical in IR-induced adverse remodeling in vivo Specific Aim 3:  Discover potential targets for intervention by (i) Investigating the mechanisms of oxidative stress and cytokine induced TRAF3IP2 expression and regulation, and (ii) Identifying the structural motifs responsible for TRAF3IP2 interaction wit the IL-18 receptor and MyD88. Using both genetic and interventional approaches, these novel and innovative studies will establish TRAF3IP2 as a pivotal regulator of myocardial injury, dysfunction, and adverse remodeling post-IR, and identify it as a better therapeutic target than either NF-B or JNK in IR injury."
"9371591","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We propose mHealth Messaging to Motivate Quitline Use and Quitting (M2Q2), a collaborative research project for a mobile health intervention designed to motivate smoking cessation and encourage access to counseling, and targeted to men and women smokers in Vietnam's Red River Delta region, a largely rural area. Cigarette smoking is the number one preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, and tobacco-related deaths are predicted to increase worldwide, particularly in low and middle-income countries. In Vietnam, currently over 50% of men (and 2% of women) smoke combustible cigarette products. Per the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, Vietnam has implemented several initiatives to support tobacco cessation, including the initiation of quitlines. However, these quitlines are underused; over the past 6 months, a quitline in North Vietnam was called only about 25 times per day, a fraction of the smokers in the region. Our goal in this proposal is to increase use of the quitline, increasing access to counseling services, nicotine replacement therapy, with the goal of promoting cessation among current tobacco users. In prior work, we have leveraged automated messaging technology to engage patients in public health smoking cessation interventions, using email and text messages to encourage patients to seek counseling services, and to send motivational messages to smokers encouraging them to quit. Based on this work, we have demonstrated that clinics are willing to refer patients to a messaging system, as it requires minimal time within the busy clinical encounter. Further, we have found that motivational messages written by smokers for other smokers out-perform messages purely written by experts in tobacco control. Combining the strength of automated mobile health with cultural adaptations written by Vietnamese smokers for other Vietnamese smokers, and the counseling services of quitlines, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: In collaboration with the Institute of Population, Health, and Development (PHAD) in Hanoi Vietnam, we will adapt our current, effective texting system to Vietnam. The texting system will: 1) Motivate smokers to quit smoking, using tailored messages adapted to be culturally relevant, and 2) Encourage smokers to accept counseling services from the quitline, and take advantage of no-cost NRT that will be provided by the quitline to those willing to quit. Aim 2: Engage with the Bach Mai quitline, providing additional training in tobacco cessation counseling for those ready to quit, and motivational interventions for those not yet ready to quit. Aim 3: In a randomized trial (N = 600 men and women smokers in the Red River Delta), evaluate the impact of the texting system on access to the quitline, use of nicotine replacement therapy, increase in self-efficacy, and six-month biochemically verified smoking cessation. Our primary hypothesis is that smokers in the M2Q2 intervention will have higher rates of smoking cessation, compared with the comparison group. This application builds on our previous collaborations with the Vietnamese Ministry of Health and with PHAD in Hanoi, Vietnam. Over the past five years together, we have conducted both epidemiologic and intervention work, including successful conduct of a cluster-randomized trial in district medical clinics in Hung Yen with NIH funding."

"9279620","Title: From Biological to Social Processes: Interdisciplinary Training in Life Course Research The poor overall health status of the US population in comparison with our high-income peers and the staggering gaps in key measures of health and well-being by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity across the life course highlight the urgency at which we must address the factors and mechanisms that lead to poor health outcomes. At the same time, it has become ever more apparent that the scientific paradigms and research approaches of today have not effectively addressed the complex constellation of factors that fundamentally influence US health and well-being from birth through adulthood. For these reasons, the National Institutes of Health has called for novel integrative research, from cells to society, to better address the web of factors that cause persistent health inequalities and result in relatively poor overall levels of health in society. Nonetheless, there is a major gap in interdisciplinary training in US universities, partly because of disciplinary silos, lack of initiative, and historical distinctions on campuses. We propose an innovative training program that will produce highly trained interdisciplinary pre- and post-doctoral trainees entering from either the social sciences or biological/health sciences who will be able to conduct integrative work across these areas that will address some of the country's most pressing health problems. With training focused on gaining knowledge from a new area of study, enhancing interdisciplinary interactions and exchange, and integrative research production, we envision that these pioneering trainees will be more likely to develop into creative and flexible scientists whom are able to develop new research pathways and create the innovative unifying frameworks that arise from crossing disciplinary boundaries. To enhance training experiences, multidisciplinary exchange, and ultimately integration of biological/health and social approaches, we seek support for eight pre- doctoral trainees (four from the biological/health sciences and four from the social sciences annually) and two post-doctoral trainees (one from each of the social and biological/health sciences). With substantial guidance from the program directors and their cross-disciplinary mentors, trainees will develop individually tailored training tracks in either the social sciences or biological/health sciences, with the track tailored to prior disciplinary training and each trainee's research interests. Social science students and post-docs will develop a biological/health sciences gap training track in one of three areas: 1) genetics; 2) cardiovascular and metabolic; 3) immunology, infections, and microbiome), while biological/health science students and post-docs will develop a social science gap training track in one of three areas: 1) social inequality; 2) socio-spatial organization and processes; 3) age-period-cohort. With this program, we aim to create junior scientists who are able to conduct cutting edge integrative social and biological/health sciences research and who will be future leaders who will use these new approaches to improve human health and well-being in the US and beyond."
"9412383","Project Summary Cu is an essential micronutrient that can also be toxic to biological systems. Mammalian cells therefore need to tightly control Cu homeostasis. The kidney appears particularly effective at regulating Cu because this organ displays some of the smallest magnitude of Cu fluctuations during conditions of Cu excess or Cu limitation. However, recently published work in the Culotta lab has shown that kidney Cu levels can fluctuate during infection and inflammation. Specifically in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis, infection with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans stimulated a drop in kidney Cu and the invading pathogen responded by activating a fungal Cu starvation stress response. Concurrent to this drop in kidney Cu, serum Cu levels rose. In my preliminary studies, I discovered that the cause of this high serum Cu is a strong elevation in serum ceruloplasmin (Cp), an acute phase protein. Ceruloplasmin is a multi-copper oxidase for controlling Fe homeostasis and I observed increases in both Cp protein levels and Cp activity that can account for virtually all the elevated serum Cu. I hypothesize that during C. albicans infection, the demand for high Cu in producing ceruloplasmin triggers a loss in Cu from the kidney, and this drop in Cu is mediated through regulation of kidney Cu uptake or efflux. To investigate this hypothesis I will carry out the following aims. Aim 1: To define the host and fungal Cu responses as a function of infection severity. I will identify the level of infection required to stimulate the host Cu response (elevating serum Cp and decreasing kidney Cu) as well as the fungal Cu response (activate the Cu starvation stress response). Aim 2: To understand the mechanism for kidney Cu loss during infection. I will investigate the mechanism by which kidney Cu decrease occurs: does this involve reduced Cu uptake or enhanced Cu efflux? I will scrutinize both protein levels and localization of the Cu uptake transporter CTR1 and the Cu efflux transporter ATP7A in an effort to answer this question. Aim 3: Determine the signal for Cu loss in the kidney. To determine whether serum Cp is sufficient to induce kidney loss of Cu without fungal infection, I will inject mice with lipopolysaccharide and heat-killed C. ablicans cells, both of which will induce an inflammatory response including Cp induction without infection. Furthermore I will test if the phenomenon of kidney Cu loss occurs in Cp-/- homozygous deletion mice infected with C. albicans. Together these studies will provide insight into the mechanisms by which kidney Cu homeostasis is affected by infection and inflammation."
"9339544","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in adults in the United States, and no therapy is available to prevent stroke-induced neurological deficits. Neurogenesis is one of the important endogenous mechanisms for neuronal replacement, repair and functional recovery after stroke. However, the majority of newly generated neurons in the brain die soon after stroke. Among the mechanisms that could foster viable neuronal replacement, a favorable neurovascular niche with proper angiogenesis and neovascularization is the most crucial one. Therefore, strategies to enhance both neurogenesis and angiogenesis would greatly improve neuronal replacement and neurological recovery after stroke.  Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) has been proven to be neuroprotective against ischemic brain injury. NAMPT markedly promotes cell proliferation, migration and capillary-like tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures. However, the effect of NAMPT on angiogenesis in the context of cerebral ischemia is under-explored. Furthermore, whether NAMPT increases neurogenesis remains unknown. We have recently found that besides acute neuroprotection, NAMPT also promotes brain repair and neurovascular remodeling. Strikingly, we found that NAMPT recombinant protein can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and also improve long-term functional outcomes against cerebral ischemia. Therefore, the objective of this project is to test the novel neuroprotective/ neurorestorative function of NAMPT in the context of cerebral ischemia with a long-term aim to develop NAMPT as a novel, clinically relevant therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke. The hypothesis to be tested is that NAMPT protects against ischemic brain injury and improves long-term neurological outcomes by enhancing angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Focal ischemia will be induced in mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to mimic the pathophysiological changes in the brain after clinical ischemic stroke. The following specific aims are proposed:  Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that NAMPT reduces brain damage and improves long-term neurological outcomes after focal cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotective effect of NAMPT on ischemic brain injury will be first tested in transgenic mice that overexpress NAMPT specifically in the brain, and then its translational potential for the treatment of ischemic stroke will be furher tested using recombinant NAMPT protein. The endpoints for assessment include infarct size and functional outcomes.  Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that NAMPT treatment enhances cerebral neurovascular remodeling, including augmented angiogenesis and neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia. The effect of recombinant NAMPT protein on post-stroke neovascularization in peri-infarct brain areas will be quantitatively analyzed. The effect of NAMPT on neural stem cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and neuronal replacement following ischemic stroke will also be examined. Relevance of the proposed work to the VA patient care mission Approximately 11,000 veterans are hospitalized annually with new strokes and up to 80,000 veterans are stroke survivors. The population with post-stroke physical disability continues to grow due to the lack of effective therapies to restrict and/or repair devastating neuronal damage after stroke. The proposed study will develop NAMPT as a novel, clinically feasible therapeutic strategy to offer acute neuroprotection as well as long-term neurological recovery after stroke. The success of this study will enhance post-stroke rehabilitation and improve quality of life for veterans suffering from stroke."

"9377877","ABSTRACT Factors Associated with Reducing Diabetes-Related Disparities of Rural Latinos We propose a research study that would greatly expand the opportunity for students to be involved in research, contribute to their knowledge about the healthcare service needs of rural populations, and stimulate research at our university about healthcare for minority ethnic/racial rural populations, especially rural Latinos. The proposed study addresses the problem of health disparities among rural populations as a whole, and among rural Latino residents specifically. The U.S. Latino population is growing at a rapid pace. As a group, they are at a high risk for developing diabetes. Compared to other groups, they have high percentages of overweight or obesity, which are among the risk factors associated with Type 2 diabetes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). The complications of diabetes are serious and costly to the patient and the healthcare system as a whole. To date, little is known about the potential impact of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) on ethnic/racial disparities in healthcare (Pollack & Armstrong, 2011). Knowing how ACOs affect these disparities is particularly essential because some minority groups, such as Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans, are more concentrated in rural areas (Institute of Medicine, 2005). We propose a longitudinal study, the purpose of which is to: 1) compare health disparities and patient outcomes of rural Latino older adult patients diagnosed with diabetes to their non-Latino White counterparts, and 2) ascertain the impact of ACO participation by rural primary care providers (along with other factors) on rural Latino older adult patients. The study has two goals: Aim 1: To measure the disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates between rural Latino older adult patients of Medicare ACOs and rural non-Latino White older adult patients, and Aim 2: To identify factors related to reduced disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates of rural Latino older adult patients, including RHC participation in a Medicare ACO. We will apply a pre-post design treating Medicare ACO participation as an intervention. The project will use data for a four-year period before the Medicare ACOs began (2008 - 2011) and a four-year period afterwards (2012 - 2015). The project will proceed in 3 major phases as follows: 1) collecting, merging, and organizing secondary data from multiple sources; 2) researching and constructing variables to include in the analyses; and 3) conducting univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. The study will contribute to rural health research by adding to the knowledge about: 1) the factors that contribute to minimizing diabetes-related health disparities of rural Latino adults, 2) the diabetes preventive care effectiveness of ACOs, and 3) the types of ACOs most beneficial to rural Latino patients."
"9241461","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to design, implement, and evaluate a novel, practicum-based teacher professional development program for elementary school teachers, aligned to the recently released Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). It seeks to address well-described gaps in the scientific training of elementary teachers that threaten the effective implementation of NGSS and interrupt development of early youth science skills. Given the lack of quality science instruction in Chicago Public Schools (CPS) elementary classrooms, we offer that the best way to prepare a future STEM and biomedical workforce is to help improve NGSS-aligned instruction at the K-5 level. Science Club Summer Camp (SC2) uses an integrated approach to train CPS teachers and youth in the nature of science. An interdisciplinary team of scientists, master science teachers, NGSS experts, and youth development staff will collaborate to incorporate the NGSS Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), Crosscutting Concepts, and science and engineering practices into both out-of-school time learning at a summer camp and academic year instruction. Program participants will also learn about NGSS connections to health and biomedicine through interactions with practicing scientists, visits to research labs, and inquiry into health phenomena The proposed program draws on best practices for teacher professional development and youth mentoring to provide both summer and academic year support for third grade teachers and youth in CPS. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Design and implement an intensive elementary teacher professional development program, incorporating both summer and academic year support, 2) establish a summer science camp program, called SC2 Kids, at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago, and 3) evaluate and disseminate best practices for implementation of NGSS in third grade classrooms Over the course of the program, we will train 64 teachers and more than 2000 youth in authentic science and health practices. A multi-faceted evaluation plan will assess the impact of our program on teacher beliefs, knowledge, and understanding of the NGSS, and the degree to which their training results in changes to their instructional practice. Additionally, we will help teachers design critical NGSS-aligned assessment tools as measures of student learning. These instruments will provide early evidence on the connections between NGSS-aligned instruction and deeper student learning. In addition to addressing the acute need for NGSS-aligned teacher professional development strategies and high quality summer learning opportunities for disadvantages youth, it is our expectation that this dual use approach will serve as a model for future teacher professional development programs that seek to bridge learning in formal and informal environments and strengthen academic-community partnerships."
"9312142","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hormonal contraception (HC), including the injectable progestin depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and pregnancy have been associated with increased risk of HIV in some, but not all, large prospective studies. In February 2012, due to the conflicting epidemiologic study results and lack of sufficient mechanistic information, the World Health Organization held a technical consultation to evaluate the existing evidence on hormonal contraception and HIV infection. The WHO decided not to change the guidelines for access to HC for women at risk of HIV but recommended that women who specifically use progestin-only injectable contraception and seek to prevent unintended pregnancy and HIV should be strongly advised to also use condoms for dual protection. Policy makers and women's advocate groups have expressed concern that the WHO statement is insufficient and difficult to translate into effective counseling for women. In addition, genital HSV-2 infection is known to significantly increase a woman's risk of acquiring HIV, but the mechanism and the impact of hormones on this relationship are not understood. A more complete mechanistic understanding of how HC and HSV-2 may modify the female immune system to increase the risk of HIV is key to clarifying the results of the epidemiologic studies and to establishing more accurate and effective public health policy and practice. The aims of the proposed research are two-fold: 1) to understand the associations between systemic hormonal levels, circulating regulators of inflammation and immunity and soluble innate immunity mediators in the cervix, their relationship with HIV acquisition risk, and how these relationships are altered by exposure to hormonal contraception (DMPA and COC) and pregnancy; and 2) to define the effects of pregnancy and hormonal contraception on the innate immune system preceding, at the time of, and during established (> 6 months) HSV-2 infection to better understand the effect of hormonal contraception and pregnancy on HSV-2 associated HIV risk. We will use ~4,000 longitudinal paired serum and cervical specimens from 1,200 women from Uganda and Zimbabwe who used DMPA, COCs and no hormonal contraception and participated in the HC-HIV study with well-specified HIV and HSV-2 seroconversion dates and who experienced substantial HSV-2, HIV-1 and pregnancy incidence. We will use ELISA and the Meso Scale Discovery multiplex platform to measure levels of endogenous hormones and regulators of inflammation and immunity in cervical samples and paired blood serum. We will use cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to determine how hormonal contraception, pregnancy and menstrual cycle modify innate immunity, how systemic regulators affect the cervical immune environment, and how the immune regulators are associated with HSV-2 infection (incident and prevalent) and subsequent HIV acquisition risk. This research provides a unique opportunity to elucidate and validate the complex associations between endogenous and exogenous hormones, HSV-2 and HIV-1 through analysis of underlying shared biological mechanisms."
"9515136","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global burden of disease attributable to depression rose 37% from 1990 to 2010. The future projected rise is greatest in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, there is a gap of 1.2 million health workers needed to provide mental health services in LMIC. Task-sharing, the involvement of non-specialist health workers to deliver mental health services, is an essential aspect of reducing this gap. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of task-sharing interventions including psychotherapy have demonstrated depression symptom reduction in numerous LMIC. Barriers to scaling up RCTs include negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors among non-specialist health workers against persons with mental illness. The goal of this K01 Mentored Research Career Development Award is to broaden the candidate s expertise in complex intervention trials of task-sharing initiatives with a focus on reducing negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors among health workers assuming new responsibilities in mental health care delivery. Through research, coursework, and structured mentorship activities, the candidate will develop new competencies in complex intervention research including (1) conceptual knowledge of complex interventions and theory of change; (2) methodological techniques for design, implementation and analysis of cluster-RCTs in health systems; (3) ethical conduct of health systems intervention research in LMIC and collaboration with mental healthcare consumers; and (4) professional development to become an independent NIMH-funded investigator. Drs. Kathleen Sikkema, Vikram Patel, Crick Lund, and Bernice Pescosolido will mentor the candidate in these four objectives. The research will be conducted in Nepal through infrastructure of the NIMH U19 South Asia Hub for Advocacy, Research, and Education for Mental Health (SHARE) and the task-sharing initiative Programme for Improving Mental Health Care (PRIME). The candidate will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a supplemental training module to improve attitudes toward and social engagement with persons with mental illness, with the goal of moving past traditional concepts of stigma and stigma-reduction interventions. This module will be added to a mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) training to of improve provider competence in evidence based practices (EBP), and reduce patient depression severity. A pilot cluster-RCT of social engagement training for primary care workers will be conducted to assess feasibility and acceptability of content, procedures, adverse event monitoring, and analytic approaches. The aims of this pilot cluster-RCT include adaptation and pre-piloting a social engagement training module, piloting a cluster-RCT, and performing quantitative descriptive analysis to prepare for an appropriately powered R01, which would evaluate the impact of reducing negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors among primary care workers on EBP quality and patient outcomes. In Nepal, this research will contribute to scalable training models that promote quality clinical services and minimize barriers to implementation stemming from biases and discrimination perpetuated by providers. The study addresses Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health Goal C to foster integration of mental health into primary care, Goal D to advance methods to reduce stigma, and Goal E to develop sustainable training models to deliver EBP. These goals advance NIMH Strategic Aim 4 by expanding the knowledge base to promote EBP among diverse provider groups and contribute to the mission of the NIMH Road Ahead through collaboration with persons living with mental illness to improve dissemination and implementation of EBP."

"9371707","7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation."
"9402123","PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled ?Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction?. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis."

In doing so, the FGC will enhance research productivity and efficiency by effectively reducing the ?start-up? time required to implement these complex experimental systems, thus reducing costs and effort required and allowing for better study designs and higher quality studies than if investigators were to individually establish this technology. Further, this core will provide access to state-of-the-art technology without requiring the users to become experts in these technologies. The FGC core will be a practical vehicle for the translation of basic advances to clinical disease applications and their very important insights in to pathogenesis. We will specifically provide consultation, collaboration, hands-on technical expertise and starter reagents to the research community to identify the biological function of genetic variants (Aim1) and apply genomic editing technology (Aim 2) to assess the biological function of genetic variants associated with of autoimmune, autoinflammatory, and immune-related rheumatic pediatric diseases. We expect the FGC to be a hub of innovation for the research community, connecting scientists with the tools and expertise to take their research projects to the next level and to accelerate the discovery of the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the genetic associations observed."
"9344388","Symptomatic urinary stone disease affects approximately 900,000 persons in the United States each year, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost of $4.5 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, a complete characterization of renal stones, which includes stone composition and fragility, is critically needed for safe and cost effective management of stone disease, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects.  Our long term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to fully characterize urinary calculi, and to use evolving technology to reliably detect stone precursor lesions. Our objectives in this application are to develop a comprehensive, low-dose, stone-characterization exam using commercially-available dual-energy CT technology, and to detect stone precursor lesions using a prototype CT system equipped with energy resolving detectors. Based on our extensive preliminary results, we know that dual-energy CT can discriminate between several types of renal stones and provide accurate quantification of stone morphology.    Our central hypothesis is that this quantitative information can be acquired at reduced dose levels and used to predict stone fragility, which we define as the likelihood of a stone to be broken by SWL or endoscopic methods. We further hypothesize that use of pre-clinical, 225-micron, energy-resolving CT detectors will allow detection of stone precursor lesions such as Randall's plaques, as well as the presence of trace elements having a suspected role in stone formation, such as zinc.  We will accomplish these objectives through two specific aims:  1) Aim 1: Develop and validate a comprehensive low-dose stone-characterization exam using clinical dual-energy CT techniques.  2) Aim 2: Develop a pre-clinical spectral CT imaging technique that can detect precursor lesions and trace elements related to the formation of kidney stones."
"9330212","In the last grant period, our studies focused on intrinsic determinants of neuronal vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the renewal application, we propose to pursue extrinsic, network-based determinants of neuronal vulnerability in PD, focusing on the innervation the innervation of the SNc by the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). The PPN provides the SNc with a rich glutamatergic and cholinergic innervation. Both glutamatergic and cholinergic signaling have been implicated in PD pathogenesis, but until recently, rigorous characterization of the role of these two PPN projection systems in regulating the activity and stress levels of SNc dopaminergic neurons has not been possible. This situation has now fundamentally changed with the advent of optogenetic and pharmacogenomic approaches. Using these new tools, we propose to pursue four specific aims with translational potential. Specific Aim 1: Determine whether PPN glutamatergic synapses on SNc dopaminergic neurons increase their oxidant stress. Our working hypothesis is that PPN terminal release of glutamate activates GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in proximal dendrites of SNc dopaminergic neurons, leading to an elevation in Ca2+ concentration and mitochondrial oxidant stress. Specific Aim 2: Determine whether PPN cholinergic synapses on SNc dopaminergic neurons decrease their oxidant stress. Our working hypothesis is that PPN terminal acetylcholine release activates ?4?2- and ?6?2-containing postsynaptic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) and that repetitive activation of these terminals, leads to suppression in Cav1.3 channel currents and diminished mitochondrial oxidant stress. Specific Aim 3: Determine whether chronic nicotine administration decreases mitochondrial oxidant stress in SNc DA neurons. Our working hypothesis is that chronic nicotine administration suppresses intracellular Ca2+ oscillations driven by Cav1.3 channels during pacemaking and dis-facilitates glutamate release from PPN glutamatergic terminals, leading to a significant drop in mitochondrial oxidant stress and enhanced function. Specific Aim 4: Determine whether pharmacogenomic suppression of PPN glutamatergic neurons enhances the survival and function of SNc dopaminergic neurons in a mouse model of PD. Our working hypothesis is that dopamine depletion drives pathophysiological activity in PPN glutamatergic neurons, which increases oxidant stress levels in SNc DA neurons and accelerates their loss in PD models. The achievement of these aims could lead to the development of novel drugs targeting specific sub-classes of NMDARs and nAChRs that could be used in combination with Cav1.3 Ca2+ channel antagonists to slow or stop the progression of PD."

The Core will be primarily based in a University of Iowa BSL3 laboratory that is equipped for tissue culture and animal work. Personnel working in the Core are experienced in virological and cell culture techniques and in handling, infecting and analyzing mice. The Animal/Virology Core has several functions that are critical for success of this PO1 grant. 1. It will maintain colonies of hDPP4-knock-in mice. 2. It will propagate and titer nonrecombinant and recombinant mouse- adapted and human strains of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and will infect mice with these viruses. 3. It will monitor mice for clinical disease and weight loss and will harvest tissue. 4. The Core will prepare samples for histological and immunohistochemical analysis and will prepare RNA and protein from infected tissue. 5.The Core will analyze mice for virus-specific antibody and T cell responses. 6. The Core will develop recombinant MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV using BAC DNA clones prepared by the individual projects. The Core will also be responsible for ensuring that protocols for working with animals and for working under BSL3 laboratory conditions are up-to-date. While the Core will teach members of the Project methods important for analysis of mice under BSL3 conditions, it will primarily be responsible for performing most of these analyses. The Core will provide reagents and perform common assays efficiently, thereby standardizing results and enhancing synergistic interactions. Additionally, all projects will interact with the Core, thereby facilitating interactions between members of the PPG. By providing these services, the Core will allow Program investigators to focus on issues related to MERS and SARS pathogenesis and to the development of anti-viral therapies and vaccines."

"9334329","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In our planning grant we found that agricultural workers in Thailand (42% of the working population) were self- employed (informal sector), with little economic security, no formal occupational health & safety protections and significant exposures to pesticides. Thus they represent a population in need of research to policy initiatives. The initial research of our GEOHealth HUB (Mahidol University, Thailand & University of Massachusetts, USA) will focus on the agricultural health research question of whether some pesticides, widely used in Southeast Asian agriculture, act as endocrine disrupters, altering endocrine hormone homeostasis and resulting in increased risk of metabolic syndrome and associated diseases such as diabetes, stroke and coronary heart disease, all of which are on the rise in Thailand. In the paired research application (1/2-GEOHealth HUB: Improving Agricultural Health in Southeast Asia-Thailand), we hypothesize that disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormone homeostasis is a biomarker of risk for the development of metabolic disorders, and that several widely used pesticides act as HPT/HPA disrupters. To evaluate our hypothesis we will: 1) Use the Thai Universal Health Care System data to conduct a cross-sectional study of metabolic disorders by occupation; 2) Evaluate sub-chronic changes in HPT & HPA hormones longitudinally among Thai organic and pesticide using farmers; 3) Examine the acute endocrine impacts of pesticide spraying events for selected insecticides & herbicides; 4) Evaluate the impact of genetic polymorphisms on pesticide metabolism. This proposed research project represents the initial focus of our GEOHealth Hub, but future projects will extend the range of agricultural health research and expand into other related occupational & environmental health topics (climate change, other chronic diseases, neurobehavioral health and other work sectors). The matched training program for the GEOHealth Hub focuses on institutional capacity building through a program of mentored research training for 15 junior faculty and medical staff over 5 years at our partner institutions (initially Mahidol University and the Thai Ministry of Public Health). Each trainee will have a Mentorship Team (Thai and U.S. mentors). The training program will include: a) 1 month Introduction to GEOHealth program at Mahidol; b) 6 months of research specific training and mentorship in the U.S. (UMass, Rutgers or Mt. Sinai), resulting in a funded interdisciplinary project that extends the research being conducted in the paired research application; c) data collection, analysis and manuscript(s) from the approved research project, supported by Mentorship Team. The program is designed to establish an international, interdisciplinary collaborative research group that will continue to work together in the future. The training program will link with our proposed research project through extensions of the current project aims and pilot projects that extend the scope of the research in agricultural health, aiding the GEOHealth Hub to expand its research capacity. As the Hub develops, we will add new training partners from other Thai and Southeast Asian universities and institutions. We will use short term training to recruit future institutional partners through existing public healt networks (ThaiPHEIN, SEAPHEIN & APACPH) and to create opportunities for Hub members to interact and develop ideas for new approaches to agricultural health research. Research findings and tools, as well as training materials will be disseminated via our website and through our short term training workshops and seminars. We expect increased research capacity will be reflected in publications (number and quality), extramural funding, multidisciplinary collaborations, development of new research areas and agricultural health policy changes."
"9312291","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of the first several nephrotic syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) genes has had a significant impact on the understanding of glomerular function and disease. However, the known genes account for only a fraction of these diseases. During the most recent period of this award, we identified mutations in INF2 as a relatively common cause of autosomal dominant FSGS. We also identified two coding variants in APOL1 that explain the high rate of FSGS and other non-diabetic kidney diseases in African Americans. Here our goal is further elucidation of the genetic basis of FSGS, using a database of over 3800 individuals assembled over the past sixteen years. Specifically: (1) We will perform mutational analysis of known FSGS genes in families with FSGS and in patients with sporadic FSGS. We will continue our ongoing ascertainment of families with FSGS as well as sporadic adult and pediatric cases. Mutational analysis of these known FSGS genes will further inform our understanding of the spectrum of mutations, inform genotype/phenotype relationships, provide further information regarding structure and function, and help clarify the utility of genetic testing. (2) We will also aim to identify new FSGS genes. We will use exome capture and next-generation sequencing in affected members of multiple families with inherited FSGS to in order to identify rare coding sequence variants. We will use a combination of known variant filtering, cosegregation analysis, and evolutionary conservation to define which of these genes and variants are likely causally related to the development of FSGS. We will perform replication studies in additional FSGS families and sporadic FSGS cases as well as functional assessments in order to prove causal relationships to disease. (3) We will also perform studies to identify de novo variants causing or contributing to FSGS using exome sequencing. We will use exome sequencing in sporadic FSGS cases and their parents in order to identify de novo variants that may cause or contribute to the development of FSGS. This is a potentially powerful approach because fewer than one de novo exomic variant is expected per individual, making the list of candidate genes expected from this approach very low. Based on the great recent success of this approach in studies of sporadic neuropsychiatric disorders, we anticipate that we will identify several genes in which de novo variants are seen in more than one affected individual, and/or specific pathways frequently mutated. We expect to see overlap among genes harboring de novo variants and genes in which inherited variants segregate with FSGS in families. FSGS is a significant and growing cause of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. FSGS is also a common consequence of a variety of primary conditions. These studies will help understand the underlying causes of this disease."
"9339467","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background: Nearly 200,000 female Veterans will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime representing a significant health problem. Metastatic breast cancer is uniformly fatal. Objective: Our goal is to identify new therapeutic approaches to prevent mortality from breast cancer metastasis. We seek novel approaches to exploit the established contribution of the Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway to breast tumor growth and dissemination. The principle COX-2 product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exerts biological effects by binding to the E series of G protein-coupled prostaglandin receptors EP1-4. Results: We have made significant progress towards elucidating the unique role of individual EP receptors on malignant and host immune cells. EP1 suppresses while EP4 promotes metastasis. Our most important finding is that EP4 supports the survival of breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) with heightened tumorigenic, metastatic and chemotherapy resistant properties that contribute to relapse and mortality. EP4 also subverts innate antitumor immunity by inhibiting Natural Killer (NK) cells and inducing immune suppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) but the role of NK and MDSC in control of BCSC is not known. Our central hypothesis is that EP4 promotes metastasis by directly supporting BCSC and indirectly by suppressing antitumor immunity. Systemic targeting of multiple EP4-positive cells will result in additive, if not synergistic therapeutic responses. BCSC, expressing high levels of EP4 will be inhibited directly by EP4 blockade. EP4 inhibitors will protect anti-tumor NK cells from PGE2-mediated immune suppression and will prevent the induction of MDSC that otherwise directly support BCSC survival and prevent effective anti- tumor immunity. Methods: Using a combination of novel pharmacologic EP inhibitors and genetic approaches in orthotopic, xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models of metastatic breast cancer, we will determine the mechanism by which EP4 promotes and EP1 inhibits BCSC. Specific Aims: (1) Determine the effect of EP4/COX-2 targeting on BCSC. We will determine the mechanism by which EP4 supports BCSC, identify the relevant signaling pathways and will determine how EP4 is regulated in BCSC. (2) Determine the effect of EP4/COX-2 targeting on NK effector functions. Little is known regarding the role of innate immunity in the control of BCSC. We will characterize the role of NK cells in the recognition and killing of BCSC and will determine how EP4 regulates these interactions. (3) Determine the effect of EP4 targeting on MDSC and TAM. We will determine if EP4 blockade neutralizes the deleterious immune suppressive effects of MDSC and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). We will determine if MDSC directly support BCSC through an EP4-regulated mechanism that is independent of effects on innate or adaptive immunity. We will identify a clinically relevant combination therapy that may target cancer stem cells as well as non-stem cell populations. Impact: We will identify EP4 as a new therapeutic target, expressed on host cells and BCSC responsible for relapse and breast cancer mortality. EP4 targeting will overcome immune suppression leading to effective tumor control. Our results will inform the design of clinical trias under development in collaboration with RaQualia/AskAt to determine if administration of an EP4 antagonist reduces breast cancer mortality in female and male Veterans and in the general population with breast cancer."
"9407146","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal this Phase 1 SBIR project is to develop an agonist bias assay for screening drugs that target seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Phase 1 will establish the feasibility of a robust assay platform to detect when particular GPCR agonists activate both ?-arrestin and G-protein pathways. This assay will detect responses in living cells on automated fluorescence plate readers, and will be compatible with screening in any cell type including neurons, pancreatic islets, cardiomyocytes, transformed cell lines and iPSC-derived cells. Depending upon the GPCR and cell type, biased agonism can be therapeutically beneficial or produce unwanted or harmful side effects (Violin and Lefkowitz, 2007). Quantifying bias in GPCR signaling could help to identify treatments that avoid adverse effects. Detecting agonist bias early in the screening process, in cell types that are relevant to disease, has the potential to reduce the risk and cost of drug discovery. The following specific aims will establish the feasibility of this assay: Aim 1: Develop dimerization-dependent fluorescent proteins to report ?-arrestin protein interactions involved in signaling. The dimerization-dependent fluorescent protein (ddFP) sensors will serve as a rapid prototype to be used as a standard for verifying sensors described in Aim 2. The ddFP sensors will be a functional readout for the protein interactions characteristic of ?-arrestin signaling. The ddFP sensors will be built using standard molecular cloning in the matter of a few weeks and will be detectable using epi- fluorescence microscopy. These prototype sensors are not amenable for detection on automated plate readers but will be useful for lower throughput, nonquantitative applications. Aim 2: Develop ?-arrestin signaling sensors that are based on one, bright fluorescent protein that have such large signals that they are detectable on an automated fluorescence plate reader. Building on the ?-arrestin protein interactions in aim one, we will harness the large scale movements of ?-arrestin associated proteins to create a bright green sensor with circularly permuted mNeonGreen. Libraries of candidate sensors will be built and screened using an iterative, directed evolution approach. Aim 3: Test a fluorescence plate reader assay that simultaneously detects G-protein and ?-arrestin signaling typical of biased agonism. ?2-adrenergic receptor activation by agonists that signal through either or both the Gs pathway and the ?-arrestin pathway (Drake et al., 2008) will be used to test the assay on a standard fluorescence plate reader. Responses from prototype sensors for ?-arrestin signaling, developed in aims one and two, and a previously developed red cAMP sensor (Tewson et al., 2016) will be compared to determine levels of agonist bias from known ?2-adrenergic agonists. www.montanamolecular.com"
"9301433","The Biostatistical Design and Analysis Core (BDAC) was established in year 3 of the first funding cycle in response to user surveys which expressed a strong need for sound and efficient biostatistical expertise and resource support. The overall aims of BDAC are to provide data management and biostatistical resources and expertise to promote best statistical practices; and to facilitate the development of function-promoting therapies through research and the training of biomedical and data scientists committed to aging research. BDAC activities are directed toward the three mutually reinforcing Specific Aims: (1) To provide rigorous, secure and comprehensive biostatistical and data management support to OAIC projects. (2) To conduct novel applied and methodologic research aligned with the OAIC initiatives, with emphasis on conduct of intervention trials and translational research in FPTs. (3) To insure rigorous training in research design and data analysis of clinical and quantitative scientists, with emphasis on the epidemiology and treatment of loss of physical function in aging.  The BDAC's outstanding leadership has substantial expertise in clinical trials, observational studies, experimental design, multivariate analysis, causal inference, statistical genetics, graphical data display, and missing data, and is seasoned in the leadership of data science teams. The Core is led by Thomas Travison, PhD (Core Leader), a biostatistician and translational researcher with 15 years' experience in the design and analysis of clinical studies in aging; and Ralph D'Agostino, PhD (Core Co-Leader), an internationally recognized leader in clinical trials design, observational studies, and comparative effectiveness research; and Paola Sebastiani, Ph.D., an internationally recognized statistical geneticist.  Core personnel maintain active and highly productive collaborative relationships with OAIC biomedical investigators, as well as leadership in independent and collaborative research programs with allied scientists. In addition, the BDAC provides key venues for dynamic mentoring, collaboration and peer support for OAIC investigators and trainees through its interactive methods workshop and seminar series, consultative services, and the continual interaction between Core personnel and OAIC-affiliated scientists and physicians. The BDAC has embedded continuous innovation in its operations; examples of this innovation include the novel risk scoring algorithms developed by the BDAC biostatisticians for mobility disability and cardiometabolic illnesses in older populations; collaborative work with OAIC-affiliated biostatisticians at Yale and Wake Forest universities in designing novel randomization schemes for pragmatic cluster-randomized trials; and the development of novel and integrated web-enabled tools in the developmental project, which enhance the replicability and reproducibility of scientific findings. The BDAC is therefore a key contributor to the Boston OAIC's outstanding record of success."
"9209898","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are coronavirus-induced human respiratory diseases with high case-fatality rates. Disease is especially severe in aged populations. In the previous funding period, we showed that age-dependent increases in prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and an upstream phospholipase A2, PLA2G2D contributed to poor immune responses and decreased survival. The lung is in a state of chronic inflammation, resulting from continued exposure to environmental antigens. We postulated that PLA2G2D, which has anti- inflammatory properties, is upregulated to counter this low grade inflammation, resulting in delayed responses to innocuous antigens but also to rapidly replicating viruses like MERS-CoV and SARS- CoV. In contrast, genetic absence of DP1, the PGD2 receptor on myeloid cells, appears to result in poor respiratory dendritic cell activation suggesting that PGD2-DP1 signaling may have pro- inflammatory properties at early times after infection. Our central hypothesis is that small lipid mediators are major factors in the inflammatory milieu in the lung, affecting many aspects of the immune response to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other respiratory pathogens. This hypothesis will be approached in the following specific aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of PLA2G2D upregulation and the role of PLA2G2D in vaccine responses in 12m old mice. CoV replication includes extensive cellular membrane rearrangements. The role between these rearrangements, the induction of oxidative stress and the upregulation of PLA2G2D will be investigated. 2. To determine the role of PGD2-DP1 signaling in the immune response to SARS-CoV in 12 m mice. The absence of PGD2-DP1 signaling results in diminished rDC activation and type I IFN (IFN-I) expression and increased inflammasome activation. Our goal is to determine whether changes in inflammasome activation are the major pathogenic effect of absent PGD2-DP1 signaling or if other factors are also involved. 3. To determine whether disease severity in murine MERS is age-dependent and whether PGD2 and PLA2G2D contribute to poorer outcomes. Using our newly developed hDPP4-KI mice and mouse-adapted MERS-CoV, we will determine whether MERS-CoV in mice also causes an age-dependent disease. We will also assess whether changes in eicosanoid expression contribute to more severe disease. MERS-CoV, unlike SARS-CoV, productively infects macrophages. In this aim we will determine whether productive infection of human and murine macrophages modulates PLA2G2D expression."

"9337257","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Our goal in this project is to validate innovations in MRI to improve the characterization of carotid plaque and ultimately improve the management of carotid disease. Atherosclerotic disease of the carotid artery is the direct cause of 173,000 or approximately 25% of the nearly 690,000 ischemic strokes each year in the United States. However, current risk stratification based on percent stenosis provides very little patient specific information on the actual risk of stroke for most veterans with carotid disease. Within the VA system during the past 4-years, over 15,000 veterans underwent surgical treatment for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Prospective randomized studies have found that only 10% of these asymptomatic patients will have a stroke within 5 years, and the significant majority will never have a cerebrovascular event. Although percent carotid stenosis is a well-established marker used to stratify patients to medical treatment or surgery, this method is only moderately sensitive, nonspecific, and limited in its ability to predict future stroke. Using MRI techniques that can image plaque surface morphology and composition, prospective longitudinal studies suggest that carotid inflammation, intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) and plaque luminal surface disruption (disruption of fibrous cap (FC)) are associated with an increased risk of cerebral ischemic events. Although promising, the accuracy of these studies is limited by the small size of important plaque features, the depth of the artery, patient motion, and the general limitations of the MRI techniques used. In this project we will evaluate newly developed 3D MRI acquisition methods that are specifically designed to improve the detection and characterization of these important plaque details. Faster imaging coupled with methods to detect and eliminate motion-corruption will achieve a marked increase in in-vivo spatial resolution and clarity of plaque components. The combination of high-resolution 3D MRI, motion detection and correction, and cardiac and respiratory variation identification and elimination will provide detail of plaque morphology at a resolution not previously available. By overcoming most sources of motion artifacts in carotid imaging, this work will reduce the failure rate of carotid MRI and increase the accuracy in assessment of fibrous cap, intraplaque hemorrhage, and inflammation. The swallow detection and image re-acquisition should eliminate or reduce major swallowing artifacts. By improving the visualization and description of plaque morphology, these methods should improve the detection and characterization of lesions that are at high risk of causing cerebral emboli. The ability to effectively triage carotid artery disease would be of significant benefit, providing reassurance to those without high-risk lesions that they can safely be treated without surgery while providing substantial support to the recommendation for intervention in those with unstable plaques."
"9537764","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to expand the functions and capabilities of the Rat Resource and Research Center (RRRC) to provide biomedical investigators with the rat models, embryonic stem cells, related reagents, protocols and services that will facilitate their research. The RRRC provides a unique repository service to the research community by importing, storing and distributing a large number of rat strains. It assures that valuable models are preserved and made available to interested investigators, allows researchers to satisfy NIH requirements for resource sharing, relieves individual investigators from the burden of animal distribution and ensures that models are maintained with rigorous genetic quality control and health monitoring to promote experimental reproducibility. Recent advances in genome editing technologies that can be used successfully in virtually any species to make targeted mutations (e.g., knock-outs and knock-ins) will facilitat the ability to genetically engineer rats to create new disease models. As a result, the number of rat models and the number of investigators using rat models for biomedical research is likely to increase substantially and the RRRC, as one of the only centralized repositories in the world will continue to serve a critical role for archiving and distributing these new models. To improve repository functions, applied research to optimize methods of sperm cryopreservation and subsequent recovery will be performed. To begin to address emerging awareness of the impact of the microbiome on model phenotype and experimental reproducibility, the RRRC will provide services to assess microbiota as well as conduct research to better characterize the gut microbiota in rats. To expand the broad utility of the RRRC, we propose to increase our fee-for-services in the areas of model generation, characterization, cryopreservation and rederivation. By expanding our services, the RRRC will serve as a much-needed one stop resource for investigators using rats in biomedical research."
"9329221","Project Summary/Abstract Lysophospholipases A1 and A2 (LYPLA1 and LYPLA2) are serine hydrolases responsible for the hydrolysis of lipid mediators derived from glycerolipids (1-3). These enzymes were first identified as lysophospholipid (LPL) hydrolases, with distinct substrate specificities despite 81% sequence similarity (68% identity). LPLs elicit a myriad of physiological effects. As a result, excessive levels of LPLs have been implicated in numerous pathologies, including atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and cancer (12-18), suggesting lysophospholipase activity is crucial for the prevention of these diseases. Endocannabinoids and their prostanoid metabolites, prostaglandin glyceryl esters (PGGs), are also derived from glycerolipids and play a role in a variety of signaling mechanisms, namely inflammatory responses, vasoregulation, muscle contraction, and nociception (19-22). We have identified LYPLA2 as the major PGG hydrolase in human cancer cells, whereas LYPLA1 completely lacks this activity. This suggests further divergences between these enzymes, as well as a role for LYPLA2 in endocannabinoid metabolism (2). Additionally, the lysophospholipases have recently been identified as acyl protein thioesterases (3, 23), able to hydrolyze conjugates of lipids to proteins. Lipids, namely palmitic acid, are known to conjugate to a plethora of proteins to regulate their function, binding interactions, and subcellular location (24-26). Despite the significance of protein palmitoylation in each of these processes, the only enzymes responsible for the dynamic regulation of this post-translational modification, LYPLA1 and LYPLA2, are poorly understood. Although the lysophospholipases have been implicated in the hydrolytic metabolism of each of these substrate classes, the full extent of the lipid and lipid-modified protein substrate pools as well as the molecular basis for substrate selectivity of these enzymes remains unclear. I hypothesize that that unique structural features of LYPLA2 dictate and modulate its distinct substrate selectivity in vitro and in intact cells. To address this hypothesis, I will use recombinant protein to investigate key structural motifs important for substrate binding. We have solved the crystal structure of LYPLA2, and are using its provided structural information as a basis for the identification of important substrate-binding determinants. Results from these experiments will be used to identify uncharacterized LPL and palmitoylated proteins substrates of the lysophospholipases. I will use three general approaches for these experiments: 1) Characterize the molecular determinants of substrate binding in the LYPLA2 active site; 2) Evaluate the role of lysophospholipases in modulating cellular levels of bioactive lipids using a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout cell line; and 3) Identify protein substrates of LYPLA1 and LYPLA2 depalmitoylation. This research proposal will assess the structural mechanism of LYPLA2 and substrate interactions, as well as identify biologically relevant lipid or lipid-modified substrates of this enzyme to elucidate its role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis."
"9323540","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to develop an integrated, interdisciplinary and translational Center for Childhood Obesity Prevention. Childhood obesity is a national public health threat that is disproportionately worse in Arkansas. Therefore, the immediate goal is to prevent the rise in Arkansas childhood obesity rates, with an ultimate goal of reducing childhood obesity rates by ?10% (reduction of ~3.8%) in our state over the next 5-10 years. Through the establishment of the Center, we will meet this critical need through a coordinated, community-based approach targeting modifiable individual risk behaviors, environmental risk factors, and local, state and national risk reduction policies. This strategy will include investigation of underlying metabolic factors. We will bring together a group  of four promising junior investigators whose collective research focuses on multiple aspects of this central theme, provide these investigators with a supportive infrastructure environment developed specifically to enhance their chances for success, and use the foundation provided by this initial group to develop four additional pipeline junior investigators, as well as to promoe ongoing recruitment of subsequent junior investigators with an interest in community-based approaches to childhood obesity prevention. Specific Aim #1 will establish the Center for Childhood Obesity Prevention, addressing childhood obesity through targeted behaviors, environments, and policies. In Specific Aim #2, we will coordinate and enhance existing research infrastructure and collaboration throughout the ACHRI and the UA System in support of the Center. Three cores will be established or enhanced to support the research of Center investigators: an Administrative and Scientific Support Core A, a Biostatistics and Informatics Core B, and a Metabolism Core C, each under the leadership of experienced senior faculty with strong research and administrative backgrounds. The mentoring program will consist of the Center Mentoring Committee (CMC) which includes two senior faculty members matched with each junior investigator and each pipeline investigator (11 total; some overlap); further, the UAMS Faculty Development Program (FDP) supports the general academic career development and advancement of junior faculty through the Promotion and Tenure process. These strategies, in coordination with the expertise of the established senior research faculty and an internal Executive Committee, will provide the synergy and oversight required for the development of ongoing successful external applications to sustain this work."
"9297404","Project Summary/Abstract:   Dominantly inherited mutations in LRRK2 and ?-synuclein are the most common genetic cause of  Parkinson's disease (PD), and ?-synuclein aggregates are a major component of Lewy bodies, which are a  key neuropathological hallmark of PD. Earlier studies found that the LRRK2 G2019S mutation enhanced its  kinase activity in vitro, suggesting that LRRK2 mutations may cause PD via a toxic gain of function mechanism.  Surprisingly, overproduction of mutant LRRK2 including G2019S even at very high levels (>10-fold) failed to  cause neurodegeneration in mice, whereas inactivation of LRRK2 results in PD-like changes, such as age-  dependent impairment of autophagy and protein degradation pathways, striking accumulation and aggregation  of ?-synuclein, and increases of apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative damage in the kidney where LRRK2 is  normally most abundant. Our recent generation and characterization of double knockout (DKO) mice lacking  LRRK2 and its functional homologue LRRK1 showed that they develop similar changes in the brain, including  age-dependent, selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and  noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, accompanied with autophagy impairment, ?-synuclein  accumulation, and increases of apoptosis and inflammation. These findings suggest an interesting genetic  interaction between LRRK2 and ?-synuclein, and highlight a critical role of LRRK in DA neuron survival and  autophagy-lysosomal pathways during aging. In this application, we propose two Specific Aims to investigate  the pathogenic mechanisms underlying LRRK2 mutations, and to explore the genetic interaction between  LRRK2 and ?-synuclein. In Aim 1, we propose to develop LRRK conditional DKO mice to determine the  consequences of loss of LRRK function in the SNpc or the striatum during aging, and will also generate  inducible human LRRK2 G2019S transgenic mice in the LRRK2-null background to determine whether in the  absence of endogenous LRRK2, overproduction of the human G2019S mutant results in DA  neurodegeneration. In Aim 2, we propose to use genetic approaches to explore the genetic interaction  between LRRK2 and ?-synuclein and determine whether loss of LRRK results in age-dependent  neurodegeneration via ?-synuclein accumulation. The completion of the proposed studies will provide new  insight into the pathogenic mechanism underlying LRRK2 mutations as well as the relationship between  LRRK2 and ?-synuclein."

Udall Parkinson's Disease Center of Excellence for Parkinson's Disease Research at Emory University is a collaborative research program in which electrophysiologists and anatomists study the pathophysiology of parkinsonism, and examine and optimize the effects of existing treatments for Parkinson's disease. The Center draws upon the proven ability of the basal ganglia research community at Emory to conduct translational research. Other Udall Center assets are its close ties to the clinical movement disorders group at Emory, and the availability of primates for research at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University. Emory is strongly committed to the Udall Center's research, and supports the Center by funding pilot grants, invited speakers, and portions of its education and outreach programs.  The Center consists of three tightly linked projects and two cores. The planned research will shed light on the poorly understood parkinsonism-related activity changes in thalamus and cortex which, in turn, will help us to better understand the pathophysiology of parkinsonism, and to optimize existing neuromodulation strategies and to develop new ones. Project 1 (led by Dr. Jaeger) will utilize brain slice and in vivo recordings in rodents, as well as a neural computational approach to develop mechanistic models of thalamocortical dysfunction in parkinsonism. Project 2 (Dr. Wichmann), will continue the exploration of thalamic and cortical abnormalities in parkinsonian monkeys, using selective activation and inactivation approaches which are designed to study corticothalamic, pallidothalamic and thalamocortical information transfer. Project 3 (Dr. Smith) will examine morphological changes in the thalamic and cortical microcircuitry in parkinsonian primates, a topic that is virtually unexplored at this time and of high relevance to the interpretation of data in the other projects. All projects will be supported by an Administrative Core (Dr. Wichmann, PI; Dr. DeLong, Co-I, Dr. Smith, Co-I, Ms Holbrook, administrator), and by an Anatomy and Behavior Core (Dr. Galvan) which will provide immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy services to all of the center projects, and standardized MPTP treatment and quantification of parkinsonism to the primate experiments in Projects 2 and 3.  In addition to pursuing its research mission (Aim 1), the Center will help junior scientists to develop their career in Parkinson's disease research (Aim 2), and will engage in extensive outreach efforts, aimed at communicating the Center's (and Udall Center network) research findings to the public (Aim 3), reaching all age groups and background levels, ranging from K-12 children to retirees in assisted living facilities. As part of the outreach agenda, the center plans to organize annual symposia for patients and their caregivers. The center will be generously supported by the University. These internal support funds will help the Center to fund some of its education and outreach missions, as well as its pilot grant program, designed to expand Parkinson's disease research at Emory University."
"9209899","PROJECT SUMMARY The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus that can cause fatal disease in patients with underlying comorbidities. Further recognition of this respiratory syndrome and prevention strategies will require a small animal infection model as well as an additional understanding of the virus. This PPG describes a mouse model of MERS-CoV disease. In this model, the viruses causing disease are adapted variants, specialized for mouse lung infection. By contrast, non- adapted MERS-CoVs cause infection in the mouse but do not cause disease. The central hypothesis of this subproject (PPG2) is that mouse-adapted variants can efficiently enter host cells through pathways that are not available to the non-adapted viruses. To address this hypothesis, recombinant MERS-CoVs will be constructed and evaluated to determine whether mouse-adaptive mutations in the cell entry-mediating viral spike proteins correlate with efficient mouse lung infection. Surrogate MERS-CoV pseudo-viruses will be constructed and evaluated to address the focused hypothesis that mouse adapted variants mediate an ?early? plasma-membrane cell entry that is unavailable to non-adapted viruses. The project will dissect mechanisms by which spike proteins mediate early cell entry through plasma membranes versus late cell entry through endosomes. The basis for selection of early versus late cell entry will be determined by identifying host cell factors promoting or restricting either pathway. This project will also identify appropriate antiviral strategies that operate by preventing early and late virus-cell entry. The rationale for all of these aims is that additional understanding of MERS-CoV cell entry pathways will identify correlates of robust infection and disease, and will also provide insights on the best ways to prevent infection and disease with innovative virus entry inhibitors."

"9324223","MODEL SYSTEMS CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Model Systems Core (MSC) is to develop, provide, and study PKD-relevant models as well as test therapeutic interventions in order to facilitate the translation of basic research findings of Mayo and non-Mayo investigators into clinical practice. This is achieved using three models, nematode, zebrafish and rodent, which work separately and in an integrated way to advance basic and translational PKD research. By spanning from simple to complex organisms, the MSC incorporates expertise in gene and protein function discovery through forward genetic or non-targeted chemical screens (nematodes), PKD pathway discovery and therapeutic testing in small, easily maintained vertebrates (zebrafish), and anatomical, physiological and pharmacological evaluation of mammalian pathomechanisms (rodents). The core is directed by Dr. Stephen C. Ekker who is a leading expert in genome editing, a key component of new model development. Further, MSC Associate Directors provide expertise in each individual model system. Dr. Jinghua Hu (nematode), Dr. Caroline R. Sussman (zebrafish), and Dr. Jan van Deursen (rodent), assure organism-specific advances in accordance with developing technologies in each field. During its four years, the MSC has fine-tuned its services based on PKD researchers' needs in order to provide maximum functionality. The current service aims are: (I) Generate, maintain and distribute PKD models, (II) Characterize PKD models, and (III) Chemical and therapeutic testing in PKD models. Within each model system, service lines are available spanning these three aims, and PKD researchers can make use of >150 nematode, >10 zebrafish, or >20 rodent knock-out/knock-in/transgenic ADPKD/ARPKD/ciliopathy lines, the majority of which have been developed and characterized in the MSC. In the last funding period these lines were used by 52 investigators to support 106 projects at 22 sites. Projects under development in nematode and zebrafish will allow higher throughput screening of pathways and therapeutics, which can then be tested in rodent preclinical trials, with which we have tremendous experience (>25 trials within the last funding period). The expertise and resources of the MSC are enhanced by expertise and facilities for rodent imaging (Dr. Slobodan I. Macura [Co-Investigator] and Dr. Maria V. Irazabal [Consultant]) and development/characterization of new rodent models as well as execution of preclinical trials (Dr. Katharina Hopp [Consultant])."
"9356338","Project Summary ? Project 3 Models of the activity changes in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry in Parkinson's disease have been instrumental for the development of new surgical and pharmacologic antiparkinsonian therapies. However, it has become clear that these models do not fully explain the complex alterations in the patterns of neuronal activity and abnormal network oscillations in the parkinsonian brain. Especially, our knowledge of the anatomical, functional, and pathological changes in the thalamocortical and corticothalamic systems in Parkinson's disease is very limited. In conjunction with the functional studies of projects 1 and 2, and the technical support of Core B, the proposed studies will help us to gain a detailed understanding of the organization and pathology of the synaptic networks through which basal ganglia, thalamic and cortical neurons interact. Our preliminary studies provide strong evidence that the synaptic microcircuits that mediate the communication between the basal ganglia receiving portion of the thalamus and motor cortices display significant pathology in the non-human primate model of Parkinson's disease. At the cortical level, a loss of dendritic spines on projection neurons and a prominent decrease in the thalamic innervation of deep cortical layers was found in M1 of MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys. Both findings are strong indicators of pathologic disturbances of thalamocortical communication in parkinsonism. Interestingly, it appears that these changes are particularly prominent in M1, suggesting that the network dysfunction is regionally specific. Combined with recent electrophysiological data showing that the activity of corticospinal, but not corticostriatal, neurons is disrupted in M1 of parkinsonian monkeys, we hypothesize that pathological changes in thalamocortical synaptic connections may differentially affect corticospinal over corticostriatal neurons. Our preliminary data also suggest that the relationships between the thalamus and motor cortices may be impaired by synaptic changes at the thalamic level in parkinsonian monkeys, such that the synaptic connectivity of cortical afferents with GABAergic interneurons and projection neurons is altered. In light of these preliminary findings, we propose a series of morphological, neuropathological, and ultrastructural studies to further assess and quantify the changes in the architecture of the thalamocortical and corticothalamic synaptic networks in normal and MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys, as well as in normal and 6-OHDA-treated mice (for comparisons with the studies in primates). The results of these studies will be of critical importance for our understanding of the pathophysiology of parkinsonism, and will aid the interpretation of the functional data obtained in the other projects."
"9344389","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):    Nephrolithiasis (NL) is common, and symptomatic stone episodes cause significant pain, suffering, and economic cost. Much effort has been expended to define metabolic abnormalities that increase urinary supersaturation (SS), and thereby favor stone growth. However, currently available treatments that reduce urinary SS are not completely effective. Therefore, new understanding of additional pathogenic factors is needed to suggest new preventative strategies. Recent studies highlight the importance of NL precursor lesions, including Randall's plaques and plugs within distal tubular lumens. Qur preliminary data suggest that a  subset of so-called idiopathic CaOx stones may also begin from tubular plugs. Clinical kidney stone research has lagged because stone passage is the final result of many earlier events, and this series of events likely differs between apparently similar patients. Contributors to urinary SS (e.g. calcium excretion) are clearly important, but other factors such as cellular responses to SS and crystals or protein crystallization inhibitors also contribute to stone formation. We hypothesize that clinical studies to investigate stone pathogenesis have likely been confounded by the (unknown) variety of underlying renal pathologies. Therefore, we plan to carefully phenotype renal stone precursor lesions by direct endoscopic visualization. These carefully pheontyped patients will be used to develop imaging algorithms to noninvasively characterize stone composition and precursor lesions, to define the gene expression of papillary tissue of patients with and without plaque, and determine the urine and stone microbiome of diverse patient types.      Specific Aims are:  Aim 1 Accurately map kidney stone location and precursor lesions after percutaneous nephrolithotomy in defined groups of patients with idiopathic CaQx stones (n=220), enteric hyperoxaluria (n=15), primary hyperoxaluria (n=5); uric acid stones (n=20); CaP stones (n=30), cystine stones (n=5), and controls without stones (n=30)  Aim 2: Define dual energy CT algorithms to predict stone fragility  Aim 3: Determine the gene expression profile of papillary tip biopsies with maximal and minimal plaque and plugs.  Aim 4: Characterize the microbiome of urine and kidney stones of patients with diverse types of stones.  These aims build upon the preliminary data assembled by our multidisciplinary group over the last 4 years."
"9545100","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain - particularly chronic pain - is a major cause of morbidity, especially in patients with cancer or neuropathic pain. The goal of this research is to develop prolonged duration local anesthetics (PDLA) that would provide local anesthesia lasting days to weeks from a single injection, depending on the clinical context (perioperative vs. chronic pain). Our strategy has been to use a variety of sustained release vehicles to deliver site 1 sodium channel blockers (S1SCBs) such as saxitoxin (STX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) in combination with compounds that are known to have synergistic or adjunctive effects on the duration of nerve blockade, such as conventional local anesthetics and steroids. To date, this line of inquiry has been very productive; since the current R01 began 3.5 years ago, we have produced 29 publications, and met or exceeded the goals of our Specific Aims. Our base formulation is a liposome containing S1SCBs and other drugs, where we have shown we can obtain sciatic nerve blocks in the rat lasting a week with minimal systemic and local toxicity. We propose a spectrum of potential modifications to produce yet longer blocks while maintaining safety. An equally important aim will be the in vivo assessment of the efficacy and systemic toxicity of these new formulations by neurobehavioral tests in rats and rabbits, by following serum drug levels. Another crucial aspect of the research, which has not received sufficient attention, will be to study the development of inflammation, myotoxicity, and neurotoxicity with these formulations, using histological and toxicogenomic approaches."

Our Program primarily provides comprehensive management of patients from all five groups of the PH World Classification, and also has a long history of participation in industry-sponsored as well as NIH-sponsored multicenter clinical trials for PH treatment. Since right ventricular (RV) function is the main determinant of death in PH, we propose thorough phenotyping of PH patients with a primary focus on the complex relationship between the RV and the pulmonary vasculature (PV) and RV-PV uncoupling, with the goal to further examine their crucial impact on morbidity and mortality in PH. Leveraging our extensive clinical knowledge in PH and our expertise in molecular and diagnostic pulmonary medicine and cardiology, we propose to use 1) echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) to identify non-invasive measures of RV performance and their capacity to predict outcomes; 2) invasive hemodynamic assessment of RV/PV interaction for its impact on deep phenotyping and survival; and 3) molecular (genomics, genetics, and serum biomarkers) for endophenotyping. The search for clinical, hemodynamic, imaging, serum and genetic biomarkers proposed in this application can be readily applied to all clinical centers in the context of the PVDOMICs as relevant variables for disease risk assessment, dynamic phenotyping (baseline and in response to treatment), endophenotyping, and as intermediate or primary outcomes in clinical trials. In summary, while the choice of parameters, studies and target populations will be left to the discretion of the DCC, our PH clinical center will offer the unique expertise of a multidisciplinary and highly integrated team of experts in this new endeavor to redefine PH phenotypes from all five groups of PH, thus ensuring success of the PVDOMICs efforts."
"9318614","Project Summary/Abstract The standard treatment for Parkinson's disease patients is the use of levodopa (L-DOPA), which restores dopaminergic tone to the striatum and provides subsequent symptomatic relief. However, the higher doses required with PD progression result in levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) which dramatically reduce the quality of life for afflicted individuals. Despite its public health importance, the etiology of LID remains unknown, thus, no uniformly effective therapies exist. To study the molecular etiology of LID we utilized a genome array comparing mRNAs in the striata of LID+ rats to those that remained refractory to LID development. One validated protein that was induced in LID+ animals but absent in LID- animals was the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1. We therefore hypothesized that Nurr1 is a molecular trigger of LID. To test this, we delivered adeno- associated viruses (AAV) expressing, or silencing, Nurr1 to the striatum of parkinsonian rats. Following L- DOPA treatment, Nurr1 overexpressing rats had significantly higher LID scores whereas Nurr1 silencing significantly attenuated LID scores. Moreover, we found that Nurr1 overexpression in the parkinsonian, L- DOPA naïve, striatum potentiates corticostriatal neurotransmission, identical to that seen in a LID+ parkinsonian rat. Finally, we have shown that LID is associated with changes in medium spiny neuron (MSN) dendrite distribution and morphology. Based on these findings we developed the central hypothesis of this proposal: Striatal Nurr1 activity is the key central component in developing LID by promoting structural and functional changes in the striatum. We further propose that Nurr1 facilitates the formation of this ?dyskinetic state? via its well defined role in plasticity and dendrite reorganization. To test this hypothesis we propose 2 distinct Aims where we will measure the same outcomes within the striatum: MSN morphology, function, and LID behavior. (1) Following dopamine denervation and L-DOPA administration roughly 30% of Sprague- Dawley rats do not develop LID. These LID- subjects also do not express striatal Nurr1. To test our central hypothesis we will thus utilize AAV to express Nurr1 in LID- subjects and observe the effect on striatal neurons and LID behavior. (2) Finally, as we posit that induction of striatal Nurr1 activity is a core event in the development of LID we ask the critical question: Does reversing Nurr1 induction normalize striatal function, reverse structural adaptions, and thus reverse LID? Together, the aims in this proposal will provide for an extensive understanding of the molecular events that underlies the formation of the dyskinetic striatum, including the novel role for striatal Nurr1 in an array of established molecular events linked to LID. The successful identification of Nurr1 as a central factor in LID formation will open a completely unexplored area for dyskinesia treatment development whereby Nurr1 itself, or downstream Nurr1 targets, can be exploited for therapeutic development."
"9529998","The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is one of the most important causes of severe diarrheal disease, and the disease manifests itself with varied epidemiology around the world. In the U.S. outbreaks are linked to tainted recreational and drinking water and have occurred at massive scale. Patients suffering from immunosuppression due to HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, or cancer are in gravest danger. The global public health impact is even larger: after Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium is the most important diarrheal pathogen in small children. In infants, in particular in the context of malnutrition, cryptosporidiosis has a highly significant imprint on overall early childhood mortality and morbidity. Cryptosporidiosis is also linked to stunting, thus leaving a lasting shadow on the future of children. There are no vaccines and only a single drug of marginal efficacy. This parasite has a single host life cycle, both asexual and sexual processes occur sequentially in the intestinal epithelium of the same host. Completion of this developmental program is required for continued infection, severe disease, and spread of the pathogen. Despite the obvious importance of the lifecycle for drug and vaccine development, our current understanding is rudimentary. This is a biological phenomenon of fascinating complexity ? there is much to discover here ? and we expect insights of fundamental as well as translational significance. We have recently pioneered a genetic system for Cryptosporidum that we will use in this project to dissect the lifecycle at the molecular and cellular level. Under this proposal we will develop rigorous molecular markers and assays for development through asexual and sexual stages, reveal stage specific gene expression, and discover the mechanisms that execute function and progression through the lifecycle. Lack of efficient systems to culture Cryptosporidium has long hampered progress. We will define where specifically in vitro development derails, and these insights will guide future work to facilitate a continuous culture model."
"9357688","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Novel, validated methods to monitor adherence to HIV treatment in real time are urgently needed given the well-known limitations of self-reported adherence, pill counts, and medication electronic monitoring system (MEMS) caps. In order to be scalable and sustainable in both resource-rich and resource limited settings, such devices need to be low-cost and designed in a way that does not increase the risk of accidental HIV disclosure and subsequent stigma. Devices which both monitor adherence in real time and provide tailored reminders to patients for medication-taking have the potential to greatly improve adherence to HIV treatment as well as to treatment for other chronic diseases. Our Indo-US collaborative team has been conducting research on HIV stigma, ARV adherence patterns and barriers, treatment outcome, and drug resistance for over a decade. We have also pioneered the use of ARV concentrations in small hair samples to measure long-term ARV adherence in resource-rich and limited settings (RLS). In response to the need for novel adherence meaures, our team has recently developed Tel-Me-Box, a small, low-cost adherence device that monitors adherence in real time, by transmitting a wireless signal to a server when opened. We now propose to add hardware that will enable the server software to wirelessly program the device to activate tailored medication-taking reminders (via a beep, vibration, or LED light) after a period of inactivity. The device fits in a pocket, can hold 1-2 weeks' worth of medications, has a long battery life, simple charging capability, and has been found acceptable to Indian patients with adherence challenges in pilot studies. Since HIV stigma serves as a profound barrier to ARV adherence in many settings, including India, the small, inconspicuous nature of Tel-Me-Box, along with its ability to deliver tailored reminder features honors participants' privacy concerns. Since this electronic device monitoring cannot assess actual drug ingestion, validating it against a biological measure of adherence, such as ARV hair concentrations, is crucial. This study has the following 3 aims: Aim 1 will further refine Tel-Me-Box by reducing its size and adding tailored reminder features. We will also demonstrate feasibility of hair analysis in RLS by training local staff to conduct the relevant hair assays. Aim 2 will validate the Tel-Me-Box adherence measure, using ARV hair concentrations and HIV viral load, and examine the predictive utility of Tel-Me-Box monitoring and hair drug levels on virologic suppression in HIV- infected patients. In Aim 3, we will conduct a pilot RCT to examine acceptability and feasibility and to estimate the effect size of automated tailored real-time adherence reminders on hair ARV concentrations, device- monitored adherence, and viral load suppression in adherence-challenged patients. At study completion, we expect to have validated Tel-Me-Box as an innovative tool to assess adherence and predict treatment outcomes and demonstrated the feasibility of hair analyses in RLS. If successful, we will also have collected pilot data on the efficacy of the Tel-Me-Box automated, tailored reminders for a future large scale RCT."
"9336901","Gram-negative sepsis remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in hospitalized patients, especially when complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). The pathophysiology of AKI in sepsis continues to be poorly understood resulting in the persistent failure of clinical therapeutic trials. Recently, we identified a novel pathway of renal injury in sepsis involving direct interactions between filtered endotoxin and S1 proximal tubules. This endotoxin-S1 interaction resulted in severe peroxisomal damage and oxidative stress in downstream S2 and S3 segments. Remarkably, this pathway of injury had no requirement for competent immune cells. In this proposal, we continue our investigation of sepsis and AKI by examining the mechanisms of renal endotoxin preconditioning. The phenomenon of protective preconditioning is unique in that it represents a state of resistance to the deleterious effects of endotoxin and yet, a preserved ability to effectively contain and eliminate infections. Unraveling the pathways involved in endotoxin tolerance has great potential for identifying potential targets that can be used for the prevention and treatment of human sepsis. Historically, preconditioning has been investigated in immune cells and their isolated responses to repeated endotoxin exposure. Little is known about the mechanisms leading to tissue protection in whole organs such as the kidney. Based on strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that macrophages are essential components of the protective pathways of preconditioning. This is a novel hypothesis because it depicts the macrophage as an active and beneficial participant in the tolerant phenotype. In specific aim 1, we will establish the essential role of macrophages and examine their cross-talk with renal tubules such as the S1 segment. In specific aim 2, we will determine the metabolic and transcriptomic changes imparted by protective macrophages on S1 tubules. We will also identify key metabolites that can be used directlt to treat sepsis. In specific aim 3, we will examine the potential of protective macrophages to treat sepsis in a cell transfer approach. We believe that the proposed studies, by increasing our understanding of endotoxin preconditioning, have great translational potential and will uncover a novel and global approach to the prevention and treatment of sepsis and sepsis-induced AKI."
"9477873","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana are the most commonly used substances among women of childbearing age, and use of these substances during pregnancy results in significant morbidities for both women and infants. The damaging fetal consequences of alcohol and tobacco are well-known, and newer research documents the harmful effects (e.g., increased infant mortality) of prenatal marijuana use. This is particularly alarming as marijuana use is on the rise. As many women use these substances unaware of their pregnancy, intervention during the preconception period is critical for preventing substance-exposed pregnancies (SEP). SEPs are heavily concentrated in women with lower financial resources, and services to address these issues with women of childbearing age are lacking. Primary care settings afford an opportunity to engage this hard-to-reach population and address interrelated problems, including substance abuse, ineffective contraception and HIV-risk behaviors. Face-to-face interventions involving sensitive information (e.g., substance use and sexual behaviors) may limit disclosure and draw resources from busy practices. Even more importantly, recent research indicates that disclosure of substance use, particularly marijuana, is improved with computer-based vs. face-to-face interventions. Thus, innovative and cost-effective methods that can be easily integrated to real-world medical settings are needed. Self-guided, computer-based interventions could improve disclosure and be more effective and efficient. Our previous work on brief motivational interventions to prevent alcohol- and tobacco-exposed pregnancies has yielded favorable results, yet marijuana use at follow-up was consistently associated with significantly poorer intervention outcomes. Therefore, preconception marijuana use needs to be addressed for maximal SEP reduction. This timely and practical randomized controlled study of 360 women of childbearing age within a primary care setting will compare the efficacy of the Choices4Health intervention delivered by a computerized tablet, the Choices4Health intervention delivered by a counselor and Brief Advice; all with the goal of reducing SEP (drinking below risk levels, tobacco cessation, marijuana cessation, and/or effective contraception use). Secondary outcomes include HIV-risk reduction and cost effectiveness. We believe this work is aligned with the need to offer effective and efficient substance use screening and treatment in front- line medical settings and will have significant impact on current standards of preconception care."
"9393263","Project Summary:     Epilepsy  still  remains  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  morbidity  in  sub  Saharan  Africa.  Associated  epilepsy  morbidity can be reduced with improved quality of life. Coupled with social exclusion and perceived stigma, this  morbidity  further  exacerbates  the  psychosocial  suffering  and  isolation  among  people  living  with  epilepsy.  Stigma, is largely caused by the lack of public awareness of the nature of the disease, is the greatest problem  faced by many people with epilepsy. People with epilepsy may be banned from school, adults may be barred  from marriage, and employment is often denied. In a previous study, more than half felt stigmatized, and 18%  felt highly stigmatized because of their epilepsy. Few studies have examined this subject in sub-­Saharan Africa  and  none  has  designed  interventions  to  address  this.  We  therefore  propose  to  expand  the  knowledge  of  epilepsy, quality of life and psychosocial burdens in our settings.    We will leverage support from the already established Makerere College of Health Sciences. This program will  be  integrated  within  the  existing  framework  of  research  at  Makerere  University  College  of  Health  Sciences  (MakCHS)  to  ensure  its  successful  completion.  Senior  faculty  at  Makerere  University  will  provide  mentorship  and  expertise  for  the  PI  as  well  as  receive  co-­mentorship  from  experienced  colleagues  at  Case  Western  University  to  ensure  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  program.  This  proposal  is  in  line  with  the  government  of  Uganda  Health  Sector  Strategic  Plan  that  highlights  building  capacity  and  provision  of  adequate  care  for  all  Ugandans.  By  the  end  of  this  program,  a  critical  preliminary  data,  tools  and  techniques  for  epilepsy  research  will have been developed.   Relevance:   Improved  in-­country  expertise  and  better  knowledge  of  epilepsy  research  especially  in  issues  related  to  well  being  and  improved  quality  of  life  are  be  critical  in  understanding  and  forming  strategic  guidelines  and  self  management approaches for improving patient care and seizure control."
"9391718","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite substantial global decline in childhood mortality rates, equivalent progress in neonatal mortality reduction has not been achieved. Severe bacterial infection affects 6.9 million neonates and causes an estimated 750 000 deaths in low-middle income countries (LMIC) annually, substantially exceeding other infectious disease-related deaths. New approaches to sepsis prevention for hospitalized and preterm newborns in LMIC are urgently needed as antimicrobial resistance threatens the few remaining therapeutic options. The paucity of data on neonatal sepsis epidemiology is an additional obstacle to development of infection prevention interventions for low-resource settings. Care bundles are evidence-based strategies targeting healthcare-associated infections; bundles are widely- adopted and effective in high-income countries, especially in adult intensive care populations. A care bundled approach for neonatal sepsis prevention in LMIC has great potential; it is likely to be cost-effective, culturally-acceptable, empowering for mothers and potentially applicable in both hospital and community- based settings. Possible bundle elements could include emollient application, chlorhexidine gluconate body washing, promotion of a clean newborn environment, safe intravenous access and improved hand hygiene among neonatal caregivers. Our research programme entails an initial surveillance phase to better characterize the epidemiology of bacterial sepsis in hospitalized South African neonates. A series of observational studies will establish the dynamics and determinants of neonatal bacterial colonization and infection. The acceptability, feasibility and compliance indicators for at least five potential elements of a ?neonatal sepsis prevention care bundle' will be determined. A final phase will measure the feasibility and acceptability of the bundle in two observational hospital cohorts of 50 infants each. The overall impact of this research will include an advanced understanding of the epidemiology of hospital-onset sepsis in South African neonates and development of a ?neonatal sepsis prevention care bundle? for low-resource settings."
"9360608","?PROJECT SUMMARY: In vitro differentiation of cultured pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) provides a promising tool for the generation of specific cell types useful for cell replacement therapies. Despite rapid progress over the last decade, numerous challenges encompassing cell-production quantity, quality and safety remain to be addressed before full-fledged clinical application becomes a reality. Moreover, generation of functional organs from cultured PSCs, a much needed breakthrough to meet the rising demands for organ donors, remains improbable. This is largely due to our limited understanding of molecular and genetic processes underlying in vivo tissue/organ generation, which has been perfected through millions of years? evolution. Nature has evolved a sophisticated and robust system to generate functional tissues and organs during normal course of embryo development. The intrinsic genetic program works seamlessly with extrinsic developmental niches in a perfect spatiotemporal manner to enable embryonic cells to commit to specific cell lineages and be organized into higher-order tissue architectures. Blastocyst complementation is based on emptying these developmental niches created by knocking out gene(s) critical for the specific tissue/organ development and use donor chimeric-competent PSCs to colonize the vacant niche and generate desired tissues/organs of donor origin. With the booming of CRISPR/CAS9-mediated genome engineering gene knockout animals can be generated with high efficiency by co-injection of Cas9 mRNA and gRNAs directly into zygotes. Also, chimeric-competent primate PSCs have seen several promising developments very recently. By combining the strength of zygote genome editing and chimeric-competent primate PSCs, we propose to establish a novel interspecific blastocyst complementation system for the generation of functional organs in a large animal host, the pig. For this first study, we will focus on using PSCs derived from non-human primate species, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of our proposed strategy. Our study will provide critical information for future application into humans. If successful, this approach will lead to a paradigm shift in regenerative medicine and will help to overcome the shortage of organ donors."
"9337252","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The central objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the benefits of optical spectroscopy for the screening, management, and prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) as compared to current standard practices. Two complementary applications will be tested using the same platform: Using elastic-scattering spectroscopy (ESS) to distinguish reliably between neoplastic and non-neoplastic polyps, and using ESS, low- coherence enhanced backscattering spectroscopy (LEBS), and partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) for sensing the field effect of carcinogenesis (FEC). The specific objectives are: 1. To conduct a prospective clinical study using ESS for real-time histological assessment of polyps. We will prospectively test and validate algorithms that we have designed for ESS classification of polyps, using the ASGE-PIVI guidelines as performance benchmarks. 2. Clinical studies of field effect, and combined applications study. We will concurrently collect algorithm-training and validation data for sensing of FEC with ESS, during routine colonoscopy procedures. With the same patients and at the same procedure, we will look at ESS as a CRC risk assessment tool and its relationship, if any, with improvements in efficiency and success rate of finding neoplastic polyps for polypectomy. In addition, we will use optical measurements obtained with LEBS and rectal brushings analyzed with PWS to cross-validate FEC sensing results obtained with ESS. 3. Instrumentation: Implement system enhancements and tool design for clinical friendliness. We will establish standardization and calibration procedures to make instruments robust to variations in clinical environment, and develop next-generation clinical hardware and software interfaces. This will ensure that comparable results are obtained among different operators and sites. Integration of ESS and LEBS into a single hybrid system box will be enabled as required. Endoscope-mediated tools for guiding polypectomy and FEC-sensing will be designed to be low-cost and disposable. Methodology: Candidate subjects for this study will be drawn from an extant pool of patients who are scheduled for routine or surveillance colonoscopy by their physician or as the result of a prior clinical evaluation or a pre-existing condition. Upon obtaining a signed Informed Consent, all patients will receive standard treatment. The main deviation from the normal examination and biopsy procedure will be to take an optical measurement prior to each biopsy and of surrounding colonic mucosa, and a rectal sample for brush cytology during the colonoscopy. When biopsy is required, prior to the standard physical biopsy, an optical biopsy will be taken of the exact same tissue with the ESS optical forceps. The biopsy will be sent for histopathology, as per standard of care, and reviewed by three independent pathologists blinded to the spectroscopic results. Measurements of normal colonic mucosa will also be taken along several segments of the colon with ESS. Additionally, optical measurements of rectal mucosa will be obtained with LEBS, as well as rectal brushings that will be analyzed with PWS. ESS spectra from polyps will be correlated to the majority diagnosis from the pathologists. ESS, LEBS, and PWS measurements from normal colonic tissue will be assigned as to belonging to a neoplastic or non-neoplastic field based on findings during the procedure. Diagnostic algorithms will be trained and tested using these correlated optical data. Data for identification of FEC biomarkers will be collected from several sources to rule out possible confounders."
"9530921","We request renewed funding to continue and expand on the documented success achieved by UAB's Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) in its first three funding cycles. Inaugurated with NIH funding in 2000, our NORC fosters multidisciplinary, collaborative, basic, clinical, and translational nutrition and obesity research. Since it was first funded, the NORC's research base has grown substantially. At its inception in 2000, we had 60 members. By the time of our last renewal in 2011 this number had increased to 134 members; the number today stands at 178 members. In 2000, our members held as PIs 15 R01s or K-awards clearly related to nutrition or obesity. As of this writing in 2016, our members hold as PIs 48 R01s, R00s and K-awards that are clearly related to nutrition or obesity. In the past funding cycle, UAB's NORC has directly helped to recruit over 15 new and established obesity and nutrition investigators. Our publication output has steadily increased in absolute numbers and as a proportion of the world's literature on obesity and nutrition. The impact of NORC publications as judged by NIH?s relative citation ratio consistently exceeds the norm for peer-reviewed literature on obesity and nutrition in general and even for NIH-funded research in particular by a factor of over 50%. Our NORC leadership oversees two NIH-funded T32 training grants for obesity research, has two more training grants in review, and aims to submit a third in the coming funding cycle. Newly initiated in the past funding cycle, our NORC has led a series of national NIH-funded nutrition and obesity-related annual short courses supported by three new R25 grants. Our NORC funds at least four Pilot & Feasibility studies per year, sponsors a Named New Investigator, and implements an extensive Enrichment Program. UAB provides our NORC over $750,000 annually to enhance the NIDDK P30 grant. The NORC?s Metabolism, Animal Models, Physical Activity, and Biostatistics Cores have flourished, resulting in cost-effective research and enhanced access to cutting-edge technology that is heavily utilized by our members. Our primary theme is Obesity: Causes, Consequences, and Alleviation. During the coming cycle, important subdomains within this broad theme will be emphasized. These subdomains include (1) obesity and health disparities among minorities; (2) obesity, diet, weight loss, and exercise among persons with disabilities; (3) obesity, energetics, and aging; (4) transgenerational, developmental, and pediatric aspects; and (5) mathematical/quantitative science approaches. Backed by exceptional institutional support and academic infrastructure, we request renewed funding to continue our contributions to this important area of research."
"9325522","Project Summary/Abstract In this application for an NIDDK Cooperative Hematology Specialized Core Center (CHSCC) at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), we seek to support the field of benign hematology research by providing crucial resources to investigators, by bringing together interactive members who will move the field forward and recruit new investigators to the area, by enriching the environment for trainees at all levels (undergraduate, graduate, medical school) and by offering Pilot & Feasibility grants for highly promising innovative projects of junior investigators. The organization and activities of the CHSCC build on an existing NIDDK-funded Center of Excellence in Molecular Hematology that has served the Harvard Medical School community and investigators elsewhere for 15 years. As the existing Center is the sole facility of its kind in the Harvard Medical Area, it represents a focal point for research in benign hematology and a site for training the next generation of investigators. The CHSCC has members at the affiliated institutions of the Harvard Medical School, and is enriched by interactions with T32 hematology training programs at BCH and Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) and a Harvard T32 training program in transfusion medicine, and with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI). The CHSCC is comprised of three cores, two of which center on the major animal models for hematology research, the mouse (Core A) and zebrafish (Core B). Focus on these two systems leverages the advantages of each, while providing the benefits of synergy from parallel developmental and genetic studies. These cores provide state-of-the-art services for the generation of engineered mice/zebrafish, maintain critical strains that are used in the day-to-day work of the Cores and that are distributed to investigators elsewhere, and export methods by teaching Center members. In addition, these Cores actively develop or incorporate new approaches, including the recently developed CRISPR/cas9 technology for genome editing. In addition, these Cores are active in generating models of human hematologic disorders and encouraging efforts to translate knowledge from these animal models to human. A new third core, CORE C, provides human iPS cell reprogramming, CRISPR/Cas9 for human disease modeling, and consultation on approaches to CRISPR/Cas9 editing of mouse and zebrafish, as well as fee-for-service flow cytometry core that allows for characterization and isolation of hematopoietic cell populations. In aggregate, the three Cores provide investigators with state- of-the-art approaches to hematology and disease, and support innovative and disease-relevant research that will lead to new therapeutic strategies. In addition to these cores, the CHSCC has an Administrative Core that manages communications with the cores, advertises the capabilities of the CHSCC to investigators, and oversees the Enrichment and Pilot & Feasibility Programs. The Enrichment Program includes many educational opportunities for Center members and trainees in the laboratories of members and an active college undergraduate summer program. The Pilot & Feasibility Program has previously supported innovative, promising projects of junior investigators with the hope that these funds will permit obtaining preliminary data for an NIH R01 application or a similar award. As a CHSCC, the impact of the existing NIDDK-funded Center of Excellence can be expanded to promote and support benign hematology research beyond the members of the Center per se. We believe that the CHSCC at BCH will constitute a national resource for hematology research.  "
"9314605","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We now have a nearly complete list of all the proteins constituting a cell. However, how these molecules come together in space and time to give rise to complex structures and compartments with defined morphology and size is still poorly understood. To address this for any system, we first have to qualitatively understand which components are involved in the system. However, we also need a quantitative framework to describe the rate and extent of assembly for all factors involved in the system to link changes in nanometer scale molecular composition with micron scale changes in architecture (eg. size and shape). Here I focus on the mitotic spindle, which plays an essential role in cell division. The first step toward understanding the spindle as a dynamic, self-organized compartment is to identify all the components that compose the spindle and quantify the extent to which each component is enriched in the spindle compared to cytoplasm. Spindles will be isolated with two complementary approaches and then subjected to state of the art mass spectrometry based proteomics to quantify ~10,000 proteins with 3% coefficients of variation and signal to noise ratios of approximately 30-fold. One intriguing possibility that I already have evidence for is tha many more proteins in the cytoplasm associate with the spindle to some degree than previously thought. Additionally, I will determine the exchange rates for all proteins that associate with spindles. Exchange constants can be paired with extensive previous knowledge of many spindle components to reveal novel mechanism, and also test for non- tubulin components of the spindle such as the proposed spindle matrix. To date, these constants are only known for tubulin and a handful for MAPs and motors. Any proteins that have half-time exchanges that are significantly slower than microtubule dynamics are of extreme interest, as these may yield novel insights into spindle composition. I will then investigate how a spindle changes size. Spindle size decreases drastically in frog eggs as a fertilized embryo undergoes cleavages and cell size decreases by two orders of magnitude. These in vivo changes were recently recapitulated in vitro and shown to be solely due to the amount of cytoplasm present, indicating that the phenomena is due to limiting factors. I will isolate proteins associated to spindles at varying spindle densities to investigate which factors are depleted from spindles and thus potentially responsible for this scaling process. Individual contributions and cooperative contributions from candidates will be investigated with a variety of approaches."
"9534324","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anemia as associated with end-stage renal disease, chemo- and radiation therapies, inflammation, myelodysplasia, iron dysregulation and hemoglobinopathies leads to chronic bouts of accelerated, yet stressed and often compromised erythropoiesis. A specific understanding of key regulators of such stress erythropoiesis is of basic importance for insight into new anemia therapies. rhEPO per se can be therapeutic, but has substantial hypertensive side-effects, evokes thrombolytic events, is a high-cost recombinant glycoprotein, and may worsen certain cancers. Via investigations of EPO's effects on primary erythroid progenitors, we have uncovered and initially characterized two important new factors (and associated pathways) that selectively regulate stress erythropoiesis. First, our studies of a novel EPO-induced intracellular Spi2A serpin (via a new KO model) reveal that under select stress conditions, erythroblasts become highly sensitive to lysosome damage to the extent of leaching lysosomal executioner cathepsins- which are inhibited by Spi2A. If unchecked, cathepsin-associated damage and erythroblast death escalate, with ROS and iron as cytotoxic co-factors. We also demonstrate that a Cathepsin B/L inhibitor can phenocopy Spi2A's cytoprotective effects. A second EPO co-induced erythropoietic regulator we have discovered (and are beginning to understand) is the molecular adaptor and pseudokinase, Trib3. By developing a Trib3-KO mouse model, we reveal non-redundant novel stress erythropoiesis specific roles for Trib3 during both early, and late- stage erythroid cell formation We will now advance insight into these two new stress erythropoiesis factors, and coupled pathways, via the following SPECIFIC AIMS: SA#1 will first define how Spi2A and linked pathways impact on stress erythropoiesis due to ?-thalassemia and iron imbalance (#1.1). At a mechanistic level, consequences of Spi2A- deficiency on erythroblast autophagy will be determined and molecular damage incurred by erythroblast lysosomes during oxidative stress plus Spi2A-deficiency will be defined (#1.2). Via LOF studies, SA#2 first will define effects exerted by Trib3 pseudokinase on early- and late-stage erythropoiesis during ?-thalassemia, and iron imbalance (#2.1). Aim 2.2 will determine Trib3's roles in unfolded protein response pathways together with Trib3's regulatory molecular action mechanisms in early- and late- stage erythroid cells. SA#3 will advance studies to primary human erythroid progenitors (including thalassemia), and will first determine effects of lysosomal compromise, and cathepsin inhibition on erythroblast cytoprotection (#3.1). Aim 3.2 will define effects of Trib3 LOF and GOF during erythropoietic stress. Substantial insight will be gained concerning new regulators of red cell formation and novel target pathways within compromised erythroid progenitors for anti- anemia agents."
"9348398","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      To conduct this study, 300 individuals who experience chronic tinnitus will be enrolled and stratified by age decades 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70 and 71+ (50 subjects per decade). Each subject will complete testing that will include tinnitus loudness and pitch matching, noise-band matching, forced-choice double staircase, and minimum masking level. Testing for these measures will be accomplished using our automated, self-guided Tinnitus Evaluation System (TES). Subjects will also complete the Tinnitus Functional Index and a visual numeric scale of tinnitus loudness prior to each test session. All testing will be repeated at 1, 3, and 6 months, enabling analyses of test-retest reliability and normal variation of the measures in the absence of intervention. A subset of 60 subjects (10 per age decade) will also perform manual testing of loudness and pitch matching, noise-band matching, and minimum masking level to facilitate a comparison of results obtained with automated versus manual testing. The end product will be a set of age-specific reference standards for each psychoacoustic measure of tinnitus, suitable for application to clinical and research samples. Testing will occur throughout the 3-year funding period. Concurrently, the TES will be upgraded to an integrated touch- screen system. Currently, the TES consists of a PC computer connected via USB port to the TES Module (control device to facilitate patient responses). An upgrade is required to update this technology that was developed over 6 years ago to conduct the previous study. To accomplish this upgrade, we plan to integrate all components into a single unit. The unit will consist of a touch-screen industrial controller and the current TES Module (mounted adjacent to each other within a common enclosure), and attached ER-4B insert earphones. With this upgrade, current technology will be made available to audiologists who perform tinnitus psychoacoustic testing, using a fully-automated system that has been validated for reliability and tested to establish normative responses of the measures. The fulfillment of this project will produce both the upgraded TES and normative data to facilitate interpretation of individual responses to tinnitus psychoacoustic testing."
"9297754","Abstract Abnormalities in triglyceride (TG) metabolism are a critical risk factor for fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, obesity and diabetes, all of which are major clinical problems worldwide. ApoAV is a new member of the apolipoprotein family and is synthesized exclusively in the liver. A fact that is often neglected is that the concentration of apoAV in human plasma is extremely low (114-258 ng/mL), 1,000 to 10,000-fold lower than that of apoB100 and apoAI, respectively. It has fascinated investigators for many years how a very low circulating level of apoAV can exert such a profound effect on plasma TG homeostasis in humans and animals. Because ~20% of apoAV is secreted into the circulation, its concentration is significantly higher in the liver than in plasma. Our preliminary data show that apoAV plays a critical role in regulating hepatic TG metabolism, and ethanol disrupts hepatic TG homeostasis and exacerbates the accumulation of excess TG in the liver, leading to more severe alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in apoAV knockout (KO) mice than in wild-type (WT) mice. We further found that ethanol inhibits expression of apoAV in a dose- dependent manner in the mouse primary hepatocytes. Chronic and binge ethanol feeding (i.e., the NIAAA model) for 4 weeks leads to a significant and rapid development of liver steatosis, gradually evolving from simple steatosis to alcoholic steatohepatitis and then to liver fibrosis in apoAV KO, but not WT mice. More importantly, ethanol significantly increases hepatic concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), a major fatty acid metabolite, by enhancing its biosynthesis in apoAV KO mice. A recent human study has found that lysoPC is a new and important biomarker for excess alcohol intake; however, its vital role in the pathogenesis of ALD is still unknown. By contrast, transgenic expression of the human APOAV gene in mice protects against ethanol-induced liver injury. Our results demonstrate that the absence of apoAV is an important risk factor for ALD and apoAV is a novel target for the prevention and the treatment of ALD. Thus, our preliminary results support the hypothesis that adeno-associated-virus 2/8 (AAV2/8)-mediated gene transfer of the human APOAV protects against ALD in ethanol-fed mice. Of the commonly used viral vectors, AAV produces the lowest immune response and is non-pathogenic even in the wild-type state, as well as is the most suitable viral vector for therapeutic applications. AAV2/8 (i.e., AAV-8 pseudotypes in which AAV-2 genomes are packaged into AAV-8 capsids) displays highly efficient liver gene transfer. Therefore, AAV2/8 is a promising method for gene therapy of ALD. We will test the hypothesis in two specific aims: First, we will investigate whether overexpression of APOAV protects against ethanol-induced liver steatosis in mice transduced with AAV2/8- APOAV. Second, we will explore whether AAV2/8-APOAV treatment prevents ethanol-triggered progression from simple steatosis to alcoholic steatohepatitis through lysoPC in mice. The proposed studies are innovative because this project may provide an efficacious strategy for the gene therapy of ALD."
"9296176","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A role for endogenous retroelements in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a severe Mendelian inflammatory disorder that affects particularly the brain and frequently causes death in childhood. The disease is characterized by progressive encephalopathy, psychomotor regression, and lesions of the skin, together with increased levels of Type I interferon in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and induction of interferon-stimulated genes detectable in peripheral blood. Causative mutations have been identified in seven genes, TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1 and IFIH1, with variation in the severity of their associated phenotypes. The protein products of these genes are involved in RNA metabolism or signaling, and have also been linked with suppression of infecting retroviruses and/or endogenous retrotransposons. This study is based on the hypothesis that functional loss of an AGS-associated gene alters the normal metabolism of retrotransposon RNA or its reverse-transcribed cDNA, triggering an interferon response and AGS.  Retrotransposons are mobile DNA elements that duplicate themselves by a copy and paste mechanism using an RNA intermediate. Endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) comprise 8% of the human genome. Although no HERVs capable of replication have been identified, ongoing HERV expression has been implicated in several disease conditions, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and autoimmune rheumatic disease. LINE1 (L1) retrotransposons occupy 17% of human DNA, although it is believed that only about 100 remain competent for retrotransposition in any individual. L1 retrotransposition has also been responsible for the insertion of over a million non-autonomous Alu retrotransposons and thousands of processed pseudogenes. The cell has evolved defenses restricting retrotransposition, which are occasionally relaxed in certain somatic cell types, notably neuronal cells in the human brain. We predict relaxation of retroelement expression in AGS patients.  Using RNA analyses, immunocytochemistry, and functional assays for reverse transcriptase activity, we will examine brain tissue, blood, sera, and derived cell lines from AGS patients to ascertain if retroelement RNA or protein expression is elevated in the disease state. We will determine if de novo L1 and Alu insertion numbers are increased in tissues of AGS patients using high-throughput sequencing protocols. The question of whether L1 expression can induce an interferon response will be addressed using a mouse model harboring an inducible L1 transgene. Finally, we will develop ELISA assays to ascertain if sera from AGS patients contain autoantibodies directed against retroelement proteins.  This research should shed new light on a devastating childhood disease and suggest future strategies for treatment. Furthermore, new insights into the interaction of the intrinsic immune system of the cell and endogenous retroelements will be gained."
"9236072","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Helicobacter pylori is the dominant member of the gastric microbiota in a majority of the world's population. H. pylori colonization can lead to protection from some pro-inflammatory diseases such as allergic airway disease, but also can lead to significant detrimental outcomes, including gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Infection with H. pylori is the single most common ris factor of gastric cancer; for this reason, H. pylori was defined by the World Health Organization as a Class I carcinogen. Current data suggest that, in addition to bacterial virulence factors, the  magnitude and types of immune responses influence the outcome of colonization. The long-term chronic pro-inflammatory response to H. pylori is believed to drive or initiate the pathways which lead to the adverse outcomes of colonization including chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer.  We have accumulated preliminary data that strongly implicate interleukin-21 (IL-21), a cytokine produced by many subsets of activated CD4+ T cells, as a critical driver of adverse consequences of H. pylori colonization and infection. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how many pro-inflammatory molecules lead to these detrimental outcomes. The major goal of this application is to investigate the mechanisms by which IL-21 regulates the immune response to H. pylori, by primarily utilizing mouse models that focus on the primary detrimental outcome of infection, gastritis. A second goal is to determine the impact of IL-17 and IL-21 immunotherapies on gastritis. Moreover, organoids and human biopsies will be used to investigate IL-21 activated pathways at various steps along the gastric precancerous cascade. In this proposal, the specific aims are designed to elucidate the mechanism by which IL-21 modulates both immune and non- immune cell responses. Our central hypothesis is that IL-21 is a master regulator of the inflammatory response during H. pylori infection, thereby driving detrimental outcomes (such as gastritis). The Specific Aims are: 1. To investigate the mechanisms by which IL-21 regulates pro-inflammatory T cell priming and activation during H. pylori infection. 2. To determine the contributions of IL-21 in dendritic cell  function during H. pylori infection. 3. To elucidate the contribution of IL-21-mediated epithelial cell responses to control of gastritis and H. pylori colonization.  This research will also inform  myriad of other infectious and chronic inflammatory disorders for which IL-21 is increasingly recognized to play a central role. Defining mechanisms through which H. pylori induces gastric cancer may provide important insights into other malignancies that arise from inflammatory foci. Moreover, the proposed studies will generate new insights into the fundamental mechanisms involved in the development of chronic inflammation."
"9409634","Project Summary COPD is a common and serious disease with no cure that is characterized by chronic, progressive lung damage, a decline in pulmonary function and quality of life, and often death. The two major clinical features of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD is mainly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke (CS), however, about 3% of COPD patients have a genetic deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AATD). AATD patients represent an orphan disease population for which emphysema is the primary cause of death, and is a relatively homogenous group with a more efficient and less costly clinical development path compared to the broad COPD population. Allinaire Therapeutics, LLC, has demonstrated that EMAP II (endothelial monocyte-activating protein) is a novel therapeutic target for emphysematous COPD that plays a central role in driving the underlying pathology of the disease, including lung inflammation and alveolar destruction. EMAP II levels in the lungs of patients positively correlate with the severity of COPD and remain elevated even after smoking cessation. Furthermore, lung-specific overexpression of EMAP II induces emphysematous changes in mice, and a tool rat antibody to EMAP II (M7/1) blocks the progression of chronic CS-induced lung emphysema in mice. Work supported by the phase 1 SBIR grant resulted in the synthesis of fully humanized versions of the rat M7/1 mAb. Several leads were identified with appropriate potency and developability properties to be considered for optimization. In addition, preliminary data presented in the application demonstrates that treatment with one of the humanized EMAP II mAbs prevented lung macrophage infiltration in a sub-chronic (4 week) CS-exposure model. The specific aims of this Phase II research plan are: Aim 1. Selection of an optimized, high-affinity EMAP II mAb development candidate. The most potent of the 4 current leads will be identified (by SPR) and used to perform lead optimization, affinity maturation, and stable cell line development to produce a clinical candidate with sub-nanomolar affinity and suitable manufacturability properties; Aim. 2 In vivo testing of the lead mAb in a chronic CS-exposure model of emphysema in mouse. The dose-response effects of the clinical development candidate mAb will be tested in a model of chronic CS exposure to confirm a reduction in emphysema endpoints. The mAb will be administered therapeutically via the clinically relevant subcutaneous route; Aim 3. Target validation for EMAP II in AATD patient samples, mouse elastase model, and human lung cells. Serum EMAP II will be measured in individuals with COPD of different severities with or without AATD to determine the correlation between EMAP II and disease severity. Further target validation of EMAP II in the context of AATD will be determined by testing the effects of the mAb in the mouse model of elastase- induced emphysema and human lung cells. Completion of the Phase II milestones will provide Allinaire with a strong pre-clinical data package to enable either partnering of the project with a Pharmaceutical company or additional fund-raising to support progression of the project to manufacturing and IND-enabling studies, as critical steps towards clinical trials with an EMAP II mAb in AATD patients initially, and subsequently in the broader COPD population with emphysema."

Changes and innovations for the renewal period include: equal participation and support for clinical and basic scientists, greater synergy with the HNRC Developmental Core to encourage competitive grant applications with an emphasis on NIMH priorities; a number of enhanced professional development opportunities; and ongoing updates to didactic series to reflect changes in the science of neuroAIDS."
"9331627","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) demonstrate a disproportionate burden of atherosclerosis compared with individuals possessing normal kidney function, which contributes to the excessive morbidity and mortality in this group. Moreover, a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia, only partially accounts for the accelerated atherosclerosis observed in CKD patients, implying that unique risk factors must be present in this population. Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in the intestinal microbiome may facilitate the development of multiple pathologic processes which are commonly found in patients with impaired kidney function, including atherosclerosis. More specifically, several byproducts of intestinal bacteria have been observed to potentiate atherosclerosis formation in animals and associate with atherosclerosis-related clinical outcomes in humans. Among these compounds are trimethylamine-N- oxide (TMAO), an organic compound derived from the metabolism of dietary L-carnitine and choline by intestinal bacteria, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin produced by Gram-negative bacteria that populate the intestinal lumen. Interestingly, recent published and unpublished evidence from our group and others suggests that circulating concentrations of both TMAO and LPS become substantially elevated with kidney disease progression and associate with adverse clinical outcomes in CKD patients. Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed, oral antibiotic that is concentrated in the gastrointestinal tract and currently utilized as a chronic therapy in patients with advanced liver disease to prevent recurrent hepatic encephalopathy that partially stems from the systemic accumulation of neurotoxins derived from intestinal bacteria. Rifaximin is unique in that chronic administration appears to result in very limited disruption of the overall balance of the intestinal microbiome, while possibly enhancing the presence of symbiotic bacteria that promote intestinal health. We hypothesize that byproducts of the intestinal microbiome contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis formation and the pro-inflammatory phenotype in patients with CKD. In the proposed pilot study, we will determine if short-term rifaximin therapy to target intestinal microbes can lower circulating concentrations of purported atherosclerotic risk factors (TMAO, LPS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF?, and hsCRP) in patients with advanced-stage CKD. Additional exploratory outcomes of this work will include assessment of circulating concentrations of purported regulators of vascular endothelial function (ADMA, SDMA, and FGF23) and alterations in HDL cholesterol efflux function in response to therapy."
"9323599","ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression."
"9280213","TR&D1 Biology to Physics Project Summary This project proposes to develop new network-free spatial modeling software at the mesoscale - occupying the niche between detailed molecular dynamics and cellular reaction-diffusion systems. Specifically, we plan to address spatial scales in the range of 50nm ? 2µm and temporal scales within the range of 1ms to 10s. Examples of systems that would benefit from modeling tools at this ?mesoscale? are receptor signaling platforms and clusters (e.g. the immune synapse or the post-synaptic density), cell adhesion complexes, lipid rafts, chromatin organization, cytoskeletal dynamics, and nucleoprotein phases. Our approach builds on the foundation of the SpringSaLaD software, which uses a Langevin dynamics formalism to model multi-molecular interactions with explicit excluded volumes. It permits spatial simulations of combinatorially complex processes such as clustering and polymerization. The approach is an amalgam of kinetic and molecular modeling, in that it derives probabilities of reactions from both coarse structural features of the molecules and macroscopic biochemical parameters such as on and off rate constants, diffusion coefficients and allosteric state transition rates. Currently SpringSaLaD represents molecules as spherical ?sites? connected by linear linkers, modeled as stiff springs. Molecules can diffuse and react either in a rectangular volume or be anchored to a planar patch of membrane. Our Specific Aims propose to dramatically expand the scope of SpringSaLaD by allowing more realistic representation of structural details and expanding the range of biophysical mechanisms that can be modelled. To better account for the influence of membrane curvature on clustering and the possibility of assemblies that span across thin processes such as filopodia, we will implement methods for Brownian dynamics along curved membranes. We will develop methods to derive the arrangement of spherical sites and linkers from more realistic 3D molecular data, including atomic coordinates. We will develop new optional schemes to better account for the rigidity of molecular structures at this coarse-grained level and, separately, the flexibility of linker domains; the latter will help us represent the influence of intrinsically disordered domains. Finally, we propose to encode the net vectorial force experienced by a site into the probabilities for unbinding (i.e. off rates), binding (on-rates) and the forces at membrane surfaces."

"9339535","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Because the diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) cannot be excluded until age 40, many ADPKD patients are veterans. The objective of this proposal is to define therapeutic potential of targeting C3 (the axial component of complement pathway) in ADPKD. In line with paradigm shifts resulting from discoveries of novel essential roles of local C3 production, our studies point to intra-renal production of C3 as a regulator of a pathway that dictates the pace of renal cystogenesis. We formulated this hypothesis based on our genome-wide expression analyses of kidneys with rapid vs slow pace of cystogenesis in a PKD model. We supported this hypothesis by demonstrating: (i) presence of both C3 mRNA and protein in renal tubular cells that line ADPKD and autosomal recessive (AR) PKD cysts and the ability of these cells to activate C3; (ii) increased renal content of biologically active C3 split products i ARPKD and ADPKD and their models; (iii) strong correlation between renal C3 expression and pace of renal cystogenesis in a PKD model and C3 hypoactive gene variant with the disease progression among ADPKD patients; and (iv) significant protective effect of C3 deficiency on renal cystogenesis in genetic PKD models. While C3 may act through different pathways, we have found consistent association of accelerated cystogenesis specifically with the pathway regulated by complement receptor CR3. CR3 (or Mac- 1), a major receptor for C3 fragment iC3b, which is highly abundant in cystic kidneys, plays a central role in differentiation, attachment and survival of monocytes/macrophages. While we have identified C3, macrophage marker CD14 and C3-inducible factor MCP-1 as candidate predictors of PKD outcomes, others have demonstrated that macrophage depletion attenuates cystogenesis in orthologous models of ADPKD by reducing the proliferation of cystic tubules. CR3 may also induce pro-cystogenic TNF release and directly activate c-Src in renal tubule cells. Since renal tubule cells produce and activate C3 when fluid flow is absent we suggest that the C3 effects in PKD increase as cystic tubules dilate, forming a vicious cystogenic cycle. Specifically, we hypothesize that C3 pathway activation accelerates cyst formation in ADPKD through a CR3 dependent process. We address this hypothesis in three inter-related aims: 1) Dissect mechanisms underlying cystogenic effects of C3 production on Pkd1 pathway; 2) Determine effects of renal tubule-derived C3 in the pathogenesis of ADPKD.; and 3) Determine the role of complement component receptor CR3 (or Mac1) in Pkd1-induced cystogenesis. Objectives of these Aims will be accomplished by integrating: (i) highly innovative study design of interrogating novel regulatory mechanisms of renal cystogenesis with (ii) generation of novel state of the art reagents (e.g., for conditional C3 targeting). Achieving the proposed aims will allow integration of existing knowledge by linking established and novel cystogenic pathways to the C3-CR3 nexus. The proposed studies represent the next step for attaining our long-term goal of developing a safe C3-based therapy for ADPKD and other renal disorders."
"9339576","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Mixed Lineage Kinase 3 (MLK3) is a stress-activated MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase (MAP3K) member, and its biological function is still elusive. While dissecting the signaling pathway mediated via MLK3, we observed a robust phosphorylation of a prolyl isomerase Pin1 by MLK3 on Serine138 residue. These results were significant as Pin1 is considered an important oncogene and is overexpressed in almost all types of cancer. The Pin1 specific inhibitors are under development to treat cancer. Remarkably, the phosphorylated Pin1 (i.e. Pin1S138E mutant) was localized in the nucleus, suggesting that this phosphorylation-dependent translocation of Pin1 could have some physiological function. Corroborating our hypothesis, the phosphorylated Pin1 was overexpressed in tumors but not in normal matching tissues and p-Pin1 was necessary for cell cycle progression. Therefore, we ventured to find the targets of p-Pin1 that could promote tumorigenesis. We identified that p-Pin1 (i.e. S138E) was able to up regulate mRNA of Gli1, a transcription factor in the Hedgehog pathway, whose dysregulation has been linked to cancer, including pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we also observed that mRNA of a chemokine, CXCL5 was downregulated in MLK3 knockout liver, suggesting that MLK3 is necessary for CXCL5 expression. These results were quite intriguing because Gli1 activation/dysregulation has been implicated in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and also reported that inhibition of Hedgehog pathway overcomes gemcitabine (common drug for pancreatic cancer) resistance in animal model. More recently, CXCL5 and its receptor blockage in pancreatic cancer cell lines was shown to inhibit the pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDA) cell growth and CXCL5 produced by pancreatic cancer cell lines was able to promote angiogenesis. Our preliminary investigation further revealed that MLK3 activity was regulated by CXCL5 in pancreatic cancer cell lines and the MLK3 activity correlated with the expression levels of CXCL5 in these cell lines. We also observed that in primary human pancreatic tumors, the MLK3 activities directly correlated with the expression levels of Pin1 and Gli1 in tumors. Based on these results, we conceive that the available MLKs inhibitor, CEP-1347/CEP-11004 or in combination with Pin1 inhibitor, should induce cell death in pancreatic cancer cells? Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in pancreatic cancer cells, MLK3 activates Pin1 and its downstream Gli1, leading PDA. Therefore targeting MLK3 or other MLKs along with Pin1 inhibition could abrogate pancreatic tumors. To achieve our goals, we will determine that: (1) activation of Gli1 by MLK3-Pin1 axis promotes pancreatic cell tumorigenesis, (2) disruption of MLK3- Pin1 axis attenuates pancreatic cancer cell tumorigenesis; and (3) we will determine the mechanism of MLK3, Pin1 and Gli1 activation in pancreatic cell tumorigenesis. It is expected that by defining the role of MLK3 in Pin1 and Gli1 activation in pancreatic tumorigenesis, we might control/treat pancreatic cancers by using available inhibitors of this pathway. Interestingly the specific inhibitor of MLK3 family, CEP-1347 has been used in clinical trials for treating neurodegenerative diseases and specific Pin1 inhibitors are under development for cancer treatment. It has also been suggested that MLKs inhibitors might serve as a treatment for specific type of cancer, underscoring our unexpected novel results related to MLK3 role in pancreatic cancer. Taken together, the present study will lead to the identification of new prognostic factors and specific targeted therapies for difficult to treat and lethal pancreatic cancer."
"9323548","PROJECT SUMMARY The Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act (ACA) has significantly changed the landscape of school health, bringing to the forefront the needs and opportunities of schools to provide for the health needs of their students. With the increasing, and persistent, attention being drawn to the problem of childhood obesity, the role of schools and the educational environment is emphasized. Unfortunately, research at the intersection of health and education, particularly in the area of childhood obesity, has not kept pace with this need. While research has demonstrated a link between academic outcomes and childhood weight status, few studies have examined the mediating relationships among health and educational indicators that may help explain causal effects. Similarly, a host of risk factors have been identified as they relate to weight status, but comprehensive studies that include multiple risks as well as educational indicators are needed. The purpose of this study is to examine the longitudinal relations between multiple risks, child weight status and educational well-being with an entire statewide population of children between birth and 6th grades. Three specific aims guide the work. First, this study will investigate relationships between early risks and kindergarten entry outcomes, including children's weight status, language skills, social-emotional skills, and school attendance. This aim will draw attention to the important early risks that render children likely to enter school with significant threats to their future educational well-being. Second, these same sets of early risks, weight status, and educational well-being indicators will be examined longitudinally across the trajectory from kindergarten to 6th grade. Where 6th grade is a consistent developmental period that evidences the peak childhood obesity rate, this aim will shed light on important factors that could be used for subsequent school- based intervention development to reduce obesity rates before 6th grade. Lastly, mediational analyses will examine the indirect relations between multiple risks, weight status, and educational well-being. Findings from this study have the potential to inform strategic interventions both within the state as well as nationwide by providing a more comprehensive understanding of risk and protective factors related to the development of obesity for school aged children."
"9357578","Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High- Order Brain Networks Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with no known disease-modifying treatment. Current clinical diagnosis and monitoring of the disease are primarily based on subjective neuropsychological and neurobehavioral assessments, which are generally susceptible to large variability. Objective biomarkers that are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis and monitoring purposes are hence critically in need. Neuroimaging fits this need and provides objective measures and markers of preclinical disease states for aiding researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness. Since AD- related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology, additional diagnostic information during the prodromal phase of AD, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is of paramount importance for the success of treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning diagnostic framework based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) for accurate AD diagnosis at the individual level, so as to promote early detection for possible treatment and prophylaxis. Achieving this goal requires significant technical innovations to empower researchers the ability to detect sophisticated yet subtle alteration patterns in brain function. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will harness the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity to provide additional information for accurate identification of individuals who are at risk for AD. This is significantly different from most existing methods that assume temporal stationarity and are therefore unable to take advantage of temporally-evolving connectivity information for more fine-grained characterization of rapidly changing brain states. In Aim 2, we will extract high-order information from functional networks, beyond the commonly used region-pair correlation, for characterizing functional synchronization of the interactions of multiple pairs of regions. This overcomes the over-simplistic pairwise-interaction assumptions of existing methods, and thus allows greater capacity to model complex brain circuitry. In Aim 3, we will fuse information across imaging modalities to complement functional networks with both the white-matter structural networks (generated using diffusion MRI) and the morphological networks (generated using cortical thickness information from anatomical T1-weighted imaging). This will allow complementary information from different modalities to reinforce each other in improving diagnostic accuracy. Upon successful completion of this project, we expect that the resulting comprehensive, integrated, and effective diagnosis framework will be conducive to improving the success of early detection of MCI/AD, as well as other neurological disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and multiple sclerosis."
"9539894","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antibiotic resistance is a major worldwide problem. With excellent efficacy, bioavailability, and minimal toxicity, the frequently prescribed fluoroquinolones are an extremely important drug class. The long-term goals of the Zechiedrich laboratory are to determine how gram-negative bacteria respond to and develop resistance to antimicrobial agents and to use this knowledge to improve diagnosis of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, to prolong the usefulness of current drugs, and to aid in the design of new therapeutic modalities. In previous funding periods, we constructed an evolving HIPAA compliant Oracle database that combines patient, hospital, and microbiological data from gram-negative clinical isolates collected since 1999. We discovered that known fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms account for the resistance phenotype in approximately half of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli clinical isolates; therefore, additional unknown resistance mechanisms must exist. To uncover these mechanisms, we developed a unique approach that incorporates genome pooling, sequencing, and SNP analysis. We uncovered extremely problematic novel clinical isolates (resistant to all but two antibiotics and with very high fluoroquinolone MICs). The genomes of these isolates diverged from and could not be mapped to reference genomes. Conserved among all other fluoroquinolone-resistant pools, we found the well-known SNP in the gyrA target gene and three novel SNPs relative to drug-susceptible reference genomes. We also found 283 SNPs in 173 genes associated with fluoroquinolone resistance and resistance to specific additional antimicrobial agents. Relative to a fluoroquinolone-resistant reference genome, we found 35 novel SNPs associated with a fluoroquinolone-susceptible phenotype. The aims of this proposal are Aim 1: Predict how Identified Genetic Variants Alter the Encoded Protein Structure and Function, Aim 2: Define Function of Discovered Genetic Variants, Aim 3: Determine the Molecular Mechanisms of Discovered Protein Variants, and Aim 4: Continue to Discover Genetic Variants Associated with Fluoroquinolone Susceptibility or Fluoroquinolone Resistance Phenotypes. Our team, in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, is composed of a molecular microbiologist (Zechiedrich), a physician scientist (Hamill), a genomics expert (Sucgang), a computational biologist (Barth), and a crystallographer (Lee). The foundational knowledge gained in achieving these goals is required before new drugs or new targets for new drugs can be identified. A better understanding of how resistance arises will provide vital clues to how it may be avoided. Moreover, the identification of SNPs associated with fluoroquinolone resistance or susceptibility will provide physicians tools to prescribe antibiotics that will be effective, thus saving lives, money, and preserving the current arsenal of antibiotics."
"9335448","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome (Velocardiofacial Syndrome; 22q11DS) occurs in about 1/3000 live births, and is the most frequent known recurrent genetic cause of schizophrenia, accounting for 1-2 % of schizophrenia cases in the general population The overall goal of this project is to study neural progrenitors and neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in order to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric phenotype in patients with 22q11DS. In the last five years we have developed highly reproducible methods for studying the differentiation of iPSCs into neurons, and for characterizing these cells using well-validated genetic and cell biological assays. Using this approach, we found evidence of reproducible changes in gene expression that implicate calcium (CA) signaling and developmental dysregulation in 22q11DS neurons. We experimentally validated the presence of aberrant CA signaling and dopaminergic D2 receptor dysfunction, as well as defects in dendritic branching. We now have the technology in place to significantly increase the throughput, and in this study we will expand our investigations to a much larger sample of patients with 22q11DS, in order to connect the cellular defects with patient characteristics. Specifically, we will: 1) generate an iPSC patient resource by obtaining skin fibroblasts from 40 well-characterized patients with 22q11DS - 20 with a diagnosis of psychotic disorder and 20 without - and 20 demographically comparable controls. 2) Using these resources, we will first validate our preliminary findings of defects in dopaminergic signaling, and then determine which aspects of calcium signaling are impacted by the deletion. By rescuing the phenotype through selectively expressing each of the genes deleted within the 22q11.2 region we will determine which gene(s) are causally implicated in the specific defects. 3) In parallel, we will comprehensively analyze the transcriptome in order to identify key hubs and pathways that are dysregulated in neurons from 22q11DS patients, and compare the co-expression modules in 22q11DS patients with and without psychosis, to explore potential pathways that may be specifically relevant to the development of schizophrenia in 22q11DS. Finally we will: 4) connect cellular, gene expression and behavioral phenotypes, by comparing cellular phenotypes derived from 22q11DS patients with and without psychosis, which will be integrated with gene expression data, in order to connect molecular pathways to morphological or physiological phenotypes, and actual clinical presentations in 22q11DS patients."

"9238192","ABSTRACT This work is a continuation of our long-standing efforts to understand the formation of the vertebrate limb. The hope is that the knowledge we glean will ultimately provide insights into the developmental defects leading to congenital malformations and to novel regenerative therapies to restore injured appendages. While replacement of developed limb tissues could, in principle, be achieved by harnessing and enhancing the endogenous regenerative potential of the limb through a process akin to amphibian limb regeneration, an alternative approach is to attempt to recapitulate embryonic limb development in an adult setting. Towards that end, in preliminary studies, we have taken a reprogramming approach. Screening for a cocktail of transcription factors capable of respecifying mesenchymal cells to a limb progenitor identity, we have evidence that Lhx2, Nmyc, Sall4 and PDRM16 together can convert non-limb fibroblasts into cells with the properties of early limb bud cells, including driving expression of a gene profile mimicking that is seen in the early limb bud, and can imbue cells with the potential to differentiate into the range of cell types found in the developing limb. In Aim 1, we will characterize these cells in greater detail in vitro to determine how closely they approximate endogenous limb bud progenitors. In Aim 2, we will interrogate these cells functionally, testing their capacity to form appropriate tissues and structures in vivo. Finally, in Aim 3, we will focus on two of the factors required for putatively reprogramming limb bud progenitor cells, Sall4 and Lhx2, investigating whether they act through the same sets of gene targets during reprogramming as they do during limb bud development. Together, these studies will bring us closer to understanding how to manipulate limb-like cells for regenerative purposes and will also potentially provide new insights into how early limb bud is regulated."
"9372582","Loma Linda University (LLU) conducted the FIC funded (R01 TW05964-05; R03 TW007345-03) ?Asia Tobacco Control Leadership Training (TCLT)? program in East Asia during 2002-2012. Under TCLT, LLU mentored personnel in the Ministries of Health and NGOs of Cambodia and Lao PDR to complete the first national prevalence surveys of tobacco use. TCLT produced numerous scientific publications, policy documents used in successful advocacy for tobacco control legislation, and a sustainable national tobacco survey model with data collection on a handheld mobile technology platform. This R01 renewal application builds upon TCLT survey technology by adding an innovative, research program of ?Building Geographic Information System Capacity into the Tobacco Control Research (GIS-TOBCR)? workforce of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Mongolia. In each nation, the ratified WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty is now in implementation phase for policies on taxation, pricing, branding, health labeling, advertising, and smoke-free areas. Our preliminary data indicate, however, that the efficacy of policy implementation exhibits marked geographic variation as evidenced by low cost, illicit tobacco sales in border regions, near schools, and in hard-to-access rural communities (i.e. ethno-religious minorities, traditional medicine vendors). The scientific premise for GIS- TOBCR research in each nation is the gap in published spatial research that can identify ? for intervention purposes ? community level, geographic targets where tobacco policies are not being implemented. The overall objective of the GIS-TOBCR program is to build GIS research capacity into the tobacco control workforce of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Mongolia to monitor and improve the progress of implementing tobacco control policies at the community level. Our specific aims use GIS analytics and innovate mobile GIS applications to identify variables that are spatially associated with: 1) Points-of-sale of cigarettes that are non- compliant with WHO FCTC policies on packaging (tax stamps, health warnings, brands for women, single cigarette sales) and pricing, 2) Points-of-sale of loose tobacco (in smokeless products, pipes, roll-your-own) that are non-compliant with WHO FCTC, and 3) Tobacco ads-promotions-placements that are non-compliant with WHO FCTC. Our research capacity building plan is fully integrated into the aims by building GIS research capacity into the multi-sectoral (Ministry of Health, NGO, academia) tobacco control workforce that monitors implementation of WHO FCTC.

"9371843","Abstract   Persistent Tic Disorders (PTD), including Tourette's Disorder (TD) are neuropsychiatric conditions marked by movements and/or vocalizations present for longer than one year, and associated with impairments in quality of life. Many individuals do not significantly benefit from existing behavioral and pharmacological treatments. Enhanced knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in PTDs may aid identification of new targets for treatment development. Circadian rhythm disruption frequently presents in psychiatric and neurological disorders and may be implicated in PTDs. Case studies show morning exposure to light therapy, known to advance circadian phase is associated with modest to large tic reductions suggesting the presence of circadian abnormalities (i.e., phase delay) in select individuals with PTDs, which may contribute to tic symptom onset, course, and treatment response, and be linked to underlying PTD pathophysiology. Circadian phase is commonly assessed through dim light melatonin onset, as it is the most reliable marker. The strongest phase shifting agent is light therapy, which is associated with circadian phase shifts in circadian rhythm sleep disorders, mood disorders, and other psychiatric and neurological disorders. Moreover, light therapy is associated with improvements in the core psychiatric and neurological symptoms. Light therapy historically has involved administration of bright white light via a light box. However, adherence may be reduced by adverse side effects from bright light, and burden due to limited mobility and time constraints. A viable alternative is wearable short wavelength blue light therapy ? shown to be more effective at phase shifting circadian rhythms at lower intensities and shorter durations relative to white light. Therefore, the present project utilizes a translational approach to identify and test a new mechanism for target engagement in PTDs. This study will assess circadian phase and phenotype in 35 youth ages 13 to 17 relative to 35 sex- and pubertal stage- matched healthy control subjects, and assess the degree to which wearable short wavelength light therapy targets this putative circadian mechanism, and is associated with improvements in tic symptoms. Drawing on the expertise of project co-mentors: Christopher Colwell, Ph.D. and John Piacentini, Ph.D.; and consultants: Meredith Coles, Ph.D., Dana McMakin, Ph.D., Helen Burgess, Ph.D., and Catherine Sugar, Ph.D. the proposed project will provide comprehensive training in circadian physiology; circadian measurement and treatment; experimental therapeutic frameworks as they pertain to pediatric psychopathology, including tic disorders and sleep; and biostatistics. Findings will enhance our understanding of the role of circadian rhythms in Persistent Tic Disorders and may provide new targets for future treatment development.  "
"9288629","Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level?key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)?and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions."
"9395192","Project Summary/Abstract  Quaternary stereocenters are prevalent structural motifs that are found in countless molecules of biological importance. For example, quaternary carbons are salient features of valuable therapeutic classes such as steroid hormones and opioid analgesics, embodied by the medicinally useful natural products cortisone and morphine, respectively. Despite the significance of quaternary stereocenters in medicines, there are few methods that allow efficient access to these moieties. Thus, methodologies that furnish one or more quaternary carbons are highly sought after, especially those that unite multiple complex fragments in a single chemical step. The proposed research aims to synergistically utilize visible light photoredox catalysis and group 10 metal catalysis for the carbo-difunctionalization of electron-deficient olefins, forging two new carbon? carbon bonds and at least one quaternary center in a single transformation. Although photoredox catalysis has been employed to generate tertiary radicals from readily available tert-alkyl hemioxalates, allowing for subsequent conjugate addition reactions, this reactivity paradigm has never been employed in a dual catalysis manifold. Realization of such a reactivity platform should permit the generation of polyfunctionalized products containing multiple quaternary centers. Moreover, it is envisioned that the proposed dual catalysis system could be utilized as a key step in the total synthesis of the complex ent-kaurene diterpenoid, sculponeatin N."
"9262750","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          An estimated 39.6 million people, including 8.5 million US Veterans (43%), are elderly and at risk for developing chronic sleep disturbance. Chronic sleep disturbance is associated with a number of negative health outcomes including cognitive decline, increased risk of fall, anxiety, and depressive disorders, contributing to the poor quality of life. The proposed research program will use a multi-disciplinary approach to examine: a) if a physiological decline or dysfunction of the preoptic hypothalamic (POAH) sleep- regulatory systems contribute to chronic sleep disturbance in aging; b) if chronic POAH inflammation and nitrosative stress in aging contribute to sleep-disturbance, by adversely affecting sleep-regulatory systems; and c) if sleep disturbance in aging can be mitigated by anti-inflammatory measures. Specific aim-1: will determine if the functional activity of sleep-regulatory median preoptic nucleus (MnPN) and ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) neurons decline with aging. We will compare in young vs. old rats: a) changes in discharge activity of sleep-active MnPN and VLPO neurons to spontaneous and homeostatic sleep cues (experiment-1); and b) c-Fos expression in VLPO and MnPN GABAergic neurons after different sleep pressures and sleep amounts (experiment-2). Specific aim-2: will determine if the MnPN and VLPO sleep-regulatory systems exhibit evidence of increased inflammation, nitrosative stress, and neuronal damage with aging. We will compare in young and old rats: a) microglia activation, and expression of TNF-alpha, iNOS, nitrotyrosine (markers of nitrosative stress), and markers of senescence, apoptosis and neuronal damage in the MnPN and VLPO GABAergic neurons, by immunohistochemistry (experiment-3); and b) levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, iNOS, and nitrotyrosine by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blots as well as NO metabolites (nitrates and nitrites) and cytokine release in the MnPN and VLPO by ELISA and flourometry (experiment-4). Specific aim-3: will determine if chronic MnPN and VLPO inflammation contribute to sleep disturbance, by adversely affecting their sleep-regulatory neuronal systems. We will quantify: a) if chronic MnPN and VLPO inflammation, induced by local LPS infusion, in young rats produces sleep disturbance and immuno- histochemical changes in GABAergic neurons, that are typical of old age (experiment-5); and b) if chronic suppression of inflammation within the MnPN and VLPO, by focal infusion of minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia activity and a selective scavenger of peroxynitrite, reduces nitrosative stress in GABAergic neurons and improves sleep-wake organization and sleep continuity in aged rats (experiment-6).  The proposed research program is conceptually innovative and will generate novel and fundamental data about the functional status of the POAH sleep-regulatory systems in aging. A better understanding of how CNS aging affects sleep-regulatory systems and the mechanism by which inflammation pathologically affects sleep-wake function may contribute to the development of novel preventative and therapeutic options for optimizing sleep health in the elderly including Veterans."

"9329124","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Three-dimensional embryonic structures are patterned by coordinated cell movements and reorganization. Structural birth defects can arise by a number of cellular mechanisms, including genetic, epigenetic, and hormonal changes in the developing embryo. However, the ultimate cause of physical anomalies that arise during morphogenesis is atypical cell behavior. Studies in non-mammalian systems have revealed many conserved physical and molecular mechanisms driving embryonic cell reorganization, but important differences between organisms have also been described. Despite the central role that cell rearrangements play in embryonic development, the cellular and molecular events underlying planar polarized cell rearrangements in mammals are poorly understood.  Epithelial cells of the developing mouse embryo undergo dramatic structural changes during gastrulation which are important for shaping the final form of the body axis. These cells have a relatively simple morphology and are located on the surface of the embryo, where they are readily accessible for live imaging. These aspects of early epithelial development make this tissue uniquely well-suited for studying mammalian epithelial morphogenesis. To identify the mechanisms driving tissue shape changes during epithelial reorganization in the developing mouse embryo, cell biological and computational methods will be used to analyze changes in cell shape, topology, and polarity during this process. I will test the hypothesis that planar polarized actomyosin and cell adhesion activities are required for remodeling of the embryonic epithelium by quantifying the spatiotemporal localization of cytoskeletal, adhesive, and regulatory proteins. Candidate regulators of cell polarity will be investigated using genetic analysis. Live imaging methods using time-lapse confocal imaging on cultured mouse embryos will be applied to elucidate the cell behaviors that drive epithelial remodeling in real time in the developing mouse embryo, and individual cells will be tracked over time with single-cell resolution.  In addition to advancing our knowledge of tissue morphogenesis during early mouse embryonic development, the long-term goal of these studies is to inform our understanding of polarized cell behaviors in mammals and how they compare to those of other animals. Elucidating the mechanisms of epithelial remodeling in the mouse embryo has the potential to inform our understanding of the basic cell biological processes that drive embryonic development, especially during extensive reorganizations that shape tissues in the embryo. These findings are likely to uncover mechanisms of embryonic morphogenesis that are conserved among animals, from flies to mice, as well as processes that are unique to mammals. A richer understanding of polarized, coordinated cell behaviors in the mouse embryo has the potential to reveal conserved cellular and molecular processes that are affected in cases of congenital and acquired diseases that involve aberrant behaviors of large cell populations."

The short-term goal of the program is to recruit and train outstanding investigators in interdisciplinary women's health research, and the long-term goal is to build and sustain a viable pool of investigators with synergistic projects who will lead the translation of scientific finding into better health for women. In this renewal application, the focus of our program is sharpened, the strengths of the program are preserved, and several novel elements that were introduced during the current funding cycle are expanded. The training and mentoring of our scholars is provided by renowned basic, clinical, and translational scientists in a collegial and innovative academic environment in a patient-centered institution. Our scholars have achieved success in collaborative research activities, have obtained competitive funding, have publishing manuscripts, have receiving extramural leadership positions, and have engaged in transformational clinical initiatives. During the current funding cycle, we have introduced three innovations: 1) we developed closer and mutually beneficial ties with the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS; 1UL1RR024150) to support the educational component of our program; 2) we integrated our scholars into the Mayo Clinic Specialized Center of Research on Sex Differences (SCOR; AG044170) as a focus for research activities and opportunity for involvement in team science, where appropriate; and 3) we established a Regional BIRCWH Partnership consisting of the Mayo Clinic, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Wisconsin BIRCWH programs to broaden and extend opportunities for career development through colleagiality, collaboration, and mentoring. These three novel elements, built upon our core program, were designed to facilitate synergies with the Mayo Clinic CCaTS and with our neighboring BIRCWH programs. The research leadership at Mayo Clinic recognizes the importance of the BIRCWH program in fostering our institutional commitment to women's health, and will support one additional BIRCWH scholar during the next funding cycle (2015-2020). Each scholar will generally be enrolled for up to 3 years, and at any point in time, we will have funding to support 3 scholars (2 with NIH funding and 1 with Mayo funding). Our scholars will generally be junior faculty members with a doctoral degree (e.g., MD or PhD). These innovations and the strong institutional support distinguish our BIRCWH program from other programs in the country."
"9301432","PILOT AND EXPLORATORY STUDIES CORE - SUMMARY Within the context of the OAIC's overall mission, the Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) aims to provide catalytic support ? seed funding, core support, and mentorship - for innovative pilot research projects that generate data on the mechanisms of FPT action to facilitate more definitive mechanistic studies, feasibility data to guide efficacy trials, hypothesis generating or proof-of-concept exploratory studies and retrospective analysis of existing epidemiologic data that inform FPT interventions. The aims of this PESC are: Aim 1. To build a translational pipeline for early stage innovative and interdisciplinary research by providing funding and infrastructure for: ? Generation of proof-of-concept preclinical data to expedite the development of FPTs. ? Mechanistic studies for target identification or hypotheses building by which FPTs exert their effects on  skeletal muscle and physical function (e.g., PES-1). ? Pilot testing of translational interventions or research protocols in human subjects or animal models for  safety, feasibility, or determination of optimal time course or dosage (e.g., PES-2, PES-3). Aim 2: To build connectivity between PESC investigators and OAIC core resources. Aim 3: To monitor biannually and guide success of research projects by PESC investigators. Aim 4. To catalyze pilot and exploratory projects into high quality peer-reviewed publications, grant applications, and intellectual property/ patents, whenever possible. We selected 3 innovative studies for PESC support, from among a pool of 11 applications, because these studies are well aligned with the OAIC's mission of promoting the development of FPTs: PES-1 will characterize microRNAs in exercise and as biomarkers for anabolic response in aged adults. PES-2 will evaluate whether a home-based exercise program can improve functional outcomes in patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve replacement. PES-3 willl determine if transcranial brain stimulation can improve physical function in older adults. During its initial 5 years of funding, Boston OAIC supported 11 PES projects from 1 to 2.5 years. A $750,000 OAIC investment yielded $17.95 million in extramural funding, two patents, and 75 peer reviewed publications including papers in Aging Cell (Guo 2013, Jasuja 2014), a book on translational biology in medicine (Montano 2014, Elsevier Publishers), PNAS (Hettmer 2011), Circulation (Jefferson 2010) and NEJM (Basaria 2012). This PESC will be led by two scientists with complementary expertise and mentoring skills; Dr. Monty Montano, a translational scientist with expertise in muscle and aging; and, Dr. Douglas Kiel, a clinical investigator with expertise in musculoskeletal decline with aging and intervention trials of function promoting therapies."

"9385242","Project Summary Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) afflicts approximately 15% of the U.S. population over 55 years of age. After an initial asymptomatic period, patients with PAD typically develop intermittent claudication, which may eventually progress to critical limb ischemia and unrelenting pain, ulceration and amputation. Although exercise, smoking cessation, anti-platelet therapy, cilostazol, statins and revascularization can mitigate symptoms, almost a third of the patients with PAD continue to suffer from intermittent claudication that profoundly impairs their quality of life. Stem cell and progenitor cell (PC) therapy that promotes neoangiogenesis and revascularization is an emerging treatment modality in PAD. Granulocyte -macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates mobilization of hematopoietic and other PCs from the bone marrow. We have demonstrated in a Phase I dose-escalation trial and in a Phase IIA trial in patients with PAD and claudication that GM-CSF mobilizes PCs into the circulation, is safe and results in improvement in claudication. We now propose to investigate the effects of mobilization of bone marrow PCs with two successive administrations of subcutaneous GM-CSF at 3 month intervals in patients with atherosclerotic PAD and walking impairment. Our hypothesis is that GM-CSF will improve walking distance and quality of life in patients with PAD and walking impairment. We will measure improvement in the 6-minute walk test and in walking distance on the treadmill and after two administrations of GM-CSF, three months apart compared to placebo. As secondary outcomes, we will also investigate whether there is further improvement with two compared to single administration of GM-CSF, and whether there is concomitant improvement in quality of life parameters and ankle- brachial index."
"9332314","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of the CREON2000A for improving asthma control and preventing or reducing asthma events in children with mild to moderate allergic asthma. The patented CREON2000A device is being developed as an environmental control intervention that will serve as an adjunctive treatment of asthma. The compact energy efficient design allows the use of the device in 95% of homes built after 1994, and in 74% of all US homes. Based on this statistics, the CREON2000A intervention, if efficacious, could benefit the majority of children with asthma in the United States. The promising results of our preliminary SBIR Phase I study warrant further investigation of this device in a larger clinical trial. This clinical trial is designed asa Phase II, multicenter, twelve month, double blind, randomized, sham controlled, parallel group study. It compares improvement in asthma control, as measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire, in mild to moderate allergic persistent asthmatic children living in homes with a CREON2000A Irradiation system to those living in homes with sham units. Secondary endpoints of this trial are: morning peak expiratory flow rates, a reduction of total number of inhalation of rescue medications, asthma exacerbations, and missed days from school or work. The trial includes an exploratory objective designed to investigate whether CREON2000A's mechanism of action is related to protein structural changes by UV irradiation leading to the decreased allergenicity of indoor allergens. An interdisciplinary team of experienced, university and small business based researchers, with the necessary technical and clinical expertise has been assembled to investigate this potentially important asthma control intervention. The current approach for the management of asthma is very costly. In 2006, 8 billion dollars was spent treating childhood asthma. The annual cost per child for implementing multifaceted environmental control interventions, as recommended by the national asthma guidelines, ranges between $750 to $1,000 which is comparable to the annual cost of asthma medications. The necessity to modify behavior of parents, so they will maintain time-consuming and often expensive interventions, creates a significant barrier for adhering to these recommendations. The CREON2000A device requires minimal maintenance (i.e., changing bulb and small filter once a year) and, because it is simple to use, home occupants do not have to change their daily routines. For that reason, the acceptability and patient adherence with this intervention is excellent. The projected annual cost of this intervention including the amortization of the CREON2000A unit over 10 years is $244. Therefore, the application of this device and technology could optimize the medical management of asthma leading to a significant reduction in the costs associated with treating this chronic disease."
"9359611","The mechanism by which cell therapy improves cardiac function remains unclear. Although injected cells minimally differentiate into cardiomyocytes or vessels, and only a small fraction survive long term in the recipient, common beneficial effects are observed regardless of injected cell type: improvement in pump function, reduction of fibrosis, and enhanced angiogenesis. These results are consistent with the idea that cell therapy recruits endogenous repair mechanisms which, however, have not been identified. The immune system has been implicated in a variety of sterile diseases, including processes regulating myocardial damage and repair. Although unresolved inflammatory processes controlled by infiltrating and tissue-resident immune cells worsen heart failure, depletion of macrophages in the infarcted myocardium leads to LV rupture and death. Thus, immune cells appear to play diametrically opposite roles in the heart. Macrophages have been shown to be required for spontaneous regeneration of neonatal mammalian myocardium after injury, and recent findings implicate them as direct contributors to cell therapy-mediated myocardial repair. Nevertheless, how immune cells regulate myocardial repair and what determines their harmful versus salutary actions remains unknown. Furthermore, the impact of cell therapy on reparative immune cells has not yet been studied in the heart. Our preliminary data show that injection of cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMCs) into the infarcted heart promotes accumulation of reparative macrophages. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that CMCs facilitate recruitment of monocytes and activation of reparative macrophages, which are essential endogenous mediators of repair. By generating detailed flow cytometric analyses of immune cell populations following CMC administration, we will not only resolve the time course of immune cell recruitment, but also determine how inflammation is eventually extinguished in the heart after cell therapy. To elucidate the mechanism whereby CMCs regulate inflammatory processes in monocyte-derived macrophages, we will determine how these cells regulate NF?B-p65 subunit expression, with emphasis on horizontal transfer of miRNAs to macrophages through CMC-derived EVs. Finally, using macrophage genetic fate mapping and genetically modified CMCs, we will elucidate the role of monocyte-derived macrophages in CMC-induced myocardial repair. This project will be the first systematic analysis of how cell therapy modulates immune cells ? a mechanism that has been relatively understudied. The results will provide novel insights not only into the mechanisms regulating cell therapy-mediated myocardial repair, but also into how endogenous reparative activities of macrophages are recruited. We will also determine whether EVs recapitulate the salutary effects of CMCs on immune cells. Thus, these studies have far-reaching implications for our understanding of how the immune system regulates myocardial homeostasis in general."
"9339558","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and has the greatest estimated heritable risk of all common cancers. Despite this, the heritable component of familial prostate cancer has proven complex and the underlying genes have remained largely elusive. Common, small-effect variants identified through genome wide association studies of prevalent prostate cancer do not explain observed familial clustering. Numerous segregation analyses have consistently demonstrated that familial clustering of prostate cancer is best explained by the inheritance of uncommon, large-effect variants. Familial prostate cancer has an earlier age of onset, with risk of more advanced disease at a late diagnosis. While Mendelian forms of other common cancers are known, greater complexity is now believed to underlie familial prostate cancer. After two decades of effort using linkage approaches, current knowledge remains remarkably limited. This motivates our study to elucidate the genetics of familial prostate cancer with a unique study design that accommodates scenarios of genetic heterogeneity, phenocopies, epistasis, and incomplete penetrance. We hypothesize that men who develop prostate cancer and who have a family history of the disease inherit uncommon genetic risk variants in the setting of complex heritability. Such genetic alterations could span a range of effect sizes and frequency, from recurrent, moderate-effect (reduced penetrance) risk variants, to rare large-effect mutations. Our aims will identify potential causative deleterious genetic variants carried by familial cases. To better delineate the etiology of the disease, we will identify the underlying molecular pathways. We will also assess which of the identified prostate cancer genes predispose to prostate cancer at an earlier age, later stage, or greater Gleason score at diagnosis. As in other familial cancers, men with a concerning family history of prostate cancer could benefit from genetic testing, particularly in the era of personalized medicine. Our study will significantly advance the field and further develop predictive models to guide clinical care."

"9302271","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Lupus nephritis (LN) affects half of all systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Among African-American women, a growing demographic in the Veteran population, this disease leads to 50% renal failure rate by five years. Effective LN drug development is hindered by the heterogeneity mechanisms leading to LN. Endothelial cells act as a final common dampener on inflammatory responses of many types through the action of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) nitric oxide (NO). Lupus is characterized by dysfunction of these cells (endothelial cell dysfunction or ECD). This dysfunction leads to tissue inflammation such as proliferative lupus nephritis. Knowledge of mechanisms leading to ECD is essential to progress in developing novel and more broadly effective therapies for LN. Preliminary studies suggest that abnormal phosphorylation of eNOS at threonine 495 (Thr-495) and uncoupling of eNOS homodimers leads to ECD in SLE. The goal of this proposal is to define and target the common intracellular mechanisms leading to functional ECD and determine, in a discovery analysis, serum factors that signal for ECD in LN. To achieve this goal, the following aims are proposed: 1) Characterize intracellular pathways of eNOS dysfunction induced by SLE and LN ECD serum. We hypothesize that SLE serum induces ECD through the common final intracellular mechanisms of increased Thr-495 phosphorylation and eNOS dimer uncoupling. To address this hypothesis, serum samples from SLE, LN, and healthy control patients will be phenotyped for their ability to induce neutrophil migration and adhesion to cultured EC (in vitro ECD). eNOS and phospho eNOS protein expression and dimer coupling will be determined after culture with serum from these groups. 2) Assess the effect of agents that target pathways of eNOS dysfunction on SLE serum-induced in vitro ECD. We hypothesize that ECD induced by SLE serum can be reversed with agents designed to restore eNOS coupling, inhibit PKC-mediated Thr-495 phospho-eNOS or mimic eNOS NO. This aim will determine the ability of each of these approaches to restore endothelial function in cells cultured with ECD-inducing serum. Agents that target mechanism-based ECD will be added to culture with ECD-inducing SLE serum to test the effect on ECD. Pharmacodynamic markers will be used to determine optimal concentrations and mechanism-based action of each agent in association with the desired effect on EC function. 3) Discovery analysis of serum proteins and exosome lipids with differential expression in ECD serum. Preliminary studies suggest that lupus immunoglobulin fractions and exosomes induce ECD. Preliminary discovery analysis demonstrates that glycosphingolipids in exosomes associate with poor response to therapy. ECD and non-ECD LN, SLE, and control serum will be fractionated into exosome, immunoglobulin, and non-immunoglobulin, non-exosome fractions and tested for in vitro ECD- induction. Proteins unique to the above fractions that induce ECD will be determined by liquid chromatography and time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Exosome lipids unique to ECD serum will be assayed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Pathway analysis will suggest pathways of ECD among molecules identified from ECD fractions. This project will fill gaps in our knowledge of how ECD induces pathologic inflammatory infiltrates in SLE and accelerate targeted therapies for Veterans with SLE. This study could accelerate development of therapies for diseases with ECD such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetic renal disease in Veterans."

Pathogenic  autoantibodies and immune complexes ultimately exert their effects through cellular signal transduction to  impact gene expression. The central roles of specific transcription factors in driving immune cell fates, and  anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs that control gene expression - such as steroids,  cyclosporine A (CsA), and inhibitors of JAKs, lnterieukin-1 (IL-1), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), and B Cell  Activating Factor (BAFF) - suggest the importance of understanding gene regulation in autoimmunity. Rather  than simply observing changes in gene expression, recent epigenomic tools have made it possible to  determine the causality of gene expression, revealing the specific transcription factors and regulatory  elements driving different gene expression programs. However, existing experimental methods require 10  million cells or more per assay, and are complex and laborious to perform. These limitations have largely  kept epigenomic analyses out of the reach of the clinical studies of human diseases, including autoimmunity.  Here we propose to develop and apply a revolutionary new method called ATAC-Seq to map open chromatin  sites genome-wide, to enable facile and rapid epigenomic studies of patients with autoimmune diseases and  their response to treatments in real time. We will also explore the role of epigenetics in known genotypes of  SLE patients with single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes such as Tyk2, STAT4, and IRF5. The end result  will be a set of robust biomarkers and important biological insights into autoimmune and inflammatory  diseases. The long term goal of our studies is to include ATAC-Seq in the ACE Shared Research Agenda,  where it can be used by ACE investigators as part of their basic science projects, and as a mechanistic  assay in ACE clinical trials."

"9474868","The intestinal epithelium is one of the most rapidly renewing tissues in the body, and thus the ideal tissue to study somatic stem and progenitor cell biology. The small intestinal epithelium is composed of a single layer of cells that contains four major differentiated cell types as well as intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and progenitor or transit amplifying cells that replenish differentiated cells throughout life. While the past twenty years have seen great progress in our understanding of the signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators that control intestinal proliferation and differentiation, our understanding of the epigenetic factors that control these important processes is rather limited. Equally important is the identification of the intestinal stem cell niche, and the characterization of its function in molecular detail. To address this knowledge gap, I propose the following Specific Aims: In specific Aim 1, we will determine if Foxl1+ subepithelial telocytes are required for providing critical Wnt signals during gastrointestinal development and in R-spondin free enteroid culture. We will employ our newly developed genetic and molecular tools to determine the signaling pathways controlled by telocytes during intestinal development using mouse models. In Aim 2, we will investigate the contribution of polycomb complex mediated gene repression via histone H3K27 trimethylation on intestinal stem cell biology and regeneration. To this end, we will employ tissue and cell type specific gene ablation of two genes encoding critical H3K27me3 demethylases in the intestinal epithelium, both under homeostatic conditions and after ablation of Lgr5 stem cells. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Gastrointestinal cancer is a significant health problem, ranking fourth in incidence and second in death among cancers in the United States. Abnormal differentiation and increased proliferation of the intestinal epithelium are hallmarks of carcinogenesis. The molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation in gastrointestinal development are far from being understood completely. Therefore, we will analyze the impact of the intestinal stem cell niche cells on intestinal growth and function, and test the contribution of histone demethylation to intestinal health."
"9315156","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity, caused by excess calories stored as fat in white adipose tissue (WAT), is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes. The discovery of fat-burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility that BAT may be targeted to treat obesity and metabolic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) can function to convert WAT into a brown-like state, and they have been used as a remedy for diabetes, but their clinical use has been limited because of serious side effects. A molecular understanding of TZD action will lead to the development of efficacious yet lower-risk drugs for metabolic disorders. In our preliminary studies, we observed widespread co-transcriptional splicing in nascent RNAs (GROseq). We found that TZDs regulate co-transcriptional splicing as well as the transcription levels of splicesomal genes. Interestingly, genes with altered co-transcriptional splicing ratios were associated with browning effect and PPAR signaling pathway. Based on these observations, we propose to study alternative splicing regulated by TZDs and determine the association with insulin sensitivity. Also, we recently found that TZDs re-distribute Med1 occupancy, a subunit of the Mediator. Interestingly, Med23, another subunit of the Mediator, regulates alternative splicing. Based on these observations, we aim to study if the mediator redistribution is associated with alternative splicing. Moreover, we further aim to study RNA stability by integrating nascent RNA (GROseq) and steady-state RNA (RNAseq). Isoforms spliced differently have different half-lives. Using a systematic way to integrate transcriptomic data we will investigate if TZDs regulate RNA stability. Our innovative approach to use nascent and steady-state RNAs will enhance our understanding of TZDs by fully exploiting the transcriptomic landscapes. The comprehensive nature of our study will reveal previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms of TZDs in regulating alternative splicing and RNA stability. Our study will lead us to the identification of efficacious, low-risk drug targets fr the metabolic disorders that pervade society."
"9358017","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Antibodies against specific proteins can be generated as an agonist to activate the receptor or an antagonist to block the function of the molecule. Similarly, an Fc fusion protein consisting of the ectodomain of a given protein can serve as blocking reagent to disrupt signaling events downstream of its ligand. By contrast, a fusion protein consisting of the ligand for a receptor of interest will function to stimulate receptor-mediated signaling. Both antibodies and Fc fusion proteins are unique reagents and have been proven to be a powerful tools to facilitate innovative research in many fields and some have proven to be potent immunomodulatory reagents to treat human autoimmune diseases and cancers. We have well-established platforms for both antibody and Fc fusion protein generation, production, purification, quality control, and functional characterization. We have been successful in our effort to create and characterize a panel of monoclonal antibodies and Fc fusion proteins. The antibodies that we have made include anti-mouse and human CTLA-4, CD94, CD226, TIGIT, Tim-2, Tim-3 and Tim-4, and the Fc fusion proteins that we have made include CTLA4/Fc, PD-1/Fc, Tim-1/Fc, Tim-3/Fc, Tim-4/Fc. Some of these antibodies have been made, purified, and provided to PPG investigators for their work. In addition to these antibodies, we have generated a panel of rear earth metal-labelled monclonal antibodies for use in CyTOF, with qualified CyTOF staining protocols. These reagents facilitated innovative research by PPG investigators and led to a series of important publications. The panel of well qualified custom made antibodies, fusion proteins and CyTOF reagents will ensure progress of each of the research projects. Based on the well established techniques for monoclonal antibody and Fc fusion protein generation in Dr. Kuchroo's lab, we aim to established an antibody and fusion protein core at Ann Rommey Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital to facilitate antibody generation and production for the needs of this PPG. The core leader has an excellent record working on therapeutic antibody and Fc fusion protein generation, assay development, production and purfication with 25 years of experience. He has been working on generation of monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins to a number of cell surface targets. His recent efforts has led to the generation of monoclonal antibodies to mouse and human Tim proteins and other immunoregulatory molecules including TIGIT expressed on the surface of T cells. The goal of this antibody and fusion protein core is to generate novel monoclonal antibodies and Fc fusion proteins for this PPG. We will also collaborate with PPG project leaders for antibody screenings and characterizations. In addition, the core will produce and purify the antibodies that were previously generated by PPG investigators for the needs of the proposed studies. While the antibodies and Fc fusion proteins produced by the core will not be manufactured in a GMP facility, the cell lines used for production will meet FDA standards. Thus it will be possible to easily progress for use in clinic in the future."
"9322558","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the rapidly increasing capacity to sequence human genomes, our incomplete ability to read and interpret the information content in genomes and epigenomes remain a central challenge. A comprehensive set of regulatory events across a genome - the regulome - is needed to make full use of genomic information, but is currently out of reach for practically all clinical applications and many biological systems The proposed Center will develop technologies that greatly increase the sensitivity, speed, and comprehensiveness of understanding genome regulation. We will develop new technologies to interrogate the transactions between the genome and regulatory factors, such as proteins and noncoding RNAs, and integrate variations in DNA sequences and chromatin states over time and across individuals. Novel molecular engineering and biosensor strategies are deployed to encapsulate the desired complex DNA transformations into the probe system, such that the probe system can be directly used on very small human clinical samples and capture genome-wide information in one or two steps. These technologies will be applied to clinical samples and workflows in real time to exercise their robustness and reveal for the first time epigenomic dynamics of human diseases during progression and treatment. These technologies will be broadly applicable to many biomedical investigations, and the Center will disseminate the technologies via training and diverse means."
"9339503","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Age-related skeletal muscle atrophy, also known as sarcopenia, diminishes the health and quality of life of many Veteran patients. However, the molecular mechanisms of age-related muscle atrophy are poorly understood, and a pharmacologic therapy does not exist. As a result, many elderly Veterans suffer the consequences of muscle atrophy, including weakness, falls, debilitation, and loss of independence. This places enormous burdens on elderly Veterans, their families, and society in general. Our long-term goal is to understand molecular mechanisms of age-related muscle atrophy, and then use that information to develop a therapy. In the previous grant cycle, we discovered Gadd45a and p21 as critical mediators of a novel molecular pathway to skeletal muscle atrophy. Aging, as well as other causes of muscle atrophy, strongly induce Gadd45a mRNA in skeletal muscle of humans, mice and rats. This increases the level of Gadd45a protein, which in turn increases p21 mRNA. As a result, the level of p21 protein rises and triggers many of the critical changes that occur during age-related skeletal muscle atrophy, including loss of protein and mitochondria, and ultimately, muscle fiber atrophy. Collectively, these results strongly suggest a key role for the Gadd45a/p21 pathway in age-related muscle atrophy. However, these data also elucidate several important areas for further investigation. For example, our data indicate that the sequential induction of Gadd45a and p21 plays a central role in skeletal muscle atrophy; but we do not yet know how aging increases skeletal muscle Gadd45a expression, or how Gadd45a increases p21 expression. In addition, our data suggest the Gadd45a/p21 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in age-related skeletal muscle atrophy; but this hypothesis has not yet been tested. To resolve these important issues, we propose three specific aims, all using mouse models. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that two transcription factors (p53 and ATF4) are responsible for increasing Gadd45a mRNAs during skeletal muscle aging. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that two Gadd45a-interacting proteins (MEKK4 and LRRC14) play key roles in Gadd45a-mediated p21 expression. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that reducing Gadd45a and/or p21 permits recovery of skeletal muscle mitochondria and muscle fiber size in aged, atrophic muscle. Through these studies, we hope to elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches for age-related muscle atrophy, a disabling condition that affects many Veteran patients."

"9339570","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cigarette smoking is an important cause of vascular and pulmonary morbidity and mortality and is increased among veterans. Both systemic and pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) injuries are important consequences of Cigarette Smoke (CS) exposure. CS is associated with an increased incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), with the hallmark of increased endothelial permeability. Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that CS increases lung vascular permeability in mice and in cultured lung vascular EC; an effect involving decreased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and RhoA GTPase activation. However, the components of CS involved in this injury are unknown. Acrolein is a highly reactive a, ß- unsaturated aldehyde that is present in CS and in exhaled breath condensates and blood of smokers. Our preliminary data indicate that acrolein, like CS, increases lung vascular EC permeability in vivo and in vitro; disrupts actin stress fibers, adherens junctions, and focal adhesion complexes; and decreases RhoA and FAK activation. CS- and acrolein-induced lung endothelial injury is prevented by inhibition of aldehyde stress in vivo and in vitro. Our Overall Objective is to understand the mechanism of CS-induced lung endothelial cell dysfunction. We hypothesize that acrolein mediates CS-induced EC dysfunction resulting in increased permeability pulmonary edema via carbonylation of RhoA and FAK in lung endothelial cells. Aim 1. We will determine: The effects of acrolein on lung microvascular barrier function in vivo and in vitro, including: a. The effects f acrolein on mouse lung microvascular permeability. b. The effects of acrolein on RhoA and FAK carbonylation and inactivation and the mechanism(s) of these changes. c. If inhibition of protein carbonylation attenuates CS- and acrolein-induced increased vascular permeability in vivo and in cultured lung EC. Circulating extracellular vesicles (EV) bearing EC surface markers have been isolated from plasma of smokers and our preliminary data indicate that there are increased circulating EV in plasma of mice exposed to CS. Our preliminary data show that EV isolated from EC treated with acrolein significantly increased EC permeability, compared to EV isolated from EC treated with vehicle. Therefore, we also hypothesize that acrolein in CS decreases lung endothelial barrier function via EV. Aim 2. We will determine the role of circulating and lung EV in CS- and acrolein-induced lung injury, including: a. Characterization of formation of EV in response to CS and acrolein exposure. b. The effects of circulating and lung EV from CS- or acrolein-exposed mice on lung EC barrier function in healthy mice and in cultured mouse lung microvascular EC (LMVEC). c. The effect of EV isolated from CS- or acrolein-exposed LMVEC on carbonylation and activities of RhoA and FAK in unexposed LMVEC and in purified proteins. d. If inhibition of protein carbonylation prevents lung vascular injury caused by EV from CS- or acrolein-exposed mice. These studies will comprehensively assess the effects of acrolein on lung EC and EV and their roles in CS-induced lung vascular permeability. Better understanding of CS-induced lung EC injury is likely to enhance understanding of both ARDS and more chronic CS-induced diseases that may involve endothelial injury, such as COPD."
"9355688","Our project highlights one of the primary areas of research within the Kansas Intellectual and Developmental Research Center? language and communication. Specifically, we focus on language and communication in children with autism and minimal verbal skills (less than 20 spoken words). Remaining nonverbal past the age of 5 years has been considered a poor prognostic indicator for future language developments (Picket et al., 2009), yet few interventions have been developed to address this problem. The Specific Aims for this project are (1) to further investigate a multimodal intervention for school-age children with minimal verbal skills? defined as less than 20 words spontaneously spoken, signed, or selected via graphic symbol selection?and (2) to identify significant covariates associated with differential responding to the intervention. The research addresses an unmet need to promote spoken word production in children who remain essentially nonverbal well past the ages associated with speech acquisition. The project is also innovative because: a) it investigates a multimodal intervention based on principles of phonotactic probability and neighborhood density in combination with augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), and b) it investigates novel predictors of treatment response that are obtained through cutting-edge technologies. We propose that this intervention will have better success than past interventions because we will provide increased input through speech, digitized speech and visual images and additional speech sound practice for words that are comprised of high frequency sounds in the child?s repertoire. Extant speech sounds in each participant?s repertoire will be identified using LENA digitized recordings. Vocabulary words will then be selected based on a child?s speech sound repertoire and principles of word learning?words with high probability speech sound sequences will be selected and taught with either our multimodal intervention or a treatment as usual condition. Responses to these interventions will be evaluated using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART) design. We propose that different outcomes will be associated with individual and environmental predictors identified in our previous research. Individual predictors include verbal comprehension, imitation skills, adaptive behavior, nonverbal speech sound repertoire, and communication complexity. Communication complexity will be measured with the Communication Complexity Scale (CCS), developed by the Principal Investigator. Environmental predictors include language input to the child as measured with LENA recording devices. Results will determine if our multimodal intervention is more successful than treatment as usual for teaching word productions, but will also identify the individual and environmental profiles associated with differential outcomes. Our discoveries will lead to more focused clinical trial research and will inform customized intervention practices in schools and clinics. Ultimately this line of research aims to improve the lives of children with autism and their families through enhanced communication skills."
"9339542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Spinal cord injury (SCI) is often followed by the development of debilitating spasms in the muscles innervated from the spinal cord below the site of injury. More than 80% of individuals with SCI have spasms and spasticity that significantly disrupt residual motor function, cause debilitating pain, and interrupt sleep. Treatment of spasms with conventional antispastic drugs (e.g., baclofen) is often not adequate, or not tolerated because of adverse side effects such as lethargy and weakness.  Serotonin (5-HT), the brain stem-derived neurotransmitter, serves a critical role in tuning the excitability of the spinal motoneurons by facilitating persistent calcim currents (Ca2+ PICs) that amplify and prolong responses to synaptic input. When SCI eliminates this major source of 5-HT, spinal motoneurons are initially left in a depressed state and are not able to produce adequate muscle contractions. Over the weeks after injury, however, Ca2+ PICs in spinal motoneurons spontaneously recover, helping with restoration of rudimentary motor functions, but also contributing to spasms. Recently, Dr. David Bennett and his colleagues showed that the recovery of Ca2+ PICs is afforded by a molecular mechanism called RNA editing. Months after SCI, there are alterations in mRNA editing of one of the serotonin receptors (2C receptor or 5-HT2CR), which lead to increased expression of the 5-HT2CR isoforms that are active without 5-HT. Such constitutive receptor activity coincides with a restoration of large Ca2+ PICs in the motoneurons of the injured rats.  Editing is catalyzed by specific enzymes-adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR1 and ADAR2), whose regulation is poorly understood. Most of them encode receptors or channels (e.g., 5-HT2CR, ionotropic glutamate receptors, Kv1.1 potassium and Cav1 calcium channels) that are expressed in the neuronal cells throughout the brain and spinal cord. Editing of these molecules modulates their Ca2+ permeability and kinetics, thus influencing intrinsic excitability of neurons. In our preliminary studies we found that SCI-induced 5-HT2CR editing changes are related to downregulation of ADAR2 (but not ADAR1) mRNA expression in SCI vs. control animals. We, therefore, hypothesize that, in addition to 5-HT2CR, SCI triggers editing changes in other receptors and channels whose mRNA is edited by ADAR2, which collectively contribute to the recovery of motorneuron excitability and the concurring development of spasticity. We also hypothesize that downregulation of ADAR2 is mediated by specific regulatory pathways that can be identified by screening the global transcriptional response to SCI using genome-wide sequencing and novel bioinformatics tools. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Aims:  Specific Aim 1: To investigate if RNA editing of AMPA and kainate glutamate receptors, voltage gated potassium channel Kv1.1, and/or L-type calcium channel Cav1 is altered in the spinal cord of SCI animals.  Specific Aim 2: To identify networks, pathways, and individual molecules that regulate downregulation of ADAR2 following SCI. We will use genome-wide transcriptome sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) in order to investigate ADAR2 transcriptional control and its alteration following SCI.  Specific Aim 3: To identify SCI-induced alterations in editing and ADAR2-related regulation that are specific for motoneurons. While studies in Aims 1 and 2 will be performed in whole spinal cord preparation, the experiments proposed in this Aim will use laser microdissected spinal motoneurons.  To summarize, the proposed research will identify ADAR2 substrates whose editing is altered by SCI as well as identify regulators of ADAR2 expression and function. These studies will advance our understanding of the neuropathology of SCI and spasticity. Most importantly, they will suggest possible targets for the development of novel antispastic drug therapy."
"9325521","Project Summary: The proposed University of Utah School of Medicine (UUSM) Cooperative Hematology Specialized Core Center (CHSCC) brings together 22 investigators whose research activities are focused on various aspects of iron and heme metabolism and non-malignant hematology. Iron plays an essential role in many biological processes including heme synthesis, oxygen transport, cellular respiration and DNA synthesis. Malregulation of iron homeostasis, either from deficiency or excess, results in disease. Heme is a key component of hemoglobin and other hemoproteins, but heme also plays a regulatory role in a number of metabolic pathways. Disorders of heme biosynthesis are responsible for an important group of human diseases, namely the porphyrias. The proposed Utah Center for Iron and Heme Disorders (CIHD) will support the activities of 22 investigators whose research projects focus on the roles of iron, porphyrins and heme in eukaryotic metabolism. The activities of center members encompass both basic and clinical studies designed to identify disease mechanisms. To accomplish our goals, we propose to provide an Administrative Core and four Biomedical Research Cores. The majority of the cores are already present and have been adjusted to the needs of the CIHD. These include: a Mutation Generation and Detection Core, which provides cutting edge genome editing through CRISPR and TALEN reagents; a Zebrafish Core, in which conditions have been optimized to generate zebrafish with engineered genomes for both gene discovery and genetic and chemical screens; a Metabolomics Core, which provides metabolomic phenotyping and molecular identification; and an Iron and Heme Core, which can assay and quantitate metals, porphyrins, heme biosynthetic enzymes and iron-binding and other proteins. The services provided by these cores will enable individual investigators to: 1) identify the role of genes in hematopoiesis or iron overload; 2) determine the effects of gene modification or mutations on metabolism in cultured cells or biological fluids; and 3) identify on a biochemical level the effect of mutations or treatments on heme synthesis on levels ranging from gene to protein to products. The Administrative Core will provide budgetary and scientific guidance to CIHD activities. Core recharge fees will be used to enhance and expand Core operations. The Pilot & Feasibility (P&F) and Enrichment Programs are designed for trainees and young investigators in the fields of nonmalignant hematology and for senior investigators who wish to enter this field. The 22 members of the CIHD are drawn from both the University of Utah and other institutions, with half of the members belonging to institutions outside of Utah. The goals of the CIHD are to be a national resource for studies involving iron and heme and to inspire the next generation of investigators focused on iron, heme and nonmalignant hematology."
"9306869","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will bring together expertise in computational and experimental neuroscience, signal processing and network science, statistics, modeling and simulation, to establish innovative methods to model and analyze temporally dynamic brain networks, and to apply these tools to develop predictive models of brain-computer interface (BCI) skill acquisition that can be used to improve performance. Leveraging experimental data and interdisciplinary theoretical techniques, this project will characterize brain networks at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and will develop models to predict the ability to control the BCI as well as methods to engineer BCI frameworks for adapting to neural plasticity. This project will enable a comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms of BCI learning, and will foster the design of viable BCI frameworks that improve usability and performance.        Intellectual Merit: As a critical innovation, this project proposes to develop a systematic and rigorous approach based on neuroimaging techniques, signal processing, and network science for the modeling and analysis of temporally dynamic neural processes that characterize BCI skill learning.  To achieve these goals, we will organize our research around the following objectives: (i) characterizing multiple spatio-temporal scales of dynamic functional brain networks, (ii) modeling BCI skill acquisition and predicting performance from brain network properties, (iii) simulating coadaptive BCI frameworks using dynamic network-based neural features. Results will first be characterized from pure graph-theoretic and neuroscience perspectives, so as to highlight fundamental research challenges, and then validated to clarify the importance and the applicability of our findings to translational efforts in practical BCI scenarios.  Our results wil (i) unveil multi-resolution properties of dynamic brain networks, (ii) identify predictive neuromarkers for BCI learning, and ultimately (iii) inform the development of coadaptive BCI frameworks sensitive to subject-specific neural plasticity.  The two young PIs - one from the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania and one from the ARAMIS team of the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA) located at the Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle epiniere (ICM) in Paris - bring complementary and interdisciplinary backgrounds to this research project, with a strong track record in network analysis, network neuroscience, multimodal neuroimaging and BCI applications.  Their experience and resources will enable the success of this new approach to analyze dynamic networks in BCI learning, design co-adaptive BCI frameworks, and facilitate the use of non-invasive BCI technology for both control of external devices (e.g. neuroprosthetics) as well as neurofeedback applications (e.g. MI-based neurorehabilitation after stroke).        Broader Impacts: This interdisciplinary project proposes a transformative approach to analyze large-scale neural systems, and to model and predict BCI skill acquisition. This research provides novel insights into the temporal interconnection structure of the human brain, and proposes entirely new methods to construct dynamic network-based models of neural plasticity from multimodal neuroimaging data. Results will foster the development of innovative predictive neuromarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders and psychiatric disease. The PIs will bring their findings and innovative techniques to the undergrad and graduate programs at their institutions, disseminate findings via dedicated courses, workshops, and publications, and to the community and local middle/highschools via lectures and STEAM outreach events."
"9547084","?    DESCRIPTION: Post-integration viral latency is a major barrier to eradicating HIV-1 infection. The current theoretical paradigm for eliminating the viral reservoir is known as `Shock and Kill', reactivation of latent virus using non-targeted small molecules. Key hurdles to this approach have recently emerged such as inefficient and/or stochastic viral reactivation, avoidance of global T-cell activation, and limited cellular death upon re-activation. It is also becoming apparent that our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HIV latency are fragmentary and in particular the relevance of drugs of abuse on the initiation and maintenance of HIV latency.  Here, we propose to explore on a genomic scale the landscape of cellular factors that regulate HIV latency establishment and maintenance and their relationship to drugs of abuse. Our exploration will be based on validating a recently completed genome scale shRNA screen for genes that control latency maintenance and reactivation. We propose to expand this screen using the novel CRISPR-Cas9 technology based on targeting via a guide RNA fusion proteins that either activate (CRISRa) or inhibit (CRISPRi) gene expression. These screens will focus on the mTOR pathway and on methamphetamine as we have recently uncovered evidence that they may act independently or together to modulate the reactivation of latent HIV. We will validate and mechanistically explore both pathways and other top hits in primary CD4 T cells and in cells from HIV-infected patients. We also propose to further develop and exploit new dual-fluorescence reporter HIV-1 genomes to identify, quantify, and purify latently infected cells in their native state, without inducing viral reactivation. This new latency model will allow us to study the effect of drugs of abuse, particularly methamphetamine, on the establishment and maintenance of latency in primary human lymphoid cells and to study the very earliest mechanisms of HIV-1 latency establishment. By combining the power of our dual-labeled latency model with high-resolution single-cell systems-biology techniques, we are uniquely suited to map out the cellular regulatory networks that control HIV latency and the role of drugs of abuse in this process."
"9542539","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a re-submission of a K23 award for Susan Meffert MD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at UCSF. This career award proposal builds on Dr. Meffert's research with emotionally traumatized populations in Low-and-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) and proposes research and training goals to focus her work on HIV-infected (HIV+) women exposed to Gender-Based Violence (GBV) (HIV+GBV+). Despite knowledge that GBV has profound adverse effects on physical health (exceeding direct injury),1-4 and that GBV is highly prevalent among HIV+ women,5,6 little is known about how GBV affects HIV outcomes. In cross sectional analysis, GBV is associated with detectable viral load (VL) and decreased CD4 count.7 Mental health sequeale of GBV, including Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression, are theorized mediators of the relationships between violence, HAART adherence and poor HIV outcomes.7,8 However, without a data-driven understanding of these relationships, we are unable to develop psychiatric treatments that effectively improve the overall health of the extraordinary numbers of HIV+ women exposed to GBV. The proposal addresses this crucial knowledge gap using a large longitudinal cohort study of HIV+ women and a pilot intervention with HIV+GBV+ women in a high burden region. Mentored by internationally recognized scientists, I propose three research aims: Aim 1 is a longitudinal analysis of GBV, HIV outcomes and mental health mediators in the largest prospective cohort study of HIV- affected women (Women's Interagency HIV Study [WIHS]). My co-mentor, Ruth Greenblatt, MD, is the N. California PI for the WIHS study. Building on my work with the UCSF-Family AIDS Care Education and Services (FACES) program in a high HIV region of Kenya, Aim 2 is an adaptation of an established mental health treatment (Interpersonal Psychotherapy [IPT]) for depression and PTSD among HIV+GBV+ women at FACES. Aim 3 is a pilot study assessing feasibility and acceptability of the adapted IPT. UCSF-FACES is a PEPFAR-funded care and research collaboration serving more than 90,000 HIV+ individuals in western Kenya. FACES has robust research infrastructure and I have an established, highly productive research team onsite. This proposal is significant because it will generate the first longitudinal analysis of GBV, HIV outcomes and mental disorders, and the first mental health intervention adapted and piloted for HIV+GBV+ women. These studies may substantially improve women's HIV programs by addressing a largely untapped mental health pathway affecting HIV outcomes among GBV+ women and developing/piloting a psychiatric treatment for HIV+GBV+ women. These research aims are tightly integrated with my training goals: (1) Longitudinal analytic methods in HIV; (2) IPT adaptation and (3) Mental health intervention research. These studies will generate preliminary findings for an R01-funded intervention testing the efficacy of adapted IPT for the effects of GBV on psychiatric and HIV outcomes."

"9326758","Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to enable the development of more effective treatments for presbyopia, the loss of near vision with age, by providing new insight into the mechanism behind presbyopia. The prevailing theory suggests that presbyopia is due mainly to age-related changes in the stiffness of the lens, but alternative theories have been proposed suggesting that age-related changes in the ciliary muscle may play a significant role. Age-related changes in the function of the ciliary muscle have been difficult to characterize in vivo due to the lack of suitable clinical imaging technology. The project will address two critical barriers in presbyopia research: a) the lack of methods to accurately quantify the response of the ciliary muscle during accommodation and b) the lack of knowledge of age-related changes to the behavior of the ciliary muscle as it accommodates. The project has two specific aims: Aim 1: Develop computational tools to quantify accommodative response from OCT images of the ciliary muscle We will develop computational tools to segment the ciliary muscle boundary from OCT images and to model and quantify the segmented ciliary muscle contour and its changes with accommodation. Aim 2: Characterize age-dependence of the accommodative dynamics of the ciliary muscle We will image the response of the ciliary muscle during accommodation in 40 subjects from ages 20 to 60. The dynamics of the ciliary muscle during accommodation will be measured using the computational tools developed in Aim 1 and compared as a function of age. The project will produce a new method to quantify the response of the ciliary muscle, which will significantly advance our capability to characterize ciliary muscle function. The project will also extend our understanding of age-related changes to the function of the ciliary muscle, which will help clarify the role of the ciliary muscle in presbyopia. The results of this project will be important towards improving treatments for presbyopia that are currently under development, since they will provide new ways to evaluate treatment efficacy and enhance our understanding of how age-related changes in ciliary muscle function impact treatment outcome."
"9481657","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A large genome-wide association study identified a common non-coding, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3129882, which was significantly associated with risk for late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Individuals homozygous for the risk allele (GG) have a 1.7 fold higher risk for PD than homozygous individuals with the low risk allele (AA). rs3129882 is located in the first intron of the Major Histocompatibility Complex class  II (MHC-II) Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DRA gene, providing the first genetic link between PD and this critical immune system locus. The conundrum introduced by this study was the fact that HLA-DRA is monomorphic and the polymorphic HLA genes were not found to be associated with PD in this study, suggesting that a protein coding polymorphism is unlikely to be the causative genetic lesion. Instead, we suggest the novel hypothesis that rs3129882 is linked to a novel regulatory element that alters the expression of the locus in antigen presenting cells that reside in and/or infiltrate into the brain, such that there is an increased risk for disease following an inflammatory event. Indeed, HLA-DR-expressing microglia, CD4+ T cells, and anti-CNS protein antibodies have been reported in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients, supporting a role for adaptive immune responses in PD disease progression. We additionally posit that changes in genetic and/or epigenetic regulation of MHC-II genes could be linked to rs3129882 and explain the stochastic and sporadic nature of this disease. Preliminary studies revealed that IFN??treated monocytes from GG individuals with PD co-express HLA-DR and HLA-DQ proteins to a higher degree than monocytes from AA individuals irrespective of disease state. Furthermore, in response to IFN?, GG monocytes expressed up to 300-fold higher levels of both DR and DQ mRNAs than AA cells. Thus, the high risk, GG genotype, is associated with increased levels of MHC-II mRNA and protein. Identification of a direct linkage of rs3129882 to a regulatory mechanism would provide a specific target for neuroimmune modulation and novel therapy to delay, prevent, or attenuate disease. To provide a scientific basis for pursuing treatments to target MHC-II expression and this pathway, we propose to determine the regulatory bases for rs3129882 association with PD and determine a causal role for MHC-II aberrant expression and PD-like neuropathology in a model system through the following specific aims: Aim 1, Determine the extent to which MHCII expression and T-cell subset frequency are influenced by rs3129882 genotype; Aim 2, Identify the molecular bases for rs3129882-related changes in gene expression; and Aim 3, Determine the extent to which modulation of myeloid-specific (including microglia) MHC-II expression determines vulnerability to rAAV-human ?-synuclein-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Together, these analyses will elucidate the molecular mechanism for understanding this important genetic association and potentially provide novel therapies for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases where inflammation plays a role."
"9371941","ABSTRACT Cancer risks associated with the use of smokeless tobacco (SLT) products worldwide vary drastically. There is a critical need to better understand SLT carcinogenesis, and which chemical constituents and/or product characteristics drive the risk of cancer development in SLT users. India has a unique tobacco burden profile and represents both an area of critical need and unique setting for such studies. Nearly one third of the population in India is using various forms of SLT, exceeding the prevalence of smoking. This is accompanied by high rates of oral and head and neck cancer (OHNC), which is strongly associated with SLT use and is a leading cause of cancer-related death in India. The goal of our proposal is to investigate the relationship between carcinogen content in SLT products and relevant exposures as well as OHNC risk in users of these products, while concurrently building capacity for a sustainable tobacco carcinogenesis research program in India. We will focus on the tobacco-specific nitrosamines N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4- (methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). Our first aim will be to determine the variation of NNN and NNK in SLT products currently available in Mumbai including a wide range of both manufactured and cottage-made products. Our second aim will be to examine the relationship between NNN and NNK levels in SLT products and the levels of corresponding biomarkers in users of these products. In this aim, we will assess biomarkers of exposure in 300 users of SLT products with differing NNN and NNK content, as established in Aim 1. In our third aim, we will compare levels of urinary NNN and NNK biomarkers between SLT users with and without OHNC. Together, these studies we will generate important insights into the role of NNN and NNK in SLT carcinogenesis in India. While substantial work has been carried out by the Indian public health research and advocacy community to generate valuable knowledge on SLT use, perceptions, and epidemiology, biomarker-based studies of tobacco carcinogen exposure and cancer risk have never been conducted in India. Our research team is uniquely positioned to initiate this research, as it will leverage our collaborative partnership with clinicians and scientists at Tata Memorial Hospital and its affiliated Advanced Center for Training, Research and Education in Cancer in Mumbai. In addition to generating novel scientific data, this study will incorporate capacity building activities that are closely linked to the Specific Aims and include the development of analytical laboratory capacity, training of young investigators from Mumbai in tobacco research procedures, and establishment of tobacco product and biospecimen repositories for future research."

"9359610","The therapeutic benefits of cell-based treatments have often been regarded as modest, borderline, or nil. As a result, clinical translation has not occurred, and considerable uncertainty and skepticism surround the concept of cell therapy. A major factor limiting the benefits of cell therapy (regardless of cell type) is the poor engraftment of the cells, which disappear rapidly after transplantation; because of this, we propose that administering one dose of cells cannot be considered an adequate test of efficacy. However, almost all preclinical and clinical studies of cell therapy performed heretofore have based their assessment of efficacy on the outcome of one cell administration. Our work in the current PPG has shown that 3 doses of c-kitPOS cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) are strikingly (~3 times) more effective than 1 dose in improving LV function. Building on this prior work, we will test the idea that the problem of poor engraftment can be overcome by repeated cell administrations. We have recently discovered a new population of cells, cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMCs), that appear to be more suitable for widespread use and to have greater therapeutic potential than CPCs. Consequently, we will focus this proposal on CMCs. The overall goal of Project 1 is to thoroughly evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and mechanism of action of repeated doses of CMCs. Our central hypothesis is that repeated administrations of CMCs dramatically increase the beneficial effects of cell therapy not only in mice but also in large, preclinical animal models (pigs) and in the presence of major co-morbidities (diabetes) via mechanisms that involve the cumulative effects elicited by repetitive bursts of extracellular vesicle (EV) release, resulting in cumulative, favorable modulation of the inflammatory and fibrotic response to CMC transplantation. The specific Aims are: 1) To establish the most effective protocols for administering repeated doses of CMCs or CMC-derived EVs. We will determine how the effects of repeated doses can be maximized by varying the number of doses and the interval between doses, and the impact of diabetes. 2) To generate data necessary for Phase I clinical trials of repeated CMC or EV therapy in patients with heart failure. Using a preclinical porcine model, we will assess the effects of repeated administrations of CMCs or EVs and identify the optimal doses. 3) To elucidate the mechanism of action of repeated doses of CMCs and EVs, including their effect on the inflammatory and fibroblast response to infarction. Throughout these studies, the effects of EVs will be compared with those of CMCs to determine whether cell-free EV therapy recapitulates the benefits of CMC therapy. This Project will test two potentially disruptive ideas: i) the concept that the full effects of cell or EV therapy require repeated doses would constitute a major paradigm shift, with potentially vast implications for the entire field of reparative medicine; ii) the concept that the effects of cell therapy can be reproduced with cell-free administration of EVs would revolutionize the field. These studies will lay the groundwork necessary for first-in-human trials of repeated CMC/EV administration."

"9339480","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Glucocorticoids are the most common cause of nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the hip, a crippling disorder that often leads to total hip replacement. Osteonecrosis, the in situ death of a segment of bone, develops in up to 40% of patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids, especially after the administration of intensive parenteral courses. Although the pathology of the end-stage disease has been partially described, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis remain unidentified and there is little consensus on optimal intervention strategies. This is because the sequential pathological changes in clinically asymptomatic patients are unknown and an animal model that replicates the progression of the human disorder is absent.  Glucocorticoid therapy causes a decline in bone strength that surpasses the decline in bone density, but the mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unknown. Although it is widely appreciated that bone is composed of cells, mineral and collagen, it is seldom realized that water is another major component accounting for more than one fourth of the wet weight of bone. Fracture resistance of hard tissues is defective without water and water confers to bone much of its unique strength and resilience. The objective of this proposal is to use a murine model of osteonecrosis of the femoral head to determine whether glucocorticoid- induced deterioration of bone water and vascularity may account for the disproportionately greater decline in bone strength than in bone mass typical of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis and whether the bone strength and vascularity may be compromised through the direct actions of glucocorticoids on osteocytes. Studies aimed at the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis and investigation of potential preventative therapy would increase motivation to protect the hip as early as possible.  We hypothesize that glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head is primarily due to adverse effects on femoral head osteocytes because of reduced bone vascularity and canalicular fluid. To achieve this goal, osteocytes in transgenic mice will be shielded from administered glucocorticoids to determine if these animals are protected from osteonecrosis. In addition, mice expressing a hypersensitive glucocorticoid receptor in osteocytes will be examined to determine if osteonecrosis is exaggerated. Next, the impact of the administration of alendronate or intermittent PTH to prevent glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis will be examined. The studies proposed in this application are timely and by capitalizing on modern concepts and innovative methodology offer the opportunity for new insights that are sorely needed for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced bone disease and are, therefore, immediately relevant and vital to the VA health care mission."
"9339534","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and remains an important health problem for our Veterans. Since 1975, the 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer patients has only improved from 2% to 6%. We and others have demonstrated that modulating death receptor-activated extrinsic apoptosis pathways provides novel avenues for cancer therapy. Recombinant ligands or agonistic antibodies for death receptor 4 or 5 (DR4/5), including DR5 agonistic antibody TRA-8, have been shown to induce apoptosis of several types of cancers in preclinical studies and are currently being tested in several phase I-III clinical trals for solid tumors, including pancreatic tumors. However, resistance of pancreatic cancer to TRA-8, and other DR ligands or agonistic antibodies, are major hurdles for effective therapy.  Over the past 8 years, we have been seeking effective reagents that overcome the resistance of cancer cells to DR-induced apoptosis. We have demonstrated that modulating the components in the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) determines the downstream survival and apoptosis signals conveyed by the DRs, and thus the sensitivity of cancer cells to DR-induced apoptosis. Recently, we identified a new component of the DR5-associated DISC, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). PARP1 expression levels correlated with the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to TRA-8-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of PARP1 sensitized resistant pancreatic cancer cells to TRA-8-induced apoptosis in vitro; and enhanced the efficacy of TRA-8 therapy of resistant pancreatic tumors in vivo. In contrast, overexpression of PARP1 in TRA-8-sensitive cells rendered them more resistant to TRA-8. PARP1 is known to function mainly in the nucleus for DNA repair. In human pancreatic cancer tissues and cells, we identified cytoplasmic localization of PARP1. We demonstrated that PARP1 regulated DR5-induced apoptotic signals through novel mechanisms, by promoting poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) modification of caspase-8 that inhibited caspase-8 activation. On the other hand, PARP1 inhibition decreased DISC-recruitment of calmodulin (CaM) and Src, which we previously reported to mediate death receptor-induced survival pathways in pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that inhibition of PARP1 promotes death receptor-induced apoptotic signals and inhibits survival signals, thus enhancing the sensitivity of pancreatic cancers to TRA-8 therapy. The proposed studies will characterize the function of PARP1 in 1) regulating death receptor-mediated apoptotic signals; 2) regulating death receptor- mediated survival signals; and 3) TRA-8 therapy in mouse models of pancreatic cancer. The present studies will define the novel function and molecular mechanisms underlying PARP1 regulation of death receptor- mediated apoptotic and survival signaling pathways, which will not only elucidate the role of PARP1 in the fundamental extrinsic apoptotic machinery, but also provide novel molecular insights facilitating further studies to translate these findings into therapeutic strategies for patient care for our Veterans."
"9339510","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Summary Reactive oxygen species (ROS), endothelial injury and macrophages play critical roles in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) kidney injury. Our data show stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) diminishes superoxide generation in macrophages, through induction of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), decreases the response of macrophages to chemoattractants- and migration across an endothelial monolayer. In cultured endothelial cells, STC1 preserve barrier function. STC1: diminishes superoxide generation; inhibits cytokine-induced activation of Jun-N- terminal kinase (JNK) and loss of tight junction proteins expression. STC1 transgenic mice, which exhibit elevated serum levels and preferential expression of STC1 in macrophages and endothelium, display resistance to I/R kidney injury. Overall hypothesis: STC1 protects from I/R kidney injury through: suppression of superoxide generation; maintenance of normal endothelial barrier function following I/R kidney injury; and inhibition of macrophages. In Objective I, we will determine the role of superoxide and Daxx in STC1-mediated inhibition of JNK in endothelial cells. In Objective II, we will determine the effect of STC1 on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/RO)-induced changes in the expression and assembly of tight junction proteins in cultured primary kidney endothelial cells. In the context of I/R kidney injury, Objective III will examine endothelil leakage to macromolecules, kidney inflammation and function after kidney endothelium-specific or macrophage-specific overexpression or deletion of STC1. Few therapeutic options are currently available for acute kidney injury (AKI). Our data identify STC1 as a potential therapeutic target for ischemic injury in the kidney and other organs, and our proposed studies will further elucidate STC1 mechanisms of action."

"9358020","Immune function is highly dependent upon costimulatory signals delivered during both the initial process of T cell activation and reactivation with entry into target tissue. There is a key role of costimulatory signals in autoimmune disease with activation of autoreactive T cells which has become evident with the emergence of autoimmmunity after blockade of coinhibitory signals in cancer. Moreover, gene variants in the costimulatory receptor CD226, and its ligand CD155 (shared with TIGIT) are strongly associated with risk of MS, suggesting a central role in MS autoimmunity. We discovered that TIGIT signaling in CD4+ cells induces IL-10, while CD226 is associated with IFN?/IL-17 secretion. Moreover, we identified Foxp3+ T cells expressing TIGIT as a distinct Treg subset with increased suppressor function. New preliminary data revealed that the CD226? TIGIT+CD4+ subpopulation from MS patients did not secrete IL-10 when compared to controls. Additionally, TIGIT was revealed to signal through AKT in MS Tregs with development of dysfunctional IFN? secreting Tregs. These new data have led us to deeply examine the function of TIGIT and CD226 on human T cells. We hypothesize that loss of TIGIT expression or function in MS drives autoimmune responses, while in tumors, increased TIGIT expression or signaling allows tumors to escape immune surveillance. We will determine the role of TIGIT/CD226 in regulating CD4+ T cell activation in human inflammatory disorders. First, we propose to test the hypothesis that the CD226/TIGIT axis regulates balance between IFN?/IL-17 vs. IL-10 production for T cells. Specifically, we propose that loss of signaling through the TIGIT pathway on MS T cells leads to loss of IL-10 while this pathway is hyperactive in glioma T cells. Serial RNAseq, ATACseq, and MINT-ChIP experiments will be performed after stimulation with TIGIT & CD226 mAbs in relationship to cytokine secretion, enabling us to elucidate key regulatory elements and associated epigenetic changes defective in TIGIT signaling in MS as compared to glioma. shRNA/CRISPR/Cas9 knockdowns will validate key regulatory nodes controlling proinflammatory vs. regulatory cytokines. Secondly, we will investigate the role of TIGIT/CD226 on the function of regulatory T cell populations in MS. In this aim, we hypothesize there are defects in the function of TIGIT+ Tregs in MS patients inducing dysfunctional Th1-like Tregs. We will measure frequency and function of TIGIT+ T cells in MS, determining whether TIGIT signaling prevents Th1 reprogramming of Tregs through repression of the AKT pathway. Using agonistic anti-TIGIT mAbs, we will interrogate molecular pathways of TIGIT in Tregs using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and MINT-ChIP serially after stimulation as readouts of biologic function allowing the elucidation of key regulatory elements that drive biologic processes which we will confirm by CRISPR/Cas9 and shRNA gene knockdown. In total, these studies will provide insight into the role of costimulatory pathways in the regulation of self- and tumor reactive T cells in autoimmune disease and cancer and potentially direct the development of new therapeutic approaches."
"9339506","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Later stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterized by a reduced number of infiltrative inflammatory cells and an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which leads to tissue fibrosis. The overproduction of ECM is mediated by the effects of the increase in TGF-beta production by reactive astrocytes. However, the intracellular mechanisms by which TGF- beta stimulates the production of ECM are not completely understood. We showed that during the course of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS, fewer OLG undergo apoptosis in C5- sufficient (C5-s) mice than in C5-deficient (C5-d) mice. Moreover, in chronic EAE, vigorous tissue repair associated with remyelination, axonal preservation, and absence of gliosis are seen in C5-s, but not C5-d mice. The extensive gliosis we observed in C5-d during chronic EAE may be directly related to the up-regulation of TGF- beta. We have identified RGC-32 as a factor that can mediate the TGF- beta -induced production of connective tissue matrix by astrocytes. Our current goal is to assess whether selectively inhibiting RGC-32 can prevent gliosis. Our overall hypothesis is that the complement terminal pathway has beneficial effects, preventing gliosis through modulation of TGF- beta and RGC-32 expression. Understanding the terminal complement pathway protective effects is critical for developing rational interventions to enhance remyelination and prevent gliosis in MS. To accomplish these goals, we have designed experiments to achieve the following three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, using a genomic approach, we will explore the pathways regulated by the terminal complement components with role in prevention of gliosis and possibly remyelination. We will analyze gene expression profiles in spinal cord samples from C5-d and C5-s mice during EAE. Based on our preliminary data we postulate that an imbalance in insulin-like growth factor binding proteins and TGF- beta levels is responsible for the generation of gliosis and lack of remyelination observed in C5-d mice. In Aim 2, we will examine whether the TGF- beta profibrotic effects are mediated by RGC-32. It is well known that TGF- beta and its downstream mediators play an essential role in gliosis but the molecular mechanisms governing this process are not well understood and the role of RGC-32 has not been investigated. TGF- beta is known to induce expression of RGC-32. If RGC-32 is involved in mediating the profibrotic effects of TGF- beta then these effects should be inhibited by RGC-32 silencing. The results of these experiments should tell us whether RGC-32 is involved in mediating TGF- beta profibrotic effects. In addition, we will characterize the signaling pathways and transcription factors involved in TGF- beta induced RGC-32 expression. In Aim 3, we will determine whether the lack of RGC-32 expression can prevent gliosis in mice with chronic EAE. To assess the contribution of RGC-32 to gliosis in C5-d (C5-/-) mice, we will generate mice lacking both C5 and RGC-32 (RGC-32-/- C5-/-). Experiments proposed in this Aim will allow us to determine whether RGC-32 is an appropriate target to inhibit gliosis. Understanding the terminal complement pathway protective effects is critical for developing rational interventions to enhance remyelination and prevent gliosis in MS. Our proposal is novel in that it integrates RGC-32 with the role of C5 in preventing gliosis, allowing us to define a new therapeutic target in MS."
"9411950","PROJECT SUMMARY. Mitochondrial disease is a highly phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of progressive, multi-system disorders affecting 1 in 4,300 people due to impaired cellular energy metabolism. Many mitochondrial disorders fall within the NICHD high priority clinical domain, which involves a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disabilities including autism. The common pediatric mitochondrial disease presentations termed Leigh syndrome (LS) or Leigh-like syndrome (LLS), which can be caused by mutations in approximately 90 genes across both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, are linked with intellectual and neurodevelopmental disabilities, infection susceptibility that often precipitates neurodevelopmental regression, metabolic strokes in basal ganglia and deep brain structures at any point in childhood including, in some cases, in the newborn period that is associated with primary lactic acidosis from birth and early demise, with an overall 35% mortality in childhood. Establishing an accurate genetic diagnosis of these diverse pediatric mitochondrial encephalopathy syndromes is critically important, as an increasing number have clinical actionability involving initiation or avoidance of specific medications, cofactors, or diets. Accurate diagnosis currently remains challenging, as there is no expertly-curated and comprehensive catalogue of pathogenic LS, LLS, and other gene mutations to guide diagnosis and clinical actionability. Since 2012, the project PIs have co-led the international Mitochondrial Disease Sequence Data Resource (MSeqDR) consortium to organize and curate mitochondrial disease genomic knowledge, analysis and sharing tools, and phenotypes. This organized MSeqDR community structure and committed international expertise is now poised to collaboratively curate genes and variants relevant to the most prevalent and treatable mitochondrial LS and LLS pediatric encephalopathy syndromes using ClinGen resources and curation tools. Aim 1. To complete gene-disease association expert curation for all pediatric mitochondrial encephalopathy syndromes with neurodevelopmental disability in the Leigh and Leigh-like spectrum. We will utilize the ClinGen gene curation tools and frameworks to review the gene-disease relationship for approximately 90 genes that cause LS, LLS, and other pediatric mitochondrial encephalopathy syndromes. We have brought together 32 leading international experts from 11 countries to collaboratively analyze all relevant data and achieve consensus in this important gene-disease curation effort. Aim 2. To expertly curate variants in the most prevalent and treatable pediatric-onset mitochondrial encephalopathy nuclear and mtDNA genes. Nuclear genes causing the most prevalent (SURF1, POLG, FBXL4) and treatable (SLC19A3, BTD, PDSS2, PDHA1, TPK1, ACAD9, ETHE1, HIBCH) pediatric-onset LS and LLS will be prioritized. In addition, our global network of leading mtDNA disease experts will evaluate the mtDNA variant pathogenicity assertions for mtDNA- associated pediatric LS and LLS genes, starting with the 3 most common causes (ATP6, ND5, MT-TL)."
"9297408","Summary  Primary torsin dystonias (PTD) are a group of movement disorders characterized by twisting  muscle contractures, where dystonia is the only clinical sign (except for tremor) and there is no  evidence of neuronal degeneration or an acquired cause. Eleven genes have been mapped for  primary dystonia including DYT1 (TOR1A), 2, 4 (TUBB4A), 6 (THAP1), 7, 13, 17, 21, 23 (CIZ1),  24 (ANO3) and 25 (GNAL), however only 3 have mutations in early onset dystonia patients,  TOR1A, THAP1 and GNAL. Each is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait but with reduced  penetrance, meaning that individuals can carry the mutation but do not show clinical symptoms.  The most common form of PTD is adult onset focal accounting for about 90% of all cases of  dystonia with a prevalence estimated at 30/100,000 in the general population. A small  percentage of focal cases are due to mutations in CIZ1, ANO3, THAP1, TUBB4A and GNAL but  the vast majority is unaccounted for and is most likely multigenic or multifactorial. In this grant,  focusing on early onset PTD, we will uncover genes that influence the penetrance of DYT1  dystonia through GWAS and exome sequencing studies. We will identify other genes for early  onset PTD using exome sequencing and determine whether variants within the identified early  onset PTD genes or the pathways associated with these genes contribute to susceptibility in the  most prevalent form of PTD, focal dystonia, using a case:control association study. The  proposed research will identify novel PTD risk factors and genes, which in turn should reveal  shared and intersecting pathways leading to a better understanding of the molecular basis of  PTD and provide the underpinnings for developing new treatments. Additionally, insight into the  factors that modulate disease penetrance would be a first step in determine whether these could  be modified leading to a reduced incidence of the disease."
"9339527","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Obesity is a common, serious, and costly disease that affects 33% of US citizens and 37% of VA patients. Although therapeutic treatments remain elusive, recent scientific evidence has pointed to enteroendocrine cells - sensory cells of the gut - as potential solutions. These cells are known to secrete several neuropeptides that are potent inducers of satiety, like cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY (PYY), and their sensory mechanisms have been the subject of intensive investigation. However, how these cells transduce their sensory signals onto neurons and other cells is largely unknown.  We recently developed novel transgenic mouse models to study these cells by expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in CCK- or PYY-containing cells. The eGFP models allowed us to discover that enteroendocrine cells have prominent basal cytoplasmic processes with similar features to neuronal axons. These basal cytoplasmic processes, we found, directly connect to neuronal afferents and efferents innervating the gut mucosa.  The present proposal is designed to elucidate the function of this connection. Our central hypothesis is that basal cytoplasmic processes are essential in the exchange of molecular information between enteroendocrine cells and sensory neurons. This hypothesis is built on preliminary data produced in the PI's laboratory and will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: ? Aim 1 is to characterize the connection between enteroendocrine cells and sensory neurons ? Aim 2 is to determine how the formation of enteroendocrine cell cytoplasmic processes  is regulated ? Aim 3 is to define the effects of diet-induced obesity on the neuro-enteroendocrine connection  We anticipate that the characterization of gut neuroendocrine signaling will facilitate the development of strategies to modulate the transmission of sensory information from enteroendocrine cells to neurons and vice versa. Because these sensory signals ultimately participate in the regulation of food intake and appetite, elucidating the mechanisms that regulate this connection can provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat obesity."
"9323547","PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States, more than one out of every two women who conceive a child is overweight or obese. Obesity is a complex disorder and there are likely multiple causative factors emerging at various times through life. We have previously demonstrated in preclinical studies that offspring have altered metabolism when the fetuses are exposed to the consequences of maternal obesity in utero. The major effects relate to how the offspring metabolize energy and store excess energy. Offspring of obese women can spare and store more ingested energy as excess fat than offspring of lean women who burn more of their energy. Preliminary data from our ongoing clinical studies show that offspring of overweight women have increased fat mass at age 2 weeks and increased weight at age 2 years. One in two American infants will have been exposed to adverse metabolic conditions while developing in utero, and this increases the risk of developing obesity later in life. Although weight loss prior to pregnancy would be the preferred line of action, in light of the high incidence of unplanned pregnancies and the low success rate of significant weight loss among women, one critical strategy is to develop interventions during pregnancy to prevent childhood obesity.  The objective of this proposal is to test an intervention that would reduce the effect of maternal obesity on the offspring and therefore prevent their risk of developing childhood obesity. The proposed study will test the efficacy of probiotics supplementation during pregnancy on preventing childhood obesity. To test these hypotheses we have designed a prospective randomized double blinded control trial. For this study we will recruit 104 obese women within the first 12 weeks of gestation and follow them throughout pregnancy and during their child's first two weeks of life. The obese women will be randomized to either a placebo (N=52) or to an intervention group (N=52). The intervention group will consist of a daily probiotic supplementation, whereas the control group will be administered a placebo. During the length of the study we will: carefully quantify maternal and child adiposity (fat mass); study maternal metabolism (dietary intake and energy expenditure); acquire dietary intakes and evaluate circulating levels of key metabolic markers. The specific aims will first demonstrate the potential for a probiotic intervention during gestation to improve maternal glucose use in obese women. For this aim, maternal fasting glucose and insulin levels will be assessed throughout pregnancy in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. The specific aims will also test whether a probiotic intervention during pregnancy in obese women alter offspring fat mass and decrease the risk of obesity in the offspring. To answer these questions, placenta, umbilical cord and cord blood will be obtained to study glucose, insulin and gene expression."

"9539082","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Overexpression of inducible HSP70 (HSP70i) in tumors is exploited as a target for immunotherapy of melanoma and other cancers. HSP70i can also funnel external stress into an autoimmune response. As reported in Science Translational Medicine, we identified a peptide within HSP70i responsible for activating human dendritic cells (DCs) and developed HSP70iQ435A, a mutant DNA isoform with a single amino acid modification. The resulting gene product supports a tolerizing DC phenotype while preventing and even reversing autoimmunity in T cell receptor transgenic mice. T cells from treated mice, however, retain the ability to control melanoma once removed from the tolerizing environment and adoptively transferred into tumor bearing animals. DNA vaccinated mice also develop robust humoral responses to HSP70i that contain tumor growth. Protective responses were observed in CD8 knockout mice, and after adoptive B cell transfer to tumor challenged, wild-type mice. Our exciting preliminary data strongly suggest that HSP70iQ435A will suppress autoimmunity while supporting anti-tumor effects. The 'stressed' microenvironment within tumors leads to HSP70i overexpression that drives T cell recruitment and susceptibility to anti-HSP70 antibodies, whereas mutant HSP70 supports immune tolerance in the skin to prevent loss of normal pigment cells. We hypothesize that HSP70iQ435A polarizes DCs to support B cell responses to HSP70i surface expressed by tumor cells while preventing migration of MAA reactive T cells to normal tissues. Thus tumors are targeted by a combination of antibodies targeting the HSP70i c-terminus protruding from the membrane, and infiltrating T cells, while normal tissue cells are undisturbed through lack of HSP70i surface expression and reduced CTL recruitment. We will measure the ability of HSP70iQ435A to interfere with severe side effects of immunotherapy including graft versus host disease, and unravel the immune mechanism underlying divergent responses to HSP70iQ435A, addressing the consequences of treatment for the physiology and function of immune cells and their targets. A spontaneous swine model of melanoma and vitiligo is included to further the application of HSP70iQ435A."

DPRC's impact will be greatest in three emerging areas: (a) Getting under the skin to understand the developmental processes of population health, (b) Understanding of the roles of social connections and network positions in population health, and (c) Identifying causal effects to advance understanding of behavior at the population level. We encourage and promote innovation in data collection and data analyses in pursuit of these questions. DPRC currently has 53 faculty associates from 10 departments, schools and institutes. This application requests funding from the NICHD Population Dynamics Centers Research Infrastructure (P2C) to support three cores, administration, development and science cores. The proposed cores will lower the administrative costs of seeking and managing external funding freeing researchers to concentrate on science. Our goal is to increase external funding by developing science that would not be possible without DPRC, given the number and quality of population researchers at Duke, its recent record of recruiting top population scientists, and its unique data resources (e.g., the leadership on major international panel surveys). Over the past 10 years, DPRC has become a major contributor to the population research community."
"9330952","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Jos, its Nigerian partner Ahmadu Bello University and their United States partners, Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and Northwestern University (NU), propose the continuation of research capacity building of the Medical Education Partnership initiative Nigeria (MEPIN) with the Support of Training and Mentoring in Nigeria for Academics (STAMINA) proposal. STAMINA will support and energize research training programs for junior faculty at the University of Jos and Ahmadu Bello University by increasing their capacity to participate in and carry out locally relevant research that contributes to improved human health and to foster the next generation of faculty researchers in Nigeria. The four STAMINA research themes build on the progress and track record of the Nigerian partners: 1) HIV Outcomes Research has been a natural extension of the work emanating from PEPFAR support and the need for robust program evaluation and implementation science research to improve programs and guide national policy; 2) Reproductive Health is a second research theme that reflects the junior faculty pool and senior faculty expertise; 3) Chronic Disease of Interest will focus primarily on breast and prostate cancers, two cancers with high disease burden in Nigeria; and 4) Bioinformatics and Genomics research which will build upon the infrastructure for genetic sequencing at the University of Jos supported by the PEPFAR program. The STAMINA program will strategically allow for the support of mentored research for this important skill set applicable to many areas of research. This proposal will further develop the Masters of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI) program initiated with MEPIN support with the addition of adapted coursework on integrated epidemiology and biostatistics and clinical effectiveness. The curriculum will be required for all junior faculty members and include courses that were initiated by our US partners and have now been stepped down to the University of Jos including: responsible conduct of research, human ethics training, research methodology, data analysis, manuscript writing, mentorship, case-based method of teaching, and public health research in infectious diseases. The STAMINA program will leverage the infrastructure developed with PEPFAR, MEPIN and Fogarty programs from NU and HSPH as well as the seed research award program initiated through the MEPIN program which have provided much of the necessary foundation for junior faculty as they initiate their research careers. We propose to formalize the mentored research program for junior faculty with STAMINA- mentored research for five junior faculty members every 2 years; upon selection of STAMINA trainees, mentors will be assigned. Milestones for progress will include the timely completion of research, publication of research in peer-reviewed literature and submission of proposals for external funding for continued research. This new generation of research faculty will provide solutions to global health needs through high quality, competitive research designed, carried out and implemented in Nigeria."
"9339482","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Myocardial infarction (MI), even with current reperfusion strategies, remains the leading cause of heart failure. Identifying the events that induce adverse cardiac remodeling post-MI will provide therapeutic targets to prevent, slow, or reverse progression to heart failure. A major risk factor for a poor response to MI is age. With age, there is an increased infiltration of macrophages into the left ventricle (LV), which stimulates extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and leads to a subtle but significant change in LV function evidenced by reduced early (E) to late (A) filling ratios. Post-MI, macrophage infiltration and ECM accumulation are driving events, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 regulates both of these processes. MMP-9 deletion attenuates the cardiac response to aging, in part by shifting macrophage polarization from a pro-inflammatory M1 state to an anti- inflammatory M2 state. Our preliminary data demonstrate that MMP-9 levels are much increased in older mice at day 7 post-MI, and this in-crease in MMP-9 yields more M1 macrophages to extend the inflammatory response and delay the healing phase. MMP-9 deletion restores the M1 and M2 polarization balance.  This renewal proposal will address the central hypothesis that during the MI response in aging mice, MMP-9 enhances pro-inflammatory M1 polarization and attenuates anti- inflammatory M2 polarization to induce adverse remodeling.  To test our hypothesis, we will determine macrophage polarization kinetics in young (3-6 month old) and old (18-23 month old) wild type and MMP-9 null mice. We will evaluate how MMP-9 activates macrophage polarization and how this process is altered with aging (aim 1), whether young hearts can be switched to an old phenotype by stimulating M1 macrophage polarization (aim 2), and whether old hearts can be switched to a young phenotype by stimulating M2 macrophage polarization (aim 3). This proposal is unique, because most studies use MMP-9 as an output measurement whereby we will use MMP-9 as a major input. Our multi-faceted approach includes in vivo physiology, cell biology, biochemistry, proteomics, and histological approaches to further advance the mechanistic understanding of the origins of post-MI LV remodeling and provide targets for translational research. The results of these studies have high significance for the aging veteran population."
"9339472","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Alcohol dependence (alcoholism) is a common condition in veterans and alcohol abuse is a complicating factor in most chronic medical and psychiatric illnesses. Although alcoholism is substantially (40-60%) genetically determined, the genetic determinants of risk are largely unknown, hindering effective prevention and treatment of dependent individuals. For these reasons and more, there is a clear need to expand pharmacotherapy options for alcohol abuse and dependence to improve outcomes and sustained abstinence.  Although no animal model duplicates clinically-defined alcoholism, models for specific factors (including withdrawal/negative effect, which constitutes a motivational force that perpetuates alcohol use and contributes to relapse) are useful to identify potential determinants of liability and pharmacotherapy in humans. A unique strength of this proposal is that we show for the first time that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an FDA approved antioxidant, mitigates alcohol withdrawal. An important goal of this research proposal is to characterize NAC efficacy to reduce withdrawal (convulsions, anxiety-like behavior) in dependent mice. Using preclinical models, we were also the first to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) with proven, large effects on alcohol physical dependence and associated withdrawal. One hypothesis that has emerged from our work is that the QTL of largest effect (Adw1) may also affect alcohol seeking behavior. Adw1 is also unique in that it affects alcohol but not pentobarbital withdrawal, providing an important clue to its mechanism of action. Notably, ethanol exposure and withdrawal introduce oxidative stress, while pentobarbital has neutral or anti-oxidative effects in the brain.  Some of the most useful tools that we have created thus far are congenic mice with the Adw1 region from a donor strain introgressed onto a different genetic background. These genetic models have been invaluable to map Adw1 to a small interval and identify high-quality candidate genes, the most promising of which (so far) have roles in oxidative homeostasis/stress; and gene co-expression network analyses using Adw1 congenics indicate disruption of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Thus, a hypothesis that has emerged from our data is the idea that oxidative homeostasis/stress may play an important role in genetic vulnerability to alcohol physical dependence and withdrawal, and that this pathway may also be a pharmacotherapeutic target to manage withdrawal and beyond. We have now published the first studies of mitochondria respiratory complex activities and organization in the mouse brain and find remarkable genetic differences, providing a framework to gain mechanistic information. Although NAC is thought to affect this pathway, it may have additional actions that could also contribute to its therapeutic efficacy. Using a systems biology network approach, we will assess both possibilities to provide additional mechanistic information. Interestingly, a growing body of evidence implicates natural variation in oxidative homeostasis in genetically influenced differences in mice, disproportionately affecting the brain, so we expect that our results may direct research beyond the addictions."
"9502651","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE: Dr. Maria Odette Gore is a board certified cardiologist and clinical investigator with a strong research interest in preventive cardiology and commitment to academic medicine. She completed Cardiology Research training at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) on the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Research Pathway, and accepted a full-time faculty position in the Division of Cardiology at UTSW on September 1, 2015. During residency and fellowship, Dr. Gore?s mentored research projects focused on several aspects related to cardiovascular disease prevention, resulting in the publication of >25 peer-reviewed articles in prestigious journals and 2 book chapters (total 14 first-author publications). During fellowship, Dr. Gore also completed a Master of Science in Clinical Science program at UTSW, served as an ad-hoc reviewer for many journals and as an abstract grader for four American Heart Association (AHA) conferences, and was the recipient of the 2013 Women in Cardiology Trainee Award for Excellence from the AHA. Key projects that Dr. Gore led or participated in during fellowship include analyses of cardiac biomarkers in large population-based cohorts; registry-based and population-based cohort studies on the association between diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease; and a two-phase pilot study exploring the community blood donation program as portal for cardiovascular risk factor screening, with potential for intervention. The present proposal represents a logical continuation of this latest study, as well as a conduit for further essential training in community health and prevention research, health communication science, advanced clinical research methods, and research leadership and grant writing strategies. The PI?s long-term career goal is to become a recognized leader and innovator in patient-oriented research in the field of cardiovascular (CV) disease prevention. In the medium-term, her goal is to become an independent, R01-funded investigator contributing to the development of novel approaches to CV disease risk assessment, risk communication, and primary and secondary prevention. For the short-term, this proposal outlines clear training and research objectives which will be achieved through structured learning, including courses and workshops, and further hands-on research apprenticeship with an outstanding team of highly accomplished, extramurally-funded mentors, advisors and consultants. Attainment of these objectives will be a crucial stepping-stone for Dr. Gore?s future success as independent investigator. ENVIRONMENT: The PI works at one the top academic medical centers in the country, with 6 Nobel Prize winners (more than any other medical school in the world), and more than $400 million in annual research funding for over 3,500 research projects. The primary mentor for this project is Dr. James de Lemos, a recognized leader in the field with an outstanding mentorship track record. Dr. Gore and Dr. de Lemos have already developed a strong mentor-mentee relationship, with 12 peer-reviewed articles co-authored prior to this proposal. The PI?s co-mentors are Dr. Jarett Berry and Dr. Wanpen Vongpatanasin, who are both extramurally-funded independent investigators working in complementary areas related to the PI's area of interest. In addition, a strong multidisciplinary team of senior research advisors has been assembled to oversee and guide the PI?s research and career development. The PI will benefit from unlimited access to and support from a highly skilled statistician, will participate and present in several research meetings held regularly in the Division of Cardiology and the Department of Clinical Sciences, and will have numerous opportunities for intellectual interactions with investigators within and outside Cardiology. The institution has pledged 75% protected time for the PI?s research and career development activities throughout the duration of this K23. PROPOSED RESEARCH: A vital component of primary CV disease prevention is the detection and control of major CV risk factors, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. In aggregate, approximately 45% of the entire U.S. adult population is affected by one, or more, of these 3 risk factors, and at least one of these risk factors remains undiagnosed in more than one third of cases, reflecting an important detection gap in the community. To help close this gap, the PI completed and published a two-phase pilot study screening blood donors, in collaboration with the largest independent blood program in Texas. The research proposed in this K23 is a logical continuation of this published work, and aims to (Aim 1) Test the hypothesis that the prevalence of undetected (undiagnosed) risk factors among blood donors is similar to existing estimates of undetected risk factor prevalence in the general population, after accounting for any differences in socio- demographic factors; (Aim 2) Develop, pre-test and optimize a multi-component, multi-platform ehealth intervention to communicate screening test results and promote health awareness and healthy behaviors among blood donors; (Aim 3) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial testing the hypothesis that the new ehealth intervention developed in Aim 2 can improve risk factor awareness and promote healthy behavioral changes among blood donors participating in the screening program. The proposed research will advance the field by opening up the way to novel, highly efficient and cost-effective strategies for population screening and primary CV disease prevention."
"9262056","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Chronic sleep fragmentation (SF) is characteristic of aging, sleep-related breathing disorders, and neurological and psychiatric diseases, including major depressive disorder (MDD), all prevalent in the veterans population. SF induces cognitive deficits in animals and humans, but the mechanisms underlying these deficits are unknown. We study adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process which facilitates specific cognitive functions which are impaired by SF. Markers of oxidative stress are found in brains of MDD patients, and are predicted to affect cells with high metabolic activity, including parvalbumin (PV+ neurons) which regulate hippocampal adult neurite survival. We will examine effects of SF on oxidative stress in PV+ neurons and neurite survival, behavioral changes resulting from deficits in neurite survival, and responses to anti-oxidant treatments. Since infection and fever often precede MDD and other neurological conditions, and fever exacerbates oxidative stress, we will examine the interactions of elevated brain temperature and fever, SF, and oxidative stress. Results will provide a basis for protecting personnel from these forms of brain damage."
"9410856","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown in efficacy and effectiveness trials to achieve high levels of protection, with over 95% protection among those with measurable levels of medication that indicate adherence. This provides a substantial public health opportunity, with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating that approximately 1.2 million US adults are eligible for PrEP, including 492,000 MSM. PrEP prescriptions are growing exponentially, with over 79,000 prescriptions between 2012 and 2015 in the US. Guidance issued by CDC and by WHO calls for quarterly follow-up visits for those on PrEP, to include behavioral and laboratory assessments, and treatment or counseling as needed. Currently, those on PrEP must have in-person visits with their medical provider for such services, a system that places a large burden on both providers and patients. If PrEP were to be scaled up to cover eligible, high-risk MSM in the United States, we estimate over 1.5 million yearly patient visits would be required, a substantial burden on clinics seeking to bring PrEP to scale. A related problem with bringing PrEP to scale is that patients may not persist in PrEP care over time. This is particularly concerning because those patients in demographics with highest risk for HIV acquisition, young and Black MSM, have been observed to be more likely to not persist in PrEP care over time. The proposed research seeks to make PrEP scale-up more feasible and to increase persistence in PrEP care, by developing a home-based monitoring and support system that would alleviate the need for quarterly, in- person provider visits. We propose to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether participants (half Black, half aged 18-34) randomized to the home care PrEP system have higher levels of retention in PrEP care relative to standard of care control participants, as determined by biomarker and self-report.

We will also conduct a mixed-methods assessment of trial results, and assess the cost-effectiveness of the home care system."
"9288318","ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this project is to identify new therapeutics that are effective after a stroke has occurred to stimulate recovery of cognitive and motor function. Stroke-induced dysfunction is the result of neuronal injury and death, and mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in these processes. Currently, drug therapy to treat stroke is limited to TPA, which must be administered within 6h of a stroke. This window is too short and TPA has significant side effects. In addition, therapies are needed that not only treat the initial phase of stroke- induced celluar dysfunction but also will enhance the chronic phase recovery of function and produce enduring benefits. Our preliminary studies revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction occurred in ispilesion cortex and striatum following focal sensorimotor cortex (SMC) ischemic lesion in adult rats, and persisted over the first week. Consequently, we propose that therapeutics that increases mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) will promote recovery from stroke in both adult and aged rats. As part of our drug discovery program to identify chemicals that induce MB, formoterol, a specific long-acting ?2-adrenergic receptor (?2AR) agonist, was identified. Formoterol is an FDA-approved drug to treat asthma. Preliminary studies demonstrated that formoterol- induced MB in naïve rats. Additional our preliminary studies revealed that formoterol administered 24h after stroke improved forelimb motor recovery after six days. Finally, preliminary studies demonstrated that daily formoterol administration, beginning 24h after experimental stroke and continuing daily during forelimb rehabilitative treatment (RT) for 15 days, improved forelimb motor recovery compared to vehicle administration with or without RT. More specifically, we hypothesize that stimulating MB with formoterol after stroke will 1) improve mitochondrial function early after stroke, thus decreasing motor impairments and 2) during RT will improve the efficacy of RT by supporting experience-dependent neuronal remodeling and repair in adult and aged rats. We hypothesize that the combination of formoterol and RT will be most beneficial in aged stroke animals. Specific Aim 1: Elucidate the optimal formoterol dose to induce MB, restore MF, and improve behavioral outcomes after experimental stroke in adult and aged rats. Specific Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of formoterol and forelimb rehabilitative training (RT) following experimental stroke to enhance MF, MB, structural plasticity and behavioral outcomes in adult rats. Specific Aim 3. Determine the efficacy of formoterol and forelimb rehabilitative training (RT) following experimental stroke to enhance MF, MB, structural plasticity and behavioral outcomes in aged rats Successful completion of these studies will provide strong evidence for the dose, timing and persistence of formoterol-induced recovery from stroke and a possible mechanism underlying these findings, providing new targets for rehabilitative training adjunctive treatments. Since formoterol is already an FDA approved drug, successful completion of these studies rapidly lead to translational clinical trials for young and older human stroke survivor."
"9365195","Project Summary Long noncoding (lnc) RNAs are a new frontier that we must explore to fully understand human development. To date, the functions of only a small number of lncRNAs have been described in human development, and the continued existence of this fundamental gap in our knowledge of lncRNA function will impede the ability to control differentiation for cell-based therapies and understand how mutations in noncoding regions of the genome lead to disease. The long-term goal of this work is to elucidate the mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate development of human definitive endoderm (DE) and use this insight to direct more efficient differentiation of gastrointestinal tissues for regenerative medicine. We have identified the lncRNA DIGIT and show that it regulates DE differentiation of human and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The gene encoding DIGIT is divergent to the gene encoding Goosecoid (GSC) in both humans and mice. In human ESCs, we find that DIGIT controls DE differentiation through regulation of GSC. The overall objective is to determine how DIGIT regulates development. The central hypothesis is that DIGIT regulates DE differentiation through different pathways in ESC differentiation and in vivo development. The rationale for this proposal is that understanding how DIGIT controls DE differentiation will make it possible to modulate expression of this lncRNA to facilitate differentiation of tissues for regenerative medicine and provide insight into the mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate divergent genes. This proposal will also determine how the mouse ortholog of DIGIT (Digit) regulates differentiation and whether mouse models can teach us about the function of DIGIT when hESCs are differentiated for therapy. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) determine how DIGIT regulates GSC expression in hESCs, (2) determine how DIGIT and protein partners interact to regulate DE differentiation, and (3) determine the role of Digit in mouse development. In the first aim, gain and loss of function analysis coupled with RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization and chromatin precipitation will determine how DIGIT controls GSC expression. In the second aim, we will investigate how protein partners interact with DIGIT to regulate differentiation. In the third aim, we will use mouse ESC culture and in vivo development to define the role of Digit in DE differentiation. The proposed work is significant because understanding the mechanism by which lncRNAs regulate DE differentiation will lead to transform- ative strategies for the differentiation of pancreatic, liver, intestinal and lung cells for therapeutics. It will also teach us how lncRNAs regulate divergently transcribed genes and whether mouse models for this lncRNA can be used to understand hESC differentiation. This work is innovative in the focus on lncRNAs to understand mechanism of development and in how it uses genome editing approaches to disrupt and track lncRNA transcription."
"9336831","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Although the vast majority of all head injuries are classified as mild to moderate, many patients report persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms, despite normal clinical neuroimaging. Generally, traumatic brain injury (TBI) is difficult to detect and diagnose, and the scope of the problem is compounded significantly given that we know very little about the neuropathology and sequelae of neurotrauma. Historically, the brainstem has been implicated as a particularly vulnerable structure in the context of TBI. However, unfortunately, to our knowledge, there are no existing data relating injury severity variables (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC]~ post-traumatic amnesia [PTA]~ number and frequency of blasts) as well as commonly experienced post-concussive symptoms (PCS~ e.g., sleep difficulties, balance/coordination problems, dizziness, tinnitus) to actual pathology in the human brain, and this could be directly related to the inabiliy to visualize small, critical white matter tracts within the brainstem, a vital structure that is critically important for respiratory function, cardiovascular regulation, and sleep and alertness. Although it is thought that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can help address the shortcomings of conventional imaging techniques in the evaluation of patients with TBI, there is a lack of comprehensive, multidisciplinary TBI studies focusing on brainstem white matter integrity and injury severity markers, and research examining this population has been extremely limited. For example, to date, whole-brain DTI data in humans have been collected using multislice acquisition techniques that have limited imaging resolution to perform measurements with very thin slices, prohibiting the study of small white matter tracts and deep intracranial structures (i.e., brainstem). Indeed, there are very few brainstem DTI studies in TBI, and none have assessed associations to important injury severity variables and enduring neuropsychiatric symptoms comprising the posttraumatic syndrome. Despite a paucity of DTI studies in TBI, promising findings from animal and clinical studies-as well as our own pilot data in support of this proposal-provide preliminary support for the potential use of DTI as a biomarker of TBI-related white matter injury. We thus propose to use a newly developed methodology (HARDI~ described in the Methods section of the proposal) coupled with high spatial-resolution anatomic images in order to help identify and visualize important brainstem tracts that may represent the anatomical substrates of TBI. Using this approach, millimetric slices and probabilistic tractography allow thinner brainstem tracts to be identified, especially within low anisotropic areas. Thus, in 190 veterans and combat controls (mild to moderate TBI: 120~ combat and non-combat exposed NC: 70), we will employ DTI tractography in the context of a novel, cutting edge imaging sequence and analytic approach in order to fully segment and properly visualize critical brainstem white matter tracts and relate white matter integrity to important injury severiy variables and PCS symptoms across mechanism of injury (blast versus blunt force TBI). Primary aims will also examine whether and how other important injury variables (e.g., number and proximity of blasts) modify the relationship between white matter integrity and PCS symptoms in this vulnerable population. To our knowledge, our proposal represents the first to fully segment and properly visualize critical brainstem white matter tracts, examine brainstem white matter integrity by mechanism of neurotrauma, and relate DTI indices to important injury severity and PCS variables.  We expect that findings will advance our knowledge of the clinical utility of DTI in identifying specific brainstem white matter changes in mild to moderate TBI, and they will provide novel information about the effects of differing mechanisms of injury on brain regions that have been shown in tissue studies to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of TBI. Clearly, linkages of injury severity characteristics and enduring PCS symptoms typically associated with vegetative signs of psychiatric origin to a neuroanatomic substrate would have very important implications for this relatively new field."

These investigators from the UCSD Departments of Ophthalmology, Pathology, Pediatrics, Institute for Genomic Medicine, Radiology, and Psychology represent an impressive, productive, and a collegial group of vision researchers. UCSD vision researchers encompass all levels of faculty appointments and research accomplishments, from 9 full professors who are leaders in their respective fields to 6 recently recruited junior faculty (Drs. Annese, Balasubramanian, Bosworth, Huberman, Ju, Lin). Moreover, the substantial funding from other NIH institutes and foundations (Table 2) further highlights the strength of UCSD's vision research program. In particular, our portfolio is strong in human and animal imaging and functional assessment, image analysis, epidemiology/clinical research, genetics, glaucoma, AMD, retinal degeneration, cell biology, molecular biology, animal models, and vascular biology.     The UCSD Department of Ophthalmology has a long tradition of excellence in glaucoma and retina research. With the recent recruitment of seven additional NEI funded investigators (Drs. Ayyagari, La Spada, Lin, Ju, Zhang, and most recently Balasubramanian and Huberman), vision research at UCSD has reached a critical mass that will benefit from an infrastructure to coordinate, enhance and leverage the expertise of each participating investigator to benefit the entire UCSD vision research community. Currently, 9 NEI funded investigators have offices and laboratories in the adjacent and interconnected Shiley Eye Center (SEC), Hamilton Glaucoma Center (HGC) and Jacobs Retina Center (HRC). The two adjoining research centers (Hamilton Glaucoma Center and Jacobs Retina Center) comprise 26,000 sq ft of dedicated research and office space. The SEC also provides extensive computer/IT support, and independent medical record services, as well as houses an auditorium and library. Another 6 NEI-funded investigators have offices nearby (less than a 5 minute drive from the Dept of Ophthalmology) at the main UCSD campus and adjoining Health Sciences research complex. The main campus includes vision researchers from the Depts. of Psychology (Dr. MacLeod), Biology(Dr. Rainegel), Neuroscience (Dr. Huberman) and Bioengineering (Dr. Silva). The Health Sciences complex includes the Institute for Genomic Medicine, Skaggs Pharmaceutical Sciences Building (Drs. Zhang and La Spada), the Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Research Center (BRC) in the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine (Dr. Jain) and the Basic Science Building-BSB with adjoining Medical Teaching Facility-MTF which house the animal care facilities and animal laboratories of Drs.

"9318553","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with type 2 diabetes are increasingly living with multiple concurrent conditions and complicated medical regimens. For these patients, diabetes management decisions and treatment goals must be addressed within the larger context of other competing health concerns. In parallel, clinical advances have led to a substantial increase in the number of tasks that primary care providers must perform during each visit. These twin trends of patient and visit complexity present a formidable challenge to effective diabetes primary care. Although there are a variety of non-visit strategies that can and are being instituted to address these issues, the primary care visit remains a vital opportunity fo catalyzing changes in diabetes care. To achieve this change, efficient and scalable tools to support more productive primary care encounters are needed. We hypothesize that among patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated HbA1c, a systematic approach that enables patients to explicitly prioritize their top diabetes and non-diabetes related health concerns before the primary care visit will result in more effective diabetes care over time. To test this hypothesis, our proposal's aims are to:1) Design and implement a web-based tool linked to the electronic medical record that will enable complex patients to indicate, and PCPs to review, patients' top health priorities for their upcoming visit; 2) Conduct a randomized clinical trial among patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated HbA1c testing the impact on intermediate care outcomes (medication adherence, medication intensification) compared to usual care and HbA1c (primary clinical outcome), blood pressure, and lipid control (secondary clinical outcomes) compared to usual care; 3) Among a sub-set of intervention participants (patients and PCPs), use mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the impact of pre-visit prioritization on the content of subsequent visit discussions and examine the influence of patient and PCP factors on these discussions. The key conceptual innovation of this study is to test a replicable, low-cost approach to improving diabetes primary care that explicitly integrates non-diabetes problems into the process of diabetes management. We will implement an easy-to-use web-based tool linked to our EPIC(R)-based electronic medical record. This patient-centered care model has the potential to significantly improve the design of primary care systems responsible for providing patient-centered care and offers an innovative approach to improving the care of increasingly complex patients with type 2 diabetes. This study addresses the three NIH priorities of translating evidence into practice, improving medication adherence, and understanding health care disparities. If successful, we will work to actively disseminate the tool throughout our system and to other U.S. care organizations."
"9339466","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Left ventricular (LV) remodeling is a summation of cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) events, invariably occurs following a myocardial infarction (MI) and contributes to clinical outcomes. The ECM plays a critical role in the maintenance of LV geometry and function, and increased induction of the ECM proteolytic enzymes, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) occur with MI and contribute to LV remodeling. We have established that a unique MMP type, the membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP), is increased following MI, and that overexpression accelerates post-MI remodeling. Recent studies from this laboratory and others have identified that MT1-MMP may actually facilitate ECM synthesis by processing profibrotic signaling molecules, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF). Our new results have identified that MT1-MMP processes the latent TGF binding protein-1 (LTBP-1), potentially augmenting ECM synthesis/accumulation. However, to move the field forward in terms of cause-effect between MT1-MMP induction and adverse LV remodeling, as well as establishing a therapeutic target, will require novel transgenic constructs and most importantly targeted, selective MT1-MMP inhibition. In this project continuation, we will move our basic discoveries forward and utilize ou newly developed MT1-MMP targeting techniques in order to test the hypothesis that while MT1-MMP activation occurs within the MI region as well as the remote viable myocardium, distinctly different proteolytic events occur - favoring myocardial matrix instability within the MI region an accelerated fibrosis within the remote region. Thus, selective targeting of MT1-MMP induction in a region, temporal, and cell specific fashion will directly alter the course of LV remodeling. The following aims will be addressed: (1) Discovery of MT1-MMP Heterogeneity: Demonstrate a regional heterogeneity in myocardial MT1-MMP substrate processing and establish that region specific fibroblast transformation and persistent MT1-MMP expression occurs. (2) Establishing MT1-MMP Mechanisms by Transgenesis: Establish cell specific targeting of MT1-MMP will alter the course of LV remodeling post MI. We will utilize both myocardial and fibroblast specific alterations in MT1-MMP levels following MI. (3) Demonstrating MT1-MMP as a Therapeutic Target: Using a validated regional injection method, whereby the MT1-MMP inhibitor is contained within a hydrogel, establish that selective and regional MT1-MMP inhibition will alter the course of adverse LV remodeling. Through a stepwise and combinatorial translational approach, a proteolytic pathway contributing to heterogeneous LV remodeling post-I/R will be established and will identify both interstitial signaling and intracellular pathways that can serve as potential therapeutic targets to favorably modify this process. These findings hold relevance to ECM remodeling/fibrosis pathways in general and are of particular relevance to adverse LV remodeling which occurs within the VA patient population."
"9352263","Despite ongoing efforts to enhance suicide risk assessment, current methods rely heavily on patient report of suicidal ideation and related factors (e.g., intent, plan, access to means) to determine level of risk. Reliance on self-report is problematic because many patients are unwilling or unable to report thoughts and intentions of suicide.1 In addition to these limitations, the emphasis of self-report measures on conscious thoughts and emotions has fostered little insight into the largely unconscious cognitive processes that are theorized to underlie suicidal crises.2,3 These suicide-related cognitive processes, or habitual ways of thinking that promote suicide, are believed to emerge when individuals become distressed, but at other times may be dormant. This notion of ?suicidal cognitive reactivity? is consistent with clinicians? and patients? observations that for some individuals suicidal thoughts and intentions may be absent during a clinical interview, but then rapidly resurface in the presence of distress. Although suicidal cognitive reactivity is purported to be a critical underlying mechanism of suicide risk, it has received little empirical evaluation because there have not been any established procedures to elicit and assess it. The ability to elicit and assess suicidal cognitive reactivity could be extremely clinically useful. If clinicians could assess the likelihood of suicidal thoughts and intentions emerging in the near future, they would be better able to accurately determine patients? risk of suicide. We have developed and pilot tested a procedure to evaluate suicidal cognitive reactivity using a suicide-specific mood induction and computerized reaction-time tasks (i.e., the Death/Suicide Implicit Association Test,4 and the Suicide Stroop5) that implicitly measure cognitive processes (i.e., association of self with death, and biased attention toward suicide-related cues) and have predicted suicide attempts among high-risk civilians and Veterans.4,6,7 These tasks serve as behavioral markers of suicide risk. Although promising, the tasks are still not very accurate. This may be due to suicide-related cognitive processes not being active in some participants at the time of assessment. In order to optimize the tasks and test the critical theoretical prediction that distress activates suicidal thinking, the proposed research will examine scores on the Death/Suicide Implicit Association Test and Suicide Stroop task both before and after inducing a dysphoric mood in participants by having them watch a brief scene from a movie having to do with suicide. The study will compare two groups of Veterans: (1) a ?Suicide Group? who have or have had a mood anxiety and/or trauma related disorder and have attempted suicide within the past year, and (2) a ?No Suicide Group? who similarly have or have/had a mood anxiety and/or trauma related disorder, but have never seriously considered attempting suicide. If the cognitive theory of suicidal behavior2,3 is correct, the Suicide Group will display a significantly larger increase in suicide-related cognitive processes following the mood induction than any increase displayed by the No Suicide Group. Six-months later, participants will complete an interview to determine if they have attempted suicide since the initial assessment session. If utilizing our suicide-specific mood induction does optimize the accuracy of these tasks, the post-mood induction scores from the initial assessment session should predict suicide attempts over and above the pre-mood induction scores and other common indicators of suicide risk (e.g., mental health diagnosis, patient prediction, severity of suicidal ideation). The ability to objectively assess latent processes underlying both suicide risk and resilience among Veterans could significantly contribute to Veterans Health Administration efforts to prevent suicide. Furthermore, results of the proposed study, testing a critical component of one of the field?s most prominent models of suicidal behavior, would inform future research on when, why, and how Veterans are at risk for suicide."
"9423436","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skeletal unloading results in a cessation in bone formation and an initial increase in bone resorption. These changes are accompanied by resistance to the anabolic actions of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) on bone. On the other hand skeletal loading increases IGF1 production, and enhances IGF1 activation of IGF1R as part of the mechanism by which it increases bone formation. In seeking a mechanism for the load induced regulation of IGF1 signaling we discovered that skeletal unloading was associated with a decrease in the expression of integrins, in particular integrins with b1 (IGTB1) and b3 (ITGB3) subunits. We discovered that in osteoblasts, IGF1 increased the binding of ITGB3 to IGF1R, and that if ITGB3 were downregulated, IGF1 could no longer activate IGF1R. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and/or its related family member protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta (PTK2B) provide a link between the integrin and growth factor receptor pathways including between ITGB3 and IGF1R. IGF1 activation of IGF1R results in phosphorylation (presumed activation) of FAK, whereas inhibition of FAK blocks activation of IGF1R either by IGF1 or by load. To test the role of IGF1 signaling directly in vivo we developed mice in which the IGF1R was deleted in mature osteoblasts and examined whether this mouse would respond to skeletal unloading or reloading. Mice lacking IGF1R showed an equivalent decrease in bone formation during unloading to controls, but failed to increase bone formation during reloading. The striking result, however, was that this failure to respond to reloading was found only in periosteal bone formation; endosteal and trabecular bone formation responded comparable to controls. These results focused our attention on the periosteum where the osteoprogenitors are exposed not only to load induced IGF1 emanating from both osteocytes and muscle, but to the integrin ligand periostin, a combination we hypothesize will maximize their proliferation, differentiation, and formation of new bone in response to mechanical load. In this project we will test the hypothesis that skeletal loading stimulates IGF1 production in osteocytes and muscle and formation of the IGF1R/integrin complex in periosteal osteoprogenitors (pOP) required for the IGF1 mediated anabolic response of these cells to load. This will be achieved in the following three aims: Aim1--Determine the components of the IGF1R complex that forms in response to load and/or IGF1 in periosteal cells in vitro, and assess their role in contributing to that response; Aim 2-- Determin the impact of deleting Igf1r and Itgb3 from pOP in vivo with respect to their ability to mediate th skeletal response to load; Aim 3--Determine the source(s) of IGF1 facilitating load induced periosteal bone formation with particular attention to osteocytes and muscle. We will be utilizing novel animal models and state of the art techniques to fulfill these aims. The results will provide new understanding of how IGF1/integrin signaling interactions regulate the skeletal response to mechanical load, open up new avenues for further investigation, and provide potential targets for preventing the bone loss of immobilization and aging."
"9393529","Project Summary / Abstract Background: The postpartum experience of preterm mothers is unlike the biological norm, and their sleep experience is poorly understood. Preterm mothers are physically separated from their infants, and few report waking through the night to pump breast milk, which may contribute to breast milk insufficiency. Breast milk insufficiency is common, and many preterm mothers cannot pump enough milk to meet their infant's needs. Despite this common obstacle, and the benefits of sleep to overall health, the relationship between objective maternal sleep measures and subsequent milk volume has never been explored. When a preterm mother experiences milk insufficiency, donor milk is prescribed; however, pasteurized donor milk contains no commensal bacteria, which are associated with improved neonatal outcomes. Milk microbiota profiles are highly variable between women, and some profiles are more protective. Factors that influence milk microbiota are poorly understood, though emerging evidence suggests a diurnal influence. Subject Population: Breastfeeding mothers with hospitalized preterm infants. Design: Maternal sleep characteristics and milk profiles (microbiota and volume) will be examined in this longitudinal, prospective, observational study. Methods: Subjects will wear an Actiwatch 2 (Philips Respironics) and complete daily sleep and pumping logs before discharge from the hospital. Once breast milk has come in and for one week, two daily breast milk samples (one daytime, one nighttime) will be collected. Bacterial DNA will be extracted from breast milk samples, 16S rRNA PCR amplification will be performed, and amplicons will be sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Analysis: Group-based trajectory analysis will be applied to identify distinct sleep and milk profile patterns. Relevance to NINR: Neonatal Intensive Care nurses are directly involved in both: 1) the support of new mothers (including sleep hygiene), and 2) breast milk administration (tracking, storage, measurement, fortification, and preparation). This study will inform future strategies related to sleep support and personalized breast milk for preterm infants.  "
"9299366","Project Summary/Abstract Our current ability to detect infants at-risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs) such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that cannot be readily identified through screening for biological markers offers several unique opportunities for understanding the emergence of ND symptoms. Particularly important is the opportunity to test the extent to which very early interventions may prevent NDs from emerging or minimize the functional impairments of NDs. Extensive research demonstrates positive associations between parent responsiveness and social-communication outcomes in children with NDs. However, the effects of early interventions designed to improve outcomes for infants/toddlers at risk for or diagnosed with NDs by increasing parent responsiveness have been highly variable. Thus, the available evidence does not provide clear evidence on whether parent responsiveness interventions improve infant/toddler social-communication development, and why or why not. The current project involves a ?proof of concept? evaluation of a newly developed intervention for infants identified as at-risk for NDs through a community screening. This intervention, Parents and Infants Engaged (PIE), is designed to directly impact parent responses to behaviors commonly observed in infants at-risk for NDs that, in the absence of intervention, may not elicit parental responses that promote infants' social- communication development. PIE includes two key content domains: (a) attuning parent responses to infants' behavior reactions to sensory stimuli, including hypo (under)-reactions and hyper (over)-reactions; and (b) attuning parent responses to infants' prelinguistic communicative behaviors, including lower-level behaviors that are not clearly directed to the parent and higher-level behaviors by which infants are clearly intending to communicate with the parent. Study Phase 1 evaluates the separate impact of each domain on infant joint engagement with parents by randomizing 40 infants at-risk for NDs (ages 9 ? 15 months) and a parent of each infant to either the Sensory Reactivity or Prelinguistic Communication domain of PIE. A trained PIE coach will facilitate parents' observations and interpretation of their infants' behaviors relevant to the PIE domain to which each dyad was randomized. The coach also will collaborate with parents to explore different parental responses to infant behaviors, and evaluate whether different parent responses help the infants engage better with the environment and their parents. In Study Phase 2, each dyad will be coached on the PIE component to which they were not exposed in Study Phase 1 (along with continued coaching on the PIE domain addressed in Study Phase 1). Study Phase 2 evaluates the combined effects of the full PIE intervention on parent responsiveness and infant engagement and intentional communication, compared to Pretest and to the effects found for the separate domains of PIE examined in Study Phase 1. The study also examines the impact of PIE on physiological measures associated with infants' ability to regulate their own arousal levels."

These defects are a significant public health problem affecting Americans and further, may go undetected but increase the risk of chronic diseases later in life. Since its inception, the GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) has provided a framework and repository for extensive expression data to provide a molecular anatomy of genitourinary development in the mouse with the long-term goal to harness and share our knowledge of urogenital development to forge innovative new approaches to treat disease. This work has advanced our understanding of subpopulations and patterning events in the developing nephron, lower urinary tract, and gonads. A deep understanding of the molecular drivers of kidney formation serves to inform current efforts in the field to create kidney organoids for therapeutic and disease studies. We propose to operate a GUDMAP Database that will facilitate a coordinated, focused, adaptive and interactive program of research by several groups, yielding results faster than a static collection of independent research projects. Coordination across the research consortium demands the ability to rapidly integrate new research projects, communicate results, and share knowledge and data across the consortium. Our work will generate connections between mouse and human data to link function to disease and thus identify potential causal and therapeutic targets. By providing tools to coalesce and link disparate datasets, we will provide efficient and easy methods to pose questions and further research. The GUDMAP Database will conduct meta- analysis to produce both informative ways to use the tools we build, and propose new testable hypotheses regarding urogenital development and disease. Our proposed GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) Database that will: 1) create organizational structure and processes that will enable seamless and frequent communication and collaboration between GUDMAP researchers, the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the broader research community; 2) create a highly usable database that will empower changing collections of researchers to rapidly upload, organize, and search heterogeneous data types; 3) build a comprehensive toolkit for data annotation, curation, analysis, visualization, and cross validation; 4) broaden the research community and create a framework for targeted shorter term research results by establishing an opportunity pool program; 5) disseminate consortium resources to the wider research community. In total, the impact of these elements of the GUDMAP will accelerate the rate of discovery within the consortium and the broader community."

"9317159","PROJECT SUMMARY Esophageal atresia (EA) is the most common congenital disorder of the esophagus with a world-wide incidence of about 1 in 3,500 live births. EA can occur as an isolated finding, or in combination with other developmental anomalies. Left untreated, EA is a fatal disorder because the atretic segment obstructs the esophagus. Fortunately, surgical correction of EA is possible in infancy. EA is thus curable in the vast majority of cases. Unfortunately most EA patients suffer from significant gastroesophageal reflux and dysphagia post- operatively as a result of impaired esophageal motility. The cause of EA is not known, however its frequent occurrence as part of complex developmental syndromes, and its higher incidence in monozygotic vs. dizygotic twins argues in favor of genetic factors. No single gene mutations have been conclusively shown to cause EA in humans. We have developed the first animal model of isolated EA occurring without other developmental anomalies by engineering a mutation in the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene (Myh11) that we have previously shown alters myosin regulation. In zebrafish, the identical mutation causes invasive expansion of the intestine. In mice the predominant phenotype is EA, although invasive-like intestinal lesions are detected. The mutation disrupts smooth muscle contractility as a result of altered myosin regulation. This suggests that genetic variants in MYH11 and other smooth muscle regulatory genes could cause both EA and account for post-surgical esophageal motility disorders. The goal of this proposal is to explore both the mechanism of EA in the Myh11 mouse model and to identify novel genetic variants in EA patients using exome sequencing."
"9393384","Project Summary/Abstract  In the United States, more than 10% of mothers, or 8.5 million, live in poverty, placing the mothers in conditions of chronic situational stress. Low income mothers are exposed to chronic situational stress, due in part to the economic hardship and additional stressors associated with the responsibilities of motherhood. Exposure to economic hardship is associated with higher reports of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, and cognitive dysfunction, known as the psychoneurological symptoms. These symptoms can significantly impair a mother by interfering with her ability to function and mother. Compromises to a mother's functioning places her children at higher lifetime risks of impaired cognitive and emotional development; infants and toddlers are the most vulnerable to these consequences. To date, attempts to intervene on situational stress-related symptoms in low income mothers have focused on depressive symptoms. These interventions have met with varied levels of efficacy. The limited efficacy may be because interventions addressing depressive symptoms do not include pain, which is experienced by 50% of low income mothers. An alternative and novel approach is to reconceptualize the stress-related symptoms as psychoneurological symptoms in order to consider underlying biological mechanisms that could be targeted by interventions.  The proposed study will describe psychoneurological symptoms in a sample of low income mothers under chronic situational stress and determine the associations of the symptoms with situational stress and with maternal and child outcomes. This study will be a secondary analysis of data from 356 low income mothers and will combine the data from two parent studies conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The proposed study will analyze key variables of situational stress, psychoneurological symptoms, maternal functioning, and child behavior and development. The project has three aims: to describe the intensity of the psychoneurological symptoms by comparing a simple, data-naïve approach (composite score) against a complex, innovative data-driven approach (reduced rank regression); to use multiple regression analyses to explore how variations in levels of chronic situational stress are associated with intensity of psychoneurological symptoms; and to use multiple regression analyses to determine the relationship of psychoneurological symptoms to mother's functional status (physical functioning, social functioning, role functioning, mothering) and child behavioral and developmental status.  This study addresses NINR's Innovative Questions in Symptom Science concerning the impact of adverse symptoms across diverse populations by researching the behavioral dynamics of symptoms (1-1) and how lifestyle factors and environmental conditions impact symptoms (1-3). The findings from this study will be the first step towards determining personalized biomarkers of psychoneurological symptoms and, eventually, developing targeted symptom management interventions to improve quality of life for the mothers."

"9403691","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposes training and research designed to provide the candidate with a foundation to establish a successful career as an independent investigator with expertise in biobehavioral research on dimensions of neurocognition and negative affectivity that underlie eating disorder psychopathology. The training and research goals of this application are consistent with Strategy 1.4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan to develop new ways of classifying psychopathology for research based on behavioral and neurobiological dimensions. The candidate seeks advanced training in three areas: (1) dimensional and multi-method approaches to studying and classifying psychopathology, (2) neurocognition and associated tasks, and (3) neurobiology and the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study theoretically relevant neurocircuitry in eating disorders. Training will be guided by an interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants and will involve formal (e.g., coursework, workshops) and informal (e.g., directed readings, mentoring meetings) activities across the funding period. The research plan proposes two studies to elucidate the role of neurocognitive and affective variables in eating disorder psychopathology. In the first study, dimensions of neurocognition (e.g., response inhibition, decision making) and negative affectivity (e.g., emotional reactivity, distress tolerance) will be examined in a broad sample of 80 women recruited from community and clinical settings who present with a range of clinically significant forms of eating disorder psychopathology. Participants will complete semi-structured interviews, self-report measures, and behavioral tasks to examine the extent to which the neurocognitive and affective dimensions are associated with cognitive and behavioral manifestations of eating disorder psychopathology. In the second study, a sample of 24 participants comprised of women with clinically significant eating disorder psychopathology involving binge eating (n=12) and non-eating disorder controls (n=12) will complete an fMRI protocol assessing resting-state activity and task-evoked activity associated with response inhibition and processing of negative affective stimuli. This study will provide data on neurocircuitry associated with inhibitory contro and affective functioning in eating disorder presentations characterized by binge eating. Importantly, these results may inform efforts to refine existing eating disorder treatments and develop new interventions targeting the biobehavioral variables under investigation. In sum, the advanced training goals and research proposed in this application will facilitate the candidate's success in becoming an independent investigator in patient-oriented research, with particular expertise in the field of eating disorders, as well as associated methodological and statistical approaches consistent with a novel program of research on dimensions of biobehavioral functioning underlying eating disorder psychopathology."
"9407746","We aim to develop a transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound simulator on a physical mannequin for realistic medical training and professional competence testing. The Specific Aims of the project are: 1. Develop a prototype TCD simulator. The anatomy of the cerebrovascular system (CVS) will be reconstructed in three dimensional (3D) from a patient?s computed tomography angiogram (CTA). The blood flow velocity at points within the CVS will be defined using computational flow modeling and used to generate the Doppler spectral waveform simulation for the TCD. 2. Develop a prototype transcranial color Doppler simulator by generating 2D B- mode ultrasound images from the CTA. Color Doppler images will be generated in real time from the flow model as in our vascular Doppler simulator. 3. Verify the accuracy of the simulation by comparing blood flow velocity measured from the simulator waveforms with the true velocities in the 3D models. We will verify the clinical realism of the simulation by comparing spectral Doppler waveforms measured on the simulator with patient Doppler spectral waveforms. This research will benefit health care by expanding patient access to TCD, a recommended diagnostic procedure, by helping to increase the number of providers trained to perform TCD. Wider use of evidence based applications of TCD will help avoid invasive and more expensive alternative diagnostic tests. This research is applicable both to underserved patients ? those with sickle cell disease -- and to large patient populations because stroke is the fifth leading cause of death for Americans and TCD has critical applications in the management of ischemic as well as hemorrhagic strokes."
"9518358","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our daily rhythms in gene expression and metabolism are driven by the circadian oscillator, a biological timer composed of auto-regulatory transcriptional/translational feedback loops. However, molecular regulation and function of core clock components, in particular Period2 (Per2), are not fully understood. Two reporter mouse lines were previously generated, both expressing PER2:LUC fusion proteins from the endogenous Per2 promoter. Whereas the endogenous Per2 3'-UTR remains intact in Per2:Luc mice, it was replaced by an SV40 poly(A) signal in Per2:LucSV mice. Intriguingly, the latter exhibited significantly enhanced circadian amplitude and peak levels of PER2:LUC protein and bioluminescence. Further analysis identified a miR-24 binding site in the 3'-UTR, suggesting an important role of miR-24 in PER2 translation. Furthermore, robust induction of Per2 and Bmal1 transcript levels were observed in Per2:LucSV mice relative to Per2:Luc, suggesting a positive activation role of PER2 in its own transcription. Consistent with the predominant role of the clock in metabolic regulation, preliminary data also illustrated activation of several metabolic regulators in Per2:LucSV mice. Based on these interesting findings, it is hypothesized that PER2 protein levels are controlled by miR-24, and PER2 plays a positive role in Per2 transcription and circadian metabolic function.  Aim 1. Determine the pivotal role of miR-24 in PER2 translational regulation and mouse circadian behavior. The 3'-UTR miR-24 binding site in the Per2:Luc knock-in vector was mutated, and candidate targeted ES cell clones were obtained following electroporation. Mutant differentiated cells (Aim 1A) and knock-in mice (Aim 1B) will be derived to examine reporter rhythms, molecular clock and circadian behavior.  Aim 2. Delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the positive role of PER2 in Per2 auto- regulation. Based on previous ChIP-seq studies showing Per2 promoter recruitment of both positive (CBP) and negative (REV-ERBs) regulators, molecular studies will be conducted to investigate whether PER2 functions to relieve REV-ERB-dependent Per2 transcriptional repression (Aim 2A), and/or to potentiate CBP- mediated transcriptional activation (Aim 2B).  Aim 3. Determine the molecular function of PER2 in energy metabolism. Genetic disruption of the clock leads to insulin resistance and metabolic deficits. To address the reciprocal hypothesis whether enhanced PER2 and circadian rhythms confers metabolic protection, molecular and physiological studies will be conducted to determine whether insulin signaling, a central regulatory pathway for energy metabolism, is activated in Per2:LucSV mice (Aim 3A), and whether these mice are resistant to high-fat diet induced circadian and metabolic abnormalities (Aim 3B)."
"9312656","Project Summary/Abstract Our long-term goal in this project is to elucidate the molecular and cellular biology for Ewing Sarcoma development and translate this knowledge into advances for pediatric cancer. Ewing sarcoma, the second most common pediatric malignant bone tumor, is characterized by a chromosomal translocation t(11;22). The resulting fusion oncoprotein EWS/FLI is an aberrant transcription factor necessary for oncogenic transformation in Ewing cells. EWS acts as an amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain linked to the carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain of its ETS family member partner in crime, FLI. Microsatellite repeats characterized by the motif GGAA serve as binding sites for EWS/FLI within the promoters of upregulated target genes in Ewing Sarcoma. Previously thought of as ?junk DNA,? these polymorphic microsatellites serve as response elements for EWS/FLI DNA binding with interesting genetic correlations and possible clinical implications. Though EWS/FLI both activates and represses numerous target genes directly and indirectly, how EWS/FLI distinguishes whether to up or down regulate gene expression remains undetermined. Therefore, the experiments proposed herein aim to test the hypothesis that EWS/FLI induces oncogenic transformation and regulation of transcriptional activation via GGAA microsatellites whose length dictates both binding and effector function. Thus our aims are: 1) Determine to what extent GGAA microsatellites function as enhancer response elements and 2) Determine the role of GGAA motif length in transcriptional activation in Ewing Sarcoma. This project is an important approach to pediatric cancer because it provides a model of understanding oncogenic transcriptional regulation necessary for biomarker and therapeutic development to improve patient care and overall survival."
"9330215","Deep brain stimulation (DES) of the subthalamic nucleus is a useful treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its therapeutic mechanism is unknown. Effective DES requires high frequency stimulation, well above the average firing rate of basal ganglia output neurons. Periodicity of DES is also essential; random stimulation patterns at the same mean frequency are ineffective. Three mechanisms for its effect on basal ganglia output neurons have been proposed. DES may correct a pathological change in: (1) firing rate of basal ganglia output cells and their targets in the thalamus, (2) bursting or oscillations of those cells, or (3) the degree to which the firing of the cells are correlated. Neither the rate nor the bursting model for the action of DES adequately explains either the frequency or periodicity requirements. We have shown that a periodically-driven oscillator model of basal ganglia output cells exhibits a sequence of synchronizing entrainment and then failure of entrainment and desynchrony as the frequency of an excitatory stimulus is increased. In this model, the range of stimulus frequency, intensity and periodicity required for chaotic desynchronization matches that of the therapeutic effectiveness of DES. This application will test our desynchronization hypothesis by measuring the degree of correlation among pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons in slices of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) during application of DES-like natural and artificial synaptic conductances. Aim 1 will test the fundamental mechanisms at work in the model using purely excitatory input. Aim 2 will add an inhibitory component to the synaptic input, and test our method for designing the optimal stimulus. Aim 3 will determine the influence of inhibitory coupling between output neurons on normal firing patterns and during DES. Aim 4 will determine whether the cellular dynamics or synaptic connections underlying DES are altered after chronic dopamine depletion. Our model offers a mechanistic explanation of DES and its properties, and a mathematical model that can be used to predict the effects of future DES-like stimulation therapies. At this point, the model has not been validated, and this proposal will provide a test of the proposed mechanism. If it survives experimental test, our idea may be useful for explaining DES and for designing future stimulation therapies."
"9371991","Abstract: In the past decade waterpipe smoking (WP; hookah) has become the No. 1 tobacco use method among youth in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), yet evidence-based solutions to the WP epidemic continue to lag behind. This is mainly due to 2 factors; 1) the mismatch of policy solutions derived from cigarettes to local tobacco use methods such as the WP; and 2) the lack of understanding of local tobacco control (TC) policy environment and challenges to implementation. On the other hand, the WHO?s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) ratified by most countries in the EMR provides an opportunity to address WP smoking in the region. Supported by program TOBAC since its beginning in 2002, our team at the Syrian Center for Tobacco Studies (SCTS) has been on the forefront of characterizing the WP epidemic and its health and addictive properties. Such groundwork has prepared us to plan for the next stage of translating evidence into policy to support EMR efforts to control the WP epidemic. Given the widespread misperceptions that WP is less harmful and addictive than cigarettes, and the value of health warning labels (HWLs) in communicating smoking-related risks, the development of HWLs is a priority for WP control. Developing HWLs for the WP however, requires their adaptation to its unique multi-part context comprised of tobacco, device and charcoal, while implementation of WP-HWLs requires an understanding of the local policy environment, and strong national partnerships. Building on our ongoing collaboration with Lebanon (American University of Beirut) and Tunisia (University of Tunis), we want to assist these countries in developing and implementing effective HWLs for the WP and in building their national capacity in TC policy research. We will apply a mixed method approach to develop and test HWLs with the involvement of members of the target population comprised mostly of young adults (18-25 years). We will also study the structure and functioning of local health systems in Tunisia and Lebanon, so we can propose a clear roadmap for the implementation of WP-HWLs, and establish partnerships among researchers and policymakers than can facilitate such implementation. This application represents our team?s continuing leadership in responding to the WP epidemic, and in strengthening TC capacity in the EMR. It will help Tunisia and Lebanon, and perhaps other countries develop effective HWLs for WP, and equip them with the means to implement them successfully."
"9373776","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is member of the herpesvirus family that is widely distributed in the human population and responsible for significant health problems, particularly in immune-compromised individuals and in newborns exposed to the virus during pregnancy or birth. Understanding the immune response to HCMV infection, and in particular the major targets of the neutralizing antibody response, is of great interest as efforts to develop an effective vaccine are of high priority. Recent studies have shown that one of the most potent targets of the neutralizing antibody response is an assembly of 5 HCMV glycoproteins, gH, gL, UL128, UL130 and UL131, into a `pentameric' complex, which is responsible for broadening the infectivity of the virus to endothelial, epithelial and myeloid cells. The gH and gL proteins are part of the core herpesvirus membrane fusion and entry machinery, while the UL proteins represent virus-specific adaptors that modulate cell tropism. Low resolution electron microscopy studies of HCMV gHgL, pentamer and antibody complexes have been reported, providing insight into the overall shape of the pentamer and the locations of neutralizing antibody epitopes. However, no high resolution structures have been determined, limiting our insights into the overall folding and architecture of the gHgL pentamer as well as the relationship between neutralizing antibody epitopes and neutralization potency. Here we will determine the structures of HCMV pentamer in complex with representative neutralizing antibodies. In addition, we will map key gHgL and UL protein residues involved in pentamer assembly, antibody binding and gHgL functions, using cell surface library display approaches. Results generated from this proposal will deepen our understanding of the HCMV entry machinery, facilitate the identification of HCMV entry receptors, and provide key fundamental knowledge for the development of vaccine antigens and small molecule inhibitors to prevent HCMV infection."

"9383708","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Mendelsohn, Cathy Lee Project Summary The urothelium is an epithelial barrier that prevents exchange of water and toxic substances between the blood and urinary tract. It is composed of basal cells, Intermediate cells and a luminal layer of superficial cells. Superficial cells are specialized for synthesis and transport of uroplakins, a family of proteins that assemble into the crystalline apical plaque that is the functional urothelial barrier. Superficial cells have a number of interesting features; they are enormous, generally binucleated and are polyploid. The urothelium is one of the most quiescent epithelia in the body, but quickly regenerates in response to acute damage, for example from urinary tract infection. Chronic injury however, from repeated exposure to toxins such as cyclophosphamide, can lead to barrier compromise, inflammation and disease such as bladder pain syndrome, a life altering condition for which there is no cure at present. These proposed studies build on previous findings from our lab that identify novel urothelial progenitors that are important for development and regeneration. In the present application, we will use lineage analysis and an organ culture together with live imaging to visualize the behavior of adult wild type and mutant urothelial progenitors. We will pursue preliminary studies suggesting that Basal cells, which are unipotent during acute injury, acquire the potential to produce Intermediate and Superficial cell daughters after chronic injury. We identify Pparg, a nuclear receptor best known for its role in adipogenesis, as a potential target of Retinoids, and we show that Pparg is critical for formation and regeneration of Superficial cells, and also regulates basal cell homeostasis, preventing squamous differentiation. Besides its critical role in human health, the urothelium is a also source of cells that give rise to different types of bladder cancers. Identification of urothelial progenitors and the signaling pathways that control them will be important for developing therapeutic strategies for regeneration and repair, and for understanding how urothelial differentiation can go wrong."
"9388404","Heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and peripheral artery disease (PAD) have emerged as  important cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) contributing to the increasing burden of chronic diseases and  escalating health care costs in the United States and globally. Recent advances in metabolomics  have allowed investigators to assay hundreds of metabolites from a small volume of blood,  providing a comprehensive  picture of an individual?s metabolic status that may underlie the  effects of diet on disease risk. However, few studies have assessed the association between  metabolite profiles and risk of HF, AF, and PAD. In this competing rewewal application, we propose  a nested case-control design to conduct targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses of incident  cases of HF (n=332), AF (n=594), and PAD (n=196) and matched controls in a cohort of 7,447  participants during the active intervention and extended follow-up periods (2003-2018) in the  PREDIMED trial. Our specific aims are: 1). To examine the associations between approximately 400  known metabolites at baseline and risk of HF, AF, and PAD, using a nested case-control design. 2).  To conduct pathway analysis and agnostic network modeling that integrate non-targeted metabolites  with known metabolites to identify novel metabolomic signatures of risk of HF, AF, and PAD. 3). To  assess whether the randomized dietary interventions modify the effect of baseline metabolite  profiles on HF, AF, and PAD risk.  In addition, we will explore both unique and common metabolites  and metabolic pathways associated with incident HF, AF, and PAD and will replicate novel  metabolites identified in the PREDIMED cohort in the  Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)  study, an independent multi-ethnic cohort in the US. This competing renewal application represents  an extension of our long-standing research on the Mediterranean  diet and CVD to new clinical  endpoints in the context of the landmark PREDIMED trial. This research has important implications  for the US population because the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend the  Mediterranean diet as one of healthy dietary patterns for CVD prevention. The current cycle of the  grant  has been highly productive with 11 papers published or submitted, contributing to new  knowledge about mechanisms underlying diet and CVD and new statistical methods for analyzing  nutritional metabolomics data. This competing renewal, built on the numerous strengths of the  PREDIMED trial and a multi-disciplinary and cohesive team, has the potential to advance our  understanding of CVD pathophysiology and produce knowledge that can directly inform specific  dietary interventions to prevent overall CVD and its subtypes."
"9375166","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The human microbiota has co-evolved with the human host. Over the past decade, the scientific community has surveyed the composition of the these human microbial communities, sequenced the content of many human microbial genomes, identified associations between microbiome states and disease, and begun to uncover mechanisms by which these microbial cells function as a community and contribute to human health. However, we still have a limited understanding of how the human microbiome is passed from one generation to the next and what mechanisms govern the processes of infant microbiome assembly and early microbiome development. Prenatal and early-life environmental exposures, including those that impact microbiome development, appear to play important roles in subsequent metabolic programming and growth. The etiology of the underlying imbalance in energy homeostasis that leads to obesity is complex, resulting from interactions between individual behaviors, environmental factors and genetic susceptibility; and, we hypothesize that maternal microbiome dysbiosis and impairment in microbiome establishment contribute to obesity risk in offspring. In our Human Microbiome Project-funded initiatives, we previously studied how the microbiome impacts pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. We and others have identified vaginal microbiome profiles associated with health states and established that the vaginal microbiome changes in pregnancy with a shift towards lower diversity and Lactobacillus dominance; this shift likely represents the evolutionary role of preventing vertical ascension of microorganisms to the intrauterine environment. Our central hypothesis is that the composition of the maternal microbiome at birth is central to the passage of the microbiome to the neonate and impacts microbiome establishment of the child. In this pilot project, we pursue three Specific Aims by reassessing ~100 three-year-old children born vaginally at term and their mothers who participated in the Multi- Omic Microbiome Study-Pregnancy Initiative and enrolled in the Research Alliance for Microbiome Science Registry. In Aim 1, we will characterize the relations between the maternal vaginal and gut microbiome prior to delivery and the child's gut microbiome at age 3 years among mother-child pairs who experienced term vaginal delivery using metagenomics and 16S rRNA-based approaches. In Aim 2, we will assess whether intrapartum maternal antibiotic exposure modulates the relations between maternal vaginal-gut microbiome and the child's gut microbiome at age 3 years. In Aim 3, we will seek to identify candidate gut microbiome signatures that discriminate stool samples from children with overweight/obesity from matched healthy-weight controls and to explore associations between child weight status at age 3 years and maternal microbiome exposure at birth. These exploratory studies will provide a characterization of host-microbiome interactions from early pregnancy to early childhood and may lead to new interventions to modulate microbiome development."
"9339469","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         A number of pharmacologic or genetic interventions have been shown to prevent the development of fibrosis following the intratracheal administration of bleomycin, a commonly used model for the study of lung fibrosis. These studies have provided important mechanistic insights into the development of pulmonary fibrosis and have identified both transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) and peroxsome prolifeator-activated receptor- gamma (PPAR-g) as important mediators of fibrosis. We have shown that preventing the degradation of PPAR- g in response to TGF-b impairs the expression of collagen and other profibrotic genes in normal human lung fibroblasts, lung fibroblasts from patients with pulmonary fibrosis, skin fibroblasts from patients with scleroderma and mice treated with bleomycin. In addition, we have generated preliminary data suggesting that TGF-b induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to the degradation of PPAR-g and are required for a full TGF-b transcriptional response. We hypothesize that TGF-b-induced mitochondrial ROS via Smad3 activation through the ALK5 receptor. These mitochondrially derived ROS activate downstream kinases and induce the degradation of PPAR-g to amplify the expression of TGF-b dependent genes. We propose to test these hypotheses in a series of experiments in vitro, in animal models of acute lung injury/fibrosis and with alveolar fluid from patients with pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS. Aim-1: To determine the mechanism by which TGF-b induces the generation of mitochondrial ROS. Aim-2: To determine the mechanism by which mitochondrial ROS modulate TGF-b-induced gene transcription. Aim-3: To determine whether fibroblast specific mitochondrial ROS are required for the development of lung fibrosis in murine models and the importance of mitochondrial ROS in TGF-b-mediated gene expression in patients with lung fibrosis. This application represents a highly innovative effort that employs molecular tools in cell culture systems and sophisticated mouse models to elucidate the mechanisms by which mitochondrial ROS regulate the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data support the feasibility of the proposed experiments and provide support for our focus on the TGF-b mediated regulation of PPAR-g via induction of mitochondrial ROS. The composition of our research group and all of the proposed experiments are designed to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung fibrosis."
"9393069","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the US with cardiovascular (CV) disease representing a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Exposure to air pollution represents a common risk factor for COPD and CV disease. People in the US spend the majority of their time indoors and our research group has shown that high indoor particulate matter (PM) concentrations are linked to worse COPD morbidity. Evidence suggests that platelet activation, long implicated in CV disease, may play a role in the pathophysiologic consequences of PM exposure. PM exposure has been associated with elevated markers of platelet activation in mice, healthy subjects and those with CV disease. Elevated markers of platelet activation have also been reported in patients with stable and exacerbated COPD. However, whether PM exposure is associated with increased platelet activation in patients with COPD, a population particularly at-risk for high air pollution exposures, and whether platelet activation plays a role in COPD morbidity remains unknown. We hypothesize that exposure to elevated indoor PM concentrations is associated with increased platelet activation and that platelet activation is associated with respiratory and CV morbidity among patients with COPD. To study the potential role of activated platelets in response to PM exposure and in COPD morbidity, we propose adding repeated measurement of markers of platelet activation in 100 former smokers with moderate-severe COPD enrolled in a study (CLEAN Air) to investigate the effect of an indoor air purifier intervention on COPD morbidity that includes intermediate CV outcomes as part of a sub- study (CLEAN Air Heart). This proposal has two novel aims. First, to determine the association between indoor PM concentrations and platelet activation among individuals with COPD, we will add measurement of three markers of platelet activation (11-dehydro-thromboxane B2, soluble P-selectin, and soluble CD40 ligand) at each of three visits (baseline, 3 and 6 months) while capitalizing on the quantification of environmental exposures and clinical phenotyping performed as part of the parent study. Second, to determine the association of platelet activation with respiratory morbidity and intermediate CV outcomes in patients with COPD, we will examine the association of the measured markers of platelet activation with respiratory outcomes such as lung function, symptoms, six-minute walk distance, and quality of life, and intermediate CV outcomes such as endothelial dysfunction, vascular stiffness and elevated pulmonary artery pressure. We will exploit the extensive characterization of participants' comorbidities in the parent studies while expanding CV phenotyping by newly measuring pulmonary artery diameter (to evaluate right heart strain) and coronary artery calcium (to quantify coronary artery disease). If we find that platelet activation is associated with PM exposure or COPD morbidity, future investigation of antiplatelet therapy as a potential therapeutic target in patients with COPD would be warranted."

"9398786","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the great hallmarks of evolution is the enclosure of genetic information in the nucleus. This spatial separation creates the necessity for efficient communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which is achieved through the selective transport of folded proteins and of protein/nucleic acid complexes across the double membrane of the nuclear envelope (NE). The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the sole gateway that allows passage of macromolecules through the NE, making this transport organelle an essential machine for eukaryotic life. NPCs are embedded in circular pores permeating the NE and can accomplish the bidirectional transport of particles of up to ~40 nm in diameter and at a rate of several hundred events per second. Electron microscopic studies have revealed that the NPC consists of a central core with an 8-fold rotational symmetry across a nucleo-cytoplasmic axis and a two-fold rotational symmetry across the plane of the NE. This symmetric core links to cytoplasmic filaments and a nuclear basket structure. The NPC is built from approximately 30 distinct proteins, termed nucleoporins (nups) that are organized into six distinct subcomplexes. Each nup is present in the NPC in multiple copies such that the entire assembly reaches the extraordinary molecular mass of ~60 MDa in yeast and even more in vertebrates. The NPC functions not just as a transport channel, but has a comprehensive role in other modes of gene regulation, for example through direct interaction with the transcription and mRNA export machineries. As such, it is less surprising that NPC dysfunction has been observed in a diverse set of human illnesses, such as neoplastic or retroviral disease. These associations as well as the NPC's existential role in eukaryotic cell biology have motivated investigations into its detailed architecture. The NPC's size and flexibility along with the unavailability of sufficient quantities of suitable material presently preclude the crystallographi determination of the structure of the entire intact NPC in one piece. An alternative approach proposed herein seeks to elucidate the atomic architecture of the NPC through recombinant reconstitution and crystallographic characterization of NPC subcomplexes, which constitute the physiological building blocks of the intact NPC in vivo. Combined with electron microscopic reconstruction, biochemical protein-protein interaction maps and cellular assays, this strategy is designed to lead to a composite pseudo-atomic model for the entire NPC and provide a roadmap for comprehensive structure-function analyses. As such, the outcome of the proposed research is expected to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the involvement of the NPC in nucleocytoplasmic transport and other cellular processes, while at the same time creating a mechanistic basis for currently untreatable nucleoporin diseases. Furthermore, the methodologies developed herein will challenge the current boundaries of structural cell biology and serve as a paradigm for other large macromolecular assemblies with essential cellular roles whose functional mechanism has remained elusive due to lack of structural insight."
"9404078","Abstract South African young women (YW) have annual HIV incidence rates of 5-10% in recent HIV prevention trials. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a strategy with potential to provide high protection against HIV if adherence is high. Two key questions about PrEP delivery to African young women need to be assessed: 1) how to identify and motivate at-risk YW to use PrEP, and 2) how to efficiently support their PrEP adherence. For PrEP uptake, we will evaluate a provider-driven approach based on behavioral and clinical risk assessment through the VOICE risk score, and a patient-directed approach to encourage patients to assess their risks and motivations for PrEP using a decision support tool. We hypothesize that a patient-centered decision tool will result in higher uptake of and adherence to PrEP than a provider-driven approach alone. For PrEP adherence, it is unknown what level and type of adherence support is needed for African YW; some women may be highly adherent with standard brief counseling or two-way SMS, in which case resources would be saved by only using more intensive adherence support for women who are not adherent. We will use a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design to evaluate a stepped PrEP adherence support model that begins with brief counseling, or two-way SMS, both of which are readily scalable, and then assesses the effectiveness of two strategies for more intensive adherence support (drug level feedback and cognitive behavioral counseling) only in those not adherent after 3 months of PrEP use. We hypothesize that if YW are motivated to use PrEP, they will adhere well with simple support through brief counseling, reminders with triage. Those who need additional adherence support will respond to drug level feedback and monthly counseling to address adherence challenges. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Using a randomized design, test whether use of a patient-facing decision- support tool in addition to a provider-administered risk score positively influences PrEP initiation compared to use of a risk score alone. Aim 1a: Evaluate if use of the decision tool affects YW?s risk perception and PrEP initiation; Aim 1b: Determine if the decision tool alters YW?s decision-making and providers? counseling about PrEP. Aim 2. Test, using a SMART design, a stepped model of scalable adherence support strategies in South African young women who initiate PrEP. We will randomize 330 women ages 16-25 in Johannesburg who initiate PrEP to standard of care brief counseling with or without two- way SMS. Adherence will be assessed at month 3 using tenofovir levels to categorize women as ?responders? and ?non-responders.? Non-responders will undergo secondary randomization to quarterly counseling about their drug levels or monthly CBT counseling. The primary outcome will be on PrEP with drug detected at 12 months. In this project, we will determine optimal strategies for facilitating PrEP uptake and scalable adherence support for South African YW, accounting for the greatest number of new HIV infections globally."

"9339490","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and in our veteran population. During the last funding cycle, we have identified several atrial-specifi ion channels including Cav1.3 (1D) L-type Ca2+ channel and small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK or KCa2 channels) which play critical roles in the function of atrial myocytes as well as sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Of clinical importance, we have demonstrated that SK channels are expressed and contribute significantly to the repolarization process in human atrial myocytes.  For the current competing renewal application, we will focus our effort on the subcellular regulation of Ca2+ channels in ventricular myocytes and pacemaking cells. Embedded in our findings and the proposed project are relevant paradigm shifts that may be exploited in developing specific drugs for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Specifically, we will test the central hypothesis that there is isoform-specific differential regulation of L-type Ca2+ current in ventricular myocytes and pacemaking cells by distinct isoforms of adenylyl cyclases (ACs). We will utilize new emerging techniques of live-cell imaging coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) sensors to directly decipher the distinct subcellular localization and activities of different isoforms of ACs not only in ventricular myocytes but also in pacemaking cells. Indeed, we will take advantage of multidisciplinary techniques including in vivo and in vitro electrophysiologic recordings, live-cell imaging, and molecular modeling to determine the subcellular regulation of Ca2+ channels through distinct isoforms of ACs. Our proposed studies will expand our understanding of the specific subcellular localization and regulation of individual Ca2+ channels and how they might coordinate to mediate normal cardiac rhythm in vivo. Understanding the molecular and subcellular regulation of Ca2+ channels in the heart will set the stage for a new and more mechanistic approach for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and SA and AV node dysfunction, a common problem encountered in our veteran population."
"9402137","PROJECT /SUMMARY ABSTRACT My prior training and exposures linked with my long-term goal makes this K43 Emerging Global Award for Developing Countries the ideal opportunity for me to realise my aspiration as an independent researcher in the field of translational genomics in non-communicable diseases. Genetic research in the area of NCDs in general, but particularly in diabetes is very sparse in Africa. I was however opportuned to be part of the only notable diabetes genetic project in West Africa, the Africa America Diabetes Mellitus Study, by which the seed of my interest in genetic research was cultivated. Recently, through the NIH D43 collaborative research-training programme between University of Ibadan and University of Chicago, I was exposed further to the impact of genomics advances in improving diagnostic precision of diabetes. In order to advance my career as independent investigator, I now ask whether acquisition of competency in diagnostic molecular genomics in NCDs, and its application in the clinic setting, can translate into improved diagnostic precision of diabetes, particularly detection of monogenic cause of diabetes as a test case. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes have devastating consequences on African nations such as Nigeria. Contributing to this is very little access to genetic testing resulting in misdiagnosis or, in some cases like monogenic diabetes (MD), non-diagnosis. Consequently, the proportion, spectrum and pattern of undiagnosed MD among patients with commoner types of diabetes in Nigeria remain unknown. It is not known whether identifying and addressing physicians' related barriers to genetic testing could facilitate genotypic description of MD in Nigeria, as a prototype for application of genetic testing to other NCDs. My overall objective for this K43 application is to describe the frequency and spectrum of genetic variants of MD in Nigeria, while I obtain training and competency in diagnostic molecular genomics focused on NCDs, so as to improve diagnostic precision of these conditions and thereby make Ibadan, Nigeria, a referral center for the entire West Africa. My hypothesis is that physicians' related factors constitute significant barriers to application and utility of genetic testing in the clinic, with consequent undiagnosed or misdiagnosed MD among patients with diabetes in Nigerian, who are likely to have different genotypic variants compared to other population. In the research plan, I describe the three specific aims that need to be achieved in the Nigerian setting to move from non-application of genetic testing in the clinic to using the outcome of genetic testing to describe the genotypic spectrum of a previously undiagnosed condition such as MD in Nigeria. The knowledge and experience gained can then be extended to other NCDs and, through training of others, increase capacity and impact the whole of West Africa. First, there is need to identify physicians' related barriers by carrying out surveys among eligible doctors practicing in public health institutions in Ibadan. Secondly, I plan to develop and implement a genomics programme to diagnose and classify diabetes in the clinic through design of a practical, contextualised decision support tool for physicians. Lastly, using a two-step strategy of screening likely patients by a practical guideline and sequencing DNA of selected patients, I will then describe the frequency, spectrum and genotypic pattern of MD among clinic patients with diabetes. In order to be successful at application of genomics to improve diagnostic precision of NCDs in Nigeria, I need further training in genomics, bioinformatics as well as leadership skills required to build a RCE in a LMIC. I have identified and assembled a mentorship committee in these areas and together we have planned a curriculum of courses training programme that will lead me to this end. The K43 award will enable me to develop the competency to independently carry out phenotype-genotype matching in NCDs, and make Ibadan a referral and training centre for other parts of West Africa."
"9315935","This project will develop methods for linking together groups of cells in two brain areas (infralimbic cortex, IL, and basolateral amygdala, BLA). This circuit is related to fear and threat response, and changing it may improve fear regulation. We will do this with electrical brain stimulation, which has also shown promise as a new treatment for severe mental illness. Using rats as a pre-clinical model, we hope to show that we can alter two specific brain areas at a single frequency, as opposed to methods like drugs that act on the whole brain at once. Our Hypothesis is that connectivity will increase from closed loop electrical stimulation ? monitoring one area and stimulating the other when the first becomes active. We believe this will cause the two areas to become strongly wired together. That should mean ensembles of brain cells synchronizing their activity between IL and BLA, especially in the theta (5-12 Hz) band. The Objective is to develop tools that can change brain coupling, then measure the effects of those changes on behavior. For brain connectivity, we will record IL and BLA and measure how strongly the activity in the two areas correlates. We will also inject electrical current into each area and measure how much the other responds. For behavior, we will use a conditioning paradigm where rats learn that a tone predicts an unpleasant electrical shock. We will then apply our electrical stimulations just before rats repeatedly hear the tone without the shock, a process called extinction. If our hypothesis is correct, our plasticity-based stimulations will make the animals more able to remember this new safety memory on later days. We will approach that Objective through two Aims. Aim 1 is time domain: we will make BLA active within a few milliseconds of an increase in IL neuron firing. Aim 2 is frequency domain: we will measure the theta (5- 12 Hz) oscillation in IL, then stimulate with single pulses in BLA when the IL theta reaches a critical phase. These two techniques should change IL-BLA connectivity in different ways, and we will measure the effects of both on electrical connectivity and defensive behavior. We expect to show that Aim 2's approach is better at increasing theta-band synchrony. By looking at multiple types of electrical connectivity, we hope to understand which ones matter for changing behaviors. That should ultimately be relevant for designing better treatments for mood and anxiety disorders."
"9536982","OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY ?Expanded SPF Rhesus Macaque Breeding Colony for AIDS Research? The Indian rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) develops a disease that closely mimics human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) when infected by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or chimeric simian- human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV), and represents the best animal model for HIV infection. Preclinical vaccine development is heavily dependent on the SIV and SHIV rhesus macaque models. The value and utility of the model are markedly enhanced by improving the level of microbial and genetic characterization. Macaques free of ubiquitous viruses that are homologues of human viruses responsible for opportunistic infections are essential for a growing number of AIDS-related opportunistic infection models and for viral vaccine vector development based on these agents. The utility of macaque models for immunological research has been hindered by the unprecedented complexity of their major histocompatibility complexes. Comprehensive MHC genotyping has the potential to revolutionize the use of macaques in infectious disease research and to guide functional immunology studies. MHC-restricted cellular immune responses are key in protective immunity and resistance to infectious diseases. The comprehensive objective of this application is to increase the capacity of the ONPRC AIDS Research Expanded SPF Breeding Colony to provide genetically characterized Indian-origin rhesus macaques free of a broad number of enzootic and zoonotic agents to enhance the usefulness of the resource for cutting edge opportunistic agent and vaccine research."
"9403774","Obesity is a known driver of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and diabetic complications. While white adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy, brown adipose tissue (BAT), through the action of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and a larger thermogenic program, releases energy as heat. BAT is now known to be present and modifiable in adult humans, including the prospect of inducing BAT-like characteristics in WAT (?browning'). Loss of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1a1) function potently induces UCP1, causing browning of WAT and protecting against diet-induced obesity and diabetes, as first we, and subsequently others, have shown in multiple in vivo models. Unlike many BAT-activating targets, ALDH1a1 inhibition decreases both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), although its higher expression in visceral fat does foster pronounced effects in this particularly pathogenic depot. Independent of adiposity, ALDH1a1 deficiency also decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis and steatosis, common T2D abnormalities. ALDH1a1 converts the substrate retinaldehyde (Rald) to retinoic acid (RA). In vitro, either ALDH1a1 inhibition or direct Rald stimulation modulates expression of key thermogenic and gluconeogenic mediators. Data supports a relationship between ALDLH1a1 levels and adiposity in humans. Thus, a strong rationale exists for pursuing ALDH1a1 as a novel therapeutic target for decreasing adiposity and improving T2D, as our interdisciplinary, multiple PI team has undertaken, resulting in the strong preliminary data underlying this application. Aim 1 seeks to optimize, further develop, and test already identified lead small molecule ALDH1a1 inhibitors and Rald mimetics. Initial focus will be on four ALDH1a1 scaffold lead candidates found in our primary chemical library screen (650,000 compounds/validated ALDH1a1 activity assay/nanomolar IC50) using iterative chemical analysis and structural modifications coupled to in vitro and in vivo testing. Since the metabolic benefits of ALDH1a1 inhibition involve increased Rald levels, a novel, orthogonal therapeutic strategy explored here involves synthetic Rald mimetics; lead analogs are already designed, made and induce UCP1 expression. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) and ALDH1a1 co-crystallography will also be leveraged to generate additional insights into ALDH1a1 modulator structure-activity relationships. Aim 2, tightly integrated with Aim 1 compound progression, will test the functional in vitro and in vivo effects of lead ALDH1a1 modulators on diabetes through changes in thermogenesis, energy balance, gluconeogenesis and steatosis. Taken together, ALDH1a1 modulation is well matched to this NIDDK PAR seeking ?early-stage pharmacological validation of novel targets and pre- therapeutic leads?: a new pathway with compelling, validated prior data establishing clinically-relevant, unique effects on critical, unaddressed pathogenic diabetic mechanisms; an interdisciplinary, collaborative team with the requisite background and tools for the proposed work; extensive progress to date, including lead compounds that support ALDH1a1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for treating T2D."
"9363583","ABSTRACT This study addresses a critical gap in the field of HIV neuropathogenesis. Previous investigations of brain integrity during the earliest stages of infection describe two opposing neuroimaging signatures of disease. The inconsistency likely reflects the challenges inherent in conducting this work in the US given the limited access to treatment-naïve individuals in early disease stages (Fiebig I-V). Leveraging a highly unique cohort of acutely infected individuals (AHI) in Thailand, our preliminary data reveals intact brain structure and function in treatment- naïve individuals infected for less than two weeks. However, after two years of suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) initiated within weeks of infection, neuroimaging abnormalities develop in the context of suppressive cART. Further, the degree of brain impairment corresponds to increased levels of monocytes expressing receptors involved in CNS migration and CSF levels of neuronal dysfunction. In this study we will answer the critical question of whether cART is sufficient to halt the detrimental impact of HIV on the brain when initiated within weeks of infection, or whether the brain abnormalities observed in our preliminary analyses progress beyond expectations for HIV- controls despite otherwise successful treatment. This study will overcome limitations in the existing literature because all participants in this study will start cART within days of viral exposure. This work is timely and builds on funded studies that will substantially leverage costs of data acquisition. We will examine longitudinal multimodal imaging outcomes (resting state fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural volumetrics) of AHI (n=60) as well as enrollment and data capture from demographically-similar individuals with chronic HIV infection (CHI; n=40) and HIV- controls (n=40). A mixed model design will determine if individuals with AHI develop brain injury similar to CHI despite suppressive cART and identify key mechanistic predictors to the evolution of brain abnormalities. Confirmation of our preliminary data demonstrating progressive brain abnormalities despite initiation of cART during the earliest possible period of infection would provide a strong argument that treatment administered under ideal clinical circumstances does not prevent the onset of brain abnormalities. Additionally, evidence of persistent neural injury despite cART instituted during AHI would identify key mechanisms of HIV neuropathogenesis and potential high-impact targets for clinical interventions."
"9303746","Project Summary The United Nations publishes updated estimates and projections of the populations of all the world's countries, broken down by age and sex. These are widely used by international organizations, governments, the private sector and researchers, for example for climate modeling and for assessing progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. The UN's previous projections were deterministic, and under the previous grant, we developed a fully probablistic projection methodology, which was adopted by the UN for its official projections for all countries in 2015. The new projections changed the understanding of the outlook for population, indicating that stabilization of world population is unlikely this century, largely because of the slowdown in fertility decline in high-fertility countries. We will improve our methodology by taking account of generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics. We will also develop new methods that account for the evolution of smoking, a major factor for mortality. Our methods are based on estimates of past population and vital rates, but these have measurement error, particularly in the more than half of countries without good vital registration system, We will extend our methods to take account of measurement error in estimating past fertility rates. We will also assess the possible effects on fertility of major policy initiatives focused on child survival, girl's education, family planning and the status of women in high fertility countries We will produce publicly available software for implementing our new methods. We will also conduct training courses and continue to maintain an email list for users of the methods.  "
"9533158","Project Summary The long-term goal of this study is to optimize a new rapid, quantitative imaging approach utilizing lightsheet microscopy in order to dramatically improve the 3D and 4D cellular information obtainable from mouse models of eye disease. During retinal disease, significant changes in cell and tissue morphology are common. In retinopathies for example, excessive, thickened, bulbous, leaky blood vessels and abnormal `tufts' form, protruding out of their usual layered locations. These malformed vessels cause many problems including the generation of abnormal mechanical traction, which pulls on the different layers of the eye, eventually causing the retina to detach. Understanding how and why cells grow into abnormal three-dimensional structures is key to understanding retinal disease progression and treatment. However, current imaging techniques used to investigate retinas at the cellular level are limited in terms of 3D information, due to a practical issue that the naturally spherical eye tissue must be flattened to be viewed on a slide under the microscope. We therefore propose to optimize the first lightsheet microscope protocol for mouse eye imaging as its design permits imaging of large intact tissues, in their natural form, avoiding distortion through flattening of the 3D tissue. Furthermore, the faster dissection method and rapid image acquisition (less than a minute to image an entire eye) of the lightsheet microscope enables us to pursue the first robust method for live imaging of cell behavior in the eye. Previous attempts at live imaging have seen limited success due again to the excessive flattening and distortion of the spherical eye tissue required to transfer it onto a dish for conventional microscopy. In storing high-resolution cellular information across large sections of eye tissue, and potentially also over many time points in dynamic imaging, lightsheet microscopes generate very large datasets. The Big Data issues incurred can cause significant scaling issues for standard image analysis software. We therefore propose to develop easy to use, freely available computational software tools alongside optimization of the imaging protocol in order to facilitate rapid adoption of the technique and maximize the quantitative information obtainable by the wider community of eye disease researchers. Altogether we call this idea of an integrated 3D-4D imaging and analysis method the ?Eye-dea approach?, standing for Eye ? preserved Dimensional tissue Environment Analysis. In this study we propose to demonstrate the advantages of the Eye-dea approach by providing the first characterization of 3D and 4D cellular abnormalities in a retinopathy mouse model. Furthermore we will demonstrate that the approach can overcome a current barrier to therapeutic progress: a lack of 3D cellular imaging tools. Our test case is a potentially restorative glaucoma stem cell therapy. We will quantify the level of functional integration of neuronal progenitor cells into the retinal layers of the eye, not feasible with current imaging methods."
"9329071","Abstract Mutant KRAS driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), confer a dismal 5-year survival rate of only 15-20%. Despite this clinical significance, there is a lack of an effective targeted therapy for the treatment of KRAS lung cancer. Given this unmet clinical need, my goal is to investigate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, particularly the protumorigenic IRE1?-XBP1 signaling pathway as an untapped resource of novel targets for therapy development. The protumorigenic role of ER stress response is being explored in various tumor types. However, this pathway had not been investigated properly in lung cancer. To first establish the clinical relevance, I analyzed a tissue microarray of >300 NSCLC clinical samples, and showed activated XBP1 in both the cancer and the stromal cells. Consistent with these observations, XBP-1 activation was observed in both the cancer cells and in the intratumoral dendritic cells, associated with activation of downstream genes in mutant Kras, p53-/- preclinical model of lung cancer. These preliminary findings, have led to the hypothesis that the aberrant IRE1?- XBP1signaling axis may contribute to carcinogenesis. Using genetic approaches (CRISPR/RNAi), and compartment-restricted recombinase systems (Clec9a-Cre or CD11c-Cre), I will investigate the cell-specific roles of IRE1?-XBP1 signaling in tumor growth, metastatic capacity and survival. Perturbation of IRE1?/XBP-1 in tumor-infiltrating DCs will be used to assess their role in T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, as this may provide key insights into whether XBP-1 targeting would enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors. Finally, the therapeutic potential of targeting the IRE-1-XBP1 pathway in NSCLC will be accomplished using selective pharmacological inhibitors of IRE1?. This study has a potential to yield targets of prognostic and therapeutic value in the IRE-1-XBP1 pathway in KRAS lung cancer, which represents >30% of lung adenocarcinomas."
"9305056","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Rare and highly disease-penetrant human genetic variation offers potential to accelerate  our  understanding  of  mechanisms  and  pathways  that  contribute  to  type-2  diabetes  (T2D), opening opportunities to translate findings into therapeutic targets and improved  individual  risk stratification.  Motivated  by  this  potential,  large-scale  sequencing  studies  have been undertaken to systematically catalog rare variation (<<1%) across the entire  genome. These efforts have revealed thousands of rare variants, with unclear functional  significance. The identification of causal rare variants has been hindered in three ways:  First, current analytical practices focus on the coding genome for ease of interpretability,  leaving  unevaluated  the  role of  noncoding  variation,  despite  its  clear  importance  for  disease  risk.  Second,  ignoring  the  polygenic  nature  of  T2D,  rare  variant  burden  is  calculated  at  the  level  of  indiviual  genes  rather  than  across  biological  networks  of  genes or potentially functional noncoding regions, due to lack of computational methods  for credible groupings and systematic collective evaluation. Finally, existing algorithms to  identify  pathogenic  candidates  are  underpowered,  a  problem  that  is  antagonized  by  prohibitive  replication  costs  and  impedes  efforts  to  demonstrate  compelling  statistical  association between rare variants and disease. Overcoming these challenges will allow  us  to  evaluate  the  hypothesis  that  rare,  particularl  noncoding  variation  contributes  risk  to  T2D,  the  aim  of  this  proposal.  We  will:  (1)  develop  algorithms  to  model  expected  levels of coding and noncoding polymorphism across human population using features  empirically  learned  from  publicly  available  data  sets  (1000  Genomes,  NHLBI  Exomes),  implemented in a new rare variant burden test for association, (2) develop computational  informatics and systems-based approaches to uncover pathogenic T2D gene networks  based on genetic data from hundreds of loci implicated in T2D risk and related traits, (3)  apply  our  new  algorithms  and  identified  gene  networks  to  evaluate  rare  variant  burden  for T2D in ~2850 individuals sequences across the genome, and (4) demonstrate T2D  relevance  via  replication  using  cost-effective  multiplex  targeted  re-sequencing  in  >33,000  individuals.  Completion  of  these  aims  will  result  in  development  and  public  release  of  software  for  the  analysis  of  non-coding  variation,  and  the  identification  of  networks and rare variants contributing susceptibility to T2D."
"9323545","PROJECT SUMMARY Through this COBRE application, we seek to establish the Center for Childhood Obesity Prevention. The goal of the Metabolism Core C is to provide support for metabolic studies, including exercise studies and biological sample analyses, for projects in the Center. It is recognized that suboptimal nutrition and exercise are important factors in the development of obesity, and that improvement of these factors are vital for the reversal of obesity and its corresponding disturbances in metabolism. The structure of this improvement is however debated, e.g., can exercise alone, without changes in bodyweight, improve obesity related metabolic disturbances. The Metabolism Core (MC) includes a physical activity facility for controlled studies of exercise and substrate metabolism, a special procedure/testing facility, and an analytical lab for analyses of biological samples. The MC will assist and mentor the junior investigators in the performance of metabolic studies, including use of stable isotope tracer techniques to measure metabolic rates, and will assist in design of future fundable studies of metabolism in obesity. Among the primary junior investigator projects, focus will be on the response of lean and obese children and also obese pregnant women, to nutritional interventions (probiotics, amino acids or protein). The effects of interventions on insulin sensitivity, fat oxidation, whole body protein turnover (synthesis and breakdown), and plasma and liver lipid content/hepatic steatosis, will be determined. The MC will also serve to educate and support the COBRE junior investigators in measurement of physical activity and biological responses in community/field studies. Thus, the core adds to the uniqueness of the grant in that lab studies and community studies of obesity are bridged in a translational manner. The Metabolism Core is NEW to the revised application."
"9269882","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Current understanding of Alzheimer's disease focuses on accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins, enhanced disease progression with vascular factors (i.e., APoE), a large reduction in metabolism and substrate/energy supply to the brain, significant changes in neurovascular coupling, neuronal damage leading to memory and cognitive abnormalities, cholinergic cell loss, and diffuse brain atrophy. Though a large number of treatments are in trials, the underlying basis of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. Thus, similar to dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease, the clinical focus for Alzheimer's disease has been to treat symptoms (i.e., memory) rather than the underlying cause. Since reduced central cholinergic function is prominent in Alzheimer's disease, current human treatment focuses on acetylcholinesterase inhibition for improved memory. Further, a preliminary trial showed encouraging results for enhancing cholinergic cell function and memory loss in Alzheimer's patients using nerve growth factor [NGF] gene therapy into nucleus basalis. Another symptomatic approach has been to enhance memory using deep brain stimulation [DBS] applied to the fornix, currently in being tested in a randomized trial. However, fornix stimulation has also been noted to show widespread metabolic changes in the brain. Though the focus of this DBS approach has been on memory enhancement, fornix and septal stimulation also induces cholinergic stimulation, which can affect blood vessel reactivity and neurovascular coupling and improve metabolism throughout the brain. We hypothesize that fornix DBS stimulation is causing both enhanced memory through hippocampal stimulation and secondary septal stimulation of cholinergic nuclei, affecting neurovascular coupling and blood flow. Septal stimulation would lead to diffuse cholinergic enhancement of hippocampal function, causing changes in excitatory transmission, neurovascular coupling and enhanced substrate/metabolic supply to the brain, likely improving the widespread vascular changes noted in Alzheimer's disease. We propose to study both physiological and vascular effects of fornix/septal stimulation at different time points of development in a progressive, mouse model of Alzheimer's disease that shows a clear deterioration with representative histological changes (i.e., plaques and tangles) over months [CVN-AD] in comparison to the control animals with knockout of the background nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS: NOS2-/-)."
"9512099","Our application for OT-PM-16-003, ?One in a Million ? Precision Medicine Initiative Wisconsin? represents the collaborative efforts of three fully integrated regional healthcare systems to form a virtual state-wide integrated delivery network. The application originates at the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), one of the most productive and earliest adopters of what has become Precision Medicine. The work of the MCHS has been cited by NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins as a model for the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). To ensure comprehensive nearly state-wide coverage of participant health care, MCHS has partnered with the other academic integrated delivery networks in Wisconsin, (University of Wisconsin (UW) and Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW)), that together include 173 clinics, 13 hospitals, insurer partners and 5 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The Blood Center of Wisconsin (BCW) also partners to operate state-wide mobile units of staff and equipment for blood collection that may be purposed for this effort. Through an independent agreement with Aurora Health, the electronic health records of participants recruited by academic and FQHC sites will be made available, ensuring nearly complete coverage of health care records across an entire state, with special emphasis on those populations that are traditionally the most underserved and understudied. The academic sites and FQHC partners have a long history of research cooperation and robust community engagement demonstrated by Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) ties, the Wisconsin Genome Initiative, reciprocal IRB arrangements, multiple joint grants and other collaborative studies. We have pioneered and implemented data sharing platforms and have demonstrated their usefulness with numerous high impact publications over many years. All three academic centers are leaders in the details of community engagement, recruitment, tracking, return of results and data sharing across various platforms in national and international consortia using large cohorts (e.g., MCHS?s 20,000 participant Personalized Medicine Research Project). A major innovation of this application is that it aligns the major healthcare systems of an entire state to more fully capture each participant?s data wherever participants get their health care. Indeed, 80% of all health care in Wisconsin is captured by our footprint. The State-wide catchment area also includes the oldest, sickest and poorest regions in the US and represent rural and urban areas, including African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, all represented as community champions. Through the FQHC partners, the recruiting institutions will achieve the 40% African American, Hispanic and Native American participant rate, with long standing community engagement and history of successful recruitment, including Wisconsin?s 12 Native American Tribes. Lending active support are Community Champions and Community Advisory Boards. A second innovative approach will employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize recruitment and retention processes. Our scientists have long collaborated on efforts to enhance the breadth and reliability of information extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), using a range of data to identify elements including family pedigrees or the occurrence of clinical events that are susceptible to unreliable coding. These efforts employed state-of-the-art methods including random forests, support vector machines and statistical relational learning, among others. These advanced computational methods will be used to predict those who are most likely to participate and which methods of approach are most effective. A third innovative approach is the planned use of mobile recruitment labs, previously successful with the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW). SHOW, began in 2008 provides a novel infrastructure for population health research recruitment, enabling engagement across the state, longitudinal follow-up of participants and community-specific studies. Key assets of SHOW are two mobile units staffed by research and healthcare professionals to facilitate on-site health studies in randomly selected or community-specific participants. SHOW is predicated on community engagement and the response rate has been outstanding (in one study more than 90% of ~4,000 participants consented to follow-up, DNA testing, or blood work). This is true across all racial/ethnic groups, including non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans. The fourth innovative approach is to work with our FQHC partners to recruit traditionally underserved populations. MCHS, UW and MCW will work with FQHC partners (Marshfield Family Health Center, Access Community Health Center, Milwaukee Health Services, Progressive Health Center and 16th Street Community Health Center). Importantly, we are ready to start. We have already informed and engaged our communities through press releases and newsletters. Processes are in place. Volunteers have already asked us to contact them. All the required personnel are trained and SOPs are in place to begin recruitment. We have a productive history of working with partners already funded for PMI cohort recruitment. For several years, we have worked closely (and published) with our colleagues at Northwestern and Columbia through the eMERGE Network and with the University of Pittsburgh through CTSA. Project Director Murray Brilliant has recently served as an advisor to the University of Arizona?s Precision Medicine Program. Thus, we are team-players who are ready, willing and able to be valuable collaborative partners in the effort to build a national engine to transform healthcare under PMI."

"9339546","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that leads to severe impairments of quality of life and substantial health care costs. The disease results from altered immune responses to intestinal bacteria and other microbes, and frequently is driven by susceptibility genes. The Immunity Related GTPase (IRG) M gene is a recently identified CD susceptibility gene. IRGM encodes a protein that regulates autophagy and mitophagy; however, how IRGM impacts CD pathogenesis is unknown. The goal of the proposed work is to establish a mouse system to model the function of IRGM function with respect to autophagy and intestinal biology. We have found that mouse Irgm1 that shares with human IRGM the ability to modulate autophagy and mitophagy. Additionally, Irgm1-deficient mice exhibit enhanced intestinal inflammation when challenged with experimental models of colitis. These and other preliminary data establish a working hypothesis: Lack of autophagic function due to Irgm1 deficiency leads to impaired functioning in different populations of immune cells that collectively contribute to enhanced intestinal inflammation. The primary goals of this proposal will be: (1) to discern the specific immune processes regulated by Irgm1 in the intestine that are key in modulating intestinal inflammation, and (2) to determine the underlying Irgm1-regulated molecular pathways that instruct those immune functions, particularly the role of autophagy and mitophagy. The following specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1A. Determine whether Irgm1 promotes immune responses in the intestinal epithelium important for controlling intestinal bacteria. Aim1B. Determine whether Irgm1 promotes immune processes in hematopoietic cells - either homeostatic or inflammatory - in response to intestinal bacteria. Aim 1C. Determine which Irgm1-mediated immune responses and cell types are key in suppressing excessive intestinal inflammation. Aim 2A. Determine whether Irgm1 promotes intestinal immune function by stimulating autophagy. Aim 2B. Determine whether Irgm1 promotes intestinal immune function by stimulating a type of autophagy called mitophagy. These studies will fill a major knowledge gap by modeling how an important CD susceptibility gene, IRGM, affects immune homeostasis in the intestine, potentially establishing future therapeutic targets. The studies will also increase understanding of how autophagic processes modulate intestinal immunity, a question that is broadly relevant, as a number of CD susceptibility genes and mouse models are now known to perturb autophagic responses."
"9339508","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Perfusion distribution among lung microvessels is thought to be controlled mainly by arteriolar constriction and dilation. However, effects of this activity on microvessel perfusability are unknown. Furthermore, considerable anatomic evidence suggests that active perfusion control is possible within the lung microvessels themselves, although this subject has never been studied. We will address these deficits in our understanding of pulmonary microvascular control using methods we developed. We will identify vasoactive agents that act directly on pulmonary microvessels versus those that act on pulmonary arterioles or venules. We will also determine how these agents affect red cell microvessel perfusability. We will conduct these studies in normal and hypoxic lungs, and in those injured by sepsis to determine the clinical relevance of this control. We propose the following specific aims: 1. Vasoactive response of lung microvessels to pharmacologic agents that produce whole-lung vasoconstriction. We will vasoconstrict lungs using angiotensin-II, bradykinin, serotonin, the thromboxane analog U46619, or hypoxia. Latex particles of a specific diameter (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 ?m) will be infused into each lung during vasoconstriction and the lungs will then be rapidly frozen. Particle densities within the microvessels will be measured in confocal histological images for particles of each diameter (one diameter per lung). These diameter-specific particle densities will be used to quantify the average microvessel diameter in lungs of each treatment group. Vasoconstrictors that produce microvessel diameters similar to those in matched-flow controls will be assumed to affect mainly arterioles. Vasoconstrictors that produce microvessel diameters smaller than those in matched-flow controls will be assumed to affect mainly microvessels. Vasoconstrictors that produce microvessel diameters larger than those in matched-flow controls will be assumed to affect mainly venules. These results will allow us to identify the vascular segment in which each agent exerts the majority of its vasoconstriction: in arterioles, microvessels, or venules. We will also examine the effects of hypoxia, and the effects of Rho kinase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), in normal and hypoxic lungs to further clarify the pharmacologic reactivity of each vascular segment. The studies in this aim provide the baseline data for aims 2 and 3. 2. Pulmonary microvessel red cell perfusability response to pharmacologic agents that produce whole-lung vasoconstriction. The studies in this Aim quantify the ability of red blood cells to flo through microvessels under the conditions utilized in Aim 1. The goals of this Aim are to determine the clinical relevance of the microvessel diameters identified in Aim 1. Our objective is to learn if the changes in microvessel diameters identified in Aim 1 translate to corresponding changes in the red cell perfusability. 3. Vasoactive response of lung microvessels to pharmacologic agents known to produce whole-lung vasoconstriction in lungs injured by sepsis. The goals of this aim are to learn how lung microvessel diameters and reactivity are affected by clinically relevant lung injury. Perfusion distribution among lung capillaries is known to be markedly disturbed by sepsis, and to cause ventilation/perfusion abnormalities. However, sepsis- induced changes in microvessel diameters and vasoreactivity may be responsible for this as well. This is a subject about which nothing is known, and our studies will address it for the first time. We will use the latex particle and red cell methods employed in Aims 1 and 2 to determine how microvessel diameters and red cell perfusion are affected by sepsis (LPS infusion), and to also determine how the pharmacologic responsiveness of each vessel segment is altered by sepsis.  Results of our studies will expand our basic understanding of pulmonary microvascular flow regulation in normal and injured lungs, and lead to new treatments that improve lung capillary perfusion in lung injury."

"9339563","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in veterans. The prognosis for GBM is dismal and there is an urgent need for novel treatments. The receptor interacting protein (RIP1, RIPK1) has emerged as a central regulator of cell death in cell stress, inflammation, and development. Depending on the cellular context, RIP1 is known to either activate the transcription factor NF-?B and promote cell survival, or induce apoptotic or necrotic cell death in response to a number of stressful stimuli. Recent studies have shown that activation of NF-?B plays an important role in the pathogenesis of GBM. In this proposal, we propose to examine the role of RIP1 as a cell life death/switch in glioblastoma (GBM). A characteristic histopathological feature of GBMs is the presence of necrosis within the tumors. We have previously shown that RIP1 is expressed in GBM and confers a worse prognosis. In this proposal we examine the hypothesis that the RIP1 switch in GBM is regulated by EGFR signaling. The experimental goals of this project are to examine whether RIP1 is essential for tumor formation in an experimental model of GBM, and to investigate whether RIP1 regulates the induction of necrotic cell death in GBM. We aim to elucidate the mechanisms used by a mutant EGFRvIII to activate the oncogenic potential of RIP1 and the mechanism used the EGFR wild type (EGFRwt) to switch RIP1 to a cell death mode using an experimental intracranial mouse model of GBM. Additionally, we investigate RIP1 as a target for treatment in GBM using two alternative hypothesis. Hypothesis A: RIP1 silencing will result in inhibition of tumor growth in GBM. Hypothesis B: Activation of the cell death function of RIP1 using the EGFR network will eliminate GBM cells in vivo. Thus, RIP1 studies in GBM have the potential to significantly impact understanding of GBM and improve its treatment."
"9353268","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Pheumonia is a leading cause of death among Veterans.  A hallmark of pheumonia is acute lung injury resulting from a profound release of host cell cytokines. The tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor (TRAF) proteins are critical in mediating cytokines responses, but little is known regarding their molecular regulation. Here we show that a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit, termed F box protein FBXL2, serves as a sentinel inhibitor that mediates disposal of TRAF proteins to impair cytokines secretion in pro-inflammatory cells.  Further, we discovered that a relatively new protein, termed F box protein FBX03, targets FBXL2 for degradation thereby stimulating cytokine release. FBX03 harbors a bacterial-like molecular signature that led to the development of a potent anti-inflammatory agent, BC1215. A loss-of-function naturally occurring FBX03 mutation was also identified in human subjects that lack ability to robustly express cytokines. Thus, in this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that antagonism or mutation of FBX03 results in reduced severity of acute lung injury from pneumonia by preserving levels of FBXL2, which in turn mediates degradation of TRAF proteins that are pro-inflammatory. To Evaluate this hypothesis,we will determine if during experimental pneumonia FBXO3 stimulates cytokine release by stabilizing TRAF proteins via degradation of the TRAF inhibitor, FBXL2 (Aim 1), determine if a novel small molecule FBXO3 antagonist, BC1215, lessens severity of acute lung injury during experimental pneumonia (Aim 2), and determine if a naturally occurring FBXO3 point mutation reduces severity of acute lung injury during pneumonia in hospitalized Veterans (Aim 3). In summary, this application unveils a new molecular model of innate immunity as it relates to cytokine signaling. Execution of these studies will lay the groundwork for a fundamental conceptual advance in the pathobiology of inflammation that sets the stage for a new translational initiative in Veterans with pneumonia."
"9356538","MOUSE NEURODEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIOR CORE (CORE D) ABSTRACT The Mouse Neurodevelopmental Behavior Core (NBC) at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) is designed to enable the comprehensive identification and quantification of complex behavioural phenotypes in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders. As well as providing cutting edge equipment, we continually validate the best protocols and generate base-line data for quality control management. Having such capabilities for in vivo analysis of mouse models of human disorders facilitates efficacy testing of novel therapeutic compounds and interventions, to provide evidence for transitioning into the clinic. The Core is equipped to perform extensive batteries of tests that phenotype specific social, emotional and cognitive behaviors, as well as motor, auditory and visual function, together with the general health of the animals. In addition, the NBC provides complementary technologies for evaluating the neurobiological mechanisms behind changes in behaviour, such as EEG, ECG and lasers for optogenetic studies. The core also provides a unique opportunity for training fellows, graduate and undergraduate students, as well as PIs, in the in vivo analysis of mouse models of human disorders. Looking ahead, we aim to keep the NBC at the forefront of in vivo analysis of genetic models of human disorders. One  major new initiative will be the establishment of a rat behavioral facility to exploit the increasing ability to efficiently modify the genome of rats to create genetic models of tuberosclerosis, Rett syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders. This will occupy ~1500 sq.ft of new space for the NBC and we have the required equipment for measuring cognition, anxiety, exploration and motor function in rats as well as EEG and in vivo imaging capacity. Another initiative is to offer reverse light housing for up to 300 mouse cages, so that investigators can study mouse behavior over the full diurnal cycle. We are also developing synergistic partnerships with the Cellular Imaging Core that has a two photon microscope to image neurons in conscious behaving mice, to bring together cutting edge imaging and behavioral technologies to the enable the mechanistic study of neurodevelopmental diseases. Finally, we recognize that the IDDRC network of behavioral Core facilities in the US provides a unique opportunity to establish a set of standards for behavioral assessment and reporting of rodent models of neurodevelopmental disorders.  We will run with Jackie Crawley (Director, UC Davis, IDDRC Behavior Core Facility) a series of comparative studies to establish standardized protocols for execution and analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9325499","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies."
"9351188","Leiomyomas disrupt uterine function and cause recurrent pregnancy loss, excessive uterine bleeding, and  anemia in 15-30% of reproductive-age women. There are few medical treatments available for leiomyomas,  and many women opt to undergo hysterectomy. Understanding how leiomyomas develop is essential for  identifying new non-surgical treatments. Preliminary data suggest that the clonal expansion of a defined  stem/progenitor cell population is responsible for leiomyoma growth. Employing antibody-based sorting and in  vivo tumor reconstruction, we revealed 3 distinct cell populations within a leiomyoma: 1-tumor progenitor  CD34+/CD49b+ cells (5%) with self-renewing capacity, which express stem cell markers and the cytokine  receptor RANK but are deficient in estrogen and progesterone (E+P) receptors (ER?/PR); 2-intermediately  differentiated CD34+/CD49b- ?support? cells (7%) with lower tumorigenicity and high levels of ER?/PR and the  cytokine RANKL; and 3-fully differentiated CD34-/CD49b- cells (88%) with negligible tumorigenic potential and  high ER?/PR levels. Only the CD34+/CD49b+ cell population was indispensable for robust tumor formation in  response to E+P in vivo. These cells, however, are ER?/PR deficient, suggestive of a paracrine mechanism.  Our long-range objective is to define the molecular interactions between distinct uterine leiomyoma cell  populations that are responsible for self-renewal, proliferation, and E+P responsiveness. The overall  hypothesis is that a small stem cell population, devoid of ER? or PR, is essential for E+P-dependent growth,  and that steroid-initiated alterations in ER?/PR-expressing support cells are transduced to the stem cells by  RANKL/RANK signals. Microarray expression analysis suggested a hierarchical differentiation pattern:  CD34+/CD49b+? CD34+/CD49b-? CD34-/CD49b- and multiple paracrine interactions between the  CD34+/CD49b+ and CD34+/CD49b- populations, with the latter acting as support cells. E+P induced RANKL  expression by over 100-fold in leiomyoma tissue. RANKL induced Cyclin D1 and BCL2 expression and  expanded the CD34+/CD49b+ stem cell population. RANKL also activated ERK and NF?B in leiomyoma cells.  Using xenografts of sorted leiomyoma cell populations under the mouse kidney capsule and cultures of tissue  explants, we will test our hypothesis in vivo and in vitro in the following Aims: 1-Determine whether a small but  distinct leiomyoma stem cell population serves as tumor progenitors. We will test the hypothesis that  CD34+/CD49b+ cells are responsible for self-renewal, proliferation and robust tumor growth. 2-Define the  biological roles of the RANKL/RANK pathway in leiomyoma progenitor/stem cell function. We will test the  hypothesis that RANKL/RANK signaling acts in response to E+P and mediates self-renewal and proliferation of  CD34+/CD49b+ tumor-initiating cells. In summary, our work will shift the therapeutic focus from the total  leiomyoma cell mass to a small stem cell population and paracrine signaling. We expect to identify new  therapeutic targets to help prevent tumorigenesis and reduce leiomyoma size and associated symptoms."
"9355689","The Clinical Translational Core (CTC) of the Kansas Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (KIDDRC) seeks to directly serve and facilitate translational research functions within its portfolio of projects. The CTC is designed to meet the needs of the work in those research themes by centralizing, integrating, and standardizing a set of functions that will allow KIDDRC projects to recruit well-characterized participants for its portfolio of human translational studies in an efficient manner. While these services will facilitate work by investigators already conducting research with human participants, they will also be extremely valuable to basic scientists who have not previously conducted research with human populations, as they provide a means for identifying individuals with Fragile X, Prader-Willi, and Rett Syndromes as well as capacity for the deep phenotyping required for supporting research on IDD subtypes and rare disorders. The objective of the CTC is to provide high-quality, cost-effective support to KIDDRC research programs in the recruitment of well-characterized participants with IDD and controls. Given the KIDDRC portfolio, the CTC emphasizes recruiting pediatric samples, but we also provide capacity to recruit adults with IDD. To achieve this, the CTC has established the goal of providing KIDDRC PIs with greater access to potential participants and with ongoing support with tools to facilitate recruitment and retention of individuals with IDD into their studies. This objective is being met in several ways. First, the CTC will provide KIDDRC investigators with access and assistance in identifying potential research participants through four registries: (1) an integrated data repository linked to electronic health records at KUMC, as well as to other regional databases that access records of individuals with IDD; (2) continuing to build a registry based on a regional clinic to which children are referred for a potential diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or developmental delays (this registry will be integrated with the KUMC repository); (3) a registry of facilities that house, advocate for, or otherwise serve individuals with IDD across Kansas and 14 other states derived from a partnership with the Kansas University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD); and (4) centralization and maintenance of a registry containing information on typically-developing (TD) infants and children that has been used to support normative research on developmental science. The core will also provide support for investigators needing assistance with human behavioral phenotyping of IDD conditions, by assisting investigators with establishing and maintaining partnerships with school districts in Kansas City-Lawrence-Topeka corridor, and by sponsoring investigators? presence and visibility at community and commercial events targeted to specific populations and age groups.  "
"9339491","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Approximately 20% of the 2 million troops deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan may require treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Bipolar disorder, a sequel to PTSD is common among Veterans. Currently about 30% of the bipolar Veterans receive chronic lithium (Li) therapy, which also effectively prevents suicidal tendencies. However, chronic usage of lithium is limited by the development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a condition in which the kidneys cannot concentrate urine resulting in excessive loss of water and electrolytes. Currently used modalities for the treatment of NDI are encountered with varying degrees of success as well as side effects. Refinement and/or replacement of the current side effect-prone therapies with new drugs based on an improved understanding of molecular pathophysiology of Li-induced NDI should result in improved efficacy and fewer side effects. In this context, we discovered that a signaling system, called purinergic signaling, can be targeted to ameliorate Li-induced NDI. The goal of this project is to decipher the role of ADP-activated P2Y12 receptor (R) in Li- induced NDI. This will have significant impact on our current knowledge of pathophysiology of Li-induced NDI, with a potential for the development of novel therapies. We observed that P2Y12-R is expressed in the kidney, and its selective blockade by clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix(r)), a widely used anti-clotting drug, increases the ability of the kidney to conserve water, and ameliorates Li-induced NDI. Based on these novel observations, we hypothesize that blockade of P2Y12-R ameliorates Li-induced NDI by re- sensitizing the kidney collecting duct to the action of AVP. We further hypothesize that P2Y12-R blockade suppresses Li-induced increases in prostanoid and nitric oxide production, and oxidative stress, thus contributing to overall beneficial effect. To address this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims, and use rat and mouse models, cultured kidney collecting duct cells, and agents that modulate signaling through for P2Y12R. Aim # 1 is to investigate the effect of P2Y12-R on Li-induced decrease in APQ2 expression in the collecting duct and the potential mechanisms involved in it. Aim # 2 is to investigate the beneficial effects of P2Y12-R blockade on Li-induced increases in prostanoid and nitric oxide production and oxidative stress. Aim # 3 is to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of targeting P2Y12-R (with or without concurrent blunting of P2Y2-R) on Li-induced NDI, collecting duct remodeling and cell proliferation in the kidney. Thus, this proposal is based on a novel concept, observations, and hypothesis, and it shifts the current focus of research and therapies for Li-induced NDI from predominantly the ones that counter anti- AVP effects to the ones that enhance the sensitivity of the kidney to AVP, thereby ensuing minimal side effects."
"9339552","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic debilitating disease affecting over 1% of Americans. Women are affected about 3 times more often than men. RA also constitutes a major health problem among the U.S. Veterans. The Veteran population is aging, and the number of women serving in the military is gradually increasing. In addition, Veterans in combat zones are exposed to extreme stress and toxic substances in different forms. All these factors may directly or indirectly influence host immunity and induction/aggravation of RA. The pain, discomfort, lost working days, and disabilities caused by RA can adversely affect Veterans' quality of life and work in many ways, as well as impose heavy cost of healthcare and rehabilitation. Therefore, studies advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of RA are highly relevant to the U.S. Veterans. Two main challenges in the field of arthritis are 1) to define the mechanisms that render the joints highly prone to attack by a systemic autoimmune response, and 2) to devise novel ways to direct systemically-administered drugs primarily into the inflamed joints (without intra-articular injection) to achieve maximum therapeutic effect, but with minimum adverse effects. We hypothesize that the vascular endothelium of the inflamed joints is characterized by unique molecular markers that facilitate both selective migration of pathogenic T cells into the target organ (the arthritic joints) and cellular/ molecular interactions with the mediators of inflammation and bone damage. Furthermore, the targeting of one or more of these vascular endothelial cell markers would offer new therapeutic approaches for downregulating joint inflammation and tissue damage without undue adverse reactions or systemic toxicity. This proposition is based on the results of our recently published study in PNAS on the synovial vasculature in the rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) model of RA, which was done in collaboration with Dr. Erkki Ruoslahti (Sanford-Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). The study was aimed at identifying unique arthritic joint-homing peptides using an innovative approach of in vitro and in vivo enrichment of clones from a phage peptide-display library. The advantage of the phage system for the detection of tissue-specific markers is that there is no a priori bias in predicting the ligands that bind to the vascular endothelium. And, unlike antibodies the phage-displayed peptides interact with the functional domain of the target molecule. This approach has been pioneered by Dr. Ruoslahti, who has developed the concept of vascular address molecules or zip codes. His group has examined several organs in this regard, but not the joints. We have now filled this gap by identifying two novel 9-residue peptides (denoted as NQR and ADK) that preferentially home to the inflamed joints and show unique receptor-binding and cellular-signaling attributes compared to the well-known arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif that binds to specific integrins. Furthermore, the treatment of arthritic rats wit NQR peptide attenuated AA, whereas ADK peptide failed to do so. The aims of our study are: Aim 1. Use the peptides (NQR and ADK) with a drug for synovial vasculature-targeted delivery into arthritic joints to control inflammation and bone damage. As a proof-of-concept, the drug will be encapsulated in liposomes, whose surface is decorated with NQR/ADK peptide. These joint-homing peptides would direct the liposomes preferentially into the inflamed joints. Liposomes will be treated with polyethylene glycol to inhibit their uptake by the reticuloendothelial system; Aim 2.  Define the cellular/molecular events triggered by the joint-homing peptides upon interaction with endothelial cells and to examine the mechanisms underlying the anti-arthritic activity of NQR peptide. We will determine the effect of NQR/ADK peptide on the pathogenic mediators produced by endothelial cells; the gene expression profile of endothelial cells; and the migration of defined subsets of leukocytes. The results of this study would advance our knowledge of the disease process in autoimmune arthritis and help design novel peptide-directed, targeted drug delivery with increased therapeutic index for the treatment of RA."
"9339543","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Current therapies for OA simply alleviate symptoms of advanced disease rather than inhibit the processes that drive the disease. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of OA would undoubtedly yield new therapeutic approaches. Although OA was long considered a purely mechanical disorder, it is becoming clear that it also involves inflammation and activation of immune cells. Synovial tissues of individuals with OA contain inflammatory cytokines and are infiltrated with both innate and adaptive immune cells, and the presence of synovial inflammation predicts more rapid cartilage destruction. These infiltrating immune cells express Fc receptors (FcRs), which normally serve to protect against infection by binding to antibodies and thereby triggering the release of inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators. However, aberrant activation or regulation of FcR-mediated signaling can lead to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We have garnered evidence that FcRs also play a central role in the pathogenesis of OA. We found that mice lacking the common ?-chain, through which several of the activating FcRs signal, are resistant to cartilage degeneration in a mouse model of OA. Mice deficient specifically in Fc?RIII, which does not signal through the ?-chain but has been shown to mediate autoantibody-induced tissue damage and inflammation, were also resistant. We hypothesize that one or more activating FcR contributes to the pathogenesis of OA by inducing FcR-expressing immune cells in OA synovial tissue to release inflammatory, vasoactive, cytotoxic, and degradative molecules that in turn contribute to the synovitis, cell death, and cartilage erosion characteristic of OA. Antigen-bound antibodies activate FcRs, and antibodies directed against joint components are present in OA synovial fluid, synovial tissue, and cartilage. Findings in mice indicate that antibodies to various joint components can elicit inflammatory joint destruction. It is possible that such antibodies develop following exposure of cartilage components to the immune system- owing to mechanical cartilage breakdown-and contribute to inflammatory joint destruction in OA by activating FcRs. We propose to use genetically deficient mice, an established mouse model of OA, and samples from patients with OA to (i) determine whether activating FcRs promote mouse OA, and whether they do so by activating mast cells, macrophages, or other immune cells; (ii) determine how early in the development of human OA FcR-expressing immune cells infiltrate the synovial joints; (iii) determine whether levels of FcR expression or levels of immune-cell activation correlate with levels of OA-associated inflammation or with disease severity in human OA; and (iv) determine whether debris from human OA cartilage can activate innate immune cells in an FcR-dependent manner. Several approaches to targeting FcRs are being developed for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Targeting FcRs, which could prevent the triggering of a cascade of different inflammatory mediators, may prove more therapeutically efficacious than targeting a single inflammatory mediator (the latter being an approach that has so far proven unsuccessful in OA). Thus, by shedding light on the role of FcRs in OA, success of the proposed studies could open up new avenues for the treatment of OA, for which disease- modifying treatments are urgently needed."
"9355680","The Kansas Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Center (KIDDRC) supports rigorous and high-impact basic and applied research within themes that are relevant to the etiology, identification, prevention, and treatment of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The Center is organized around projects that fall into four basic themes: (1) Language, Communication Disorders, and Cognition, (2) Risk, Intervention, and Prevention, (3) The Neurobiology of IDD, and (4) Cellular and Molecular Biology of Early Development. To achieve its mission, the KIDDRC seeks to develop new interdisciplinary research initiatives relevant to the Center?s mission by bringing together scientists across the various sites of the Kansas Center as well as promoting collaboration with researchers at other institutions. It supports existing and new projects with cost- effective, scientifically generative, state-of-the-art core services, resources, and facilities that directly enhance the quality, quantity, and impact of science produced by center investigators and their collaborators, and to provide highly efficient, cost-effective systems for planning, developing, managing, coordinating, and disseminating research activities associated with the center. The KIDDRC proposes to operate five Cores in support of its projects. An Administrative Core coordinates and integrates services and functions across the three physical locations of the KIDDRC in Lawrence and Kansas City and provides scientific leadership and governance mechanisms to ensure that scientific cores are current and efficiently run. A Clinical Translational Core provides KIDDRC investigators with several tools for enhancing translational research, addressed broadly by facilitating contact with individuals with IDD for research. A Preclinical Models Core facilitates translational applications by assisting in the development of cellular and organismal models of IDD. This is done by providing infrastructure and resources needed to create and characterize laboratory models of IDD and by extending KIDDRC?s prior capabilities for analyzing behavior, anatomy, physiology, and gene expression. This latter goal includes cutting-edge genome editing technologies to aid in generating cellular models using patient?derived cells. A Clinical Outcomes/Biobehavioral Technology Core provides high-quality, cost-effective support to KIDDRC research programs requiring quantitative measurement of human neurobehavioral and behavioral outcomes, as well as biological correlates. The CBC includes tools for the generating, collecting, automating, and validating such measures. The fifth core is a Research Design and Analysis Core (RDAC), which supports the analysis of data from both preclinical and clinical research through state-of-the-art statistical and bioinformatics methods. Finally, a Research Component housed within the KIDDRC seeks to evaluate the efficacy of multimodal intervention for language in a group of children with autism and minimal verbal skills by comparing results from an experimental intervention to a treatment-as- usual condition, and compare two intensities of the multimodal intervention.  "
"9339475","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Members of the Sirtuin family of enzymes are important regulators of genomic stability, stress responses, and metabolic programs that impact on human health and disease. SIRT6 and SIRT7 are closely related mammalian sirtuins that regulate fundamental nuclear processes. These enzymes catalyze highly selective histone deacetylation reactions at chromatin, whereby important acetyl marks are removed from specific lysine residues. Proper regulation of histone acetylation patterns at chromatin is essential for establishing specialized chromatin states that control processes such as gene expression, DNA repair, and DNA replication. Dysregulation of histone acetylation patterns, as occurs when SIRT6 or SIRT7 are inactivated, can therefore have pathological consequences at the cellular and whole organism levels. Indeed, SIRT6 has numerous demonstrated functions relevant for aging, metabolism, and cancer. By contrast, much less is understood about SIRT7. We recently showed that SIRT7 is a highly selective H3K18Ac (acetylated histone H3 lysine 18) deacetylase that plays a pivotal role in modulating oncogenic transformation programs and tumor formation. Now, our preliminary studies provide evidence for additional epigenetic functions of SIRT7 in cellular metabolic processes that impact on both cancer and fatty liver disease. This proposal aims to elucidate the role and mechanisms of SIRT7 in these processes. In addition, our preliminary data reveal that the specific substrate of SIRT7, H3K18Ac, can also be deacetylated by SIRT6. We will ask how deacetylation of H3K18Ac is coordinated between SIRT6 and SIRT7 in specific genomic and physiologic settings, and whether these sirtuins provide compensatory mechanisms that protect against pathological consequences of defective H3K18Ac deacetylation.  In Aim 1, we will elucidate novel roles and mechanisms of SIRT7 in oncogenic transformation and cancer pathways. We will use genetic and biochemical strategies to study a new link between SIRT7 and the oncogenic Myc transcription factor in regulating cancer cell translational capacity, proliferation, and survival. In addition, we will ask whether SIRT7 influences the efficiency of oncogenic transformation of primary cells in culture and overall tumor susceptibility in mice.  In Aim 2, we will characterize the role and mechanisms of SIRT7 in preventing fatty liver disease. In humans, this disease is highly prevalent and predisposes to liver failure and cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We will combine molecular, genomic, and cellular approaches with studies of SIRT7 mutant mice to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which SIRT7 influence fatty liver disease pathogenesis. Growing evidence implicates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the development and progression of fatty liver disease. We will test the hypothesis that SIRT7 prevents fatty liver disease by attenuating the pathogenic effects of ER stress, as well as by directly regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.  In Aim 3, we will examine the functional interplay and overlap between SIRT6 and SIRT7 in H3K18Ac homeostasis and cancer cell biology. We will employ newly generated systems to inactivate both enzymes simultaneously, using double RNAi strategies and double mutant mice, and assay genomic, cellular and whole organism phenotypes. Together, these studies should elucidate fundamental chromatin mechanisms in human physiology and disease and the potential of SIRT6 and SIRT7 as therapeutic targets."
"9356337","Project Summary ? Project 2 It is not known how dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease and the resultant abnormal activity in these structures, alter information processing in brain areas that are downstream from them, specifi- cally the basal ganglia receiving motor thalamus (BGMT). Information processing in the BGMT remains enig- matic. Unlike other areas of the thalamus, the BGMT receives no peripheral glutamatergic input and only weak glutamatergic `driver' input from the cerebral cortex. In addition, it is unique among thalamic nuclei because it is subject to massive inhibitory modulation from the basal ganglia. The BGMT projects to the primary motor cor- tex (M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA) and other cortical areas, but it is not known how these projec- tions influence cortical activities. As we and others have shown, information processing in thalamus and cortex are strongly altered by abnormal basal ganglia output in the parkinsonian state. There is also strong new evi- dence for synaptic (functional/morphologic) plasticity in the parkinsonian state that will further affect the activity of thalamic and cortical neurons (project 3). In the planned studies, we will assess how parkinsonism affects the processing of basal ganglia or cortical inputs to BGMT, and BGMT inputs to motor cortices. Under aim 1, we will use a combination of optogenetic and electrical stimulation methods to probe the impact of activating M1, SMA, or basal ganglia inputs on BGMT activity in normal and parkinsonian (MPTP-treated) monkeys. Based on preliminary findings, we expect to find that light activation of opsin-transfected corticothalamic termi- nals will lead to short-latency excitatory and long-latency inhibitory responses in BGMT, while (electrical) acti- vation of pallidothalamic fibers inhibits BGMT. We will also study interactions between these inputs. In aim 2, we will examine responses of cortical neurons to optogenetic activation of BGMT projections in normal and parkinsonian primates. We expect that the prominent and layer-specific parkinsonism-related plasticity at thalamocortical synapses (project 3) alters responses of cortical neurons to their BGMT inputs. We will particu- larly focus on cortical neurons with antidromic responses to electrical internal capsule stimulation, because the activity of these cells is known to be strongly altered in parkinsonian monkeys. Interactions with project 1 will provide important mechanistic information regarding parkinsonism-related changes in the excitability and spike patterning of thalamic and cortical neurons, while collaboration with project 3 will help us to incorporate mor- phological changes into our analysis. Core B will add essential anatomical results to our study, and will help us by generating parkinsonian animals. Taken together, the planned studies will help us to understand how pal- lidal and cortical inputs shape BGMT activity, how these effects influence M1/SMA activities, and how cortico- thalamic and thalamocortical transmission changes in parkinsonism. This knowledge may alter our view of the pathophysiology of parkinsonism, and will be essential for the rational development or optimization of surgical or pharmacological antiparkinsonian neuromodulation strategies that target basal ganglia or thalamus.  "
"9306373","Summary/Abstract (no more than 30 lines) Mammalian sperm acquire fertilization capacity as they transit through the reproductive tract in a process known as capacitation. During capacitation, sperm change their motility pattern and become competent to undergo an acrosome reaction and fertilize an egg. Capacitation-associated processes require energy. Similar to somatic cells, sperm generate ATP and other high energy compounds using nutrients in their surroundings via the coordinated actions of numerous metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In sperm, it remains unclear how these pathways are coordinately regulated to generate sufficient energy for motility and capacitation. In this application, we propose to apply modern metabolite profiling combined with metabolic flux analysis to sperm physiology to identify the contributions of the different metabolic pathways used by sperm. These studies will test the central hypothesis that sperm actively up-regulate their metabolism during capacitation to generate sufficient energy for motility and other capacitation- associated processes necessary for fertilization. Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is essential for the molecular changes observed during capacitation. In other contexts, sAC is a metabolic sensor. Therefore, we will also test the hypothesis that sAC acts as a metabolic sensor in sperm which regulates the metabolic changes induced by capacitation, and regulates energy production during sustained sperm motility. !"
"9339565","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex anxiety disorder that develops following exposure to either military or civilian traumatic stress. PTSD affects approximately 10% of women and 5% of men in the US, and affected individuals are at increased risk for unemployment, depression, substance abuse, and impaired physical health. PTSD is overrepresented in Veterans. Family and twin studies have implicated both genetic and environmental factors in PTSD risk. Case/control studies have identified associations between PTSD risk and variants in a number of candidate genes; however, such associations have not been consistently replicated in multiple independent datasets. We hypothesize that this difficulty in replication is the result of the failure of previous studies to include epigenetic variation, an to fully account for gene/environment interactions. The present application will address this gap in our knowledge of the factors that increase risk of PTSD. We have an existing genome-wide association dataset of more than 2500 PTSD cases and controls (including 1470 African Americans), genotyped at more than 2.5 million genetic variants. We will conduct association studies in this dataset, and incorporate environmental influences in our genetic models. We will measure epigenetic variation in 1470 African American PTSD patients and controls, using the Illumina methylation arrays that measure DNA methylation levels at more than 480,000 sites across the genome. This methylation data will be analyzed independently, as well as in conjunction with genetic data, to determine its role in PTSD risk. Finally, we will conduct an exploratory gene*environment and epigenome*environment interaction analysis. By including environmental and epigenetic factors in our analysis of genetic variants, we stand to gain a much clearer understanding of the multiple factors that increase both the risk and severity of PTSD."
"9339492","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common in many metabolic disorders such Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. In these chronic conditions, there is a decreased responsiveness to endogenous insulin (insulin resistance). The decreased responsiveness to insulin results in a reduction in insulin- regulated glucose disposal, which occurs mostly in skeletal muscle. Acute insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are much less studied, but are characteristic metabolic responses to infections and injuries such as surgery, burns, trauma and hemorrhage.  Recent data suggests that intensive insulin treatment of ICU patients may reduce both morbidity and mortality associated with critical illness. However, there is some controversy concerning the proper use of intensive insulin therapy, and under what conditions it can do the most good, or conversely when it is unnecessary or harmful. Intensive insulin therapy increases the likelihood of deleterious hypoglycemic incidents, a major complication of intensive insulin therapy. Even though intensive insulin therapy is now extensively used in the ICU, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the acute onset of insulin resistance. For instance, how quickly it develops, what are the causative factors, what intracellular signaling pathways are affected, and what tissues are involved. An understanding of how this insulin resistance develops will be important in determining the proper application of intensive insulin therapy, the most advantageous time for initiation following different injuries, and may suggest new treatment protocols to increase survival of critically ill patients. For instance, is therapy to reuce insulin resistance more advantageous to the patient than intensive insulin therapy? And what tissue or tissues need to be targeted?  Insulin resistance can be explained by changes in the number of insulin receptors or their activity, or a post- receptor defect. Our recently published and preliminary data indicate that there are insulin receptors and post-receptor defects in insulin signaling that develop in skeletal muscle following surgical trauma and hemorrhage. The data suggests an important role for the glucocorticoids and proinflammatory cytokines, but how they interact to cause the initial development of insulin resistance is unknown. Additional preliminary data indicate that the mechanisms of the development of insulin resistance are different in the three main insulin target tissues, skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. This makes it necessary to study each tissue separately, to determine how this insulin resistance occurs. In addition, there are time-dependent changes in the factors that maintain the insulin resistant state. We have also found these to be tissue dependent. These results may be clinically advantageous, allowing us to specifically target individual tissues with treatments less likely tha intensive insulin therapy to cause hypoglycemic incidents, and more likely to achieve the proper range of blood glucose levels in patients in the ICU.  Thus, studies are proposed in this application to determine the mechanism(s) of the development of acute insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Also, much of this application is designed to study the mechanisms of recovery of insulin sensitivity following resuscitation. Potential clinical treatments are explored that may work to reverse the mortality and morbidity related to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in the critical care setting following injury, infection and critical illness."
"9339585","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies account for nearly half of worldwide cancer deaths. A small population of cells, termed tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), are important for tumor maintenance, progression and post-treatment recurrence. It is speculated that this specialized population of cells mediates the treatment resistance that is a hallmark of GI malignancy. Reg4 expression is an early event in carcinogenesis in colon, gastric and pancreatic carcinomas and is independently associated with poor clinical outcomes from colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancers. This proposal follows our recent discovery of the Reg4 receptor, and our preliminary data that suggests that it may play an important role in the proliferation and survival of the CSC. Since these pathways are not addressed by existing therapeutics, targeting Reg4-CD44ICD signaling in the stem cell could dramatically change the current treatment paradigm and enhance responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents. This proposal has three Aims; one focused on identification of the CD44 isoforms that can serve as the Reg4 receptor, an experimental Aim focused on examining the role of CD44ICD in the CSC, and a clinical Aim focused on determining the relationship between CD44ICD signaling and clinicopathologic features in colorectal cancer."

"9339501","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Gastric adenocarcinoma remains the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The vast majority of gastric cancer evolves in the stomach in the setting of chronic atrophic gastritis usually in association with Helicobacter pylori infection. While the role of H. pylori as the proximate cause of gastric carcinogenesis is well established, the cellular basis of lineage changes that lead to development of preneoplastic metaplasia and progression to cancer remain unclear. The normal gastric fundic mucosa is assembled from a heterogeneous group of epithelial lineages responsible for the normal secretion of mucins, pepsinogen and HCl. Chronic injury associated with H. pylori infection leads to prominent changes in the composition of the gastric epithelia, with loss of parietal cells (oxyntic atrophy), expansion of surface cells (foveolar hyperplasia) and mucous cell metaplasia. Two metaplastic lineages are now acknowledged in the setting of oxyntic atrophy in humans: intestinal metaplasia (characterized by the presence of intestinal goblet cells in the gastric mucosa) and Spasmolytic Polypeptide Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM; characterized by presence of antral type mucous cells in the body of the stomach). However, Helicobacter infection in mice leads only to SPEM. Over the past 15 years, we have investigated the factors that lead to the development of SPEM in the face of oxyntic atrophy. Using lineage-mapping studies in mice, we have demonstrated that SPEM arises, not from professional progenitor cells, but from transdifferentiation of mature Mist1-expressing chief cells into mucous cell metaplasia. All of these results support the hypotheses that loss of parietal cells from the gastric fundic mucosa induces the development of SPEM from transdifferentiation of chief cells. Since SPEM appears to be the initial pre-cancerous metaplastic response to oxyntic atrophy, it is critical to understand how transdifferentiation of chief cells leads to the emergence of SPEM as the central initial event required for the development of dysplasia and neoplasia in the stomach. We will therefore continue our studies of the origin of metaplasia through the prosecution of three specific aims:  First, we will examine the plasticity of chief cell transdifferentiation into metaplasia. Sice our present studies suggest that the ability to transdifferentiate may be a general property of chief cells, we will evaluate whether transdifferentiation induced by oxyntic atrophy is a polyclonal process. Because induction of SPEM is reversible in acute oxyntic atrophy, we will use lineage-mapping studies to evaluate whether SPEM transdifferentiation is directly reversible back into chief cells. Second, we will evaluate the role of CD44variant in the initiation of SPEM. Since we have found that up-regulation of CD44variant marks the earliest point yet identified in the process of transdifferentiation, we will seek to identify critical gene transcription changes attendant with CD44variant up- regulation in chief cells. Further, we will examine whether inhibition of the xCT cystine-glutamate antiporter, a target for activation by CD44variant, can alter the induction or progression of SPEM. Third, we will examine the role of miRNAs in the induction of metaplastic phenotypes by determining whether targeted loss of Dicer expression in chief cells alters the induction of SPEM.   All of these studies will help identify fundamental mechanisms involved in chief cell transdifferentiation and may lead to insights in how pre-neoplastic metaplastic lineage changes can be prevented or reversed."
"9324222","MOLECULAR GENETICS AND BIOMARKER CORE SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Molecular Genetics and Biomarker Core (MGBC) provides services to genetically characterize polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients, with a focus on autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and to facilitate collection and processing of samples to test biomarkers and to explore the pathophysiology of PKD. The core is directed by Dr. Peter C Harris, an expert in genetic studies of PKD. During the previous funding period the core provided services to ~80 investigators from Mayo and beyond, with a total of >4500 services performed. The MGBC is now enhanced in several areas from the previous core, providing expanded services for genetic analysis, and collection of materials and information to enable and enhance clinical trials, genotype/phenotype studies, novel gene identification, and exploration of the molecular basis of disease. Survey results indicate a high level of demand for the services to be provided. Service 1 provides access to the Mayo PKD Clinical Database that contains clinical, imaging and genetic information on a large population of PKD, especially ADPKD patients, that will facilitate association and genotype/phenotype studies. Service 2 employs locus specific approaches to screen the duplicated PKD1 gene, plus PKD2, and now includes a next generation sequencing as well as a conventional sequencing approach. This service facilitates selections of patients for clinical trials and interpretation of trial data, characterizes PKD cell-lines for the PKD community, and helps resolve the etiology of unusual patients. Service 3 complements the ADPKD oriented screening to use focused ciliopathy and whole exome approaches to screen other PKD genes for population characterization and novel gene discovery, including identifying novel ADPKD genes/modifiers. Service 4 consists of a Biobank that collects, processes and distributes tissue, cells and cyst fluid from PKD patients; an important resource to help understand pathogenesis. Service 5 involves collection and processing of urine samples from PKD patients to aid with biomarker discovery and testing. Service 6 distributes full-length clones of various cystogenes. In addition to the services, three development projects are described which aim to: 1) simplify ADPKD mutation screening and facilitate high throughput analyses; 2) generate PKD1, PKD2 and PKD1/PKD2 null cell-lines using TALEN methodologies; and 3) develop urine and plasma sample collection and processing methods to facilitate metabolomics studies. The final component of MGBC is the training aspect to disseminate the expertise of the core to investigators worldwide.

"9306839","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Th17 Pathway Plasticity in the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The Th17 subset has been implicated in a number of immune-mediated diseases, including IBD. Despite the acknowledged importance of the Th17/IL-23 axis in intestinal inflammation, questions remain regarding stability of the Th17 lineage and the role of IFN-? in colitis pathogenesis. In human and mouse colitis, T cells that express either IL-17A or IFN-?, or both are found in inflamed intestinal tissues. In published studies we have found using novel cytokine reporter mice that Th17 cells show late developmental plasticity, such that under the influence of IL-23, Th17 cells can deviate to IFN-?+ cells (`Th1-like' cells) in a mannr that is dependent on the transcription factors Stat4 and T-bet. Our new preliminary data show that Th17 cells deficient in Stat4 or T-bet are impaired in their transition to IFN-?+ cells in vvo, and their colitogenic potential is markedly reduced. Similarly, Th17 cells that are deficient in IFN-? do not induce colitis. We hypothesize that IL-17A and IFN-? producing cells arise from common Th17 precursors under the influence of IL-23 and have distinct roles in IBD pathogenesis: IFN-?+ Th1-like cells are required for disease development whereas mature Th17 cells that express only IL-17A are protective. In this proposal we will explore how late diversity n Th17 differentiation impacts IBD development by using recently created IL-17A reporter mice to (i) study the contribution of Th17-derived IL-17A+ and IFN-?+ cells to the development of colitis and (ii) define mechanisms by which Th1-like cells derived from the Th17 pathway drive intestinal inflammation."
"9292399","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent laboratory, epidemiological and clinical observations have identified urate - the end product of purine metabolism in humans - as a neuroprotectant and the first molecular predictor of both reduced risk and slower progression of typical Parkinson's disease (PD). Urate is also a potent antioxidant and confers protection in cellular and animal models of PD. Epidemiological studies of prospectively followed healthy populations have repeatedly demonstrated serum urate to be an inverse risk factor for PD. These findings led to the discovery that among people with early PD serum and CSF urate levels are predictors of slower progression, assessed clinically or by neuroimaging of dopamine transporter (DAT) loss over years. Phase 2 Progress: Based on urate's properties as a neuroprotectant and favorable prognostic biomarker in PD, urate elevation was proposed as a candidate disease-modifying strategy. Inosine, an orally bioavailable precursor of urate, was investigated in a phase 2 study, the Safety of Urate Elevation in Parkinson's Disease (SURE-PD) trial. It demonstrated that inosine can safely produce well-tolerated elevations of serum and CSF urate for months or years in early PD. Secondary analyses of long-term clinical data support advancing to a pivotal efficacy trial. Results also suggested refinements in dosing and other design features. Phase 3 Aims: The primary aim of the study is to determine whether oral inosine dosed to persistently elevate serum urate (from =5.7 mg/dL to 7.1-8.0 mg/dL) slows clinical progression over two years in early PD. Secondary aims include assessing long-term safety and effects on a) the development of disability warranting dopaminergic medication, b) short-term changes in parkinsonian symptoms, c) changes in functional disability and quality of life, and d) non-motor measures of cognition, mood and autonomic function. The operational aim of the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) is to safely, effectively and efficiently manage all study activities and training of ~60 participating Parkinson Study Group (PSG) clinical sites and to integrate clinical management by the CCC with data and drug management by the partnered Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Methods: A placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial of inosine will enroll 270 subjects with early PD, lower serum urate and DAT deficiency by neuroimaging and will randomize them 1:1 to treatment with placebo or inosine dosed to elevate urate for 2 years with a 3-month wash-out. Our primary outcome of change in the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score will be assessed quarterly to measure patient- and investigator-reported and motor and non-motor features of the disease. Significance: Slowing the progressive clinical decline of PD remains a critical unmet goal of neurotherapeutics development. If the established association between higher urate and favorable outcomes in PD patients are due to neuroprotective properties, then this study is designed to provide direct evidence that urate-elevating inosine treatment slows clinical progression of the disease."
"9320783","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney fibrosis is a common final pathway of chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to end- stage renal failure (ESRD) and specific anti-fibrosis therapy is lacking. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective anti-fibrosis therapy t prevent the progression of CKD. It is known that the kidney fibrosis process is regulated by a complex cell signaling network. The drugs targeting these signaling pathways are of great interest. However, only a few drugs are in early phase of clinical trials. From the systems point of view, kidney fibrosis has a complex pathogenesis and drugs targeting individual signaling pathways may not have sufficient anti-fibrosis effects to prevent the progression of CKD. Therefore, it is important to perform systems analysis of the signaling network. During the last funding period we developed a combined systems biology and experimental approach allowing us to deduce upstream signaling networks from genome-wide gene expression profiles. Using this approach, we identified HIPK2 as a key regulator of genes altered in the kidney of animal model with kidney fibrosis. Furthermore, we confirmed that HIPK2 expression is increased in kidney biopsies from patients with various kidney disease associated with kidney fibrosis. In vitro, we found that HIPK2 mediates injury and activation of pro-fibrosis markers in kidney cells. HIPK2 activates multiple pro-fibrosis and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways leading to kidney fibrosis and inflammation. The role of HIPK2 in kidney fibrosis was also confirmed in mice with HIPK2 deficiency. Our findings indicate that HIPK2 is a key protein kinase mediating kidney fibrosis and suggests that it may be a potential drug target for anti-fibrosis therapy.  In this competitive renewal application, we propose to further validate HIPK2 as a drug target for anti-fibrosis therapy and develop specific inhibitors of HIPK2 as anti-fibrosis drugs. These questions will be addressed in the following three specific aims: Specific aim 1: We will determine whether conditional knockout of HIPK2 in kidney cells attenuates kidney fibrosis in the animal models of kidney fibrosis. We will also determine whether the induction of HIPK2 expression in kidney cells accelerates renal fibrosis in these animals. Specific aim 2: We will determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which HIPK2 causes kidney fibrosis. Specific aim 3: We will identify specific and potent HIPK2 inhibitors and validate the effects of these inhibitors in cultured kidney cells and animal models of kidney fibrosis."
"9540185","Our main goal is to correlate key proteomic and genomic alterations in melanomas with responses  to next-generation targeted therapy. The new treatment opportunities and the remarkable heterogeneity of  melanoma tumors require better profiling of tumor sub-types to achieve efficient selection of patients for  targeted therapies. We will focus on responses to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) such as PLX4032/RG7204/  Vemurafenib and GSK2118436. The studies will include novel kinase inhibitors developed by Plexxikon to  overcome the paradoxical effect of BRAFi (i.e., stimulation of cells with wild type BRAF), termed paradox  breakers (PLX-PB). Freshly isolated tumors will be characterized at base line before treatment and at the  time of disease progression employing multiplex-phosphoproteomic assays, high throughput sequencing of  coding regions (Exome-Seq), and gene expression arrays to establish a subset of indicators that correlate  with short (< 6 months) versus durable (s 12 months) response to the drug. We will assess the  characteristics of tumors poorly responsive to BRAFi compared to those with durable response, relapsing  over a year after treatment. We expect to identify mechanism(s) of resistance that can be used to devise  alternative treatments. The major translational outcome ofthis work is classification of melanomas by  phospho-proteomic/genomic/gene expression aberrations that show an association between treatment and  response that will lead to development of assays for selection of patients for targeted therapies. In addition,  the project will facilitate clinical trials of novel BRAFv600 kinase inhibitors. Aim 1: To correlate phosphoproteomic,  genomic and gene expression aberrations with resistance to BRAFi. Aim 2: To perform  functional analyses on the best markers associated with treatment response employing melanoma cells in  culture. Aim 3: To conduct a Phase I clinical trial with next-generation paradox-breakers (PB) BRAFi  developed by Plexxikon Inc. We will compare tumor profiles of PLX-PB response to those revealed in Aims  1 and 2."
"9347683","PROJECT SUMMARY The aim of this Phase II proposal is to develop a rapid, easy-to-use, and inexpensive multi-sample diagnostic system to identify sexually transmitted infection (STI) pathogens, such as Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in non-traditional healthcare settings. The features of our system will likely qualify it to be a CLIA-waived CT/NG test. The sensitivity and specificity to be achieved using this prototype type assay will be comparable with those of current laboratory-based molecular tests. This would present a major advancement in clinical diagnostics for STIs. According to the CDC, chlamydia and gonorrhea, caused by C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, are the two most frequently reported STIs in the US and likely the rest of the world. These STIs are often under-diagnosed, leading to delayed treatment, continued spread and higher public healthcare costs (~$16 billion annually). As a result of their prevalence and long term health consequences, there is a need for rapid and sensitive methods of detecting STIs in order for patients to get results and treatment immediately. It is important that patients receive results and initial consultation or treatment during the first patient visit, as they rarely return for a second visit. Point-of-care (POC) tests are an important strategy to address the STI epidemic, and because many affected by STIs (young and/or poor) often have limited access to traditional healthcare, POC tests that can be performed in non-traditional settings (e.g., university clinics, community public health care clinics, jails, and detention centers) could greatly reduce STIs. The system we propose to further develop will combine AI Biosciences, Inc.?s novel assay cartridge, low-cost automatic platform inspired by 3D printer technology, and a rapid real-time thermal cycler to form a multi- sample system for use in non-traditional healthcare settings. A low-cost self-contained nucleic acid extraction and purification cartridge will be developed to perform a 10 min. extraction process for 6 samples. The extracted NA samples will then be eluted and amplified using shuttle thermal cycler to perform multiplexed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CT and NG targets (15 min for 40 cycles). We plan to optimize the assay and disposable to meet the needs of non-traditional healthcare settings, improve the system for ease-of-use, and minimize risk of erroneous result. We will complete prototype system validation and verification as well as determine analytical sensitivity and specificity of the CT/NG assay. The proposed work will be carried out in collaboration with a STI expert in the US. Our proposed technologies are highly suitable for parallel, automated processing. This is a substantial advantage over other integrated systems being developed as most can only process one sample at a time, requiring the purchase of several modules in order to meet the throughput demand in most point-of-care or near-patient settings. The successful development and commercialization of our medium-throughput technology will impact how molecular diagnostic assays are implemented in non-traditional healthcare settings."
"9336326","PROJECT SUMMARY      There are over 14 million cancer survivors in the United States, many of whom suffer from chemotherapy-  induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) as a late effect of neurotoxic chemotherapy. CIPN presents as bilateral  numbness and tingling in the hands and feet and typically progresses to include neuropathic pain. CIPN-  related neuropathic pain (CIPN-NP) develops during chemotherapy and often persists for 6 months and beyond  following treatment completion. As such, CIPN-NP results in long-term suffering, disability, and decreased  quality of life for cancer survivors. There are no agents available to prevent the development of CIPN, and  treatment of symptoms with anti-epileptics, anti-depressants, and opioids is suboptimal at best. Exercise, a  non-pharmacologic intervention, holds promise as a new modality for reducing CIPN-associated pain and  functional decline. Thus far aerobic exercise and resistive training have been shown to 1) reduce severity of  CIPN development in patients being treated for hematologic cancer; and 2) improve nerve fiber integrity in  patients with diabetes. In this study, we will examine the effect of aerobic exercise and resistive training on  CIPN-NP in subjects who have completed chemotherapy treatment for 6 months or longer. The purpose of  this study, therefore, is to test our hypothesis that exercise will decrease pain and improve nerve fiber  integrity in subjects with persistent CIPN-NP following chemotherapy completion. We will test our hypothesis  with the following study aims:    AIM1: Determine the effects of aerobic exercise and resistive training versus attention control on CIPN-  NP (quantitative sensory testing, Neuropathic Pain Scale) in cancer survivors who have completed chemotherapy. AIM 2: Determine the effects of aerobic exercise and resistive training versus attention control on  peripheral sensory fiber and epidermal innervation integrity in subjects with CIPN-NP."

"9278962","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The demand for safe and effective therapeutic technology continues to increase as worldwide cancer diagnoses increase. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising option to focus acoustic energy for non-surgical ablation of tumors, while avoiding surgical complications and long recovery times. With HIFU, acoustic energy is delivered to a target location, and in the process, causes warranted damage by over-heating the tissue and/or causing mechanical injury. There remain concerns with HIFU regarding long surgical time, high energy requirements, and off-target effects, such as skin burns, due to acoustic energy delivery requirements. A new technology which could increase the amount of heating delivered to the site of pathology, while reducing off-target thermal damage would be highly clinically significant. Microbubbles have shown potential to decrease energy requirements by providing enhanced conversion of acoustic energy to thermal and mechanical energy through cavitation. Limitations in microbubble diameter prevent extravasation outside the circulatory system, and their thin shells give them a very short half-lif in vivo. Phase-changing nanoagents (PCNAs), a novel nanoparticle in the field of ultrasound, can be developed by compressing the gas-core of microbubbles into a liquid. These agents possess a diameter range of several hundred nanometers, likely capable of extravasating through the leaky vasculature of tumors and accumulating in tumors due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In the following proposal we aim to optimize nanoagent formulation and improve HIFU performance through further development of PCNAs. Little has been done in regards to evaluating and optimizing in vivo PCNA behavior, specifically optimizing their extravasation and accumulation potential as well as evaluating their circulation time in vivo. We propose to work towards generation of a PCNA designed to accumulate in tumors and provide sustained tumor circulation, which can be used for HIFU ablation effectively. PCNA properties will be modified by varying the type of perfluorocarbon gas used, the diameter distribution of PCNA formulation, and the shell composition. Ideal nanoagents for HIFU will have properties of long circulation time, long accumulation time inside tumors with little deposition in  healthy tissue, and enhanced ablation at the target with minimal off-target damage. PCNA formulations will be tested in the treatment of mouse melanoma tumors to test this hypothesis. It is the hope that the successful completion of all three proposed aims will demonstrate the versatility of the nanoagents and advance the PCNA technology for clinical applications in ultrasound for therapy and diagnostic imaging."
"9409094","This Direct to Phase II SBIR project addresses the need for safe and effective drug delivery after lower extremity angioplasty. Globally over 200 million people suffer from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Both the disease and economic burdens of PAD are projected to grow rapidly, with the US PAD population projected to grow to 22M in 2020 as costs currently exceed $20B. The leading cause of this growth is an aging US population that faces a disease whose prevalence increases with advancing age. In the advanced stages of PAD, angioplasty, the expansion of an occluded artery, is the state of the art for treatment. However, the lifespan of angioplasty can be as brief as 3 months in the periphery due to restenosis, the re-occlusion of the blocked artery by the overgrowth of its own cells. As a result, it is recommended that interventionalists wait to perform angioplasty on patients until the onset of critical limb ischemia (CLI), a catastrophic vessel blockage that results in severe pain and can lead to amputation. In order to address these needs, SoundPipe is commercializing a platform to deliver drugs that can prevent restenosis, the Guidance by Ultrasound Imaging and Delivery Enhancement of Therapeutics (GUIDE-Tx) system. This novel catheter-based system uses ultrasound to simultaneously image the vasculature and enhance delivery of restenosis preventing drugs after angioplasty. The drugs are carried by microbubbles ejected from the tip of the catheter where they are guided to a precise location by intravascular ultrasound. There, under ultrasound image guidance, the ultrasound and microbubbles enhance permeabilization of the cell membrane and release the drug from the microbubbles. This technique controls drug dose and spatial coverage, providing a versatile method for preventing restenosis after angioplasty. SoundPipe?s technology will improve angioplasty by: 1) allowing the interventionalist to control drug dose, type, and coverage and 2) offering image guidance during drug delivery. The added versatility will foster innovation in the field of intravascular drug delivery. This Direct to Phase II SBIR will use a series of in vivo swine and rabbit studies to evaluate whether 1) drug delivered by GUIDE-Tx is of a sufficient dose and is retained by the artery, 2) GUIDE-Tx reduces neointimal hyperplasia, 3) systemic doses of drug following GUIDE-Tx treatment are safe and low. Key technological innovations for this project include a dual mode intravascular drug delivery and imaging system. Plans for Phase III include clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of GUIDE-Tx."
"9325496","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is submitted in response to RFA DK-13-003 which solicits applications from qualified investigators for the continuation of the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN). Indiana University is one of the five founding clinical centers and has robustly participated in all DILIN operations since its inception. We propose the following specific aims to meet the goals of this RFA. Specific Aim # 1: To enroll large number of eligible adults with suspected DILI into ongoing DILIN studies. We propose to collect prospective cases of suspected DILI from multiple sources in Central Indiana, each providing distinctive epidemiological facets and research potential. Specific Aim # 2: To enroll significant number of eligible children with suspected DILI into ongoing DILIN studies. We propose to include Cincinnati Children's Hospital as a satellite site to significantly increase the number of children enrolled into ongoing DILIN studies. Specific Aim # 3: The DILI is currently a diagnosis of exclusion and it can be a challenging diagnosis to make. We propose to conduct two ancillary studies in order to develop tests that facilitate the diagnosis of DILI: (i) we will conduct a discovery proteomic study of individuals with acute liver injury due to DILI and non-DILI etiologies enrolled within two weeks of liver injury onset to identify biomarkers specific for acut liver injury due to DILI; (ii) DILI can sometime mimic autoimmune hepatitis and it is difficult to distinguish it from de novo autoimmune hepatitis. To address this clinical conundrum, we will conduct a preliminary study for autoantibody profiling using an auto-antigen array assay among individuals with (i) acute DILI with autoimmune hepatitis-like features, (ii) acute DILI without autoimmune hepatitis features, and (iii) acute autoimmune hepatitis without precedent medication exposure. Specific Aim # 4: DILI carries considerable mortality and morbidity but there is no treatment available other than withdrawing the offending agent. In order to address this unmet therapeutic need, we propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of budesonide in individuals with well characterized hepatocellular DILI meeting predefined eligibility criteria. Our hypothesis is that oral budesonide, a steroid with hig glucocorticoid activity and substantial first pass elimination, attenuates liver injury and improve outcomes of patients with hepatocellular DILI."
"9542543","Project Summary/Abstract: We propose to continue our global health research training program called Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) program designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and professionals prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the last 4 years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who can dedicate their research career to address the health problems that arise out of inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human settlements that the United Nations has defined as slums. Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary and integrated approach to deal with slum health issues, developed over many years by various participating faculty members of this program. This program will be comprised of 4 US partner institutions (Consortium) that include University of California at Berkeley, Yale University, Stanford University, and Florida International University, each led by a leader in global health research with many years of collaborative relationship among themselves. Together, core training faculty members (mentors) of these institutions currently conduct research at one of 31 sites in 23 countries, representing Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Oceania. The training program will address a wide range of health research topics including emerging and high-consequence infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCD), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance abuse, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health. Training will target US postdoctoral fellows and pre-doctoral students, as well as low and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral fellows. They will undergo 8-12-month of training at one of the 23 countries under supervision of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC mentors. They will be provided with both research and career mentorship throughout the course of their training and tracked for career development after completion of their GHES-supported research work. Thus, through this training program, we will introduce to the trainees one major and important aspect of global health research (slum health research) and provide an opportunity for them to become experts in this new global health discipline."
"9394383","Project Summary The proposed research encompasses the design of new peptide catalysts to develop methods by which desymmetrization of diarylalkanes may occur. Chiral diarylalkanes are commonly found in drug candidates as potential treatments for cancer, allergies, hypertension, etc. An overarching objective for this proposal is to understand the roles of noncovalent interactions between catalysts and substrates in imparting reactivity and selectivity so that improved catalysts may be designed for a specific outcome. In this context, two desymmetrization methods are planned to explore these fundamental design concepts for peptide catalysts. First, by combining the dynamic kinetic resolution of oxazolones with symmetry- breaking of bis(phenols), access to chiral diarylalkanes with two new stereocenters and the incorporation of amino acid derivatives is possible. Second, an enantioselective C?H amination reaction via desymmetrization of diarylalkanes is proposed through the design of an integrated peptide-metal catalyst. By joining the peptide?s potential for selective molecular recognition with the transformative power of transition metal catalysts, improvements to current C?H functionalization methods, such as low site selectivity, may be achieved. To develop these methods, detailed analysis of the relationship between catalyst structure and function will be executed with the intention of refining new catalyst structures based on this mechanistic insight. The opportunity to gain understanding from unique modes of action could facilitate extension to substrate classes beyond diarylalkanes and alternate C?H functionalization reactions. Synthetically, these new methodologies will provide access to an array of enantioenriched diarylalkanes, which are a common pharmacophore pursued in the medicinal chemistry field. Elucidating specific roles of noncovalent interactions has applications to many areas of chemistry with the potential to transform and improve established methodologies."
"9281611","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Thyroid carcinoma is the most frequently occurring endocrine cancer. Most thyroid cancers are successfully treated with surgery and radioiodine (131I). However, poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) loses its ability to take up radioiodine leading to disease recurrence and death. Additionally, patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) show very poor prognosis and survive for less than 6 months. These findings hold true for veterans as well; moreover, veterans could be at a higher risk for developing thyroid cancer due to their previous exposure to radiation and the enhanced risk of potential exposure to radiation amongst individuals who serve in the US armed forces. Therefore, a treatment that can selectively kill tumor cells that are unresponsive to radioiodine treatment and the anaplastic thyroid cancer cells is highly desired. TRAIL is one such potential therapeutic agent.  TRAIL is a cytolytic drug that can selectively kill cancer cells while sparing most normal cells. However, its clinical utility in cancer treatment has been limited due to the expression of TRAIL-resistance factors. Map kinase Activating Death Domain containing protein (MADD; a.k.a. IG20) can confer resistance to TRAIL- induced apoptosis in a variety of thyroid and other cancer cells. While knockdown of MADD in cancer cells rendered them more susceptible to apoptosis, it had no apparent effect on normal cells, suggesting that it might serve as an ideal target for developing cancer therapy. The ability of MADD to act as a TRAIL resistance factor is dependent upon it's phosphorylation by Akt (i.e. pMADD). Interestingly, in TRAIL sensitive cancer cells, TRAIL treatment reduced the levels of pAkt and pMADD, while they remained unaltered in TRAIL- resistant cells. However, reducing the pMADD levels by suppressing the Akt activity restored TRAIL sensitivity to TRAIL resistant cells.  This is profoundly interesting because the most aggressive forms of thyroid cancers, such as PDTC and ATC, show constitutive activation of Akt due to activating mutations in Ras or Akt1, PIK3CA gene amplification or inactivating mutations in PTEN, which can enhance tumor survival and growth. The PI3K/Akt signalling pathways are attractive therapeutic targets and drugs that can suppress this signaling pathway are in clinical trials. However, most of these are cytostatic and not cytolytic and thus allow tumors to persist, develop resistance and metastasize. Thus there is need for developing newer modalities of effective treatment.  A clearer understanding of the role of pMADD, in regulating apoptosis of ATC cells could enable us to develop effective methods to kill them. We hypothesize that TRAIL can be used to effectively kill most anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. However, in TRAIL resistant anaplastic thyroid cancer cells, MADD function can be repressed to sensitize them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis in Aim-1 we will determine if Akt phosphorylation of MADD contributes to TRAIL-resistance in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells; in Aim-2 we will test the in vivo therapeutic utility of down modulating MADD function in anaplastic thyroid cancer using an orthotopic xenograft athymic nude mouse model; and in Aim-3 we will determine the levels of MADD and pMADD in anaplastic thyroid cancers and see if they correlate with TRAIL-resistance of primary cells derived from those cancers.  Apoptosis induced by TRAIL as well as by MADD down modulation is primarily seen in cancer cells and not normal cells. Therefore, the proposed novel studies on down modulating MADD function in anaplastic thyroid cancer to enhance TRAIL sensitivity is of high clinical significance and highly relevant to VA mission."

"9348013","PROJECT SUMMARY African American women represent 2 out of every 3 cases of HIV among women of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States. While safer sex interventions have been largely utilized to target individual-level sexual risk behavior in reducing new HIV transmissions, these interventions are limited in scope and effectiveness. African American young adults have the highest rates of new and undiagnosed HIV infection in the United States. Undiagnosed HIV infections are a serious impediment to HIV prevention goals, as over half of new HIV infections among young adults result from individuals uninformed of their positive HIV status unknowingly passing on the virus. Receiving an HIV test is the only way to be knowledgeable of one's HIV status. HIV-positive individuals who know their status are less likely to pass on the virus through unprotected sex, and are more likely to be less infectious after being linked to care. Thus, increased HIV testing as a HIV prevention strategy is needed to reduce rates of new transmissions. Despite the benefits of HIV testing, limited research has examined mechanisms to increase HIV testing among African American women. Additionally, few studies have examined barriers and facilitators related to HIV testing. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) identify barriers and facilitators related to HIV testing among young African American women and 2) develop and test evidence-based health messages to increase HIV testing among this population. Study methods: Study 1 is a cross-sectional study which will identify barriers and facilitators related to HIV testing and test intentions among 100 African American young adult women (aged 18-24) through use of online questionnaires. Study 2 is an online randomized control trial that will utilize results from Study 1 to develop HIV testing messages, and to examine whether the developed messages increase rates of HIV testing behavior and HIV test intentions. This study will also examine message acceptability and feasibility. The long term objectives of the proposed research are to: 1) reduce rates of HIV transmission that happen inadvertently by making more HIV positive young adults aware of their status, 2) reduce likelihood of transmission by linking HIV positive individuals to healthcare which can thereby reduce their viral load and make them less infectious, and 3) promote HIV testing as a HIV reduction strategy among young adults and African Americans, as this strategy has been largely disregarded in favor of safer sex behavioral interventions. These messages can be utilized by clinicians and healthcare providers, HIV prevention groups/organizations, and within HIV prevention interventions to increase rates of testing. Results from this study will be disseminated scientifically through manuscript submissions and research conferences, in addition to being distributed to local HIV prevention serving organizations. Training Plan. This proposal will be guided by Dr. Faye Belgrave (sponsor), Dr. Dace Svikis (co-sponsor), and Dr. Isaac Lipkus (health message development consultant). The applicant's training plan includes frequent meetings with her sponsors and consultant, ethnics/research training, relevant coursework and workshops, clinical methods and quantitative statistical trainings, writing development, and scientific dissemination."
"9527243","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed renewal of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Wisconsin ADRC) is to support cutting-edge and innovative research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related illnesses by establishing a stimulating, interdisciplinary environment for collaborative research and by providing invaluable clinical and postmortem data and ante- mortem biospecimens. Funded by NIA in 2009, the Wisconsin ADRC will support seven well-integrated Cores, including a new Neuroimaging Core, that will support a full-spectrum of timely, innovative research including studies that will: 1) target antecedent biomarkers of preclinical stages of AD, 2) investigate the neurobiology of AD, 3) identify novel vascular and genetic risk factors and linking them to the disease pathology and clinical phenotype, 4) incorporate contemporary biochemical and molecular techniques into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, including genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and next generation genetic sequencing and 5) participate and facilitate the missions of other federal, state and local agency supported aging and dementia research programs and studies.    The overall goals of the Wisconsin ADRC will be accomplished through coordinated activities of its seven Cores. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADRC as a whole. The Clinical Core will perform standardized evaluations and collect UDS and additional data on all research participants. It will work closely with the Outreach, Recruitment and Education (ORE) and the Minority Recruitment Satellite Program (MRSP) Cores to enhance enrollment of underrepresented minorities into the ADRC. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to meet all the data management, informatics and statistical needs of the cores. It will continue to support all the PC- and web-based services and processes. The Neuropathology Core will continue to process, evaluate, store and distribute antemortem biospecimens and postmortem tissue to support novel research in AD. The ORE Core will provide a wide-range of educational and outreach programs about AD and the missions of Wisconsin ADRC to recruit research volunteers, especially those of color into the Clinical Core and other NIA-funded initiatives, such as ADCS, ADNI, NCRAD and GWAS studies. The MRSP Core will work closely with the ORE and Clinical Cores to enhance recruitment and retention of minority participants into the ADRC. The new Neuroimaging Core will bring together all the resources and expertise of the UW in neuroimaging to develop a well-coordinated program that will significantly enhance collaborative interdisciplinary research in neuroimaging of AD and related diseases.    Successful renewal of the Wisconsin ADRC will allow the Center to continue to conduct novel studies targeting antecedent biomarkers of preclinical stages of AD. Findings from these studies will result in an early diagnosis and discovery of new treatment and prevention strategies for AD that will significantly reduce the human suffering and socio-economic devastations of the disease."
"9295540","ABSTRACT Rationale: Every year, 200 million children under 5 years of age fail to reach their full cognitive development, the vast majority of cases in low-income countries (LIC). Ten percent of the global burden of disability results from neurodevelopmental impairment arising from perinatal insults. Maternal undernutrition and infections are two prevalent and modifiable pregnancy risks linked with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this K23 proposal, Dr. Lee will test the hypothesis that perinatal undernutrition and infections place the fetus at greater risk of inflammation, and in turn, risk of white matter injury, poor brain growth and long-term development. Objectives: In a cohort of 300 Bangladeshi mothers and infants, Dr. Lee will: 1) determine the associations of pregnancy undernutrition and infections on fetal inflammatory responses, 2) examine the associations of fetal inflammation and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years, and 3) explore the role of inflammation in infant brain structure and function at 3 months. She will further explore these associations among higher-risk moderate-late preterm and small for gestational age (SGA) infants. Design: In an ongoing longitudinal pregnancy-birth cohort and specimen bio-repository, Dr. Lee will test umbilical cord blood for pro-inflammatory mediators and perform secondary data analysis. She will assess the relationships between maternal nutritional status, dietary intake of potentially immuno-modulatory nutrients, prenatal infections, fetal inflammation, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years. Multivariate models will be created to determine associations between exposures and outcomes adjusting for other relevant determinants. In a subset of infants, Dr. Lee will also explore the potential effects of inflammation and prematurity on brain structure and function using MRI and visual evoked potentials. Innovation: The effects of maternal nutrition on fetal inflammation, and the interactions between nutrition and infection, have been poorly characterized in pregnancy. The role of inflammation in predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes has been inadequately described in moderate-late preterm and SGA infants, which are highly prevalent in LIC. Dr. Lee will use neuroimaging and electrophysiology in order to study the underlying mechanisms of these processes. Career Development: The K23 award would enable Dr. Lee to expand her investigation into neuro- development and build a new, independent multi-disciplinary research program. Mentored training is proposed in four key areas: 1) neurodevelopmental assessment, including neurobehavior, electrophysiology and imaging (Primary mentor: Inder, co-mentor: Nelson), 2) inflammation (Fichorova), 3) nutrition (Fawzi, Oken), and 4) longitudinal statistical modeling of child outcomes (Rosner, Baqui). The expertise, knowledge, and pilot data gained from the K23 program will enable Dr. Lee to obtain R01 funding to conduct a randomized controlled trial of perinatal interventions targeting fetal inflammation to optimize infant neurodevelopment in LIC."
"9319227","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Repeated cycles of muscle degeneration/regeneration can exacerbate tissue decline in conditions such as muscular dystrophy and sarcopenia. This decline can occur via molecular/cellular processes involving select cytokines and/or muscle stem cells (i.e., satellite cells, SCs). In rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a highly metastatic and often deadly soft tissue childhood sarcoma, tumors typically arise in muscle and show histopathological features of chronic damage more common to sites of muscle regeneration. Based on these observations and our recently published findings, chronic activation of SCs is implicated as playing a functional role in fostering neoplastic progression of RMS. Our experimental data include that: (i) SCs facilitate tumor engraftment in an interleukin (IL)-4 Receptor (IL4R?)-dependent manner, (ii) IL4R?-blockade significantly curtails lymphatic and hematogenous metastases, and (iii) SCs fusion to RMS cells is also IL4R?-dependent, the functional significance of which is yet unknown. That said, with regard to the latter, fused cells in murine RMS models are strongly reminiscent of multinucleated, differentiated yet proliferative (Ki67+) rhabdomyoblasts found in human RMS. Given that similar multinucleated cells are tumor-propagating in other forms of sarcoma, we hypothesize that IL4R? blockade will prevent new RMS engraftment, metastases and relapse by interfering with RMS-SC interactions and thus represent an efficacious therapeutic strategy for children with RMS. In response to the pressing clinical need of children with this disease for new agents, our overall goal here is not only to identify functionally significant mechanisms regulating RMS progression, but to also translate this knowledge into a feasible therapeutic strategy for RMS intervention in partnership with Children's Oncology Group cooperative trial investigators. Thus, taking a combined muscle and tumor biology approach using state-of-the-art genetic murine RMS models and human RMS culture models, we will: (Aim 1) Delineate contribution of SC-tumor cell fusion to RMS progression, and reveal functional significance of IL4R? as well as CCL-CCR chemotaxis for cell fusion. These studies will define tumorigenic properties (engraftment, metastasis, chemotherapy-radiation resistance) of experimentally-generated, multinucleated SC-RMS fused cells. (Aim 2) We will determine the functional contribution of IL4R? signaling in infiltrating host cells, SCs and malignant RMS cells to disease progression. These genetic studies will define significance of IL4R? signaling in SCs, RMS cells, and stromal cells (macrophages, fibroblasts, fibrocyte- adipocyte progenitors) in the RMS tumor microenvironment, and (Aim 3). We will evaluate the IL4R? signaling cascade as a preclinical therapeutic target in RMS with a clinical-grade reagent, e.g., REGN668. In the end, results from these studies will define functional mechanisms regulated by IL4Ra signaling is RMS that can be rapidly translated to the clinic."
"9342881","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biofilms are ubiquitous in medical, environmental, and engineered microbial systems. The majority of naturally occurring microbes grow as mixed species biofilms. These complicated biofilm consortia are comprised of a large number of cell phenotypes with complex interactions and self-organize into three-dimensional structures. While foundational to the vast majority of microbial life on the planet, the basic design principles of consortia biofilms are still poorly understood. We believe that a combination of computational and experimental tools is needed to address the challenge of characterizing, predicting and treating these complex systems. The overarching goal of this project is to develop an experimentally driven, predictive multiscale model that generates quantitatively accurate predictions of biofilm formation dynamics, species distributions and responses to perturbations. The biofilm model will be formulated by combining genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of individual species with reaction-diffusion equations for nutrient, metabolic byproduct and antibiotic transport through the biofilm. The biofilm model will be multiscale with respect to both time and length scales, with the metabolic models linking individual genes to cellular dynamics and the consortia model linking individual cells to community dynamics. The research will be developed using a medically relevant, three species chronic wound model system. Treatment of chronic wounds costs the US in excess of $25 billion per year and the costs are anticipated to grow rapidly due to the rise in diabetes and obesity. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) construct and evaluate a multiscale metabolic modeling framework for multispecies consortia biofilms in a dynamic, spatially resolved format; (2) develop and implement spatially resolved biofilm analytical methods to quantify physiologies of consortia and monoculture biofilms to inform and validate the computational model; and (3) predict and test spatially resolved metabolic responses to culturing perturbations including antibiotic treatments with iterative loops of hypothesis refinement. Expected outcomes of the proposed research are: (1) a general methodology and associated software tools for multiscale modeling of microbial biofilms to predict consortia dynamics in heterogeneous environments suitable for distribution to the multiscale modeling community; (2) experimental tools for spatially-resolved measurement of mass and energy balances within interacting consortia biofilms; (3) the first perturbation analysis of monoculture and multispecies chronic wound biofilms to nutrient variations and antibiotic treatments; and (4) proposed therapeutic strategies for effectively treating microbial consortia biofilms."
"9339579","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Original contributions from our laboratory have established novel roles for small G-proteins [e.g., Rac1, Cdc42] in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [GSIS] from normal rodent and human islets. We provided the first evidence to suggest that these G-proteins undergo post-translational lipidation via incorporation of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups at their C-termini. Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated novel regulatory roles for protein farnesyltransferase [FTase] and geranylgeranyltransferase [GGTase] in ß-cell function including GSIS. Our efforts have also led to the identification of novel regulatory factors for these G-proteins including GDP-dissociation inhibitors [GDIs] and guanine nucleotide exchange factors [GEFs], which appear to precisely control signaling steps leading to GSIS. During the course of these investigations, we noticed significant defects in FTase/GGTase signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo models of glucolipotoxicity, endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress and T2DM. As a logical extension of the previously funded studies, and based on recently accrued exciting preliminary evidence we propose to test the overall hypothesis that glucolipotoxic and ER stress conditions induce defects in the FTase/GGTase signaling cascade leading to sustained activation of small G-proteins [Rac1] and mitochondrial dysregulation and demise of the islet ß-cell. We will accomplish this goal via experiments described under three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if glucolipotoxic and ER stress conditions promote alterations in the FTase/GGTase signaling pathway leading to the metabolic dysfunction and apoptosis of the islet ß-cell. In its support, we present preliminary evidence to suggest significant reduction of FTase/GGTase activity and sustained activation of small G-proteins [Rac1] in pancreatic ß-cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Studies in Aim 2 will delineate the mechanisms underlying sustained activation of G-proteins and accelerated stress kinase signaling steps [JNK1/2, p38 MAP kinase] in the islet ß-cell under conditions of glucolipotoxicity and ER stress. Our preliminary evidence also suggests that inhibitors of Tiam1 [NSC23766] and Vav2 [Ehop-016], two known GEFs for Rac1, significantly attenuated glucotoxic effects in islet ß-cells. Experiments described under Aim 3 will determine if pharmacological intervention and prevention of alterations in FTase/GGTase signaling axis, sustained [constitutive] activation of G-proteins, and abnormalities in downstream metabolic events restore normal ß-cell function in animal models of diet-induced obesity and T2DM. The proposed studies are innovative and carry significant translational impact as they will provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms for defective FTase/GGTase signaling events leading to islet dysfunction in T2DM, and the data accrued from these studies will form the basis for the identification of novel targets in the FTase/GGTase and G-protein signaling cascades for development of therapeutics to treat T2DM in humans. Our long-standing expertise in the area of G-protein prenylation in islet function including GSIS gives us a unique opportunity to address these important aspects of islet function in health and in diabetes."
"9481633","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury death among adults aged 25 to 64 years in the United States. The number of fatal overdoses involving opioid pain relievers nearly quadrupled between 1999 and 2012, and fatal overdoses related to heroin more than doubled between 2010 and 2013. Public health interventions designed to reduce opioid overdose deaths are urgently needed. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that reverses opioid overdoses. Increased access to naloxone has been shown to reduce opioid overdose mortality; however, naloxone is a prescription drug, which limits opportunities to expand its distribution. In March 2014, Massachusetts established an innovative program that allows the issuance of naloxone standing orders (NSO) at community pharmacies. Under NSO, pharmacies can dispense naloxone to any individual at risk of having, or witnessing, an opioid overdose. Massachusetts is one of only four states to implement a pharmacy-based naloxone distribution program thus far, but an additional 10 states passed legislation in 2014 authorizing NSO. Accordingly, the Massachusetts program represents an important and timely natural experiment in expanding naloxone access through community pharmacies. This study will use a multiphase mixed methods research design to assess the implementation and impact of the Massachusetts NSO program. Specifically, this study will (1) characterize implementation of the Massachusetts NSO program and assess barriers and facilitators to pharmacy participation and proper dispensing; (2) examine the acceptability of pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing to illicit opioid users and potential overdose bystanders and identify factors that would increase acceptance for these two groups; and (3) assess the impact of the pharmacy NSO program on overdose mortality. At the conclusion of our study, we will have generated a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the implementation and impact of one of the first statewide pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing programs in the United States. Our findings will be of considerable value to the growing number of states considering and/or implementing NSO programs as part of their overall strategy to reduce the public health burden of opioid overdose mortality."

"9420313","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  There is growing evidence of genetic and neurobiological differences between readers with developmental dyslexia (DD) and typically developing (TD) readers, but there is no consensus on the specific origins of DD. The central goal of the proposed research is to develop a well specified brain-based account of DD, to better understand how neurocomputational mechanisms give rise to behavioral deficits, and their relation to response to treatment. Project 1 will use integrated cognitive and neuroimaging  experiments to examine neurocomputational mechanisms that have been hypothesized to interfere with reading acquisition in DD resisters, by placing limits on processing speed, capacity, and learning and consolidation. Computational modeling will clarify the nature of these neurocomputational mechanisms and provide evidence as to which types and degrees of impairment(s) give rise to the behavioral profiles of  different DD participant groups. Using younger (3rd/4th graders) and older (7th graders) cohorts of DD readers, it will develop detailed behavioral and neurobiological profiles of DDs who are treatment resisters and responders, to be analyzed with a focus on isolating specific factors that differentiate them, and predict variability within well-defined subgroups at different ages.  A total of 120 3rd/4th graders, and 70 7th/8th graders, will receive treatment (Phase I). After post-testing, 30 resisters and 30 responders from each age category will be identified for the Phase II. In Phase II, in addition to the 60 DD responders and 60 DD resisters, 60 typically developing (TD) 3''*4* graders, and 60 TD 7'^'8'''  grade controls, will participate in the cognitive and neuroimaging experiments. Phase II includes an fMRI  session using the N-back task, structural scanning to measure grey matter volume, and DTI measures.  Phase II also includes linguistic and non-linguistic learning and plasticity experiments, which are used to evaluate those brain-related predictors of group and individual differences in rate and retention. Ultimately, through this identification of the neurocomputation mechanisms that best describe DD resisters and responders at different ages, this work will inform development of better-tailored and optimized treatments for DD."
"9463131","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a translational research proposal focused on a newly identified association between striatin and two factors: aldosterone's mechanisms of action and vascular function. Striatin is a cytosolic protein that has been reported to be a criticl intermediate in estrogen's non-genomic mechanism of action. Recently, we have documented that striatin: 1) is present in several cardiovascular tissues, mononuclear cells and the adrenal cortex; 2) is an important regulator of aldosterone's non-genomic mechanism of action in human vascular endothelial and mononuclear cells; 3) is regulated by aldosterone and the level of sodium intake; 4) gene polymorphic variants are associated with salt sensitive hypertension in humans. These data suggest that striatin is a key modulator of aldosterone mechanisms of action and likely an important modifier of vascular function. Furthermore, variation in striatin gene expression may be involved in mediating vascular responses to changes in salt intake, potentially related to striatin's role in mediating aldosterone's mechanism of action and/or secretion. These novel findings provided entr?e to several avenues for future studies. However, this proposal will focus only on two of them: 1) determining striatin's role in modulating vascular and cardiac function and 2) assessing striatin's role in mediating aldosterone biosynthesis. These two goals will be assessed in Three SPECIFIC AIMS using a three-level translational approach - humans, genetically modified animals, and cells. First, we will test the hypothesis that in hypertensives, striatin status is an important mediator of vascular function and vascular responses to changes in Na+ intake and aldosterone secretion. Second, in mononuclear cells from hypertensives we will test three hypotheses related to the predictability of striatin gene variants on: 1) striatin levels; 2) non-genomic and striatin protein responses to aldosterone and estrogen; and 3) striatin protein responses to Na+ intake. Third, we will test the hypothesis that in genetic modified mice and cells, striatin gene status is an important mediator of vascular function, vascular responses to changes in sodium intake and aldosterone secretion. These goals will be accomplished by assessing in striatin+/+ and striatin+/- mice, placed on a liberal or a Na+ restricted diet: 1) BP; 2) ex vivo aortic functional studies; 3) in vitro molecular studies i cardiac, vascular and adrenal tissue; 4) molecular studies in primary endothelial cell cultures and 5) mononuclear cells. Studies in a human adrenal cell line will assess more directly striatin's role in regulating aldosterone secretion. Thus, completing the proposed aims of this project, will define how striatin influences cardiovascular function, its interaction with sodium intake and aldosterone and may provide entr?e to valuable new approaches to prevent and/or treat hypertension and its consequences."
"9336848","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed nations and is a major health issue in Veterans. Despite numerous pharmacological agents targeting CVD risk factors, the identification of individuals at high risk remains incomplete. Further, there is still a need to identify new targets for therapy. SAA is an acute phase reactant that is significantly and persistently elevated in chronic inflammatory conditions such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MetS) or rheumatoid arthritis, which are all associated with increased rates of CVD. SAA has been found to be predictive of CVD events. Furthermore, we and others have recently shown in murine models that increased SAA is directly pro-atherogenic. As described in the Response to Retention hypothesis of atherosclerosis, the sub-endothelial retention of atherogenic lipoproteins by vascular wall proteoglycans initiates atherosclerosis. Although in the healthy state SAA is exclusively associated with HDL, we and others have previously reported SAA in association with apoB-containing lipoproteins in murine models of diabetes and/or obesity and we recently confirmed this observation in human studies. In preliminary studies we demonstrate increased association of SAA with apoB- containing lipoproteins in insulin resistant states, which may be due to the delayed lipoprotein clearance seen with insulin resistance. In new preliminary studies we demonstrate that SAA can shift from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins. SAA itself has proteoglycan binding properties and our preliminary data demonstrates that the presence of SAA on apoB-lipoproteins enhances their retention. The central hypothesis of this grant is that the shift of SAA from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins is pro-atherogenic. We propose that the presence of SAA on apoB- containing lipoproteins in insulin resistant conditions such as MetS and diabetes contributes to the increased atherosclerosis and CVD observed in these populations. Using in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies, the results of this proposal will identify that SAA augments the atherogenicity of apoB lipoproteins and thus may identify SAA as a target for therapeutic intervention."
"9542433","PROJECT SUMMARY  Preterm birth is a significant global health challenge as a leading cause of infant mortality and costly long-term  morbidity. Rates of preterm birth in the U.S. have increased in recent decades for reasons that remain  uncertain. The recent escalation in preterm births in Puerto Rico is especially alarming, where rates have  increased from just above the U.S. average (12%) in 1997 to nearly 18% in 2009. While known risk factors for  preterm birth have failed to account for this increase, there is growing evidence that environmental factors may  play a key role. However, these factors remain understudied and underappreciated. The proposed project will  apply state-of-the-art molecular epidemiological methods to a prospective cohort study of over 1,200 live births  designed to explore environmental, clinical, demographic, behavioral and other factors that contribute to  preterm birth risk in Puerto Rico. The project also aims to provide much needed information on the potential  mechanistic pathways involved in preterm birth as it relates to environmental factors, and data on important  predictors of phthalate exposure among pregnant women. Phthalates were chosen as the primary pollutants of  interest because they are common contaminants of Superfund sites in Puerto Rico and elsewhere (several  phthalates are on the ATSDR Substance Priority List), and recent studies show widespread exposure to  phthalates in the U.S. population. In our preliminary work and in recent studies by others, multiple phthalates  have been associated with preterm birth, reduced gestational age, and other adverse impacts potentially linked  with preterm birth such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and endocrine disruption. Our preliminary data also  suggests elevated exposure to certain phthalates in Puerto Rico compared to the U.S. Using data and samples  generated by recruitment efforts of the Human Subjects and Sampling Core (Core C) and the Data  Management integration provided by Core D, we will collect detailed questionnaire data, clinical information,  and measure phthalate metabolites in urine samples collected from pregnant women at multiple time points in  pregnancy. We will evaluate phthalate metabolite levels for associations with residence, water sources, water  phthalate contamination, diet, activities, and product use to identify determinants of high exposure and  opportunities for exposure reduction strategies. Using innovative statistical methods, we will assess the  association between exposure to phthalates and risk of preterm birth, both as individual chemicals and as  phthalate mixtures. We will also explore relationships between phthalate exposure and biomarkers of oxidative  stress, inflammation, and endocrine disruption measured at multiple times during pregnancy to provide data on  biologic pathways that may link environmental exposures with early parturition. The proposed study will provide  much needed information on preterm birth risk factors in Puerto Rico and a rich resource for future  investigations and follow-up. Identifying modifiable environmental risk factors for preterm birth could have huge  public health impact since interventions aimed at preventing preterm birth to date remain largely ineffective."
"9396113","Abstract  Neurons of the central nervous system have a limited ability to survive and regenerate following axonal injury. Interventions to protect remaining cells and induce axonal regeneration have produced promising, yet ultimately unsatisfying, results, falling far short of recovery. To improve upon these results, it is imperative to determine why some neurons respond better than others. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose axons pass through the optic nerve, offer a tractable system to study these processes. Previously, our lab found that the progression of RGC degeneration following axonal damage (optic nerve crush, ONC) is not stochastic but instead is cell-type dependent. Further, axon regeneration was also cell-type restricted following two different interventions targeting the mTor pathway. These findings demonstrate that cell-intrinsic characteristics can have a strong influence on neuron degeneration and regeneration. However, this study only examined a few of the >30 RGC subtypes, and as such it was not possible to determine the characteristics that separate susceptible and resilient subtypes. In this study, I will determine the full cohort of RGCs that survive and regenerate following ONC, with or without different interventions. I will also examine the transcriptional differences between subtypes, which could underlie their differential responses. Two main approaches will be used to address these questions. First, I will use combinatorial immunohistochemistry in whole mount retinas to quantitatively track RGC subpopulations using established molecular and genetic tools. Second, I will perform massively-parallel single-cell mRNA sequencing on thousands of RGCs using DropSeq to characterize gene expression of all RGC populations in an unbiased manner. Together, these results will provide a comprehensive look into why RGC subtypes respond differently to axonal injury. This has important implications for understanding the different ways degeneration progresses in neurons and how therapeutic strategies could be sculpted to meet the needs of different populations."
"9330788","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The kidneys remove numerous organic solutes from the plasma. Remarkably little is known, however, about the relation between these solutes and health outcomes in patients with kidney disease. Care is now guided almost exclusively by measurement of only two solutes, creatinine and urea, which are known to be imperfect predictors of clinical events. The proposed study will employ new mass spectrometric methods to identify additional solutes associated with important clinical outcomes. These metabolomic methods allow for the simultaneous measurement of numerous solutes in individual samples. The current proposal will apply these methods to two major clinical problems. The first aim is to identify solutes for which impaired tubular secretion predicts the progression of chronic kidney disease. In focusing on glomerular function, nephrologists have neglected the possibility that impaired tubular secretion predicts the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The candidate has recently employed high resolution untargeted mass spectrometry to identify solutes which are very efficiently secreted by the normal kidneys. The proposed study will use similar methods to interrogate appropriately stored samples from prospective studies of patients with CKD. Untargeted mass spectrometry will identify candidate solutes for which impaired secretion is potentially associated with the rat of progression of CKD. Follow-up studies will establish the chemical identity of solutes of interest. More quantitative assays using tandem mass spectrometry with isotopic dilution will then be employed to confirm the relation of specific solutes to progression in a larger population. Results will test the hypothesis that impaired tubular secretion predicts the risk of kidney disease progression independent of established markers. The second aim is to identify solutes which may cause uremic symptoms. We know remarkably little about which retained solutes cause illness when the kidneys fail. The proposed studies will use untargeted mass spectrometry to interrogate plasma samples from patients maintained on hemodialysis. Untargeted mass spectrometry will identify candidate solutes potentially associated with prominent uremic symptoms. Follow-up studies will establish the chemical identity of solutes of interest. More quantitative assays using tandem mass spectrometry with isotopic dilution will then be employed to confirm the relation of specific solutes to symptoms in a larger population. Results will test the hypothesis that state of the art mass spectrometry can identify retained solutes associated with uremic symptoms. Both aims are designed to yield new chemical knowledge which could facilitate the design of future clinical trials and potentially lead to new methods of treatment."

By all core metrics, the UJMT fellowship program has been highly successful: 132 doctoral students and postdoctoral students trained, 109 manuscripts published (including 69 as first author), 204 conference abstracts presented, and ~$1.7 million in program co-funding raised. Over half of our postdoctoral fellows have taken academic positions after completing the program; many have successfully competed for research funding, including from the NIH, to become independently funded investigators. In the coming grant cycle (2017-2022), we will expand upon these strengths to further build capacity in global health research. First, we will enrich the pool of talented US and LMIC investigators committed to solving global health problems. We will recruit doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows from 33 domestic training programs (i.e., T32) and 17 international programs (i.e., D43, R25) affiliated with our institutions. We will provide 12-month, intensively mentored field opportunities that connect trainees with experts across a wide range of scientific areas and disciplines. We will continue to foster research in HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, emerging infections, cancers, mental health, neurologic disorders, and women's health. Second, we will implement and iteratively improve a program curriculum tailored to the professional development goals of trainees, alumni, and mentors. We will build upon the activities of our current program (e.g., scientific writing, webinars, core skills checklists), while enhancing new areas such as cultural competency and global research ethics. We will also dedicate resources to improving mentorship within our program, including support for trainees and mentors alike. Third, we will strategically allocate resources to support LMIC site capacity building. We will competitively award funds for workshops and short courses, specialty skills training, and equipment to support long-term research infrastructure. We will collaborate with existing D43 training programs in our focus countries to maximize the impact of our investments. In countries with high capacity (e.g., Malawi, Peru, Uganda), we will help to align and coordinate ongoing activities; in countries with fewer dedicated resources for capacity building (e.g., Ghana, Sierra Leone), we will facilitate South-South and North-South partnerships to identify gaps and prioritize needs for future grant support. Our program leverages a unique set of resources, training faculty, and sites that directly further four of the five strategic goals set forth by the Fogarty International Center in 2014: building research capacity, supporting implementation science, advancing research on communicable and non-communicable diseases, and forming partnerships to advance global health research."
"9224420","PROJECT SUMMARY This career development award will allow Dr. Torchen to develop the experience and skill set required to achieve her long term goal of establishing an independent research program primarily focused on investigation of the developmental and genetic origins of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Through this work, Dr. Torchen hopes to translate her research findings into clinical practice in order to improve early prevention and treatment interventions for this disorder. If these goals are achieved, she will have a lasting impact on her scientific field and improve the clinical care of patients with PCOS. Controversy regarding diagnosis of PCOS during early adolescence has delayed implementation of prevention and treatment strategies, so the impact of Dr. Torchen?s proposed work is significant. Dr. Torchen will use this award to enhance her skills in execution of physiologic protocols and to develop skills in statistical and molecular genetics. These skills will leave her well-positioned to successfully compete for independent funding in the next phase of her career. Dr. Torchen will achieve her training goals through a career development plan that consists of intensive mentorship, completion of a Master?s Degree of Science in Clinical Investigation, participation in institutional scientific and career development seminars, and attendance and presentation at national meetings. Her primary mentor is Dr. Andrea Dunaif, an expert in clinical studies in PCOS, who has ongoing NIH support and an excellent record of mentorship. Her secondary mentors are Dr. Robert Rosenfield, a pediatric endocrinologist and international expert in reproductive physiology in childhood and adolescence, and Dr. Margrit Urbanek, a molecular and statistical geneticist focused on identification of genes important in the pathogenesis of complex genetic traits. The overall goal of Dr. Torchen?s research strategy is to identify early clinical and genetic markers of PCOS in daughters of affected women and obese girls. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that early adolescent postmenarchal PCOS daughters will have a distinct reproductive and metabolic phenotype characterized by ovarian hyperandrogenism, increased ovarian follicle count, and evidence for pancreatic ?-cell dysfunction, which hyperandrogenic obese girls and control girls will lack. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that early adolescent PCOS daughters with ovarian hyperandrogenism and increased ovarian follicle count will fulfill diagnostic criteria for PCOS at postmenarchal age three years, while hyperandrogenic obese girls will fail to meet these criteria. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that a PCOS genetic risk score will predict the diagnosis of PCOS in this adolescent cohort."

"9340221","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Theoretical neuroscientists use neuron models to predict, understand, and explain biological neuron behavior. They often work with reduced neuron models that abstract away biological details but capture essential neuronal dynamics. This choice facilitates mathematical tractability, conceptual analysis, and computational speed. However, the tradeoffs inherent in using such models (instead of biologically detailed ones) are not transparent. It is often unclear if a model is faithful to essential observed dynamics of the neuron, and if so, under what model parameters and stimulus conditions. It is also rare for multiple types of reduced models to be compared in this regard, making it difficult to select the most appropriate one for a scientific question. Lastly, such models, once developed and parameterized, usually are not shared among researchers in a form that facilitates reproducibility and re-use, nor can they be easily discovered. As a result, status quo behavior in the use of reduced models is often simply to choose a favorite model regardless of merit, to optimize it for the scientific question at hand, and then to discard it.     A standard practice in professional software development is unit testing. A unit test is a procedure that validates a single component of a computer program against a single correctness criterion. An ongoing effort to develop an analogous unit-testing procedure for neuron models, NeuronUnit, enables the construction of validation tests-executable functions that validate models against a single empirical observation to produce a score indicating agreement between the model and an observation. NeuronUnit facilitates the construction and logical grouping of tests for neuron models, the parameterization of tests using a wide range of empirical data, and the execution of tests against models in a continuous and transparent fashion. Aggregate results provide both theoretical and experimental neuroscientists with an overview of model suitability for targeted research questions. Merits and deficiencies of competing models are clearly visible, benefiting ongoing modeling efforts and informing new theoretical and experimental directions.       This proposal aims to expand NeuronUnit to create data-driven, neuron-type-specific validation tests for reduced models. The ability of a range of reduced models to capture the relevant membrane potential and spiking dynamics of specific biological neuron types in response to specific stimuli, using publicly available experimental data from numerous sources, will be quantitatively tested and visualized. In doing so, the merits and deficiencies of each reduced model-as well as tradeoffs in model complexity, speed, and analysis-become transparent, providing critical information for model choice.      Project aims are to 1) express a large number of reduced models using NeuroML/LEMS, 2) implement NeuronUnit testing of these models against data from a wide range of neuron- and experiment-types, 3) provide web-based search and visualization for test results and corresponding simulations, and 4) make these models available both as NeuroML documents and as code for every NeuroML-supported simulator. Collaborations with multiple existing initiatives will promote uptake of these tools, which for the first time, will provide a rigorous, transparent process for evaluation and selection of reduced models to address scientific questions about neurons.     This project goes beyond model sharing by facilitating the dissemination of information about the performance and applicability of reduced neuron models in the context of specific datasets, complementing the existing dissemination mode of manuscript publication. By making model choice more deliberate and model appropriateness more objective, this work highlights which models should be used to address which scientific questions and why, without the need for a deep literature search (for models and data) or the installation of new tools or re-coding of models for simulation. The project also serves neuroscience educators by providing an interactive platform for visualization of reduced model dynamics accessible to any student, using data from biological neurons. This work broadly transforms theoretical neuroscience: by giving modelers a tool to select models quickly and with clear purpose; by rigorously identifying the models best-suited for further research efforts; and by helping experimentalists enhance the impact of their work."
"9391550","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells are a small subset of malignant cells which are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) and are able to repopulate a tumor after cytotoxic treatment. It is these quiescent cells which can seed cancer relapse and metastasis, even in cases of apparent complete response to treatment. Immunotherapy offers a tremendous advantage over cytotoxic therapies to target CSCs because immune effector cells do not require targets to be actively proliferating. Therefore, immune-mediated killing appears to be an attractive candidate for targeting CSCs following the depletion of non-CSCs. Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes which play a major role in eliminating transformed cells. NK cells not only attack hematologic malignancies and circulating solid tumor cells, but they also appear to have the unique ability to spontaneously recognize and reject allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Our laboratory has extensive preliminary data demonstrating that ex vivo activated NK cells can preferentially target CSCs in multiple experimental models, including tumor cell lines, primary tumor samples, and xenograft mouse models. In parallel, we have observed that RT and chemotherapy enrich for CSCs due to preferential targeting of non-CSCs by cytotoxic therapy. In addition, we have shown that RT sensitizes tumor cells, especially CSCs, to NK cell attack and recruitment. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the combination of RT and NK immunotherapy will be more effective than standard anti-proliferative therapy or immunotherapy alone because we will be able to simultaneously target both non-CSCs and CSCs. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following 3 Specific Aims: The first specific aim will determine the mechanism by which NK cells recognize and kill CSCs. This aim will also examine the effects of RT on the sensitization of the CSC to NK killing. Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate that activated NK cells recognize and preferentially attack CSC populations compared with non-CSC in breast, pancreatic, and sarcoma malignancies. We hypothesize that RT debulking of non-CSCs will augment the ability of NK cells to destroy the CSC population resulting in the greatest anti-tumor effects. Our second specific aim will test the efficacy of combination of NK and local RT against xenograft tumor models including both orthotopic breast, pancreatic, and sarcomas and patient-derived xenografts. Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate that RT will improve NK immunotherapy by decreasing tumor bulk, enriching CSCs, sensitizing CSCs to NK attack, and recruiting NK cells to the tumor site. Our third specific aim will utilize the world-class UC Davis Veterinary Cancer Center to establish a clinical trial in canine companion animals. This trial will involve the use o autologous NK cells from canine sarcoma patients in combination with palliative RT or chemotherapy directed towards either primary or metastatic tumors. Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that NK cell radio-immunotherapy will show local and systemic anti-tumor effects targeting CSCs and non-CSCS with minimal toxicities in canine patients. The aims of this research will elucidate the role of adoptive NK immunotherapy to target CSCs with the goal of translation to meaningful clinical benefit for patients with solid cancers."
"9316588","Abstract Th17 cells are an Interleukin-17-producing subset of CD4+ T effector cells that are centrally implicated in many human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, from inflammatory bowel disease to multiple sclerosis. The retinoid orphan receptor gamma t (ROR?t), a nuclear hormone receptor, programs Th17 cell development and function. With the ultimate goal of modulating inflammatory T cells in disease settings, we undertook chemical and genetic screening to identify ROR?t target genes that drive human Th17 cell function. Intriguingly, our results implicated a group of genes in a novel pathway that would link lipid metabolism, ROR?t activity and Th17 cell functions. We will thus test the hypothesis that Th17 cell function is controlled in large part, by ROR?t target genes, via lipid droplets (LDs) (cellular organelles associated with lipid metabolism). We will take the following approaches: First, we will determine if LD- related genes ? specifically, HILPDA and BNIP3 ? are necessary, sufficient and specific regulators of human Th17 cell functions. Second, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which LDs modulate Th17 cell differentiation. Third, using autoimmune disease models in mice, we will determine the physiological significance of LDs in inflammation and autoimmune pathologies. Our results may shed a light on novel lipid-regulatory mechanisms that control Th17 cell responses in inflammatory diseases."
"9248849","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    There is good evidence that the regulation of energy intake (EI) changes with aging. The anorexia of aging has been described and is associated with reduced hunger and reward-related eating and thus with reduced EI and ultimately weight loss. Paradoxically, however, obesity rates are increasing in older individuals, and within this rapidly growing segment of our population, the problem of obesity and excess adiposity has become particularly widespread. While changes in energy expenditure and lean body mass are thought to be important mediators of body weight regulation or dysregulation in older individuals, there is also good evidence that aging is associated with not only reduced appetite and motivation to eat but also with impaired ability to accurately regulate EI and thus adapt to energy imbalance. The mechanisms, though, for these findings have not been well elucidated, and it is unclear whether the mechanisms responsible for the development and/or maintenance of obesity are impacted by age. Because of the high prevalence of obesity in older-aged individuals and the number of unanswered questions and controversies, it is critical to determine the mechanisms for the development and/or persistence of obesity in this population and whether the mechanisms are different from younger adults. Furthermore, better understanding EI regulation in older individuals is also critical if we are to properly manage this growing population. The overall goal of this pilot project are to begin to examine age- and obesity-related differences in the regulatio of EI. Specifically, we propose to examine: 1) the neuronal response to salient visual food cues and during an impulsivity task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); 2) appetite-related ratings and peptides; 3) eating-related behaviors; and 4) ad libitum EI. These assessments will be performed in older obese (OOb) as compared to older normal weight (ONW) and younger-aged obese (YOb) individuals. We hypothesize that measures of EI regulation will favor increased EI in OOb as compared to ONW as evidenced by: 1) increased neuronal responses to salient food cues in brain regions encoding reward, motivation and attention, and to an impulsivity task; 2) differences in measures of appetite (?hunger, ?satiet) and appetite-related peptides (?leptin, ?ghrelin, ?PYY/GLP-1); 3) increased ratings of eating related behaviors; and 4) increased ad libitum EI. We also hypothesize that measures of EI regulation will favor decreased EI in OOb as compared to YOb as evidenced by: 1) decreased neuronal responses to salient food cues in brain regions encoding reward, motivation and attention, and to an impulsivity task; 2) differences in measures of appetite (?hunger, ?satiet) and appetite-related peptides (?leptin, ?ghrelin, ?PYY/GLP-1); 3) decreased ratings of eating related behaviors; and 4) decreased ad libitum EI. More than 35% of Veterans in primary care are obese and this percentage is likely even higher among older Veterans. The knowledge generated by this project is expected to guide therapeutic weight loss strategies in the VHA and will advance GRECC research on Consequences and Treatments of Obesity in Older Adults."
"9277192","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Demyelination shunts depolarizing current out of the nerve. As a result, nerve conduction of action potentials can be slowed or even eliminated. The later is known as conduction block. This change causes neurological disabilities such as sensory loss, vision loss, and limb paralysis in a variety of neurological diseases.  We have found that patients and mice with FIG4 deficiency develop a demyelinating neuropathy. This demyelination closely recapitulates features in acquired demyelinating diseases. The FIG4-deficient cells exhibit lysosomal membrane fission defect with an abnormally suppressed efflux of intralysosomal Ca2+ through a lysosomal Ca2+ channel. These observations lead us to propose the hypothesis below. Hypothesis: FIG4 deficiency deactivates Ca2+-channels on lysosomal membranes and prevents Ca2+ release from lysosomes. This, in turn, impairs lysosomal membrane trafficking (lysosomal fission defect), leading to segmental demyelination. Toward this end, we propose the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that FIG4 deficiency suppresses lysosomal fission by blocking the efflux of intralysosomal Ca2+ in myelinating Schwann cells. Specific Aim 2. To determine whether FIG4-deficiency in Schwann cell sensitizes the cell to demyelination. In this aim, we will utilize Fig4 conditional knockout mice to examine how the impaired lysosomal Ca2+-homeostasis in Fig4-/- Schwann cells may sensitize the cells to demyelination. Specific Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that FIG4 in myelinating Schwann cells is required for remyelination.  Significance of lysosomal membrane trafficking in de/remyelination is essentially unexplored. Our results have demonstrated a novel signaling pathway in FIG4 deficiency that appears to be critical in lysosomal membrane trafficking and demyelination. Since demyelination in Fig4-/- nerves recapitulates key features of acquired demyelinating diseases, results from this project are also relevant to other acquired demyelinating disorders. Furthermore, our preliminary results suggest a high probability in developing therapeutic interventions for demyelination in FIG4 deficiency."
"9249385","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Impairments in mitochondrial functions have been frequently implicated in ischemic brain injury associated with cardiac arrest or stroke. However, the extent to which mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons and astrocytes contributes to neurodegeneration is unknown, and the mechanisms leading to mitochondrial failure are elusive. Recently, it was suggested that an imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics could lead to neurodegeneration and brain damage. Furthermore, over-activation of NAD+ degrading poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP1) causes excessive cellular and mitochondrial NAD+ depletion resulting in detrimental effects for cell survival. We hypothesize that the activity of ADP-ribose catabolizing enzyme, NUDIX hydrolase NUDT9, leads to downstream mitochondrial GTP consumption and consequently to inhibition of GTPases that control the organelle's fusion. Since ischemic insult triggers an extensive fission of mitochondria, the ability to refuse these organelles is essential for cell viability. This notio is strongly supported by our data showing irreversible fragmentation of mitochondria in ischemia vulnerable regions, re-fusion of mitochondria in ischemia resistant brain cells, and genotoxic stress induced depletion of mitochondrial NAD+ and GTP pools. Our preliminary data also show that over-expression of mitochondrial NUDT9 isoform is aggravating cell death; the mitochondria are more sensitive to ischemic insult and cell death maturation is accelerated in transgenic animals with increased levels of NUDT9. The primary goal of this study is to determine whether neuronal or astrocytic activity of NUDT9 is a major contributor to cell death mechanisms following ischemia. To address these questions we propose to:  1. Determine the specific role of NUDT9 in mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics functions, dynamics and cell death. The role of NUDT9 in cell death of astrocytes and neurons will be examined by utilizing pure neuronal and astrocytic cell cultures prepared from brain tissue of our new transgenic animals that conditionally express mito-eYFP and NUDT9 either in neurons or in astrocytes. These cell cultures will be exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and the effect of NUDT9 on bioenergetics metabolism, mitochondrial respiratory functions, mitochondrial dynamics and cell death will be determined. In addition, cellular and mitochondrial metabolism, mitochondrial respiratory functions, and mitochondrial fusion and fission will be analyzed. Small interference RNA (siRNA)-induced knockdown of the NUDT9 gene will be used to confirm the NUDT9 effect on impairment of mitochondrial dynamics and cell death mechanisms.  2. To study the specific role of NUDT9 in post-insult impairment of mitochondrial dynamics, we will use our transgenic animals that will be subjected to transient forebrain ischemia and at designated recovery periods the alterations in mitochondrial morphometry specifically in neurons or astrocytes in brain will be examined. Finally, we will assesse the effect of NUDT9 over-expression in neurons or astrocytes on the histological and neurological outcome after ischemic insult. Similarly, we will determine the role of NUDT9 enzyme activity in the mechanism of ischemic brain damage by assessing post-ischemic histological and neurological outcome of animals pre-treated with NUDT9 targeted siRNA.  This work proposes both mechanistic and translational approaches to unravel the mechanisms of impairment in neuronal and astrocytic mitochondrial dynamics and determine its role in acute brain injury. Furthermore, the identification of a novel metabolic link between NAD+ catabolism and inhibition of mitochondrial fusion will offer new protective mechanisms that could significantly impact the clinical application of NUDT9 inhibitors as therapeutic compounds for acute brain injury such as global ischemia, stroke, TBI or chronic neurodegenerative disease."
"9324218","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is submitted for renewal of the NIH/NIDDK Research and Translational PKD Research grant entitled Mayo Translational PKD Center (MTPC) that began funding on July 1, 2010. The overall goal of MTPC is to develop Core facilities to support existing and stimulate new PKD research by Mayo and non-Mayo investigators and to facilitate the translation of basic research breakthroughs into improvements in clinical practice through the implementation of clinical trials. The three MTPC Biomedical Research Cores were chosen after thoughtful analysis of the services that would be most effective in achieving the MTPC goals, build on the existing strengths of the PKD investigators at Mayo, and updated in response to our experiences over the past four years of operation. The focus of the Molecular Genetics and Biomarker Core (Dr. Peter Harris, PI) is to characterize PKD populations to facilitate clinical trials, to aid genotype/phenotype studies and gene discovery, and to provide materials and information to catalyze understanding of disease pathogenesis. The focus of the Model Systems Core (Dr. Stephen Ekker, PI) is to empower PKD research through facilitating access to PKD C. elegans, zebrafish and rodent models, to provide expertise for novel organism characterization, and to test novel therapeutics. The focus of the Human Imaging Core (Dr. Bradley Erickson, PI) is to provide accurate and reliable analysis of imaging data and to apply new and enhanced qualitative and quantitative methodologies to measure disease progression and therapeutic outcomes in ADPKD. The focus of the Pilot and Feasibility Program (Dr. Michael Romero, PI) is to attract new investigators into PKD research and provide funds and guidance to foster discovery and the generation of strong grant applications, thus strengthening the research base by developing a new generation of PKD researchers. During its four years of existence, MTPC has refined the activities of the Center in response to surveys and feedback to ascertain membership needs, strengthened its Internal Research Base and added a large External Research Base of PKD investigators. The services and cutting-edge technologies provided by the three heavily used Biomedical Research Cores have been expanded, focusing on areas of high demand and interest. The Pilot and Feasibility Program has so far funded 12 projects with an excellent return for investment, we have implemented a successful Scientific Enrichment Program that promotes synergy among its members, and built research capacity by partnering with Institutional Facilities, other Mayo and non-Mayo NIH funded Centers, and industry. Thus, MTPC has fulfilled the goals set forth by NIDDK for its PKD Research and Translation Core Centers program and is well positioned to build on these successes in the next five years."
"9515144","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of our research is to understand the mechanisms of helicases and polymerases in processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and role of RIG-I helicase in innate immunity. Our research has made major contributions to understanding how these molecular motors move on nucleic acids to catalyze DNA and RNA strand separation and synthesis. These insights can provide the basis for understanding and treatment of diseases caused by dysregulation or malfunction of these enzymes. The unifying approach is quantitative characterization of the enzymatic reactions using rigorous biochemical and biophysical methods such as transient state kinetics, single molecule kinetics, computational kinetic modeling, and crystallography. Integration of structural and functional studies allows development of a complete mechanistic picture. The elegantly simple phage T7 enzymes allowed us to probe replication reactions with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution, to develop new biophysical tools that correlate structure with function, and to propose new mechanisms that serve as a basis for studying more complex mitochondrial replication and transcription enzymes. Mitochondrial DNA deletions caused by defects in mitochondrial helicase and DNA polymerase affect energy production and result in a wide variety of neuromuscular diseases. Hence, in depth understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms of the mitochondrial DNA enzymes are critically needed. Our research on T7 and mitochondrial DNA replication will address key gaps in understanding the structure of the replisome, the proofreading mechanism of the DNA polymerase, and the DNA recombination activities of mitochondrial DNA helicase Twinkle. Our research on mitochondrial DNA transcription will provide mechanistic insights into the initiation mechanism, roles of the transcription factors, and address challenges in solving the structure of the initiation complex. Recently, we ventured into investigating the roles of RNA helicases in innate immunity by biochemically and structurally characterizing the RIG-I family of helicases. The RIG-I family of helicases are the cytoplasmic detectors of RNA viral infections, e.g. Dengue fever, West Nile, influenza, and hepatitis C. Our research will address key gaps in understanding the essential role of RIG-I helicases in initiating innate immunity by identifying crucial viral RNA recognition features, how viruses evade detection, and mechanisms that activate RIG-I. We will also address challenges in understanding the role of ATPase in RIG-I activation. This research will provide the mechanistic framework to quantitatively model the reactions of replication, transcription, and pathogen recognition that will guide in the development of therapies for human diseases including cancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial agents."

"9385422","Project Summary Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) differentiate from specialized endothelial cells in the embryo called hemogenic endothelium (HE). The transcription factor Runx1 is required for the specification of hemogenic endothelium and for the endothelial to HSPC transition to occur. However, how Runx1 does so is poorly understood. Our goal is to apply systems biology approaches to study the transcriptional regulatory network controlling hemogenic endothelial specification, including the role of Runx1, additional transcription factors that cooperate with Runx1, and the order of regulatory events that promote the process. These studies will not only increase our understanding of the normal developmental process of HSPC formation, but will help guide attempts to generate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from endothelial cells, ES, or iPS cells for the treatment of disease. In Aim 1, we will identify Runx1 target genes in embryonic endothelial cells that are competent to respond to Runx1, and examine the genome-wide chromatin modifications and gene expression changes that take place when Runx1 binds its target genes. In Aim 2, we will develop an advanced graph-theoretic method to identify key TFs that cooperate with Runx1 in embryonic endothelial cells to induce HE and form blood. We will validate the candidate TFs by determining their ability to cooperate with Runx1 to induce fetal endothelial cells to undergo endothelial to HSPC transition and form blood."
"9372431","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Public health efforts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) could be catalyzed by bolstering ways to optimally leverage local talents and resources, such as civil society. Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk factors, including tobacco. Local coalitions have been a dominant strategy in tobacco control in the US, with well-documented success in establishing smoke-free policies specifically. However, this approach has not been widely leveraged or well-studied in LMICs or those with less democratic traditions than the US. Instead, in many LMICs, smoke-free policy progress is largely initiated at the national level. Parallel civil society movements at the local level may be needed to build support for and compliance with policies. Given their sociopolitical histories and high tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) rates, Georgia (GE) and Armenia (AM) are two strategic settings for the proposed work. The smoking prevalence is 57.7% and 52.3% in men (6th and 11th highest in the world) and 5.7% and 1.5% in women, respectively. Moreover, our findings indicate extremely high rates of SHSe. However, we also documented high receptivity to public smoke-free policies despite high use rates, particularly in worksites and restaurants. This proposal is a well-justified extension of the literature and our prior work. We will build the capacity of GE and AM researchers to conduct high-quality mixed methods tobacco research and test the Community Coalition Action Theory as a framework for impacting local community-driven policy change. Researchers from the GE National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and AM National Institute of Health (NIH) will collaborate with Emory to execute the proposed research, train tobacco control researchers within their organizations and partnering universities, and train practitioners within local communities to build local coalitions for tobacco control policy. We aim to: 1) conduct a matched-pair community randomized controlled trial in 28 municipalities in GE and AM to examine the impact of local coalitions promoting the adoption of smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants, with the primary outcome of changes in SHSe over time; 2) assess how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational and municipal smoke-free policies to provide an evidence- base for public health practice; 3) disseminate research findings regarding both the effectiveness and the process of establishing and maintaining coalitions, and consequently increasing smoke-free policies and reducing SHSe, to key stakeholders in GE and AM; and 4) capitalize on the proposed research and dissemination opportunities to build tobacco control research capacity within the GE NCDC, AM NIH, and partnering universities, as well as practice capacity within local public health centers and their civil society partners. Ultimately, the activities outlined in this proposal will serve as a catalyst for future action-oriented science and evidence-based practice to support tobacco control progress in this region more broadly."
"9318332","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Not all patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) develop excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or cardiovascular disease at any given level of disease severity. Adverse outcomes of OSA may be driven by genomic, biological, and/or environmental factors, but mechanisms remain unclear. There is a need to determine genetic and biological markers and how they may influence EDS symptoms and cardiovascular risk among patients with OSA. Our overall hypothesis is that mechanisms of sleepiness and cardiovascular disease share common molecular pathways. Thus, genetic and biological factors associated with risk for sleepiness likely predict individuals who develop adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In the K99 mentored phase of the award, genetic markers and their relationship to EDS symptoms will be determined via retrospective analysis of the ongoing Icelandic Sleep Apnea Cohort (ISAC). Advanced didactic and laboratory training in translational research will complement this analysis and build upon my prior experience with genetics and biomarker research. We hypothesize that a different frequency of polymorphisms in genes such as NOX-2, NOX p22phox, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?), and PDE4D, will modify the degree of sleepiness symptoms in individuals with similar degrees of sleep-disordered breathing. In the R00 phase, a case-control study will be conducted to investigate further the relevant genetic markers identified in the K99 phase. We will recruit 64 sleepy and 64 non-sleepy OSA patients from the clinic population at the Penn Sleep Center to determine whether elevated genetic and biological markers are related to sleepiness symptoms. Our primary hypothesis is that patients with EDS symptoms (measured subjectively) will have increased biological and genetic markers. The secondary hypothesis is that those with EDS symptoms (subjective and objectively) will have increased biological and genetic markers compared to those with neither symptoms. Individuals seeking medical attention for OSA will be recruited for the study. Blood and urine samples will be obtained after polysomnography. EDS symptoms will also be measured by using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT). Cardiovascular risk measures [ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and Pulse-Wave Velocity (PWV)] will also be obtained at this time. We hypothesize that the symptoms of EDS are associated with increased cardiovascular risk measures."
"9523651","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancers are the most lethal gynaecological cancers in women in the USA. Despite the rapid progress made in ovarian cancer research in the past decades, the mortality of the epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is still very high. This may be attributed to the fact that the origin and pathogenesis of EOC are poorly understood. Recent studies identified the Fallopian tube secretory epithelial cell (FTSEC) as cell of origin for ovarin high-grade serious carcinoma (HGSC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of HGSC in the Fallopian tube, the colonization of HGSC cells in the ovary, and the final expansion of HGSC cells in the ovary are poorly understood. Studies in our laboratory find that YAP, the effector of the Hippo pathway, is able to initiate the transformation of FTSEC cells and promote the growth of FTSEC-derived tumors. We also find that YAP regulates genes and signalling pathways that are critical for tumour cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis, as well as growth factors involved in the ovarian tissues remodelling. Our preliminary studies further indicate that the Hippo/YAP signalling pathway interacts with the ErbB signalling pathway to promote the proliferation of ovarian HGSC cells. We hypothesize that the Hippo/YAP pathway plays critical roles on the initiation of HGSC in the fallopian tube, colonization of the FTSEC-derived HGSC cells in the ovary, and the final expansion and progression of the HGSC in the ovary after menopause. In this proposed project, we have designed in vivo and in vitro experiments to examine the function of the Hippo/YAP pathway on the initiation and progression of ovarian HGSC. In specific aim 1, we will use transgenic mouse model to determine the role of the Hippo/YAP pathway in the initiation of HGSC in fallopian tube epithelial cells. In specific aim 2, we will use genetically modified mouse model to investigate the biological events that lead to colonization of fallopian tube-derived tumour cells in the ovary. In specific aim 3, we will determine how the Hippo/YAP pathway associated molecules and signalling pathways regulate the expansion of fallopian tube-derived tumour cells in the ovary. Successful completion of these proposed studies will answer the following questions: What is the molecular mechanism that initiates the transformation of FTSEC cells in the fallopian tube? How do the fallopian tube-derived tumour cells colonize in the ovary? What are the factors drive the initial expansion and subsequent progression of FTSEC-derived tumour cells in the ovary? Achievement of this proposed project will provide new insight into our understanding on the development and progression of ovarian HGSC and will open a new window for the prevention and therapy of epithelial ovarian cancer."
"9348473","Summary  Dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) in the dorsal striatum are hypothesized to play a major role in methamphetamine (Meth) addiction, and self-administration paradigms of Meth intake (clinically relevant models of Meth addiction) have reported that Meth self-administration increases D1R expression in the striatum and systemic D1R blockade decreases responding to Meth and reduces Meth seeking. Systemic D1 receptor antagonism in Meth experienced animals also prevented some aspects of maladaptive alterations; e.g. Meth-induced hyperphosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the striatum and Meth reward, indicating that enhancement of ERK1/2 by Meth is an intracellular signal transduction mechanism contributing to the maladaptive plasticity associated with reinforcing effects of Meth. These studies suggest that progressive increases in the intake of Meth over extended access schedules of reinforcement may lead to persistent neurobiological alterations in the striatum through aberrant increases in D1R expression and ERK1/2 activity. Therefore, the proposal will determine whether D1Rs and ERK1/2 activity in the dorsal striatum plays a role in establishing compulsive-like self-administration in animals experiencing Meth over extended access schedules of reinforcement. New evidence demonstrates that D1R signaling occurs in discrete plasmalemmal microdomains termed membrane/lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol- and sphingolipid and the cholesterol binding and scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Cav-1 is important in regulating D1R signaling, turnover and function. Therefore, we also seek to determine whether Cav-1 in D1R expressing neurons plays a role in mediating the maladaptive behavioral responses in compulsive Meth taking and seeking in Meth addicted animals. We will test these hypotheses using well-established rodent models of compulsive-like Meth self-administration and state-of-the-art genetic and pharmacological techniques to determine the role of D1Rs, ERK1/2 activity and Cav-1 in Meth addiction. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Meth addiction in the dorsal striatum in animal models that demonstrate compulsive-like behavior has tremendous potential for identifying therapeutic interventions for reducing Meth addiction and maladaptive patterns of Meth seeking."
"9334840","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To accelerate progress in understanding and treating human type 1 diabetes (T1D), relevant biological data must be organized, exchanged, and analyzed efficiently. Achieving this goal in measurable ways continues to be a challenging and high priority need. The era of biomedical big data presents a remarkable opportunity for innovation and translational advances in T1D research, but the expansive volume, variety, and velocity of experimental information being generated in pursuit of exploration and discovery is daunting. City of Hope (COH) is applying to become the Bioinformatics Center (BC) to provide the informatics consultation, infrastructure, computing, and dataset management capabilities for the Human Islet Research Network (HIRN).

"9319347","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to lay essential groundwork for a unique, potentially transformational, model system-agnostic, Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB). Tissue phenotypes provide insights that are central to our understanding of gene function and environmental variables such as chemical exposures. Phenotypes can occur anywhere in an organism and during any time in the organism's life. To capture the full breadth of phenotypic tissue effects, organisms must ideally be evaluated across the full life span and in every cell type and organ system. We show that synchrotron microCT has the power to image mm length scale organisms at cellular resolution to produce high-contrast, 3D reconstructions of every cell in the whole organism. With these data, phenotypes occurring at different scales (system, tissue, or cell) can be evaluated simultaneously slice-by-slice or in 3D context to reveal valuable spatial relations. Accessing this tool is currently a highly involved process that is not practical for routine biology. On the basis of our data, attendees of an NHGRI-sponsored zebrafish phenome meeting, investigators meetings, two Zebrafish Models of Human Disease meetings, biologists working at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and two toxicology meetings have agreed that methods for high-throughput synchrotron-based microCT should be developed for phenotyping model system samples. Investigators working in NIH-sponsored small model systems including Drosophila, C. elegans, and Daphnia, have become interested in phenotyping their organisms. This work will allow us to establish the user base and technical foundation for a new beamline dedicated to biology, which has been approved by the Scientific Advisory Council and the Director of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory for further pursuit. Accessibility to the broader biological community requires customization of the imaging process for biological samples. An interdisciplinary team will bring key steps in synchrotron- based microCT imaging to a stage that computer scientists can enhance to achieve speeds practical for phenome projects to be completed within reasonable periods of time. We will design and implement throughput-oriented enhancements including design of sample formats for reproducible and robotic sample loading, optimization of optical components, and streamlining of image processing. We have set milestones, and will work iteratively with investigators involved in potential zebrafish, Drosophila, elegans, and Daphnia phenome projects. Broader applications of the developed tools have large potential translational impacts. Given the uniquely pan-cellular nature of the 3D images, this work will not only facilitate research with any biological model system, but also any organ system, including nervous, digestive, endocrine, reproductive, excretory, and integumentary systems. The ability to capture the effects in any part of the organism resulting from gene or environmental variables means that the research is likely to address the assigned mission of NIH, NIEHS, EPA, FDA, and DOD."
"9339548","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the Veteran population. Although cigarette smoking is the major risk factor, determinants of COPD development and progression remain incompletely understood. In this application, we propose to test a novel theory of COPD pathogenesis that we developed based on striking correlations between altered mucosal immunity in small airways and key parameters of COPD, including airway wall thickening, inflammatory cell influx, and airflow limitation. Secretory IgA (SIgA), the most abundant immunoglobulin in the airways, is delivered to the surface of small airways by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which is expressed on the basolateral surface of airway epithelial cells. In the setting of epithelial remodeling, which is pervasive in COPD, our preliminary data indicate that epithelial cells down-regulate pIgR expression and are no longer able to maintain a normal mucosal immune barrier. Exposure of mice to mainstream cigarette smoke down-regulates pIgR expression and reduces SIgA levels in the airways prior to development of COPD-like pathology. In pIgR deficient (pIgR-/-) mice, which lack SIgA in their airways, lungs are normal at birth and young adulthood but spontaneously develop COPD-like airway and parenchymal remodeling by 6 months of age. These structural changes are worsened by exposure to cigarette smoke and are associated with bacterial invasion of the airway epithelial layer, epithelial NF-kB activation, and influx/activation of leukocytes, similar o findings in humans with COPD. These data suggest that SIgA on the airway surface plays an essential role in defending the airway from environmental challenges and that altered mucosal immunity contributes to development and progression of COPD. Therefore, we hypothesize that in COPD a dysfunctional mucosal immune barrier with reduced SIgA on the surface of small airways allows access of microorganisms and airborne antigens to the airway epithelium. As a result, persistent/recurrent NF-?B activation in the epithelium drives expression of pro- inflammatory mediators that recruit and activate leukocytes. Accumulation of activated leukocytes (particularly macrophages) in the distal airways and lung parenchyma perpetuates the inflammatory state in COPD and leads to small airway remodeling and emphysema. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) to identify mechanisms that drive small airway remodeling and emphysema in mice with disrupted mucosal immune barrier function in the lungs, 2) to determine whether altering the bacterial burden in lungs of pIgR deficient mice alters development and progression of COPD-like pathology, and 3) to define the impact of NF-kB activation and macrophage recruitment/activation on development of COPD-like pathology in pIgR deficient mice. By defining the contribution of altered mucosal immunity to COPD, proposed studies will result in improved understanding of COPD pathogenesis and hopefully will lead to new effective therapies."
"9404197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This collaborative project seeks to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of the Mediator kinases (CDK8 and CDK19) and the CDK8 module. CDK8 and its paralog, CDK19, are considered Mediator kinases because of their stable, but reversible, association with the 26-subunit Mediator complex. Mediator is a global regulator of pol II transcription and appears to be required for expression of perhaps all pol II transcripts, which include all protein-coding and most non-coding RNA genes. CDK8 and CDK19 are linked to a growing number of cancers and developmental diseases, indicative of their essential-yet poorly understood-biological roles.  Here, we propose to study CDK8 and CDK19 function in the context of serum response signaling, which is fundamentally important for cell physiology, development, and cancer biology. CDK8 in particular (CDK19 is less studied) has been shown to regulate transcription of serum response genes; however, the mechanisms remain unclear due to inherent limitations with cellular knockdown approaches. Working with our collaborator Dr. Matt Shair (Harvard), we have characterized a small molecule that is an extremely potent and selective Mediator kinase (CDK8 and CDK19) inhibitor. Using this reagent, we can for the first time reliably assess the mechanistic roles of Mediator kinases in human cells. In the context of serum response, we will identify the kinase substrates for CDK8 and CDK19 by using SILAC phosphoproteomics (with/without the Mediator kinase inhibitor). Also during serum response, we will use GRO-Seq to determine how Mediator kinases affect transcription genome-wide. GRO-Seq is uniquely suited to address these questions because, among other reasons, it provides a direct and immediate picture of active transcription (including all classes of transcripts-antisense, divergent, eRNA, lncRNA, tRNA, and so on), which is essential for understanding the rapid (within minutes) cellular response to serum stimulation.  CDK8 functions in the context of a four-subunit, 600 kDa CDK8 module that also contains CCNC, MED12, and MED13. Because of its genome-wide association with Mediator, the CDK8 module seems poised to broadly regulate pol II transcription. The structure of the CDK8 module is poorly understood, which limits our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate its essential biological functions. In Aim 2, we seek to define the 3D architecture and identify functionally relevant interfaces within the CDK8 module by applying well-tested crosslinking-mass spectrometry (CXMS) approaches and innovative 3D modeling techniques. These data will be supported by detailed in vitro mechanistic studies and cell-based functional validation assays, with a goal of defining the molecular mechanisms by which the CDK8 module regulates pol II transcription and how its kinase activity is regulated. Collectively, the diverse and complementary set of experiments proposed should yield fundamental insights regarding CDK8 module and Mediator kinase function that should drive the field in new directions."
"9278963","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Department of Veterans Affairs spent over $1.2 billion to treat 28,000 of its more than 170,000 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients with new targeted antiviral medications. These combination regimens are a dramatic improvement over prior interferon-based therapies, with 90+% cure rates for hepatitis C with all-oral regimens generally for 3 months, with a reasonable side effect profile. In its current HCV Treatment Guideline, the VA states its commitment to treat all Veterans with HCV who wish to be treated and are suitable for treatment with these medications. It is fair to say that the cost of these drugs, at approximately $40-90,000 per course of treatment for a single patient, is the largest new expenditure that VA Pharmacy and Medical Services will face over the next 3-5 fiscal years. Treatment of all patients is not currently feasible because of the cost of the medications and limited VA treating capacity. We also do not know which patients who are treated will derive the most clinical benefit. Patients with cirrhosis from HCV are currently given the highest priority fo treatment, but whether their liver disease can regress and their rates of complications can be lowered by cure of their hepatitis C is not known. Likely, cirrhosis may be too late, and hepatitis C cure will not prevent complications of cirrhosis like the need for a liver transplant o the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In fact, patients with moderate liver disease without cirrhosis may well derive the most benefit. Some patients may also progress to cirrhosis despite HCV cure, and would benefit from closer monitoring. Such subtle questions require prospective studies to answer, as large databases cannot classify disease so finely. Aim 1 is to establish a prospective cohort of approximately 500 patients with known stage of liver disease who are considered for hepatitis C therapy at the San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVAMC) over the next two years, with reassessment of liver disease severity by liver imaging (including the novel methods of FIBROSCAN and MR electrography) and serum fibrosis testing at two years after enrollment. Aim 2 is to analyze the most important genes and their polymorphisms, in addition to clinical variables, that have been linked to cirrhosis development, cirrhosis decompensation, and HCC in these patients. We cannot currently predict who will develop complications from HCV, or who will derive measurable clinical benefits from hepatitis C cure, but studying the roles of recently identified genetic polymorphisms and prospectively measuring liver disease before and after therapy should allow us to address both questions."
"9294135","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop and train Nephrology fellows in Precision Medicine Research for Kidney Diseases. In the majority of patients with kidney disease, the diagnosis is based on clinical information, and sometimes by kidney biopsy. However, genetic and acquired forms of disease are usually indistinguishable based on clinical tools and frequently, the precise etiology of kidney failure remains undiagnosed. In recent years, advances in genomic, proteomic and data sciences have enabled more precise delineation of molecular mechanisms of disease, allowing reclassification of renal disorders based on primary molecular pathogenesis, and sometimes. As these advanced technologies are being incorporated into clinical practice at an increasingly rapid rate, they are bridging basic research with clinical investigations and the daily practice of Medicine. These technologies promises to have transformative effect in the care of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), because kidney disorders are frequently diagnosed based on clinical assessment alone, and late diagnosis or misclassification may cause uncertainty in identifying the etiology of disease. These advances indicate that there are major opportunities and for treeing young investigators in precision Medicine Research in Nephrology. To achieve this aim, we brought together participating a high-qualified faculty members, who bring a diverse expertise that span the full spectrum of research in Precision Medicine. They hold multiple appointments in participating departments, the Department of Medicine, The Department of Biomedical Informatics, the Center for Translational Immunology, the Department of Pathology, The Department of Genetics and Development, the Department of Systems Biology, the Center for Behavioral and Cardiovascular Health, the Department of Physiology, the Department of Biomedical Engineering, the Department of Epidemiology in the Mailman School of Public Health, and all play crucial roles in this application. All of the mentors are well funded, the vas majority with NIH funding and have a track record of successfully mentoring trainees to independent careers in investigation. This program will prepare the next generation of investigators in kidney disease research, to simultaneously acquire multidisciplinary expertise and a strong domain- specific knowledgebase to effectively design and implement research within Nephrology."
"9337061","Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Malfunction of peripheral T cells is associated with impaired learning, changes in social behaviors and reduced neurogenesis. Reconstitution of immune deficient recipients with T cells from wild type donors restores these brain functions. T cells mediate their beneficial effects on the brain through meningeal spaces, which are closely associated with peripheral immunity through the meningeal lymphatic vessels. It has also been demonstrated that chronic stress is correlated with gut inflammation and with impairments in learning and neurogenesis. We have addressed, at least partially, what type of immune cells are mediating neuro-immune interactions (T cells), and where (meningeal spaces), although how the changes in peripheral immunity as a result of stress are impacting the brain has not yet been addressed. Based on our new data, we aim to provide novel insights into these complex interactions. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in the gut microbiota as a result of stress facilitate changes in the immune composition of the deep cervical lymph nodes, which are reflected in meningeal immunity, which in turn impacts brain function, thus creating a tripartite loop: brain-immune-gut. In this proposal, we will address how metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, found to be dysregulated during chronic mild stress by the gut microbiome, affect T cell function in the meningeal spaces, and how these immune changes impact brain function. Our results suggest that gut microbiota could be targeted therapeutically to mitigate abnormal immune changes during chronic stress, which in turn would protect the brain.?"
"9337253","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Low bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) independent of traditional osteoporosis risk factors, including physical inactivity, steroid use, ad cachexia. However, osteoporosis in men with COPD is often underdiagnosed due to lack of consensus on osteoporosis screening guidelines in this group of patients. Systemic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of both COPD and osteoporosis; but few studies have shown a relationship between specific systemic inflammatory biomarkers and either low BMD or accelerated loss of BMD over time. Immunologic alterations likewise contribute to the pathogenesis of both COPD and osteoporosis but the role of autoimmunity in COPD-related osteoporosis has not been studied. An independent association between low BMD and emphysema has been supported by the literature, but the mechanism for this association is unknown. This project's overall goal is to identify specific systemic inflammatory and autoimmune processes associated with both concurrent and progressive BMD loss and emphysema in men with COPD. This goal will be accomplished by establishing a two-year longitudinal c o h o r t o f m e n w i t h C O P D and attaining baseline and two-year assessments of BMD, radiographic emphysema, a n d pulmonary function. Inflammatory biomarker levels will be measured at six month intervals and during episodes of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). Systemic inflammatory and autoimmune biomarkers associated with BMD loss, measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry, emphysema progression, measured by quantitative CT scan, and incident hip or vertebral fractures over the two-year time interval will be identified. Changes in systemic inflammatory and autoimmune biomarker levels with AECOPD and the relationship to bone turnover and cumulative BMD loss will also be assessed. The findings from this project will identify criteria for male COPD patients at risk of accelerated BMD loss in whom early and serial BMD assessments may be beneficial, provide insight into pathogenic mechanisms linking COPD and osteoporosis, and provide novel targets for osteoporosis prevention and treatment strategies in men with COPD. This project will also address an unmet public health need given that most data on skeletal health are in women."
"9337063","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with schizophrenia exhibit impaired neuronal network dynamics that can be targeted by non- invasive brain stimulation. In particular, rhythmic stimulation waveforms (transcranial alternating current stimulation, tACS) that enhance cortical synchronization may represent a targeted and therefore more effective approach to treat these network abnormalities. The long-term goal is to develop a new, noninvasive treatment for schizophrenia that is based on a mechanistic understanding of the network- level pathology. The overall objective of the R21 phase is to compare tACS and sham, with tDCS as a positive control for assay sensitivity, for treatment of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial. Additionally, the mechanism of action will be studied with electroencephalogram (EEG)-based biomarkers to elucidate the network- level effects of non-invasive brain stimulation. The objective of the R33 phase is to perform a double- blind, sham-controller clinical trial to assess the reduction in AHRS scores by five days of twice-daily tACS compared to sham stimulation (primary outcome) and the additional benefit of low-dose maintenance tACS (secondary outcome). The central hypothesis is that tACS is an effective treatment modality for auditory hallucinations and that the effectiveness of tACS correlates with changes in neuronal synchronization measured by EEG. The hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (R21: 1) evaluate tACS for the treatment of medication resistant auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia, (R21: 2) elucidate the network-level mechanisms that are targeted by tACS and determine the predictive value of EEG synchronization measures for treatment outcome, and (R33: 3) perform a larger pilot clinical trial to assess tACS versus sham stimulation (primary outcome) and low-dose tACS maintenance treatment versus sham maintenance (secondary) outcome for reduction in AHRS scores. The significance of the proposed research is the chance of significant improvement in quality of life of affected patients with successfully treated medication resistant symptoms of schizophrenia, specifically auditory hallucinations."
"9394390","1 PROJECT SUMMARY  2 This application for a Phase I SBIR award represents a collaboration between Clinitech, LLC and McLean  3 Hospital/Harvard Medical School to develop a wearable biosensor for detecting alcohol in the interstitial fluid of  4 humans who have consumed alcohol. Excessive use of alcohol accounts for much of the public health burden 5 related to alcohol use disorders, including fetal alcohol syndrome, fatal motor crashes, accidents and  6 homicides. On college campuses alone, alcohol use results annually in almost 2,000 deaths, 100,000 sexual  7 assaults, 600,000 injuries, and 700,000 assaults. These figures justify the need at many levels to have a  8 wearable device that can help track individual's alcohol consumption in real time. A prototype device has  9 already been developed for glucose and the current proposal is aimed at modifying the basic concept to 10 measure alcohol. All patents and licenses are in place at Clinitech and the McLean Hospital team has decades 11 of experience in administering alcohol to human volunteers and then measuring blood, breath and most 12 recently, tissue alcohol levels. Thus, the two sites are ideal to collaborate on this joint venture and are well 13 poised to initiate this project at a very rapid pace. The device, named LabPatch-alcohol, utilizes a novel 14 combination of technology that samples interstitial fluid from just underneath the skin by temporarily disrupting 15 the waterproof stratum corneum epidermal barrier, collecting interstitial fluid into a micro chamber within the 16 patch, and then applying an electrochemical reaction to measure alcohol concentration. The device is 17 unobtrusive, looks like an adhesive bandage, causes no injury to the skin and its operation cannot be 18 perceived by the person who is wearing it. The initial prototype will be wired to a computer and once the 19 detection circuitry is finalized and the calibrations with blood alcohol completed during this proposed Phase I 20 study, the next step (Phase II) would be to reduce the size of the patch even further and add the wireless 21 (Bluetooth) capability so that measures of blood alcohol levels can be sent directly to a website via a 22 smartphone application. This opens a number of major opportunities to provide real time oversight of 23 individuals' drinking patterns. The research plan will use an iterative approach by which Clinitech will develop 24 the prototypes and then McLean will test them with human subjects who have been given measured amounts 25 of alcohol to consume. Parallel samples of interstitial fluid and blood will be tested for alcohol concentration in 26 order to correlate the pharmacokinetic profile of alcohol in these two compartments. Full exchange of the data 27 will permit rapid adjustments made on the prototypes so that modified versions can be tested in a timely 28 manner. Key milestones for Phase I include: design and fabricate the initial prototype LabPatch-alcohol device, 29 perform initial calibration testing via benchtop studies, obtain IRB approval, conduct initial human testing, share 30 the data for improvements, retesting, preparation of Phase II application."
"9231999","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Exercise improves areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and is thought to decrease the risk of osteoporosis in older adults. Preventing osteoporosis is of major importance to Veterans since poor bone health can lead to fractures and functional disability. However, not all forms of exercise have the same effect on bone, so investigating the most effective exercises to improve bone strength is warranted. Currently, the exercises shown to influence aBMD typically involve ground reaction forces (GRF), which include activities such as walking and jumping, and joint reaction forces (JRF), such as weight lifting and rowing. Due to the distinct orthopedic challenges that combat Veterans face, GRF may not always be safe, feasible, or comfortable, so it is necessary to determine what effects JRF may have on bone health in this population. In this randomized trial, 50 older women and men, aged 60 to 75 years, will participate in 24 weeks of supervised GRF or JRF exercise at least 3 times a week. The primary aim is to investigate if GRF and/or JRF exercise in older adults lead to changes in bone strength and volumetric BMD (vBMD) at the femoral neck and lumbar spine. The rationale for this proposal is that, although GRF and JRF have both shown benefit to aBMD, cutting-edge bone-specific imaging and analysis techniques will be used to generate novel information regarding the effects of GRF and JRF exercise on bone strength. Quantitative computed tomography will be used to measure vBMD and bone architecture. 3-D image analysis with finite element analysis and statistical shape modeling will provide quantitative measures of changes in bone strength and geometry based on parameters obtained from quantitative computed tomography. These techniques provide a comprehensive assessment of the effects of exercise on the stress and strain that bone can experience before structural failure (fracture). The proposed research is significant because it compares two different exercise strategies on bone sites at high risk for osteoporotic fracture and will establish a means of comparison for a future definitive exercise trial. This research is innovative because it uses state-of-the-art technology to analyze and determine bone strength and bone shape, in addition to bone mineral density. Information gained from this research will help to define the optimal exercise prescription to improve bone strength in aging Veterans."
"9543606","Summary In contrast to conventional T cells that recognize peptides on MHC proteins, CD1 molecules present lipid antigens to T lymphocytes. The abundant expression of CD1a hallmarks Langerhans cells in the skin, a subtype of dendritic cell with antigen-presenting functions. CD1a is able to bind and display a broad spectrum of lipid antigens derived from exogenous sources, such as bacteria, or host origin. The complex immune system of the skin is critically involved in responses to extrinsic insults like allergens, as well as in autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis. However, the in vivo role of CD1a on Langerhans cells remains enigmatic, since CD1a is expressed in humans but lacking in most animal models. Our hypothesis is that CD1a on Langerhans cells is critical to control inflammatory skin diseases. We will support this hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Investigate the impact of CD1a on inflammatory skin diseases. To overcome the obstacle of CD1a lacking in normal experimental animals, we propose to use human CD1a-transgenic mice to study the impact of CD1a on skin inflammation. We show that the lipidic substance urushiol from the plant poison ivy induces severe skin inflammation in a CD1a-dependent fashion. The immune response is exclusively driven by CD1a-expressing Langerhans cells that elicit the generation of CD4 T cells, producing the inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL- 22. In a model for psoriasis, CD1a massively amplifies inflammation mediated by Th17 cells reactive with self lipid antigens from skin. Strikingly, treatment with blocking antibodies against CD1a fully abrogates skin inflammation. These experiments will provide the first in vivo evidence that CD1a on Langerhans cells is essential to control skin inflammation. 2) Elucidate the mechanism of lipid presentation and recognition in skin inflammation. For this purpose, we will analyze antigen specificity (TCR repertoire) of CD1a-restricted T cells. We plan to generate new tools such as CD1a tetramers and novel techniques for lipid loading of CD1a molecules. Further, we will develop new kinetic measurements for binding of lipids to CD1a. Using structural biology, we resolve the crystal structure of the CD1a/urushiol complex. This forms the basis for subsequent structural studies on the ternary complex between TCR and lipids presented by CD1a, and will also help to identify dominant lipid antigens in inflammatory skin diseases. Finally, we translate our findings to the human system and demonstrate that poison ivy responders and patients suffering from psoriasis show strong inflammatory T cell activation in response to CD1a. Taken together, we propose CD1a as a novel target for future therapeutic strategies against inflammatory skin diseases."

"9323542","PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed Center for Childhood Obesity Prevention will address childhood obesity prevention through a coordinated, community-based approach targeting modifiable individual risk behaviors, environmental risk factors, and state and national risk reduction policies with the goal of first halting the rise, then reducing the rate, of childhood obesity in Arkansas. Recognizing that it will take a fully coordinated and multi-faceted approach to have an impact on current rates, we have developed a strategy through the Center for Childhood Obesity Prevention that brings together the collective expertise of multiple investigators, and multiple organizations in the state, to address the problem. This Administrative and Scientific Support Core is designed to provide the basic operational underpinning to support the research efforts of the Center. The goals are to establish and operate the center; implement a mentoring and career development plan to support rolling cohorts of promising junior investigators, and help them to achieve independent investigator status within two years of COBRE funding; and to expand and strengthen the infrastructure of the Center over five years by establishing and/or enhancing three cores; tracking data regarding junior investigator progress; recruitment and guidance of subsequent replacement junior investigators; the number and type of multi-investigator, interdisciplinary applications developed as a result of Center collaborations and mentoring activities; tracking of volume and usage of core facilities and services by Center investigators; and evaluation by the internal Executive Committee and the External Advisory Committee of all Center components. This Core will further support efforts to sustain the Center through the development of subsequent multi-disciplinary grant applications."
"9339541","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Background:  Atherosclerotic lesions underlie the leading cause of death among Veterans and in the developed world. Atheromas consist of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), inflammatory cells, lipid and extracellular matrix (ECM) underlying a dysfunctional endothelium. Thus far the overwhelming emphasis has been on studying the role of lipids and inflammation in atheroma pathogenesis, leaving important gaps in our understanding of the role of VSMCs. The goal of our laboratory is to gain better understanding of their role and key molecular regulators in order to identify new therapeutic targets to halt disease progression and plaque rupture. Using a genomic screen we identified that the small proline rich repeat protein 3 (SPRR3) is exclusively expressed in atherosclerotic lesions of humans and mice primarily in VSMCs. The SPRR family consists of over a dozen small cytoplasmic proteins first identified in stratified epithelia but more recently found in cardiomyocytes, skeletal and smooth muscle and cancer cells. As yet, their role in cell function is unclear. Objective/hypotheses:  To determine SPRR3's role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, we generated the SPRR3-deficient (KO) mouse in the atherogenic apoE-/- background. Preliminary data showed a dramatic increase in lesion size and numbers in SPRR3-/-/apoE-/- mice as compared to apoE-/- mice without increased macrophage density or circulating lipids. Importantly, this model showed advanced lesions with reduced VSMCs in the fibrous cap, intraluminal thrombi and downstream intramural myocardial infarcts, likely due to plaque instability. Primary VSMCs isolated from KO mice demonstrated increased apoptosis but reduced ECM synthesis and PI3K/Akt activation. We also found that SPRR co-immunoprecipitates with FAK. Together, our findings support the central hypothesis that SPRR3 is a unique and significant modulator of atheroma progression and plaque stability, which it does by enhancing Akt-dependent VSMC survival and ECM synthesis within the atheroma microenvironment. Specific aims/methods employed:  We will study our hypothesis with the following aims:  1) What is the cellular mechanism by which SPRR3 regulates atheroma progression? In this aim we will investigate whether SPRR3 loss drives disease progression by augmenting VSMC loss within lesions. 2) How does SPRR3 regulate VSMC cellular activity? In this aim, we will determine the cellular effects of SPRR3 and whether SPRR3 regulates these effects by interacting with FAK to modulate PI3K/Akt activation. Relevance to VA mission:  Atherosclerosis and its complications underlie the leading cause of death in our largest population of Veterans from the Vietnam and post-Vietnam time period. Our studies have identified a novel atheroprotective factor whose loss results in aggressive disease progression and clinical consequences of plaque rupture. Our studies will result in new insights and therapeutic approaches to this pervasive disease with exceedingly high morbidity and mortality."

"9393254","Receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) has been extensively characterized in vitro as the key initiator of necroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death1. However, the physiological role of necroptosis, and by extension of RIPK3, has remained elusive2. The goal of this proposal is to uncover novel functions for RIPK3 signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) and to define the unique nature of RIPK3 signaling in this tissue. In pursuit of this, we will assess the role of RIPK3 in mediating neuroprotective responses to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, as well as establish the nature of cell-specific transcriptional programs engaged by RIPK3 signaling in the CNS.  As opposed to canonical apoptosis, necroptosis is highly immunogenic and has been shown contribute to antiviral responses to diverse viruses3-5. However, emerging evidence also suggests that RIPK3 can induce inflammatory gene expression through signaling pathways that are independent of its canonical role in cell death6-9. Our recent study (in revision) identified a death-independent role for RIPK3 in coordinating protective neuroinflammation during WNV encephalitis. However, the unique features of this unexpected signaling program in the CNS have not yet been fully defined. Moreover, the potential for RIPK3 to promote protective responses to other neuroinvasive infections of global concern is unknown.  Since its recent introduction to the Western hemisphere, ZIKV infection has become a significant threat to public health10. Among the outcomes of ZIKV infection are severe birth abnormalities characterized by neuropathological damage during development followed by lifelong functional and cognitive impairments10,11. Though rare, symptomatic infections in adults can lead to chronic neuropathy and potentially fatal meningoencephalitis12. In the absence of any approved vaccines or disease-specific therapies, there is an urgent need to identify host factors that contribute to disease pathogenesis and protection during neuroinvasive ZIKV infection13.  In preliminary studies, we demonstrate that RIPK3 is a critical host factor in the restriction of ZIKV pathogenesis, as Ripk3-/- mice exhibit ascending motor impairments and increased viral burden in the spinal cord compared to WT controls. In in vitro studies, we observed a unique induction of inflammatory chemokine expression that was dependent on the kinase activities of both RIPK1 and RIPK3. However, this signaling appeared unique to neurons and did not occur in either peripheral or resident CNS myeloid cells, suggesting that RIPK3 engagement may have different functional outcomes in CNS cells of distinct developmental ontogenies. In these proposed studies, we will define cell- and lineage-specific functions for RIPK3 signaling in the CNS, and establish how these functions coordinate neuroprotective responses to ZIKV infection."
"9322366","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study (CKiD) is a multi-center, prospective cohort study of children aged 1 to 16 years with mild to moderately impaired kidney function at study entry. Two clinical coordinating centers (CCCs) (at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH) in Kansas City), a central laboratory (at the University of Rochester), and a data coordinating center (at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) have formed a cooperative agreement to conduct this prospective study of chronic kidney disease in children. Since its inception in 2003, the scientific aims of CKiD have been to determine the risk factors for decline in kidney function and the effects of kidney function decline on risk factors for cardiovascular disease; growth failure and its associated morbidity; and neurocognitive function and behavior. The purpose of this application is to request funds to continue the cohort study from August, 2013 to July, 2018. The aims of the current proposal are to assess and improve the accuracy and precision of the CKiD estimating formulas in youth with early CKD, to define the risk of kidney disease progression in children according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification of CKD according to Cause, GFR and level of albuminuria, to define risk factors for accelerated and non-linear decline in GFR among strata of children with glomerular compared to non-glomerular diagnoses and in African Americans, and to assess physical performance, arterial stiffness and myocardial structure and function as GFR declines. The Midwest Clinical Coordinating Center Principal Investigator has clinical expertise in kidney disease in children, clinical research design, recruitment and retention, quality control of study procedures, and organization of collaboration across the multiple participating sites in CKiD. The CKiD study encompasses a geographically and racially diverse cohort. The structure of CKiD and its support of ancillary studies continue to stimulate novel approaches to identify risk factors for kidney disease progression. The infrastructure of CKiD continues to serve as a platform for career development awards for junior investigators and ancillary R01's for more senior colleagues. With longer follow-up and additional recruitment of subjects with mild kidney dysfunction and glomerular disease, we will continue to characterize novel biomarkers of kidney injury that are associated with CKD progression and its sequellae to inform future therapeutic trials."
"9344390","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The objectives of this application are to determine the key environmental and genetic factors that lead to symptomatic recurrence among stone formers, as well as to validate asymptomatic stone formation and growth by CT scan as a surrogate for symptomatic recurrence. The central clinical hypothesis is that kidney stone recurrence can be predicted from clinical, laboratory, and radiographic measurements in the electronic health record (EHR). Our central mechanistic hypothesis is that genomic markers for kidney stones contribute to an increased risk of incident and recurrent stone events. In order to develop effective prevention strategies for kidney stone recurrence, we plan to objectively test our hypotheses with the following aims: Specific Aim #1: To develop a model to better predict symptomatic stone recurrence using clinical and laboratory information from the comprehensive (inpatient and outpatient) health records of 4680 chart validated symptomatic stone formers in the Olmsted County general population (1984 to 2016). Specific Aim #2: To determine if urine chemistries, blood serologies, and life-style factors can improve the prediction of symptomatic recurrence beyond the clinical and laboratory characteristics available in the EHR using 800 incident stone formers in our expanded prospective cohort (2009 to 2017). Specific Aim #3: To determine if models predicting symptomatic recurrence in Aims 1 or 2 also predict radiographic stone formation and growth among 300 incident stone formers in our current prospective cohort. Specific Aim #4: To sample stone formers from the general population to identify causative genes. A) Assemble a cohort of 1500 carefully validated and phenotyped incident kidney stone formers, plus 1500 controls for genetic analysis. Multiplex families will be a focus of this recruitment effort. B) Screen 400 validated incident symptomatic kidney stone formers for significant variants in 66 candidate genes for hypercalcuria, employing exon capture and next generation sequencing."
"9339545","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease associated with neurodegeneration of the CNS, is thought to result from an attack on myelin proteins by autoreactive T helper (Th) cells. Relapsing-remitting (RR) MS is characterized by acute attacks with periods of partial or full recovery between episodes. Current findings suggest that pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells predominate during relapse and that anti-inflammatory Th2 and T regulatory cells (Tregs) drive remission. Understanding the mechanisms of these shifts is crucial to developing therapies for MS. Previously, our data showed increased expression and activity of the calcium- activated protease calpain in brain, spinal cord, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of MS patients during relapse compared to remission. Calpain activates T cells and is involved in the production of Th1 cytokines, while its inhibition promotes upregulation of Th2 cytokines. Calpain also modulates the activity of signaling proteins associated with Th profiles (STATs, NFAT, NFkappaB). Our goal is to determine whether alterations in calpain activity during relapse and remission in MS patients are involved in Th1/Th2 dysregulation via alterations in transcription factors. Preliminary data found increased IL-17 levels in PBMCs isolated from the blood of RR-MS patients, and treating these cells with calpeptin reduced the number of Th17 cells in MBP-activated PBMCs, and inhibited the proliferation of MBP-specific T cells as well. Calpain inhibition also increased the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in MS PBMCs. Interestingly, STAT6, which specifically induces Th2 cytokine gene expression, was degraded in activated PBMCs from MS patients, and incubation with calpain inhibitor reversed the degradation, suggesting that calpain inhibition may promote a Th2 profile by reducing STAT6 degradation. Incubating primary neuron cultures with supernatant from activated PBMCs isolated from patients increased neuronal death, which was blocked by calpain inhibitor treatment. Based on these data, we hypothesize that calpain inhibition dysregulates Th cells via alterations of transcription factors and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in MS, and reduces production of inflammatory mediators released into the supernatant of Th1/Th17 cells that induce cell death. Three specific aims will be used to examine the hypothesis: (1) examine the effects of calpain inhibition on Th and Treg cytokine/chemokine profiles and alteration of MDSCs in MS patients; (2) determine the signaling mechanisms responsible for these shifts following calpain inhibition; and (3) identify which cytokines/chemokines secreted by activated Th cells are responsible for cell death or increase protection of neurons in vitro and examine the effects of calpain inhibition on the secretion of these factors. These studies are crucial to identfy the mechanisms by which calpain inhibitor therapy may potentially treat MS."

"9339550","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary: Chronic hepatocyte apoptosis and the activation of the quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSC) to extracellular matrix-producing myofibroblasts are central to the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Reactive oxidative stress (ROS)-mediated injury and activation of TNFalpha are major events in the progression of ALD, however the sources of ROS and how the signaling events are integrated culminating in active TNFalpha production are not well elucidated. To study these pathways, we have made several original observations: we have demonstrated that NOX4 induction results in a direct activation of the collagen I promoter in HSC, and in hepatocytes it plays a role in death ligand-induced apoptosis. NOX4 is upregulated in humans with ALD; and in the NOX4-/- mice steatosis, TACE activity, TNFalpha levels and lipid peroxidation were attenuated. Of particular importance for this proposal we created cell-specific NOX4-/- models. Thus our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that NOX4 is an important enzyme in alcoholic liver injury playing a role in the induction of the TNFalpha converting enzyme (TACE, or ADAM17) and thereby activating latent TNFalpha. We propose three SPECIFIC AIMS to address the key areas generated by the main hypothesis: Our first aim is to determine the pathways by which NOX4 induction results in an increase in TACE activity in hepatic stellate cells. a) We propose experiments to address the mechanism by which acetaldehyde; the metabolite of EtOH induces the NOX4 promoter. Identifying the key transcription factors controlling NOX4 during alcoholic injury will have a major impact. We will perform DNase footprint analysis and chromatin IP assays and promoter deletion mutants will be generated targeting the corresponding areas. b) We will interrogate the pathways of NOX4 induction leading to the activation of TACE by studying the downregulation of Sirtuin1 and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3), the natural inhibitor of TACE. We will test the hypothesis that the low TIMP3 activity results in TACE activation and ectodomain cleavage and activation of TNFalpha. Our second aim is to investigate the mechanism by which NOX4 can induce hepatocyte injury, either as a result of direct NOX4 induction in hepatocytes or by paracrine effects from active HSC. The experiments in this aim will address: a) the role of NOX4 in hepatocytes as a proapoptotic enzyme. We will test the hypothesis that the activation of NOX4 in hepatocytes results in the translocation of the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) to the nucleus resulting in the formation of a chromatin degrading complex. Alternatively, activation of the death ligand pathway by TNFalpha will result in lipid raft formation and the recruitment of NOX4 and ceramide formation. b) We will determine the role of NOX4/H2O2 in the HSC/hepatocyte crosstalk and reciprocal effects; using a novel micropatterned co-culture system with integrated biosensors. In the third aim we will study if NOX4-mediated oxidative stress is a key event during ALD in vivo. In mechanistic studies we will define the specific contribution of hepatocytes and HSC to alcoholic liver injury using hepatocyte or HSC NOX4-/- mice that we have recently generated. We will study the effects on both acute and chronic progressive alcoholic liver injury. This work is expected to highlight future avenues in developing effective treatment options. Thus complementing the above studies, we propose to use a novel orally available NOX4 inhibitor in the acute and chronic models of ALD."
"9280216","TR&D 4 Spatial Modeling: Modeling Framework for Cell Motility Project Summary Modeling and simulation of cell motility is an exciting new direction, which expands beyond biochemistry and electrophysiology to incorporate mechano-chemical processes and mechanical properties of cellular structures. This project extends VCell to develop an integrated modeling and data processing environment for cell shape changes driven by mechanical forces. It directly supports the numerical methods for cell kinematics and cell mechanics developed in TR&D2. Many of the capabilities we introduce will enhance all spatial modeling, including static geometries. In Aim 1 we develop a framework to create kinematic models of moving and/or deforming cells, using anatomical landmarks and local cell coordinates to describe subcellular localization of regions of interest and spatial functions. This aim creates the computational infrastructure for solution of reaction-diffusion-advection problems within changing geometries. Driving Biomedical Projects from the Haugh and Wu laboratory drive the need to create VCell BioModels of signaling pathways within migrating cells. In Aim 2 we will create a framework for describing mechano-chemical processes as components of VCell models, responding to the DBPs by Mogilner, Pollard and Inoue. The resulting forces will result in kinematics that are treated in Aim 1. The analysis of simulation results and the use of experimental data to constrain models and/or validate model predictions pose new challenges when cells move and change shape. Therefore, in Aim 3 we will build an integrated suite of tools for analyzing and comparing simulation results and experimental data in the context of cell motion; this will also be useful across all spatial modeling applications in VCell, including any optogenetic or dynamic fluorescence microscopy experiments."

"9274155","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments."

"9269794","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a fundamental gap in understanding how oxidative damage contributes to pathogenesis.  Thus, the long-term goal is to elucidate how the release/clearance dynamics of several reactive oxygen species and small molecules in the brain underlie neurodegenerative disease states involving oxidative stress.  Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a reactive oxygen species that also serves as an important signaling molecule in normal brain function.  Because H2O2 serves these distinct biological roles, H2O2 concentrations likely rise and fall in the extracellular space with precise spatial and temporal resolution, such that functional levels can be achieved for signaling while the pathological consequences resulting from unregulated generation are prevented.  However, studies aimed at elucidating these dynamics have been hindered by the lack of a method for probing dynamic H2O2 fluctuations in living systems with molecular specificity.  The goals of this research proposal are to enable the quantitative analysis of endogenous H2O2 fluctuations in real-time, and to elucidate how these molecular dynamics modulate those of dopamine (DA) in intact, functional brain tissue.  H2O2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.  Simultaneous H2O2 and DA measurements will enable regulatory kinetics and mechanisms to be unraveled, investigation of the alteration of these mechanisms by disease or pharmacological agents, and clarification of the neurochemical processes that underlie motor dysfunction.  Carbon-fiber microelectrodes will be employed with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, as this approach provides a quantitative view of neurotransmission in discrete brain locations in real-time.  The specific aims combine the development of new technology with innovative applications.  They are:  1.  To enable the precise characterization of H2O2 fluctuations in the extracellular space of specific brain nuclei, shedding light on its modulatory signaling role, extrasynaptic lifetime, sphere of influence, and diffusion profile under both normal and pathological conditions.  These experiments will also demonstrate the extent to which various sources of H2O2 contribute to signaling within select brain nuclei.  2.  To elucidate the precise physiological interaction between H2O2 and DA, and the role that these molecular dynamics play in the onset of motor complications associated with Parkinson's disease.  In order to achieve these aims, powerful mathematical models will be developed and validated that can be used to interpret the effects of pharmacological agents on the balance between H2O2 generation and clearance.  Existing analytical techniques will be modified to enable improved quantitative assessment in the face of chemical variability.  The proposed research is significant because the results are expected to vertically advance and expand our understanding of the physiological roles played by H2O2 in the brain, and to shed light on whether oxidative stress is an initiator of dopaminergic dysfunction, or a consequence of that process.  Ultimately, such knowledge will inform the development of improved therapeutic interventions, neuroprotective strategies, and promising antiparkinsonian drugs based on redox biology."
"9371044","Project Summary  Classic galactosemia (CG) is a potentially lethal genetic disease that results from profound loss of galactose-1P uridylyltransferase (GALT). While pre-symptomatic diagnosis by newborn screening and immediate dietary restriction of galactose prevent or minimize the acute and potentially lethal symptoms of disease in infants, a majority of affected children nonetheless grow to experience a constellation of debilitating cognitive, behavioral, motor, female reproductive, and other disabilities. The mechanisms that underlie these long-term complications remain unknown, hindering the development of more effective treatments. One of the major roadblocks limiting progress in the field has been the lack of a mammalian genetic model of CG that recapitulates patient outcomes. Specifically, while a GALT-null fruit fly demonstrates both acute and long-term complications reminiscent of CG, each of two mouse models created by other groups did not. Recently, we applied CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to create three mutant alleles of GALT in Sprague-Dawley rats. The single male founder from whom all three distinct alleles were derived was, by definition, mosaic, at least in his germ cells, but demonstrated bilateral cataracts reminiscent of untreated patients. Here we propose to characterize both the acute and long-term outcomes of homozygous GALT deficient rats reared in the presence versus absence of dietary galactose. The results of these studies will establish the first mammalian model of GALT deficiency that recapitulates relevant phenotypes of classic galactosemia, setting the stage for future studies to define the timing and mechanisms of disease, and an amenable model for testing novel candidate interventions."
"9355634","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing number of studies show that the quality and safety of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be significantly improved with careful selection and arrangement of materials having a high electric permittivity, or High Permittivity Materials (HPMs) in the space around the radiofrequency (RF) coil and the human subject. With strategic use, these materials act to convert otherwise useless electric field energy in the space surrounding the RF coil and patient into useful magnetic field energy through the effects of displacement currents. These displacement currents are more distributed sources of magnetic fields than are the conductive currents in the discrete wires alone, and can be closer to the subject than the discrete wires improving the sensitivity without compromising safety. The net result is higher SNR (by about 40% in many experiments and simulations) in reception and significantly less RF energy absorbed by the subject in transmission. Given the SNR-limited nature of MRI, the multiple significant costs of going to ever-higher field strengths (including finding superconductive alternatives to NbTi), and the fact that HPMs can be used in all existing scanners for an immediate boost in SNR, pursuing this work is critical to the advancement of MRI on existing and future systems.  We propose to develop thin, solid HPMs that will fit within the space that is currently occupied by the plastic coil formers in state-of-the-art clinical coils and integrate them into new coil designs. Thus, the final result will be no larger than existing clinical coils and the conducting coils will be no further from the subject. Preliminary simulation and experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Numerical simulations considering both SNR and patient heating (SAR) will guide the design of the materials both in terms of desired properties and shape. Otherwise equivalent RF head coils with and without the incorporation of HPMs will be constructed for use on 7T research and 3T clinical systems. The performance of coils with and without HPMs will be compared in a number of clinically relevant protocols at both field strengths. Performance will also be compared to existing state-of-the-art clinical coils. We expect significant gains in SNR and reduction in SAR at both field strengths. Successful completion of this research will overcome numerous obstacles to practical, routine use of HPMs and make significant (~40%) gains in SNR possible on both future and existing MRI systems."
"9517370","ABSTRACT The number of obese individuals worldwide has reached epidemic proportions and is a major global health concern. Excessive adipose tissue stores predispose individuals to developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, fatty liver disease, dementia, obstructive sleep apnea and many types of cancer. Adipose tissue acts as the master regulator of lipid storage, and through secretion of adipokines, influences many systemic processes, including energy metabolism, inflammation, and pathophysiological changes associated with disease. A more thorough understanding of the pathways that regulate triglyceride synthesis and storage is necessary for the development of new effective therapeutic treatments of obesity. There are two independent, but convergent pathways for triglyceride biosynthesis. The glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway or Kennedy pathway is considered the predominant pathway in most cell types. The alternative pathway for triglyceride biosynthesis, known as monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) pathway has been most extensively characterized in intestinal enterocytes where it is involved in dietary fat absorption. This application is designed to test the novel and innovative hypotheses that the MGAT pathway of triglyceride synthesis is important for controlling lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and that perturbations in this pathway affect adipose tissue triglyceride synthesis and metabolism. We have postulated that MGAT activity facilitates incorporation of lipid into its preferred and inert storage form in adipocytes and prevents free fatty acids from entering circulation. The studies proposed herein are designed to: [1] define the role that MGAT activity plays in adipocyte triglyceride metabolism, [2] to examine the role of adipose tissue MGAT1 in states associated with increased lipolysis, and [3] to test the role MGAT1 in regulating adipocyte and whole body lipid metabolism by an in vivo loss-of-function approach. The results of these studies will not only have implications for our understanding of the biology of MGAT proteins, but will also provide new insight into the basic molecular regulation of monoacylglycerol and FFA metabolism in adipose tissue. More importantly, modulation of MGAT1 expression and activity in adipose tissue may represent a novel and effective treatment of obesity."

A variety of neuroinflammatory disorders are common in Uganda, but these disorders are poorly understood. There are only a handful of trained neurologists in Uganda and very few researchers focusing on understanding neurological disorders. Thus, there is a major gap in expertise in this area, and I wish to develop my career to fill this gap through this K43 program by gaining expertise that I can apply to investigating the epidemiology and pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory conditions in Uganda. This K43Award will provide me the support necessary to complete the following goals: 1.

To understand the epidemiology of neurological conditions and design interventions for  improving care among neurology patients, I will need additional training and experience related to  epidemiology and biostatistics and in design and execution of clinical trials. 2. Neuroinflammation and infections of the central nervous system. To understand the etiology and  pathogenesis of neuroinflammation, I will need additional training and experience related to neurological  clinical assessments, infections of the central nervous system and neuroinflammation. 3. Translational and implementation research  In my future career, I aim to bridge basic science research to clinical application and back. This training  and experience will help me to translate findings from bench to bedside and back as I develop new projects  as my career develops. I would also be interested in learning how to translate evidence based interventions  to practice and policy. I have assembled a team of mentors comprising of the following: primary research mentors-Drs.Boulware (epidemiology and biostatics, infectious diseases) and Dr. Meya (immunology, infectious diseases), and Dr. Bohjanen (microbiology and immunology, infectious diseases) ,Dr. Meyer (neurology, epidemiology of neurological conditions) Prof. Katabira (neurology in HIV infection) and Dr Andrew Kambugu (infectious diseases, clinical research).

"9529044","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past 10 years we have focused on addressing two interrelated public health issues, alcohol use disorder (AUD) and suicide in 12-18 year old Yup'ik Alaska Natives (AN). AUD and suicide are among the leading causes of mortality among AN people and a significant health disparity in contrast to the U.S. general population (1). AN mortality rates from all alcohol-induced disorders between 2001 2005 were 53.8/100,000 in contrast to 6.3/100,000 for other ethnic groups in Alaska (2), while the age-adjusted rate for suicide is twice the national average (3). Overall, between 1960-95 AN suicide rates increased approximately 500% (4). More recent data indicate continuation of these trends and also identify cluster suicide behavior as a feature of AN youth suicide (5). Yup'ik community leaders have made addressing AUD and suicide among their highest priorities. In response, working with several communities, a community-based and led intervention (Qungasvik - toolbox) was designed. The intervention is designed to develop protective factors that will ultimately reduce the incidence of AUD and suicide. Our research leading up to the currently proposed study has shown that it is possible to: (1) deliver the intervention in remote rural communities; (2) obtain valid and reliable measures of two ultimate outcomes (i.e., Reflective Processes regarding alcohol consequences and Reasons for Life) and intermediate protective factors variables that underlie them; (3) show a dose-response effect: the more intervention sessions a person attends (dose) the stronger the measured protective factors (response); and (4) obtain a maximum protective effect from the intervention by lengthening the duration of the intervention from one to two years. The proposed study is an assessment of a modified version of the intervention and focuses on three specific aims (SA): (SA1) test Qungasvik intervention efficacy through impact on the two protective factors and to link those measures to direct measures of alcohol use and suicidal ideation; (SA2) examine the mechanisms of change in response to the intervention through growth in: (a) intermediate outcome measures of protective factors at the individual, family, peer, and community level; (b) social network characteristics of supportive relationships with elders, immediate and extended kinship relations, and community adults and describe social network change; and (c) using qualitative interviewing and grounded theory analysis techniques, describe process and impact of the intervention from community elder and parent perspectives; and (SA3) examine the fidelity of implementing the intervention."

"9337547","Project Summary / Abstract Research Misconduct, defined as deliberate fabrication, falsification and plagiarism in proposing, performing, reporting and or reviewing research, is a significant but insidious threat to the research enterprise globally. The overall goal of our project is to increase the capacity of Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital / Moi University Institutional Research and Ethics Committee (MTRH/MU IREC) to prevent, detect and manage research misconduct in Moi University College of Health Sciences, Kenya by developing and implementing a scalable modular institutional framework for preventing, detecting and managing research misconduct. To achieve this goal, we will engage HIV researchers, the research ethics committee (REC) leadership and national research regulatory bodies to estimate the prevalence of research misconduct in recent HIV research and document perceptions on occurrence of the research misconduct (AIM1); document perceptions on the current capacity to prevent, detect and manage research and the characteristics of a model institutional framework to manage research misconduct (AIM 2) and identify and document international best practices through broad literature review and benchmarking visits to United States and sub-Saharan Africa institutions where such capacity exists and is functional (Aim 3-sub-AIM3a). Utilizing the body of knowledge gathered through AIM1, 2 & 3-sub-AIM3a, we shall hold a 2-day national workshop, involving local research stakeholders and international bioethics experts, to adapt the international best practices to the local setting and formulate a scalable modular institutional framework for prevention, detection and management of RM in Kenya (AIM3- Sub-AIM3b).

"9537765","Abstract The generation of novel transgenic rat models has greatly accelerated with the advent of nuclease-based genome-editing technologies such as ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. With that in mind, there is a need for reliable methods of sperm cryopreservation using rat sperm, to ensure the future availability of these models. Existing methods are technically challenging, limiting their use by many research laboratories. Preliminary data demonstrate that supplementation of sperm freezing extender with the antioxidant monothioglycerol or the nonionic compound iodixanol enhances post-thaw motility. Proposed studies in Aim 1 will determine the effects of such supplementation on post-thaw motility, acrosomal and membrane integrity in sperm from multiple rat strains. Additionally, the effect of supplementation on fertility using cryopreserved sperm will be assessed using artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization. The data generated in this aim will serve to optimize rat sperm cryopreservation, thus enhancing the resources provided by the RRRC and the use of rat models in general in biomedical research. There is also increasing recognition that the gut microbiota (GM) plays a vital role in host physiology, metabolism, disease susceptibility, and behavior. As such, differences in the composition of the GM due to any number of factors may affect study reproducibility. Preliminary data show that the GM differs substantially between different genetic backgrounds of mice, even when purchased from the same commercial source. Of note, those differences are associated with differences in the phenotype of a well-characterized rat model of colorectal cancer. The studies proposed in Aim 2 will determine the influence of several common variables associated with animal husbandry, as well as genetic background and commercial source of animal, on the composition of the GM. Additional studies will examine the efficacy of various means of manipulating the GM toward a desired composition. Such studies hold the potential to greatly refine many rat models and are expected to generate broadly applicable data."
"9538346","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long career goal is to become an independent clinical research scientist and a leader in developing novel therapies for myotonic dystrophy. To continue my progress towards this goal, I propose to explore approaches to correct the mutant gene in Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. I have been trained in conducting scientific research in my MD, PhD student training and postdoctoral studies. I believe the K08 mentored career development award will greatly facilitate me to become an independent research scientist. I have developed a career development plan with my mentor. I have assembled a strong mentor committee. University of Florida, McKnight Brain Institute, Department of Neuroscience and Neurology, Center for Cellular Reprogramming and Center for NeuroGenetics provide an excellent environment for me to pursue the long term goal. My short-term goal is to use DM1 iPS cells as a platform to test our hypothesis that mutant gene in DM1 iPS cells can be efficiently corrected using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. I have developed a research project for this goal. DM1 is caused by CTG nucleotide repeat expansion within the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase gene 3'-untranslated region on chromosome 19. The expanded repeats encode toxic CUG RNA repeats, which sequester splicing factors and form intranuclear RNA foci, leading to aberrant gene splicing and subsequent clinical manifestations. Regenerative medicine holds hope for treatment of advanced myotonic dystrophy. Patient-specific iPS cells are making this realistic. However, patient-specific iPS cells still retain the pathogenic mutation and may undergo the same degenerative process after transplantation. To utilize these cells, the mutated gene needs to be corrected before transplantation. We have designed two approaches in correcting the mutant gene using TALEN technology and homologous recombination (HR): 1) targeted interruption of transcription of the expanded repeats. A sequence interrupting transcription will be inserted between the stop codon and expanded repeats through HR. 2) targeted deletion of the expanded repeats. LoxP sites will be inserted before and after the expanded repeat using HR. The expanded repeats flanked by LoxP sites will then be deleted following transient expression of Cre-recombinase. We will further evaluate in vitro and in vivo pluripotency of genome- corrected DM1 iPS cells by embryoid body-mediated differentiation and teratoma formation. We will evaluate RNA foci and downstream splicing events to confirm the successful correction of molecular phenotypes. We expect this study will provide proof of principle data that TALEN technology can be used to correct dominantly inherited mutant genes. This will overcome one of the hurdles in the development of autologous cell replacement therapy. The implementation of the proposed project and training under K08 mechanism will well- prepare me to compete successfully for R01 funding to become an independent clinical research scientist."
"9360220","Short tandem repeats, also known as microsatellites, are relatively unstable DNA elements comprised of repeating subunits typically ranging from 2-6 bp in length. Large pathogenic expansions in short tandem repeats (hundreds to thousands of nucleotides) have been implicated in over 40 genetic disorders to date, which are collectively known as repeat expansion diseases. Although repeat expansion diseases represent a diverse group of genetic disorders, they typically involve the nervous system and are marked by neurological, neurodegenerative, neuromuscular, and/or developmental abnormalities. Current approaches for discovering the genetic basis of repeat expansion disorders are challenging in multiple respects and are often limiting to their study: they rely on the availability of large families with multiple affected individuals, and employ low-throughput and laborious molecular biology methods. Genetic investigations for many diseases have now shifted over to using ?next-generation? sequencing methods which are capable of examining variants on a genome-wide scale. However, because next-generation sequencing reads are typically quite short (100-250 nucleotides) compared to the length of expanded repeat tracts (several hundred to several thousand nucleotides), there are technical barriers to identifying and accurately typing expanded tandem repeats using this approach. Here we propose a novel, next-generation sequencing approach which will enable expanded short tandem repeats to be effectively enriched and typed using short next-generation sequencing reads. In our approach, artificial genetic diversity is introduced into monotonous repeat sequences through the incorporation of synthetic hybridization probes containing unique, random DNA tags (unique molecular identifiers). After hybridization of these probes to target DNA, covalent linkage, and PCR amplification of converted repeat tract DNA, standard protocols for DNA fragmentation and next-generation sequencing library preparation are applied. Repeat tracts, now containing integrated molecular tags, are then subjected to massively parallel sequencing. During analysis, reads spanning across adjacent molecular tags are computationally assembled together into a larger contiguous sequence, enabling reconstruction of the converted tract on the basis of these synthetic, high diversity regions. After computational removal of the molecular tags, the composition of the original tract can be accurately resolved. In our first Aim, we will develop and optimize this technology to enable accurate sizing of expanded repeats across several representative repeat expansion diseases involving tracts of different lengths and composition. In our second Aim, we will adapt our methods in order to develop a multiplexed panel of probes targeting all short tandem repeats in the human genome, enabling inexpensive, high-throughput, whole genome screening for both known and previously unknown expanded repeat diseases. The availability of robust, cost-effective, quantitative, and generally applicable tools for the detection and characterization of expanded repeat disorders will provide enhanced, transformative capabilities in the diagnosis and genetic investigation of these disorders. Consequently, these methods will greatly facilitate genetic discovery and study of repeat expansion diseases, and will have application to typing other repetitive elements in the genome, including centromeres and telomeres. "
"9532418","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrheal disease that disproportionately affects children and immunocompromised adults. The WHO estimates that in 2010, diarrheal disease accounted for 10.5% of deaths in children under the age of five, with the majority of childhood deaths occurring in Africa and Southeast Asia. In developing countries, malnutrition exacerbates diarrheal episodes and prolongs infection. These prolonged childhood infections are known to cause destructive, permanent effects, such as stunted growth, developmental delay, and cognitive deficiency. Of the known diarrheal diseases, cryptosporidiosis appears to one of the most deadly.  Tryptophan synthesis enables intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Chlamydia trachomatis to evade a key mechanism of host innate immunity, IFN-? induced tryptophan catabolism. Through horizontal gene transfer, Cryptosporidium has acquired a bacterial tryptophan synthase gene, tryptophan synthase beta (CpTrpB), and we believe that this gene acquisition was a crucial step to adaptation to the mammalian intestine. We will evaluate the role of CpTrpB in Cryptosporidium metabolism, growth, and survival during host tryptophan catabolism.  In this project we propose to 1) define the metabolic activity of CpTrpB during host tryptophan catabolism, both in vitro and in vivo, and 2) determine the impact of CpTrpB gene loss on Cryptosporidium parvum through genetic analysis. The unique tryptophan metabolism in Cryptosporidium is an attractive target for drug development and pathogen attenuation, and studying CpTrpB offers the opportunity to explore the biology of a novel parasite pathogenesis factor."

"9334265","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diagnosis and treatment of many genetic diseases is hindered by variation in disease symptoms. The reasons for this variation are often unknown because systematic studies have not been undertaken. The goal of this Program Project is to elucidate mechanisms underlying normal phenotypic resilience and the instability that occurs when such mechanisms are lost in the disease state. We hypothesize that variation can result from failure of mechanisms that normally buffer against noise in developmental processes, for example stochastic variation in gene activities and cellular read-outs, and thus assure phenotypic stability in healthy children. We test this hypothesis in three Projects (Projects), using the zebrafish, a premiere model organism pioneered by this group at the University of Oregon. The projects take advantage of attributes of the zebrafish for developmental genetics analyses, including exquisite time-lapse microscopy of transgenically labeled fish to follow developmental events and perturbations in real time, assays of macromolecular complex formation, genome-wide analyses of cell signaling events, and assessment of environmental interactions that modulate host gene expression. These studies will elucidate the nature of events leading to variability in disease symptoms. Project1 focuses on variation In Fraser syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by craniofacial and pharyngeal epithelial disruptions that show a remarkable degree of variation, both among affected individuals and on the left and right sides of the same individual. Proposed studies will explore how failure of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions results in differences in craniofacial skeletal development and will reveal genes responsible for the stability and resilience seen under normal conditions. Project2 tests a novel hypothesis for phenotypic variation with Usher syndrome, the most prevalent cause of hereditary deaf-blindness, hypothesizing that it results from disruption of complexes of Usher proteins that cause cellular stress that leads to stochastic cell death. Project3 investigates phenotypic variation associated with Hirschsprung disease, the leading cause of intestinal aganglionosis, exploring the hypothesis that the enteric nervous system regulates composition of intestinal bacterial communities and that altered communities contribute to disease progression by promoting inflammation and amplifying intestinal motility defects. Together with support of four Core Units, this Program Project will provide novel insights into three specific diseases and develop a new understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease variability that will promote better disease diagnosis and treatment."
"9331341","Project Summary/Abstract An important aspect to this annual meeting is the planning committee comprised of representatives from the regulatory community and academic partners. The planning meeting is typically held in January. At the planning stage, topics are discussed and chosen based on relevance to seafood safety, water quality, seafood HACCP, etc. Lately the important issue of reducing the risk of Vibrio in oysters, a naturally occurring pathogen, has been one of the most common concerns. Topics for this issue are clinical, environmental, and at times very technical. Laboratory methods are also an import topic of concern. Input is gathered from all representatives and FDA's participation plays an important role in the planning stages.  The host state is responsible selecting a meeting site, announcing dates and location, registration, any agreements with the hotel for meeting spaces, and for finalizing the agenda topics and securing the speakers for the meeting. This responsibility rotates between the participating states (Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware).  The Interstate Seafood Seminar brings together regulators, public health professionals, researchers and industry in an informal setting. Seafood safety such as using best management practices and Seafood HACCP is everyone's responsibility. Seafood safety is very important in preventing food borne illnesses and providing cost savings to consumers. This annual meeting provides an unprecedented opportunity for participants to network with other regulators, both federal and state, in a cooperative and informative setting. The opportunity for researchers to present and discuss their latest findings with regulators lays the framework to assess needs and how the research can be utilized in a regulatory or industrial setting while serving to improve seafood safety. This venue promotes informal discussion and since it is regional in nature provides an opportunity for many participants that may not get an opportunity to participate in larger, formal national meetings. Attendees include regional State and local regulators, federal partners (FDA, EPA, NOAA), industry, and academics. The purpose of this application is to facilitate participation from State partners whose attendance might otherwise be denied due to budget constraints."
"9323524","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Poor women and women of color face reproductive health disparities, including higher rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion. Literature demonstrates that continuous care with a dedicated health care provider leads to improved health-seeking behaviors and better outcomes, including better use of preventive care, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer emergency room visits. Recent healthcare reform aims to increase access to continuous medical care to reduce health disparities and healthcare cost. Women presenting for abortion are disproportionately from medically underserved populations, including women of color and low- income women. The proposed research uses the abortion visit as an opportunity to engage women who may lack continuous medical care. A replicable, theory-based lay health worker (LHW) intervention will be developed to support post-abortion uptake and continuous use of contraception and health care. LHWs are individuals from a local community who serve as a bridge between community members and health care providers and systems. LHWs use flexible problem solving and coaching to help individuals improve health outcomes. The LHW intervention proposed in this study will be informed by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), which posits that one's ability to exert behavioral control, or self-efficacy, is central to behavior change and moderates individuals' responses to factors that facilitate or impede health behavior. This study will develop and test a SCT-based LHW intervention that uses social support through a brief, in-clinic counseling session and follow-up phone calls to help women build skills to improve contraceptive and reproductive health care use. Interviews will be conducted with 15-20 women presenting for pregnancy termination who do not engage in health care outside of the abortion visit. Interview responses about contraception and reproductive health care use will be used to develop the content and training materials for the LHW intervention. Pre/post testing will determine feasibility and collect preliminary outcome data. We hypothesize that participants will experience improved levels of contraceptive and reproductive health care self-efficacy. This work has the potential to serve as a model for engaging other populations who have poor access to care, such as those who rely on emergency care. Therefore, development, implementation, and evaluation of an effective intervention to integrate populations into routine care have important public health and policy implications."
"9252982","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Phenotypic heterogeneity in small cell lung cancer. Abstract. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) constitutes a group of malignancies responsible for the about 24,000 cancer deaths every year in the United States. Little progress has been made in decreasing SCLC mortality. Gene expression and mutation profiling efforts to identify driver mutations, gene amplifications, or signatures with clinical utility in SCLC have been limited and thus far been unfruitful. Our preliminary data point towards the existence of subclasses of SCLCs and new therapeutic targets. Based on these preliminary data we hypothesize that discovering the temporality, frequency and nature of primary and secondary mutations associated with tumor progression, the characterization of a small number of subpopulations and their responses to drugs will lead to significant improvements in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of lung cancer. We propose to validate the two distinct phenotypes- neuroendocrine and mesenchymal- of SCLC within primary tumors. We will investigate the heterogeneity of the tumors based on fresh specimens by single cell mass Cytometry as it relates to their behavior. Our single cell analysis will inform us on the clonality of the lesions and intra-tumor heterogeneity. We will determine the temporality of events in tumorigenesis of SCLC in primary tumors and in tumors resisting chemotherapy. Whole genome sequencing and RNAseq analyses will be performed on these samples to assay tumor heterogeneity and compare before and after treatment as well as to identify changes specific to exceptional responders. Finally, we will interrogate in patient derive xenografts tumor heterogeneity in SCLCs who relapse after chemotherapy to discover new pathway activation and test new strategies for intervention including SYK and EPHA2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The ultimate goal of this translational research is to develop personalized management for patients presenting with SCLC. Phenotypic heterogeneity among cancer cells, observed even within single tumors, presents enormous challenges for developing optimal targeted treatment plans. We hope to uncover SCLC heterogeneity and its implications for chemotherapy. We hope to identify driver mutations and mutations that are uniquely associated with tumor progression, including therapy induced mutations. This will better inform the design of clinical trials and assist clinicians in tailoring treatment in individual patients."
"9327393","7. Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this application is to elucidate the function of transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2), a protein of unknown function associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This goal is highly congruent with the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), which supports ongoing efforts to elucidate the pathogenesis of NAFLD with a view to early detection, intervention, and prevention of chronic progressive liver disease. To identify genes that contribute to NAFLD, the Hobbs/Cohen laboratory performed an exome-wide association study for liver fat content. This screen revealed that a common variant (E167K) in TM6SF2 was associated with increased hepatic fat content and leads to progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis. The project proposed here will take advantage of the trainee?s expertise in lipid mass spectrometry to identify unique changes in lipid biochemistry in Tm6sf2 knockout mice. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Determine effects of TM6SF2 inactivation on hepatic and circulating lipid composition in mice. Aim 2: Establish a cell-based assay to determine the biochemical function of TM6SF2. The project will provide the basis of a multi-faceted research training program that will expand the trainee?s current knowledge of lipid biochemistry in the context of NAFLD, and provide additional training in protein-lipid biochemistry and human molecular genetics. In addition to laboratory training, the program will broaden the trainee?s knowledge of liver disease and pharmacological treatment strategies through course work, laboratory meetings and journal clubs, departmental/university lectures, and national conferences. By combining her analytical expertise in lipid mass spectrometry with biochemistry/molecular biology skills and biomedical perspective, this program will leave the trainee well-positioned to pursue a career in the biomedical sciences."
"9338229","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the normal kidney, an enormous volume of blood (180 L) is filtered each day through the glomerular filtration barrier. By even the most conservative estimates, between 1 - 3 g of albumin a day make it through the filtration barrier. Podocytes are a key part of the GFB and the molecular basis of protein trafficking in podocytes is unknown. In preliminary studies, we have found that podocytes actively transcytose two major serum proteins, albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG), and that transcytosis is the major pathway for handling these proteins. We have also found that trafficking of IgG is more complicated than that of albumin and that podocytes direct trafficking of IgG differently depending on whether IgG is coupled to antigen. In other cell types such as renal tubular cells and endothelial cells, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is required for transcytosis of albumin and IgG. In dendritic cells, FcRn is required for antigen/IgG (immune complex) trafficking to the lysosome for antigen presentation on MHC Class II. Based on our preliminary studies and the known role of FcRn in other cell types we propose a dual role for FcRn in podocytes. Specifically, we hypothesize that (1) FcRn is required for transcytosis of albumin and IgG through the podocyte and (2) FcRn is required for immune complex presentation in podocytes by directing antigen/IgG complexes to the lysosome for processing and presentation in podocyte MHC II. In this proposal, we will use primary podocytes isolated from wild type and FcRn knockout mice to determine whether FcRn is required for transcytosis of albumin and IgG. We will also determine whether the glomerular sieving coefficient for albumin and IgG is significantly less in wild type versus FcRn knockout mice and whether podocyte-specific knockout of FcRn in vivo leads to protein accumulation within the glomerulus and glomerulosclerosis. We will examine whether FcRn is required to direct antigen/IgG complexes to the lysosome for degradation and antigen presentation on podocyte MHC Class II and determine whether lack of FcRn abrogates antigen/IgG presentation in podocytes. Finally, we will determine whether podocyte-specific knockout of FcRn ameliorates disease in a mouse model of immune-mediated nephritis. We will also use intravital multiphoton microscopy, a dynamic advanced imaging technique, to examine whether podocyte-specific knockout of FcRn reduces T retention times within the glomerulus after induction of immune-mediated nephritis. The work outlined in this proposal is significant because it is the initial step in understanding exactly how serum proteins are trafficked through the podocyte. Protein accumulation in podocytes has been shown to be toxic to podocytes and correlates with podocyte loss and glomerulosclerosis. Knowledge at the molecular level of how proteins are handled by the podocyte will form the basis for the design of rational therapies to prevent protein accumulation in podocytes. An understanding of the dual role of FcRn in podocytes (both in transcytosis and antigen presentation) is also critical to the design of safe and effective therapies to treat immune-mediated glomerular diseases."
"9547079","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twenty million Americans suffer from peripheral nerve injury that leads to significant changes in cortical and subcortical neuronal activity. Evidence from human imaging studies suggests that the degree of post- injury plasticity and cortical remapping may be maladaptive and positively correlated to the levels of sensory dysfunctions and phantom limb pain. In an animal model of peripheral nerve injury we demonstrated that post-injury increases in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses reflect in fact, increases in inhibitory interneurons activity. Thus, we hypothesize that post-injury increase in inhibitory interneurons activity delays neurorehabilitation. However, the majority of current neurorehabilitation strategies focus on surgical nerve repair which neglect to address the dramatic changes occurring in the brain level. Indeed, studies show that patients continue to suffer from sensory dysfunctions despite nerve repair surgeries. We have recently demonstrated that limb injury in adult rats induces short- and long-term plasticity changes that affect S1 activity; an effect that can be readily mapped with non-invasive, ultra-high field, and high-resolution fMRI. The plasticity was manifested in changes in the excitability of cortical laye 5 inhibitory interneurons in the affected primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and was mediated via the transcallosal projections. We used optogenetics methods to modulate cortical activity in the injured rats and successfully restored the balance between excitation and inhibition. Therefore, post-injury neuronal changes leading to a shift in the excitation-inhibition balance have the potential to be reshaped with neuromodulation strategies. The goal of this proposal is to develop state-of-the-art neuromodulation strategies to augment recovery including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and a novel, minimally-invasive, neuronal-specific technology. Utilizing multimodal technical approaches we will determine how injury affects plasticity mechanisms in the molecular, cellular, network and behavioral levels, and whether the neuromodulation strategies employed here can minimize sensory dysfunctions associated with injury and facilitate rehabilitation. We anticipate that these strategies could be translated into he clinical setting as alternatives or adjuvants to traditional surgical nerve repairs, and also be usd to modulate neuronal function in other neurological disorders."
"9536361","The Adipose Tissue and Lipid Biology Core (ATLB) is a new Core that has been developed to replace the Human Studies Core in response to the changing needs of the Research Base. In particular, there is a growing body of researchers studying the role of adipose tissue as a mediator of deleterious effects of obesity and high dietary cholesterol intake on lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity and atherosclerosis. Many of these investigators are using murine adipose depots as well as murine adipocytes in culture, and are studying the pathogenesis of both adipose tissue inflammation and atherosclerosis in a variety of mouse models. Therefore, this Core was developed so as to provide these researchers with a variety of services. These include high quality and standardized adipocytes for in vitro experiments, along with a standardized approach to the measurement of plasma lipoproteins by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), developed in collaboration with the Analytic Core. Moreover, since a large number of investigators are assessing atherosclerosis in a variety of mouse models, a decision was made to standardize the quantification and evaluation of the characteristics of atherosclerotic lesions in mice. This approach is well validated and (a) allows better comparison of results between various research groups, (b) provides a cost-effective way of assessing atherosclerosis in various mouse models, (c) reduces the necessity for duplication of equipment and reagents, and (d) provides a high quality service to Affiliate Investigators (Als) who have not previously been able to assess mouse atherosclerosis in their own laboratories. To this end, we have established a Mouse Atherosclerosis Subcore of the ATLB to serve these needs. This Subcore was first established in 2006 as part of the Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC) at the University of Washington (UW). Although the MMPC has recently closed, this Subcore was itself highly successful and productive. In view of the needs of NORC investigators in this area, we are fortunate to be able to move this Subcore to the NORC."
"9368353","Project Summary  During aging, impaired hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) maintenance induced by clonal DNA mutations as well as niche-driven RNA processing deregulation can set the stage for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) initiation. In seminal murine studies, adenosine deaminase associated with RNA1-editase (ADAR1) activity was shown to play a vital role in both fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cell maintenance. Recently, increased adenosine deaminase associated with RNA1 (ADAR1)-mediated A-to-I editing was shown by our group and other research teams to contribute to therapeutic resistance in a broad array of malignancies. Also, we discovered that lentivirally enforced ADAR1 expression in HSPC enhanced myeloid differentiation commensurate with upregulation of PU.1 and reduced dormancy. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis demonstrated that inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways and RNA editing increased during normal aged HSPC evolution to MDS. Thus, we hypothesized that niche dependent activation of RNA editing by ADAR1 provides a competitive advantage for MDS over normal HSPCs. The majority of ADAR1 mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing events in humans occur within double- stranded RNA (dsRNA) loops created by primate-specific Alu sequences, which comprise 10 percent of the human genome, thereby underscoring that important ADAR1 functional differences exist between human HSPCs compared with their murine counterparts. However, the limited research effort aimed at deciphering the role of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in HSPC maintenance has been performed primarily in mouse models rather than highly purified human HSPCs. Because ADAR1 is activated by inflammatory cytokines that accelerate aging and MDS initiation, our main goal is to define the niche- dependent role of RNA editing on human HSPC cell fate and cell cycle regulation during aging and MDS initiation. We will first determine the RNA editing profile by whole transcriptome and single cell RNA-seq, RESSqPCR and lentiviral RNA editing reporters. The functional role of ADAR1 in HSPC aging and MDS initiation will be examined in stromal co-cultures with or without addition of inflammatory cytokines, FUCCI2BL cell cycle reporters, and humanized aged HSC and MDS immunocompromised mouse models. The proposed study is uniquely responsive to PAS-13-033: Stimulating Hematology Investigation: New Endeavors (SHINE) because it will identify the role of ADAR1-mediated regulatory mRNA and miRNA editing in HSPC myeloid lineage commitment and cell cycle deregulation during age-dependent MDS initiation in the inflammatory bone marrow niche. The ultimate goal of this study is to determine the biological, diagnostic and prognostic significance of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in HSPC aging compared with MDS initiation."
"9412393","SUMMARY An effective vaccination strategy is urgently needed to combat the global scourge of tuberculosis (TB). Due to the known importance of CD4 T cells and IFN? in immunity against TB, current vaccine efforts are focused on boosting bulk IFN?-producing CD4 T cell numbers (i.e., Th1 cells). These efforts, however, have been only moderately successful in conferring protection against TB in animal models, and a recent human efficacy trial of a novel candidate vaccine failed to confer measurable protection despite significantly boosting a Th1 response. Thus, there is growing concern that TB vaccines that target Th1 cells may not be adequately effective. We, and others, have recently discovered that adoptive transfer of fully differentiated Th1 cells, expressing high levels of the Th1-promoting transcription factor T-bet, provide little or no protection against murine TB, at least in part because they localize poorly to the lung parenchyma, the primary site of infection. In contrast, less-differentiated CD4 T cells, expressing intermediate levels of T-bet and sharing properties with Tfh and central memory T cells, readily home to the M. tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected lung parenchyma and mediate superior protection. Importantly, however, we have also recently shown that Mtb infection itself drives Th1 cells toward terminal differentiation and a non-protective state. This complicates vaccine approaches in regions of the world in which TB is endemic because most individuals who would benefit from immunization have already been exposed to Mtb or are persistently infected. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms that enable protective CD4 T cell populations to enter and be maintained within the lung parenchyma and to evaluate the influence of pre-existing Mtb infection on these parameters during vaccination in both animal models and human clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will determine the factors that govern the localization of CD4 T cells into the parenchyma, with the prime hypothesis that T cell KLRG1 binds N-cadherin on vascular endothelial cells, thus preventing entry. In addition, the role of key cytokines and glycolipid interactions in granuloma-associated high endothelial venules will also be explored. In Aim 2, we will assess whether vaccine-dependent CD103 expression serves to retain protective CD4 T cells within the parenchyma, and if so, whether this is beneficial or detrimental to immunity. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the impact of vaccine dose on priming protective, lung-homing CD4 T cell responses and how previous Mtb exposure influences this priming. The access to clinical samples from dose escalation studies of infected individuals provides a unique opportunity to compare human immune profiles to those observed in mice and to translate our murine findings into testable hypotheses for human TB. The proposed experiments will provide a framework for the future design of novel vaccine delivery strategies with the ability to induce and maintain lung- localizing T cells even in TB endemic regions."
