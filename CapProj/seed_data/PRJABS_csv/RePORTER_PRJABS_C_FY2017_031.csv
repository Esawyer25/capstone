"9263459","Summary As the Asia-Pacific aim to eliminate malaria from the entire region by 2030, a number of key challenges related to increasing strong variations in malaria transmission, the presence of a large reservoir of infected but asymptomatic individual and the development of resistance to frontline antimalarial treatment need to be confronted. In addition, the predominance of P. vivax infections in the region results in the particular challenge of dealing with P. vivax hypnozoites and the relapsing infections the cause. The Asia-Pacific ICEMR project is proposing to conduct coordinated set of field and in-depth biological studies in 3 sites in Cambodia, Papua New Guinea and Thailand that span the range of transmission intensities currently found in the Asia-Pacific regions. In the Epidemiology Project spatio-temporal patterns of risk of malaria infection and disease will be investigate through a combination of large cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies that combine excellent epidemiological study designs with state-of-the-art molecular detection and genotyping of Plasmodium spp. infections and an assessment of host immune responses and their link to exposure and clinical protection. The information thus gained will be used to evaluate improved surveillance strategies through an innovative combination of computer simulations and field application. The Transmission Project will use direct membrane feeding assay as a xenodiagnostic tool to determine the infective reservoir as each site and investigate host, parasite and host factors that contribute to sustaining endemic transmission at each site. In addition, we will study patterns of human-vector contact in low transmission settings by investigating human antibodies to anopheline salivary protein as marker exposure to mosquito bites. A key question in both studies is how artemisinin and partner drug resistance affects parasite fitness both in chronic asymptomatic infections and transmissibility. Finally, the P. vivax Relapse Project will specifically address the role of relapsing infections from long-lasting liver stages in the increased resilience of P. vivax against control and elimination. The conduct of these studies will use spatially explicit malaria transmission models, next- generation sequencing (NGS)-based high-throughput genotyping methods and a range of high-throughput and functional assay of humoral immune responses that will be developed in 3 resource cores. These interconnected, multi-disciplinary studies thus aim to identify and characterize critical steps in malaria transmission cycle and thereby gain a better understanding of parasite, host and vector factors that contribute to continued transmission in the context of intensive national malaria control and elimination programs. This knowledge will assist in the development of novel approaches to target residual transmission pockets."
"9473503","Abstract The broad, long term goal of this research is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke. In this proposed work we will develop new biomedical imaging technologies based on MRI. In light of recent MRI based imaging trials which successfully use MRI for stroke triage, there is an unmet need to improve acute phase physiologic and angiographic imaging in stroke. In this proposal we will develop, validate and perform a pilot study of new MRI pulse sequences that are capable, for the first time, the imaging of volumetric changes in cerebral perfusion, pail collateral flow, and tissue oxygenation in under 10 minutes. Our research group brings together two top-tier research institutes to interactively alter and image cerebral physiology using a novel animal model of ischemic stroke. The use of this model will allow direct visualization of the pial collateral flow, local alteration in cerebral physiology and the hypothesized response to flow augmentation therapy."
"9472428","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed program represents a 5-year continuation of an institutional training grant in the biology of aging, which was encompasses diverse investigators from 7 academic departments at UT Health Science Center San Antonio (UTHSCSA). We request funds to support 10 predoctoral and 6 postdoctoral trainees. The impending avalanche of elderly in the US combined with major recent advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of aging has created a substantial demand for researchers trained to investigate means of delaying and relieving the ailments of an aging population. UTHSCSA is a premier research institution in the biology of aging, with the largest faculty in the country whose research is devoted primarily to the basic biology of aging. The primary goal of the proposed Training Program is to intellectually prepare both graduate students and postdoctoral fellows for careers as leaders in basic biological research in aging. The Training Program involves 26 faculty members (16 men, 10 women) and takes advantage of the synergies created by intensely collaborative personnel, the unique resources available from our Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Biology of Aging and the institutional commitment to, and expanding resources of, the Barshop Institute itself. Trainees will be chosen competitively based on academic excellence, their interest in aging research, and motivation for careers in research. The main activity of each trainee is the development of their faculty- supervised research project, which because of the extensive collaboration among our faculty tends to result surprisingly often in co-mentorships. Trainees have thrived with dual mentorships to the point that we have now institutionalized it as an obligatory feature of our training program Another key component is to require broad knowledge in the biology of aging acquired in our biology of aging course such that trainees' can place their research in an appropriate scientific context. In addition to this formal didactic training, we require trainees to attend the weekly Aging Research Journal Club and present at, as well as attend, our weekly Barshop Institute seminar series and annual trainee retreat. Training in grant writing skills resulting in an F- seris grant proposal for individual NRSAs are accomplished by all trainees within the first 18 months of entering our training program."
"9274604","Project Summary/Abstract The purpose of this shared S10 instrumentation grant application is for the purchase of an Olympus VS120 high throughput automated slide scanning microscope. The main aim is to provide high throughput slide scanning capabilities at the University of Miami (UM) to support the NIH funded research of 14 Major Users, as well as 5 Minor User groups representing 4 Centers and 8 Departments at the University of Miami (UM). Currently, there are no available, open-access, high-throughput slide scanning microscopes at UM or nearby research facilities (please see attached letters). The user groups have identified a strong need for high throughput image acquisition of pathological and immunofluorescently labeled slides to accelerate and expand their research programs. The increased throughput will provide the opportunity to increase the number of biomarkers that can be imaged in a given experiment and the number of analysis that can be conducted per sample thereby generating new data and increasing statistical power to detect group differences. Currently available instrumentation is limited to manual and labor intensive image acquisition. We expect that numerous other NIH-funded projects will be well supported by this instrument in the future as other investigators become aware its utility and functionality. We chose the Olympus VS120 slide scanner as the preferred instrument based on two main goals: 1) provide automated high throughput image acquisition and 2) to offer high- resolution imaging of tissues that require brightfield or complex, multi-channel fluorescence labeling. The instrument will be housed and maintained at the open access Analytical Imaging Core Facility (AICF), available to the entire UM community. The existing confocal microscopes in the AICF facility allow for high precision state of art imaging. However, since our confocals are point scanning microscopes (which means they sequentially acquire intensity reads from individual pixels), their performance speed is much lower, compared to the slide scanner, and not capable of automated high throughput operation. Other available instrumentation (e.g., confocal or conventional fluorescent microscopes) require manual imaging of individual fields within a tissue specimen, such that overlapping images must be obtained and the images ?stitched? together. The entire process is tedious and time consuming. Existing manually operated slide scanners provide only low magnification and low resolution images and are not comparable in speed or image resolution to the high throughput, high resolution scanner. An automated high throughput slide scanner is an essential device when the context of the staining within a larger area of tissue is important. The slide scanning microscope can bring a dimension of omics-level throughput to image acquisition and processing of histological and immunofluorescent stained tissue and cells not currently available in Miami. Acquisition of this technology will accelerate discoveries in the laboratories of the many investigators that have demonstrated desire and need for the capabilities available in the requested instrument."
"9253109","KL2 Project Summary/Abstract We propose our second generation institutional translational KL2 program at the University of Massachusetts Worcester Campus (UMW) that consists of the UMass Medical School (UMMS), the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS), and the Graduate School of Nursing (GSN). This program will build upon the transformative KL2 program that has produced 9 scholars with three graduates who together, have had an outstanding impact on our campus and patient care. This program will encompass the full spectrum of translational research from first-in-man studies to implementation science and global health with additional continuous feedback to our basic science colleagues. Working across the University of Massachusetts (UMass) system, we will leverage applied science, engineering, and manufacturing resources to foster a collective institutional culture of creativity and collaboration driving scientific inquiry across disciplinary boundaries. The nature of this proposal is transdisciplinary, a term we have adopted to describe a working environment that expands beyond discipline-based concepts, theories, and methods as a means to address a common research topic and promote team science. In this program, we aim to: 1. Promote a research career development program across basic, clinical, and population health  disciplines geared towards translating research into effective clinical practice and policy, as well as  generating new questions spanning the entire spectrum of research. 2. Recruit promising scholars resulting in a diverse scholar pool with respect to sociodemographic  characteristics, clinical background, and disciplinary perspective. 3. Provide scholars with the individual mentoring, academic career development, and technical skills  necessary to ensure their success as independent investigators as well as contributors to team science. 4. Provide an independence-targeted research experience within transdisciplinary teams that builds  on the strengths of the current environment of linkages between UMass campuses, departments,  centers, and institutes. In order to achieve these aims, each scholar will pursue a major research theme with guidance and direction from an experienced lead mentor and transdisciplinary mentorship team. Scholars will also pursue a degree or coursework to enhance their research potential, and undergo a novel high-impact journal internship that will position them to submit their results for publication in a practice-changing journal. Finally, scholars will produce an R01-level grant under the guidance of both their mentorship team and our newly created ?K to R Club? to position them for independence. Consistent with our transdisciplinary approach, our proposed program also includes mentor development that is built into our mentoring teams across the continuum of faculty levels and disciplinary perspectives. Thus, this program represents a UMass-wide effort for the next generation of our already transformative translational investigator career development program. Using these novel training paradigms and the plans laid out in this proposal, we will be able to meet the current and future needs of translational investigation in Central Massachusetts and beyond."
"9243238","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing loss is a leading public health concern, with about 17% of American adults reporting some degree of impairment. Of those, fewer than 20% seek help for their condition for a variety of reasons. To address this issue, the National Institue of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) is seeking solutions to improve hearing healthcare access and lower its cost. Solutions include enabling currently available commodities (telephone, Internet, and smartphones) to conduct surveillance of hearing loss, Internet screening systems, and DPOAE screening to be used beyond traditional clinical environments.  Creare proposes to complete development of a hearing screening device that measures Otoacoustic Emissions and is controlled through a mobile platform. Our device is designed for use in remote and non- traditional locations with limited personnel and resources as well as for widespread infant screening in the developing world. OAE measurements can be successfully obtained even in noise environments thanks to our noise rejection algorithms as well as a design that enables the use of attenuating earmuffs over the probe to further reduce external noise. The device is designed for low-cost manufacturing and results in a screening system that is cost competitive with even the lowest cost audiometric screeners used in schools. The resulting device will provide a solution to the problem of hearing healthcare access for populations who are unable to provide behavioral responses by allowing wide-scale screening in public health programs and humanitarian efforts, as well as in remote locations where minimal resources are available. In addition, because it is designed for use with mobile platforms and is calibrated to applicable standards, the proposed device will enhance the development of quality audiology applications for use with smartphones, tablets, and the Internet.  During Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of our innovation by building a benchtop prototype of the device and testing its performance using standard clinical protocols. We showed that DPOAEs measured with our prototype were equivalent to DPOAEs measured with a commercial device on a pilot human study that included 20 subjects. During Phase II, we will refine the design of our device, build several integrated prototypes, and demonstrate their use and performance with several human subject studies in target locations and populations. The Phase II human study will have two objectives: (1) compare the test results and test/retest variability using the new device to what can be achieved with existing commercial devices, and (2) evaluate the performance of our device in the target populations to demonstrate its ability to increase access to hearing health in underserved populations.  The Creare team is extremely well qualified to successfully develop and commercialize this low-cost hearing screening device for automated and remote applications. Our system is made possible by leveraging hardware and software that Creare has previously developed for hearing assessment in varied settings including remote assessment in developing countries, Otoacoustic Emission (OAE) measurement in noisy environments, and advanced hearing protection."
"9257462","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission for the K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (POR). The applicant, Dr. Phillip Yang, is a physician-scientist and Associate Professor of Medicine (Cardiovascular Medicine) at Stanford University. Over the past 10 years, Dr. Yang has developed an interdisciplinary translational expertise at the intersection of molecular/cellular imaging and stem cell biology. He has consolidated his expertise to train in POR in regenerative medicine, develop an independent POR career, and mentor the junior clinical investigators. To accomplish this objective, he has received independent research awards from the NIH, AHA, and CIRM related to clinical application of stem cells. Most notably, he received the NIH/NHLBI UM1 Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) grant, which is a 7-year (2012- 2019) $73M effort, consisting of 7 academic sites to design multi-center clinical trials of novel cell therapy. CCTRN will provide the overall framework to conduct POR and to mentor junior clinical investigators. Dr. Yang leads the effort at Stanford to conduct the CCTRN sponsored parent clinical trial, Combination Of c- kit cells and mesenchymal cells: a Novel, dual Cell study Evaluating Regenerative properties for Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure (CONCERT). CONCERT is a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial designed to study the effects of 3 stem cel populations in 144 ischemic cardiomyopathy patients: 1) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), 2) ckit+ cardiac progenitor stem cells (CPCs), 3) combined MSC/CSCs, and 4) placebo. The CCTRN UM1 Award provides $350,000 per year in direct costs for POR in addition to the cost of conducting CONCERT. This K24 is designed to leverage the resource and infrastructure of CONCERT to allow an invaluable opportunity for Dr. Yang to augment his POR and mentor the junior investigators. In addition to conducting the CONCERT trial, Dr. Yang will recruit the CONCERT patients to undergo two ancillary studies to investigate the clinical utility of manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs). The MEMRI study will assess the direct effects of cell therapy on the peri-infarct region (PIR). The MEMRI data will be correlated with the clinical outcome to determine the ability to visualize the direct therapeutic effects of stem cells in real-time. The iCM study will assess the direct in vitro response of the patient-specific iCMs to cell therapy. Functional assays of the patient-specific iCMs will provide a high- resolution assessment of the individual response to cell therapy and potentially correlate with MEMRI. The K24 proposal will provide support for Dr. Yang's 25% FTE and supplies for MEMRI and iCM studies. Dr. Yang has over 10-year history of mentoring junior clinician scientists, postdoctoral fellows, medical students, graduate students, and undergraduates - all performing POR. This funding will provide protected time to augment and enhance Dr. Yang's ongoing POR and mentor new clinical investigators."
"9471119","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that causes a wide range of gastrointestinal disorders. Over the past decade, incidence, severity, and costs associated with C. difficile infection (CDI) have increased significantly. Difficulties in treating infections with conventional antibiotics, increasing rates f recurrent infection, and the emergence of hyper-virulent strains underscore the need for investigating new therapeutic strategies. Initiation of CDI is facilitated by disruption of the gut microbiome, most commonly mediated by broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment, which enables C. difficile colonization and outgrowth. However, the rate of non-antibiotic associated CDI cases are well documented and steadily on the rise. This suggests that a wide range of unexplored factors likely influence susceptibility to CDI. In this proposal, we will explore the impact of the nutrient metal, Zinc (Zn), on CDI. During infection, access to nutrient metals profoundly impacts bacterial replication and virulence factor production. To exploit this, the host produces factors that limit metal availability in a process termed nutritional immunity. One such protein factor, calprotectin (CP), has strong antimicrobial properties mediated by its ability to bind Zn and manganese (Mn). Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize the contribution of CP-mediated Zn starvation in CDI. Another factor likely impacting Zn availability during infection is diet. Altered dietary Zn levels are associated with decrease immune system function and increased susceptibility to various infections; however, there is a paucity of data on how altered dietary metal levels affect the gut microbiome. Furthermore, the impact of dietary Zn on susceptibility to CDI has yet to be defined. We hypothesize that (i) alterations in dietary metal levels profoundly impact the composition of the gut microbiome and this remodeling affects the susceptibility to C. difficile, (ii) calprotectin (CP) mediated metal sequestration is essential for limiting growth, pathogenesis, and persistence of C. difficile, and (iii) C. difficil adapts to variations in nutrient metal levels through the expression of dedicated gene systems involved in metal uptake, metabolism, and detoxification. We plan to test these three hypotheses through a series of integrated Specific Aims. First, we will define how dietary alterations in nutrient metal levels affect the murine gut microbiome and susceptibility CDI (Aim 1). We will next determine the role for CP-mediated metal starvation in CDI (Aim 2). Finally, we will identify C. difficile gene products that are required for growth and virulence in high or low n conditions (Aim 3). These experiments will elucidate the impact of altered dietary Zn levels on the gut microbiome and CDI. Furthermore, characterization of C. difficile gene products involved in nutrient metal homeostasis will lay the groundwork for future studies focused on understanding how C. difficile acquires nutrients within the host. Together, results from this proposal will lay the groundwork for the development of novel therapeutics strategies for treatment of CDI."
"9260747","Project Summary The goal of this research is to discover the best methods to improve cognition and the ability to perform important everyday activities of older adults suffering from age-related cognitive decline using technology- based cognitive interventions. Any successful cognitive aging intervention must satisfy two requirements: 1) the intervention must effectively and efficiently improve cognitive abilities necessary for important activities required for independent living, and 2) the intervention must be one that older adults are able and willing to engage in. When either of these requirements is not met an intervention is likely to fail. Study 1 aims to assess the comparative effectiveness of technology-delivered narrow and broad interventions designed to improve cognition and support functional independence. Before and after training a variety of outcome measures will be assessed. A sub-goal of this study is to create indices of functional abilities whose failure could be catastrophic to older adults; therefore we adopt a focus on simulated versions of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). We will also assess whether individual differences mediate or moderate cognitive intervention efficiency. This study will contribute to fundamental knowledge about intervention approaches, as well as contribute to theories of intervention efficiency. Study 2 will investigate technology- based intervention adherence. An intervention that an older adult does not adhere to will not have the desired outcome. Older adults will be asked to adhere to a technology-based cognitive intervention and we will explore the predictions of several technology adoption and medical adherence models applied to this domain, as well as apply a novel temporal-discounting framework to explore the amount of time older adults are willing to invest in training to obtain benefits in the future. This study will provide guidelines and a model of adherence so that technology-based interventions can be designed that promote adherence. The sum of the results from the two proposed studies of the FSU project will provide guidelines for designing targeted, individualized training that effectively improves cognition and IADL performance while also ensuring that maximum benefits are obtained by promoting intervention adherence."

"9263464","Summary To ensure that malaria transmission continues to decline in the Asia-Pacific region, it is critical that national malaria control programs be able to more efficiently target specific areas of high transmission and populations at highest risk. In order to do this they need to be able to accurately identify and delineate pockets of residual transmission and identify the presence and nature of high-risk groups. This will require new approaches and more efficient epidemiological study designs that are based on an in-depth understanding of key host and parasite factors that contribute to sustaining residual transmission in different scenarios. In particular, unraveling the biological basis (e.g. parasite population genetics, host genetics, immunity) for the relatively high prevalence of asymptomatic infections is now more important than ever before. The overall aim of the Asia-Pacific ICEMR Epidemiology Project is thus to better understand host and parasite factors that contribute to sustaining residual malaria transmission despite intensified control and to apply this knowledge to develop novel ways of accurately identifying and delineating pockets of residual transmission. In order to achieve this spatio-temporal patterns of risk of malaria infection and disease will be investigated through a combination of large cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies that combine rigorous epidemiological study designs with state-of-the-art molecular detection and genotyping of Plasmodium spp. infections and an assessment of host immune responses and their link to exposure and protection from clinical symptoms of malaria. This information will then be used to evaluate improved surveillance strategies through an innovative combination of computer simulations and field application. This combination of in-depth malaria epidemiology, ecology and application of molecular and antibody profiling feeding into mathematical modeling to allow in silico experimentation, followed by application in the field is highly innovative and has previously received very little attention in the context of malaria surveillance.  "
"8627203","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (Sz) is associated with deficits in cognitive function that represent a core feature of the disorder. Traditional dopaminergic models stress dysfunction within higher order associational brain regions. In contrast, more recent glutamatergic models predict widespread dysfunction across cortical regions, including primary and secondary sensory cortices. Over the past project period, we have documented deficits in early auditory and visual processing in Sz using behavioral-, event-related potential (ERP) and MRI-based approaches, supporting distributed models of cortical dysfunction in Sz. In addition, we have demonstrated significant contributions of early sensory processing deficits to higher order cortical impairments. These studies have permitted us to formulate specific hypotheses concerning neural mechanisms underlying sensory/cognitive dysfunction in Sz, as well as novel approaches to potential treatment development. In the auditory system, early deficits include impaired ability to match tones following brief delay, as well as impaired generation of mismatch negativity (MMN), auditory N1 and auditory steady-state (ASSR) responses. Furthermore, deficits in low level auditory processing contribute to higher order dysfunction, such as impaired ability to interpret prosody, leading to deficits in auditory emotion recognition (AER), which, in turn, contributes to impaired social function. In the visual system, deficits include reduced contrast sensitivity particularly to low contrast, low spatial frequency (LSF) stimuli that preferentially engage the magnocellular visual system, as well as impaired generation of steady state visual evoked potentials (ssVEP), visual P1, and impaired fMRI activation of magnocellular-recipient regions of primary visual cortex. Low level deficits contribute to higher order impairments including in perceptual closure and face emotion recognition (FER). Both auditory and visual deficits contribute to progressive impairment in reading ability, which may be an early marker of Sz. Finally, both auditory and visual deficits correlate with impaired structura and functional connectivity within low level sensory regions, as assessed using diffusion tensor (DTI) and resting state (rsfMRI) imaging. To date, neurophysiological abnormalities have been assessed mainly using time-domain approaches. Over the upcoming period, we will incorporate advanced frequency-domain and oscillatory hierarchical approaches as well, which provide separate indices of spontaneous and event-related dynamics of neuronal oscillations. Visual ERP will be combined with eye tracking to permit evaluation of naturalistic scene processing. We will also explore patterns of dysfunction within both prodromal and first episode (FE) cohorts using paradigms validated during our prior grant cycle. Finally, we will incorporate novel brain stimulation approaches including Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) applied over sensory vs. frontal cortical regions to disrupt local processing in healthy controls as a model for Sz; and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied over sensory or frontal brain regions as a prelude to plasticity-based stimulatory intervention in Sz."
"9278439","PROJECT 1 SUMMARY (Targeting sperm-specific proteins during meiosis and sperm morphogenesis) The overall goals of Project 1 are to use CRISPR/Cas9 to understand the formation of the sperm- specific acrosome and identify drug-like probes and preclinical candidates to target spermatogenic- specific druggable proteins for a contraceptive effect in vivo. The human population is reaching alarming numbers, resulting in changes in our climates and ecosystems and likely global shortages of food, water, and other resources for our children and grandchildren. To curb rampant population growth and its dire consequences, we require contraceptives that specifically target the male germline. Contraceptives that target testis-specific proteins should eliminate unwanted side effects. As contraceptive targets, we will focus on two meiosis-specific proteins and four sperm-essential, acrosome-associated transmembrane proteins. These six evolutionarily-conserved proteins were chosen based on proof-of-principle studies in the mouse showing that they are specifically required for fertility in males, our success at delivering small molecules for reversible contraception in vivo, and the potential of these proteins as druggable targets for male contraception. Seventy percent of FDA-approved drugs target either secreted or transmembrane proteins. Further, how the acrosomal proteins interact during acrosome formation is unclear. To define the interactome for formation and function of the acrosome, we will collaborate with Dr. Ikawa (Project 2) to use CRISPR/Cas9 to insert tag sequences into these four genes. To identify small-molecule probes and preclinical candidates, we will partner with the DNA- Encoded Chemistry Technology (DEC-Tec) Core. Our overall hypothesis is that CRISPR/Cas9 and DEC-Tec will help us to define the protein interactome during spermatogenesis, rapidly identify multiple small-molecules that are directed at these essential spermatogenic proteins, and create an assortment of oral and implantable contraceptives for men and women. The Specific Aims of Project 1 are: 1) Use CRISPR/Cas9 to functionally understand acrosome formation and the specific relationship of four sperm-essential transmembrane proteins; 2) Employ DEC-Tec to identify small-molecule probes and preclinical candidates to target spermatogenic- specific ?druggable? proteins; and 3) Evaluate potential in vivo contraceptive effects of small-molecule inhibitors. The success of this P01 and Project 1 relies on interactions with Projects 2 and 3 and the DEC-Tec Core. Dr. Ikawa and his colleagues created several key models and will generate the tagged alleles for Aim 1. Dr. Sonnenburg and his Project 3 team will help to produce recombinant proteins for our Aim 2 DEC-Tec screens. Drs. Young, Huang, Sonnenburg, Simmons, Yu, Lee, and Li are experts at using DEC-Tec, medicinal chemistry, X-ray crystallography, and drug metabolism studies for uncovering lead compounds. Project 1 will perform the in vivo proof-of-concept studies for all three projects (Aim 3). Thus, our multidisciplinary team will tackle this urgent problem and create novel and reversible non-hormonal contraceptives for men and women."
"9431275","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the renewal of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Cancer Health Disparities Training Program (CHDP). The current proposal requests twelve postdoctoral positions. The aim for continuation of CHDP is to train a diverse cadre of scientists at the postdoctoral level to work to improve the science of cancer health disparities research that will lead to reduction and elimination of these disparities. To accomplish this aim, we have added new training elements that will take full advantage of the unique resources and opportunities of the T32 training mechanism to: Recruit three postdoctoral Fellows per year who have an explicit commitment to conducting research on cancer health disparities. A program of this size is necessary to initiate and sustain a specialized, interdisciplinary training infrastructure. Successful efforts to recruit minority Fellows will be enhanced with special strategies to recruit Latino and American Indian Fellows. Develop and deliver a specialized two-year curriculum that fosters an interdisciplinary understanding of  cancer health disparities. The curriculum will continue to build on the institutional strengths of nationally  recognized educational and training programs at UNC. New interdisciplinary courses, graduate certificate programs, and workshops on community engagement in research will be added as recommended opportunities for Fellows. Provide program participants with individualized career development experiences that enhance professional skills and build professional networks. The program will continue to assign each Fellow with mentors in more than one discipline. Additional emphasis will be placed on including steps toward seeking academic research positions to foster transitions from training to productive career paths. Provide CHDP Fellows with individualized mentored research experience with interdisciplinary research teams that focus on understanding complex issues underlying cancer health disparities, based on a social- ecological model of health. Evaluate the success of the program in meeting its objectives by employing explicit benchmarks and will follow well-defined procedures for capturing, analyzing, and reporting outcomes. The evaluation will serve the dual purposes of program accountability and continuous improvement. CHDP has been operative since 2009 and has supported seven Fellows, including five minority Fellows. Four fellows have completed the program, and three have faculty positions. We are confident that with our curriculum, faculty, projects, and research resources, CHDP will continue as a highly successful and vibrant training environment in which Fellows will be exceptionally well prepared for a productive career in cancer disparities research."
"9234033","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): De novo DNA sequence mutations are mutations not inherited from a parent and play an important role in many human disorders, including cancer, autism, schizophrenia, and heart conditions. However, de novo mutations can be difficult to identify because sequencing errors are more common than mutations. Current approaches used to analyze DNA sequence data are inadequate to identify de novo mutations successfully at a genome scale because each potential de novo mutation must be validated by a costly and time-consuming validation process. Our goal is to improve the identification of de novo mutations in order to understand their role in genetic disorders. We will develop a novel statistical approach to identify de novo mutations, and we will implement it in software to make our method readily available to other researchers. Our first objective is to determine the probability that an apparent DNA sequence change is due to a de novo mutation, when analyzing short-read sequencing data from families. To determine this probability, we will integrate over other possible sources of error/noise including sequencing error, population diversity, and chromosome segregation. Secondly, we will expand on this model to detect somatic de novo mutations between multiple tissues from the same individual (e.g. matched tumor-normal datasets). Thirdly, we will develop new models to handle sequencing data from single-cell sequencing, which generates different probabilities of error compared to those discussed previously. These three aims are unified by a common approach of using genealogical information relating people, tissues, or individual cells, to improve the accuracy of de novo mutation discovery. Finally, we will implement these methods in an easy-to-use software package that will make the identification of de novo mutations possible for scientists working on subjects ranging from variation in mutation rates to the effects of aging. The methods developed here can benefit the hundreds, if not thousands, of studies that will search for and characterize de novo mutations in the coming decade. This package will be open source and free for the community to use."
"9250828","Contact PD/PI: Li, King C. Project Summary/Abstract A critical issue that impedes advances in public health is the chasm between what we know can improve health and what is implemented in everyday practice. In addition, to have the highest impact, diverse participants should be involved in all types of clinical and translational research, to ensure both the relevance of research findings to the general population and the likelihood that they can be disseminated to improve public health in a meaningful way. Finally, implementation of research findings requires that translational research occurs in an efficient and organized environment. All of these activities are critical to a learning health care system by providing the foundation for information feedback loops, team-based learning and investigation, stakeholder participation, opportunities for education, continuous improvement, and sustainability. The mission of the Wake Forest Translational Science Institute (TSI) is to provide an innovative, efficient, and sustainable research infrastructure to accelerate WF's transformation, and thus speed the translation of discoveries to improve health. The purpose of this Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) application is to synergize the fundamental positive changes that the TSI has already brought to bear at Wake Forest Baptist Health. The TSI has already made substantive progress to develop and augment our translational workforce; provide outstanding support in biostatistics, epidemiology, and research design; and assure that our research complies with regulatory guidelines and meets ethical standards. Our rapidly growing Clinically Integrated Network will aggregate data from our affiliates to provide an extraordinarily rich source of clinical information to inform new research directions, facilitated by our biomedical informatics expertise. We can offer to the CTSA network our resources and expertise in building efficient clinical research support programs and extensive experience in the conduct of multi-center clinical research, especially studies focused on older adults, in which our track record is exemplary. The TSI also has model programs in community engagement, team science, and recruitment of special populations into translational research. We propose novel experimental approaches that will test methodologies to advance the science of translational science. In particular, we can offer our world-class capabilities to support the use of nonhuman primate models for research of high translational value to public health.

"9425564","VISUALIZATION OF HIV-1 INTEGRATION IN REAL-TIME PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Retroviral infections, including HIV and HTLV, continue to be a pandemic problem. While several drug therapies are able to treat HIV-1 infection, the virus's propensity to develop resistance mutations remains challenging. A clear priority for the HIV-1 treatment arsenal is to identifying novel drug targets. Stable integration of a retroviral donor cDNA into the host chromosome is absolutely required for a productive infection. Nearly three decades of research have established that retroviral integration is extremely inefficient in vivo and in vitro. Integration is catalyzed by the retrovirus encoded integrase (IN), which in many retroviruses forms a tetramer complex with the two viral cDNA long terminal repeat (LTR) ends (termed an intasome). The IN protein removes two 3' nucleotides and catalyzes end joining (strand transfer) of the resulting recessed 3' hydroxyls across one major groove of the target DNA separated by 4-6 bp. HIV-1 integration requires a host protein co-factor PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 for stable intasome assembly and to target integration to chromatin marked with the histone H3(K36) trimethylation post-translational modification (PTM). Remarkably, the prototype foamy virus (PFV) remains the only complete intasome structure. While anti- retroviral drugs that target the HIV-1 enzyme integrase also inhibit the PFV integrase, it remains unclear whether the integration mechanics of these respective retroviral intasomes are similar. We have used novel single molecule analytical tools to demonstrate that the PFV intasome catalyzes the two strand transfer events during integration in quick succession. We also visualized PFV intasomes on a linear target DNA and determined that the vast majority of IN-mediated search events were nonproductive. Together these observations suggested that target site selection limits PFV integration. We propose to extend our single molecule analysis to the biophysical mechanism of HIV-1 integration. Our preliminary studies have already identified significant differences between PFV and HIV-1, suggesting that the biophysical analysis of HIV-1 is likely to be more relevant to human health. Several important questions will be addressed in this new grant application: 1.) What are the protein dynamics of HIV-1 IN during the DNA target search and integration? 2.) What are the viral DNA dynamics during the DNA target search and integration process? 3.) What constitutes an efficient DNA target site? 4.) What factors influence the DNA target search process? 5.) What are the dynamics of intasome targeting on chromatin? We propose to utilize several innovative single molecule imaging systems to visualize HIV-1 integration in real- time. We will examine DNA lesions and mechanically altered DNA structures that may mimic the preferred target DNA configuration as well as chromatin containing histones with specific PTMs. These studies are designed to fully interrogate the animated processes associated with HIV-1 integration."
"9247875","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in the gene ATP1A3 affect the neuron-specific major ion transporter in the brain, the sodium pump or, Na,K-ATPase. This causes rare diseases, Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) and Rapid-Onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism (RDP). Mutations occur in families with dominant inheritance, and there are many de novo mutations occurring in ~100 different places in the gene to date. The objectives of this application are to apply a highly multi-disciplinary, collaborative approach to determine the full range of clinical phenotypes; develop a brain imaging biomarker; and investigate the underlying functionality of the mutations. The full range of clinical phenotypes includes motor, cognitive, developmental, and psychiatric symptoms, and is predicted to expand with a screen to discover patients with new ATP1A3 mutations and features intermediate between AHC and RDP. The full range of phenotypes expressed in adult AHC patients is predicted to overlap with RDP patients and call for a shared approach to therapy development. An advanced brain imaging analysis is hypothesized to lead to a signature of structural and functional features that can be used for three parallel purposes: to identify the specific brain pathways that are impacted and that result in the clinical symptoms, to augment the tools available for future clinical trials, and to potentilly enhance the on-going care of patients by making it possible to evaluate changes over time. The identification of pathways will assist in the future design of treatments, such as deep-brain stimulation. The potential for longitudinal study is particularly relevant because RDP patients, and we think also AHC patients, can have step-wise deterioration, often associated with stressful triggers. The third component, investigation of mutation mechanisms at the biochemical and cell biological level, is needed to determine if specific kinds of mutations result in different phenotypes, and why. This will contribute to rational design of therapies. This is an example of how the study of rare mutations can lead to advances in understanding brain connectivity (imaging) and its relationship to health (clinical phenotypes) and fundamental science (mutation mechanisms). The aims are: 1) Define the phenotypes for ATP1A3 mutation in adult patients including in-depth evaluation of adult AHC patients as well as returning and new RDP patients. Screen for a missing patient population between AHC and RDP; 2) Use advanced imaging methodology to assess alterations of specific brain pathways (correlating with RDP neuropathology) in adult AHC and RDP patients, and initiate longitudinal studies with returning patients; 3) Test the hypothesis that mutations with different enzymatic or cellular consequences will relate to clinical phenotypes and imaging findings, using in vitro mutagenesis and expression in human cell cultures."
"9233193","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are the most prevalent clinical syndromes associated with severe sepsis and are important causes of morbidity and mortality in United States with a mortality rate of 40%. Although much is known about the pathogenesis of cell injury and death in ALI/ARDS, there are several gaps in our knowledge; as a result of which there is currently no effective pharmacologic therapy.  In this context, enzymes known as caspases are essential for completion of the apoptotic program. Phagocytes, in particular monocyte/macrophages, are recognized as major components of inflammatory and immunologic reactions in the lung and are rich reservoirs of caspases, especially caspase-1. The function of caspase-1 has recently been recognized to extend beyond the processing and activation of IL-1ß and IL-18 to include regulation of NF-kB and induction of apoptosis. The present project seeks to expand upon our recent observation that microparticulate caspase-1 can be released from mononuclear phagocytes to have distant effects on target cells.  The present project seeks to investigate a novel hypothesis that links apoptotic enzyme, caspase-1, encapsulated in circulatory vesicles, to lung cell injury and apoptosis. The central hypothesis is that monocyte/macrophage caspase-1 released in target specific microparticles can promote lung cell apoptosis, enhancing lung injury. This project provides a much needed effort and framework to study the poorly understood mechanism of endothelial cell injury and vascular dysfunction in ARDS patients, to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell injury and provide new therapeutic opportunities to halt the cell injury in ALI/ARDS patients. Therefore, to determine the specifics of this novel pathway, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To discover the detailed mechanisms by which monocyte derived extracellular caspase-1 injures lung vascular endothelial cells, 2) To characterize the forms of circulating caspase-1 present in the serum of critically ill patients and 3) To determine how extracellular caspase-1 is taken up by target cells. This project provides an opportunity to examine the role of caspase-1 in the complex biology of monocyte/endothelial cell interactions and apoptosis. Successful completion of this work will uncover critical components of microparticles and caspase-1 mediated inflammasome signaling, enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell injury and provide new therapeutic opportunities to halt the lung destruction in septic patients with ALI/ARDS."
"9274294","Abstract/Summary Core F: Regional Islet Production Core. Interactions with researchers at nearby institutions in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest would strengthen diabetes research throughout the region. The initiation of mutually beneficial interactions will be accelerated by extending the availability of highly unique, diabetes- centric facilities within the UCSF DRC to our regional colleagues. This will be initiated in the coming funding cycle by opening UCSF's world-class Islet Production Core to researchers throughout the region. By providing islets isolated from pancreases of mice and humans to researchers beyond UCSF, the Regional Islet Production Core will enable regional investigators the opportunity to translate their findings to humans. Purpose: The Regional Islet Production Core consolidates, enhances and disseminates expertise and resources in islet preparation to DRC investigators who currently study or have plans to study pancreatic islet cell biology, islet function and/or transplantation. The Core provides the following capabilities:  1. Islet Purification. Processing and preparation of human and mouse islets for use in islet biology, autoimmunity and transplantation studies.  2. Islet Functional Analysis. Real time biological and biochemical analysis of insulin production and other functional aspects of human and mouse islets to characterize islet activity under different conditions and to assess islet preparation quality for transplantation studies. Benefits to DRC Community: The UCSF DRC's Islet Production Core has been receiving requests from through the region for human islets, in particular, for some time. The Core has responded by establishing the procurement and distribution procedures that ensure access to research-grade pancreases. It also has established the equally challenging protocols for ensuring that laboratories are ready to receive the very valuable human islets, once prepared. By piloting these procedures within the UCSF DRC, the Islet Production Core is now able to extend this capability to researchers throughout the region. Five regional investigators from Stanford University, Oregon Health Sciences University, University of Washington indicate a need for human research islets for each of the eight human islet preparations we will prepare annually. These 24 aliquots of human islets will be accommodated by expanding our islet preparations from four per year (for UCSF) to 15 projects with $4,664,620 annual direct support (8, NIH-funded for $3,501,837) will benefit from this effort. Doubling the number of annual islet preparations to accommodate both regional and UCSF DRC islet needs doubles the frequency at which researchers have the opportunity to obtain islets. This enhanced access to all will accelerate diabetes research and enable previously unattainable studies using human islets. Regional investigators also will have access to islets isolated from model organisms by the Core. Thus, the Regional Core will enable both basic and translational islet-based researcher throughout the region."
"9278440","PROJECT 2 SUMMARY (CRISPR/Cas9 and small molecules for targeting sperm function and fertilization) The overall goals of Project 2 are to use CRISPR/Cas9 to understand the formation of functional sperm and identify small-molecule probes and preclinical candidates to target fertilization-required proteins for a contraceptive effect in vivo. Population growth is a major worldwide issue, and our resources cannot continue to sustain these population increases, and because of this, NICHD has made contraception a priority focus area. Because our group is focused on the development of contraceptives that specifically target sperm and fertilization, these germ cell-selective contraceptives would eliminate unwanted side effects. The Ikawa laboratory has developed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to efficiently mutate genes in vivo including the Cetn1 and Prm1 genes required for male fertility. In this P01, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to advance our understanding of fertility pathways in all three Projects and generate useful information to move these target proteins and other related pathway proteins into the DEC-Tec Core for screening. For contraceptive targets in Project 2, we will focus on two sperm-egg fusion transmembrane/signaling proteins and four sperm motility- related proteins that we have shown are evolutionarily-conserved and required only for male fertility. The Ikawa laboratory has effectively used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate mutations in over 200 mouse genes including the genes described in this proposal. This strategy has also successfully produced knockin of tag sequences into loci. We have used CRISPR/Cas9 independently and in collaboration with the Matzuk laboratory (Project 1) to uncover proteins required for sperm-egg fusion and sperm motility. Functional analysis of these mouse models will help not only to decipher the mechanisms by which these proteins function in sperm-egg fusion and sperm motility but also to develop contraceptive drugs to target these essential pathways. The screening of small molecules using the DEC-TEC Core will accelerate this process. Our overall hypothesis is that CRISPR/Cas9 and DEC-Tec will help us to understand the network of interactions of these proteins for sperm function, rapidly identify multiple small molecules that are directed at these essential spermatogenic proteins, and create an assortment of contraceptives for men and women. The Specific Aims of Project 2 are: 1) Manipulate the mouse genome and characterize the interrelationship of sperm-egg fusion proteins; 2) Use CRISPR/Cas9 to study the mechanism of action of novel testis-specific proteins; and 3) Use DEC-Tec to identify small-molecule drug-like probes and preclinical candidates to inhibit sperm motility-specific and fertilization-specific proteins for a contraceptive effect in vivo. The success of Project 2 and this P01 grant relies on the continued collaborations of Project 2 with Dr. Matzuk in Project 1, Drs. Sonnenburg, Lamb, and Huang in Project 3, and the scientists in the DEC-Tec Core. Our goal is to develop multiple unique transgenic models and non-hormonal contraceptives for mechanistic and pharmacologic studies in vivo in this P01 grant."
"9274293","Abstract/Summary Core D: Genetic Modification Core. Diabetes research is commonly conducted by comparing various functions in model organisms, including mice, following the introduction of specific alterations into the genome. The DRC Genetic Modification Core leverages a number of institutional facilities to provide a cost-effective, shared resource for the facile genetic modification of cells and animals needed for DRC investigators to complete studies relevant to type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Purpose: The Genetic Modification Core offers services that enable DRC researchers to:  1. generate complex targeting vectors for conventional knock-ins/knock-outs, genome-editing tools such  as TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9, and standard lentiviral-mediated gene transfers.  2. modify ES or other cells with such vectors.  3. characterize and expand genetically modified cell lines.  4. deliver modified ES cells to blastocysts and generate modified mice lines.  5. inject fertilized eggs with TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 for direct in vivo genome editing.  5. use transgenic methods to create genetically modified mice.  6. assist investigators with the optimal storage of, recovery of, and transfer of modified mouse lines. Benefits to DRC Community: The Genetic Modification Core enables access of DRC researchers to technologies and expertise that would require years to replicate within individual laboratories. In the past 2 years, the facilities that comprise the DRC Genetic Modification Core assisted 77 investigators from 35 DRC laboratories with an average of 269 procedures annually. 61 different currently active projects totaling $15,903,865 annual direct costs ($10,694,539 from NIH sources) have benefited through these efforts.  The DRC Genetic Modification Core coordinates multiple UCSF facilities that provide these technically challenging services to DRC researchers. The DRC Core lowers barriers to enable the use of these necessary capabilities by DRC researchers. The DRC Core also provides feedback and resources to the component facilities so that they evolve to meet the emerging genetic modification needs of DRC researchers. Technology Development: All DRC Cores interact with DRC members to define service needs to be developed by Core Staff. The DRC Executive Committee selects proposals that meet emerging needs by DRC members. Within the past funding period, DRC support has developed the Core's ability to generate both knock-ins and transgenics in non-obese diabetes (NOD) mouse background, lentivirus-based methods for transgenesis, and TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9-directed modifications in a variety of model organisms including mice, flies and worms. This support for the development of new technologies within the Core thus ensures that DRC investigators have cost-effective access to the most up-to-date genetic modification tools they require."
"9343343","The goal of this Phase I STTR grant application is to capitalize on our recent discovery of novel sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) inhibitors by the design and preparation of new analogs for the treatment of heart failure that enable us to understand SAR so as to improve potency and optimize ADME/PK properties. Heart failure is a highly lethal disease affecting more than 6 million adults in the United States. Hypertension, myocardial infarction, and ischemia associated with coronary artery atherosclerosis are the leading causes of heart failure. There are presently no effective treatments for heart failure other than heart transplantation, which is limited by the availability of organ donors and immunosuppressive agents. There is an urgent need for novel therapeutics that reduce the major risk factors and prevent the pathological remodeling triggered by myocardial injury that leads to heart failure. The attractiveness of increasing H2S levels as a therapeutic strategy to treat heart failure stems from the ability of this gasotransmitter to activate multiple protective pathways at the same time. Thus, H2S protects against the development of hypertension and atherosclerosis and plays a key role in mitigating pathological remodeling by regulating multiple critical cellular responses including hypertrophy, anti-oxidant, apoptosis, fibrosis, angiogenesis and inflammation. Our therapeutic strategy targets SQOR, an enzyme that sits at a key pharmacological intervention point because it catalyzes the first irreversible step in H2S metabolism. The Phase I objectives will be achieved by combining the biochemical and cell biology expertise of the Jorns group at Drexel University with the pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry expertise of scientists at the Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. We will accomplish these goals through two specific aims. Aim 1: Perform iterative medicinal chemistry to enhance the potency of SQOR inhibitors to the low nanomolar range and improve drug-like properties with cellular potency for SQOR inhibition of IC50 # 1 ?M and specificity index $ 10. Compounds meeting these criteria will be assessed for their ability to improve survival and reduce apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in an ischemia/reperfusion model and prevent hypertrophy induced by treatment with an adrenergic receptor agonist. Our goal is to achieve these criteria while removing the unwanted functionalities present in some of the original hits. We will synthesize 50-60 new analogs based on existing inhibitor scaffolds, and expect to find at least 10 SQOR inhibitors that meet the criteria of this aim. Aim 2: Evaluate ADME/PK properties for compounds meeting the desired criteria for biochemical and cellular potency. We will explore potential probe- and drug-like suitability by evaluating ~3-4 top leads in assays measuring microsomal stability, plasma protein binding, Cyp3A4 inhibition, aqueous solubility and cell permeability (Caco-2 assay). The most promising 1-3 compounds will also be evaluated for their pharmacokinetic properties in mice. Successful completion of these objectives will uniquely position us to execute an expanded drug discovery program directed against SQOR in a Phase II period of study to include efficacy evaluation in a mouse model for pressure overload-induced heart failure."

The TRTT is enrolling individuals with subjective debilitating tinnitus to one of 3 treatment groups: () DC and ST achieved with conventional sound generators (SG); (2) DC and placebo SG; (3) Standard-of-care (SC) as usually administered in the military. As of September 1, 2014 the TRTT has recruited 136 of the expected total of 228 participants; 76 participants will be recruited per treatment group using an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. A standardized protocol for treatment and data collection is being used by all centers. The primary outcome is change in Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) score assessed longitudinally at follow-up, taking place at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months following the initial treatment session. Secondary outcomes include change in TQ sub-scores, in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Tinnitus Functional Index scores, and in the visual analogue scale of the TRT Interview. Other secondary outcomes include audiometric measures, psychoacoustic measures, and change in quality of life. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of TRT (DC and conventional SG) compared with SC. The secondary objectives are to evaluate (1) the efficacy of DC plus placebo SG versus SC, and (2) the efficacy of conventional versus placebo SG in study participants assigned to DC. We hypothesize that (1) full TRT will be more efficacious than SC, (2) DC + placebo SG will be more efficacious than SC , and (3) conventional SG will be more efficacious than placebo SG, in habituating the tinnitus awareness, annoyance, and impact on the study participant's life. Study centers will include a Study Chair's Office, Data Coordinating Center, and Clinical Centers housed in U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force military hospitals. Results from the TRTT are anticipated to impact the clinical practice for severe debilitating tinnitus."
"9326386","PROJECT SUMMARY During the development of addiction, drugs of abuse induce synaptic plasticity throughout the reward pathways of the brain. Rodent models have been used to show that these changes begin to occur after a single drug administration, enhancing the activity of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). DA neuron activity is largely regulated by excitatory glutamatergic inputs and inhibitory GABAergic inputs. Recent studies using optogenetic techniques have provided evidence indicating that DAergic cells that project to different targets display different drug-induced glutamatergic plasticity and are differentially involved in the regulation of reward behavior. Though previous studies had suggested that such heterogeneity existed in the VTA, this optogenetic circuit level analysis uniquely provides researchers with the ability to isolate input/output pairs and directly determine their specific synaptic properties. This approach will be used here to investigate morphine effects on synaptic plasticity of local GABAergic inputs onto DAergic neurons projecting to three regions: the lateral nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), medial NAcSh, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Aim 1 - Determine the effect of morphine on VTA GABA synapses onto lateral NAcSh projections Hypothesis: Morphine will decrease the synaptic strength of GABAergic inputs to the lateral NAcSh and block LTPGABA at these synapses. Aim will be addressed by combining AAV2-DIO-YFP-ChR2 injection into the VTA with red fluorescent retrobead injection into the lateral NAcSh of VGAT Cre mice. These animals will be treated with morphine or saline and the plasticity of local GABAergic connections onto retrobead expressing cells will be determined by measuring asynchronous IPSCs (asIPSCs), miniature IPSC (mIPSC) frequency and amplitude, paired pulse ratio (PPR), and LTPGABA. Aim 2 - Determine the effect of morphine of VTA GABA synapses onto medial NAcSh projections Hypothesis: Morphine will either decrease or not change the synaptic strength of GABAergic inputs on medial NAcSh and these synapses will not express LTPGABA. I will perform dual injections of AAV2-DIO-YFP-ChR2 into the VTA and red fluorescent retrobeads into the medial NAcSh of VGAT Cre mice. These animals will be treated with morphine or saline and the plasticity of local GABAergic connections onto retrobead expressing cells will be determined by measuring asIPSCs, mIPSC frequency and amplitude, PPR, and LTPGABA. Aim 3 - Determine the effect of morphine on VTA GABA synapses onto mPFC projections Hypothesis: Morphine will increase the synaptic strength of GABAergic inputs on medial NAcSh but have no effect on LTPGABA. I will perform dual injections of AAV2-DIO-YFP-ChR2 into the VTA and red fluorescent retrobeads into the mPFC of VGAT Cre mice. These animals will be treated with morphine or saline and the plasticity of local GABAergic connections onto retrobead expressing cells will be determined by measuring asIPSCs, mIPSC frequency and amplitude, PPR, and LTPGABA."
"9253432","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary hypoplasia is a devastating complication of preterm delivery that is responsible for over 70% of the cases of perinatal mortality. Replacement of damaged cells with healthy cells that would participate in physiological processes and respond to local signaling cues is a therapeutic ideal that may be achievable using stem cell-based therapy. Embryonic stem (ES) cells show tremendous promise as a source of healthy cells. Indeed, we have shown that murine ES cells can be differentiated into specialized surfactant-producing alveolar type II pneumocytes that distribute in the lung parenchyma when implanted into preterm mice. However, the fundamental obstacle of immune rejection precludes long-term engraftment of these cells and impedes translation to clinical therapy. Clearly, new methods to alter the host's detection of the graft or induce graft tolerance are critical to advance of this potentially transformative therapeutic option. We have a longstanding interest in CD13, a multifunctional cell surface peptidase expressed on many cell types where it influences cell adhesion, migration, antigen presentation and endocytosis. Pertinent to this proposal, CD13 is also found on adult and embryonic stem cells. During the course of characterizing CD13KO mES cells, we observed that while cells of both genotypes grew equally well when subcutaneously injected as teratomas into immune-compromised mice, CD13KO ES showed markedly enhanced growth and differentiation in immune competent animals. These CD13KO teratomas contained fewer immune cells, suggesting that the absence of CD13 on the ES cells allowed the transplanted cells to evade immune detection. To confirm this notion, we performed skin transplants between gender-mismatched WT and CD13KO animals. Remarkably, the CD13KO grafts survived for greater than 100 days in both WT and CD13KO hosts while WT grafts were readily rejected, supporting our observations in the teratoma model. Furthermore, at 7d post-transplant the architecture of the skin in WT grafts was clearly disrupted with numerous graft-infiltrating immune cells, while the CD13KO grafts retained a more normal architecture with fewer infiltrating cells. While the hematopoietic profiles of naïv CD13KO mice are normal, 18 there are fewer infiltrating T cell, macrophage populations and significantly reduced numbers of degranulated mast cells in gender-mismatched CD13KO grafts when compared to WT, consistent with WT grafts triggering a stronger immune response? Importantly, treatment of WT mice with a blocking anti-CD13 monoclonal antibody significantly enhanced the survival of mismatched WT grafts when compared to vehicle alone and treatment withdrawal led to graft rejection, implying that CD13 influences immune detection rather than tolerance induction. Taken together, our studies identify CD13 as a potential target for modulation of transplant immunity. We hypothesize that the absence of CD13 in donor cells allows them to escape immune detection and subsequent rejection, thus prolonging survival."
"9253414","?    DESCRIPTION: Successful treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a challenge due to the desmoplastic microenvironment that promotes both tumor growth and metastasis and forms a barrier to chemotherapy. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a crucial role in PDAC progression and contributes to desmoplasia. Hh inhibitor GDC-0449 can overcome desmoplastic reaction. While Hh levels are increased in pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCs), tumor suppressor miR-let7b targets several genes involved in PDAC pathogenesis. Therefore, inhibition of Hh pathway and restoration of miR-let7b could effectively treat PDAC. In our preliminary studies, miR-let7b was downregulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines, human patient's cancer tissues and during progression of spontaneous pancreatic cancer in genetically engineered KPC mice. Our in-silico analysis and in vitro experiments indicate that miR-let7b targets several genes like MUC4, NCOA3, Kras, HMGA2 and TGFßR1, which are upregulated in PDAC. miR-let7b and GDC-0449 could inhibit the proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells (Capan-1, HPAFII and T3M4) and there was synergistic effect when miR-let7b and GDC- 0449 were co-formulated into micelles using poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-carboxyl- propylene carbonate-graft-dodecanol-graft-tetraethylenepentamine) (PEG-b-PCC-g-DC-g-TEPA) copolymer. This copolymer self-assembles into micelles and encapsulates hydrophobic GDC-0449 into its core and allows complex formation between miR-let7b and cationic pendant chains. This combination therapy effectively inhibited tumor growth when injected to ectopic tumor bearing mice compared to micelles carrying GDC-0449 or miR-let7b alone. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR receptors, was conjugated to the nanomedicine to achieve active targeting to PDAC. Therefore, we hypothesize that combination therapy of miR-let7b with GDC-0449 using cetuximab conjugated nanomedicines can effectively chemosensitize PDAC cells by reducing desmoplasia and treat PDAC by reducing their tumorigenicity. Our overall objective is to develop novel combination therapy for PDAC using nanoformulations targeting multiple signaling pathways by miR-let7b and Hh pathway by GDC-0449. Our specific aims are to: i) determine the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of miR-let7b and GDC-0449 combination therapy in PC cells; ii) co-formulate miR-let7b and GDC- 0449 in cetuximab conjugated polymeric micelles and assess their synergistic effect on the inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells, iii) determine the therapeutic efficacy of micelles encapsulating miR-let7b and GDC-0449 in orthotopic NSG and genetically engineered KPC mouse models of PDAC. Long- term significance is to develop nanomedicines of miR-let7b and GDC-0449 that increase the local drug concentrations within the fibrotic stroma of these tumors and bypass the resistance mechanisms that allow tumor growth and inhibit the efficacy of current standard chemotherapies."

SF HI will: 1) develop a community of high school Student Researchers who will conduct research into health issues in their communities, study how adolescents respond to health messages, create new health messages informed by this research, and study the broader impacts of the materials they develop; 2) partner with educational researchers to research the effects of SF HI on the high school student participants and the impact of the materials on the broader community; 3) disseminate those materials shown to have the greatest impact nationally; and 4) publish results on the public understanding and awareness of health issues in peer-reviewed journals and other forums to inform and advance the field of public health. The SF HI model is designed to leverage students' cultural and technological knowledge and their social capital in the role of Student Researchers as they study the awareness, knowledge and attitudes about current health issues in their communities. It will have a broad range of impacts. Over the course of the project, 100 urban public high school students will be immersed in research projects that have the potential to directly benefit the health of their communities. These Student Researchers will design health messages informed by the social, cultural, and community knowledge and by their research results. They will collectively survey more than 8,500 community members - their peers, neighbors, and attendees at public gatherings to assess the effectiveness of these materials. Student-developed materials will be distributed broadly via the web, high school and college wellness centers, the NIH SEPA community, and other networks - thus these materials have the potential to reach over 1.5 million adolescents and young adults over the life of the project."
"9257451","microRNAs (miRNAs) are 22 nucleotide small non-coding RNAs that regulate translation, deadenylation and decay of their target mRNAs. miRNAs have recently taken central stage in biology due to their fundamental roles in animal development, human disease and cancer. Typically, two RNase III family members, Drosha and Dicer, process the stem-loop structure of miRNA precursors sequentially. My recent work has uncovered a novel processing pathway where miRNA maturation skips the Dicer step and instead enters into an alternative Ago2-dependent pathway. This finding challenges a long-held assumption that Dicer is essential for miRNA maturation. However, Ago2-mediated cleavage is just the initial step of this novel pathway and little is known about the molecular machinery and the mechanisms underlying the final steps of miRNA maturation. My preliminary results suggest that after Ago2-mediated cleavage, miR-451 is uridylated and processed to its mature form by exonucleolytic trimming, a mechanism that has recently been reported as a widespread method to refine mature miRNA length. Whether the trimming and uridylation machinery is common to both the canonical and Ago2-dependent miRNA processing pathways is a question that I will explore in this project. To uncover the miRNA trimming (Aim 1) and uridylation machinery (Aim 2), during the mentored phase of the award I will focus on the analysis of miR-451 processing because processing of this Ago2-dependent miRNA requires pervasive uridylation and extensive trimming. Moreover, miR-451 is conserved across vertebrates and plays an essential role both in erythrocyte maturation and in metabolic regulation of glioblastoma tumors making the results of this project relevant for human therapeutics. Later, in the independent period of the award I will capitalize on the discovery of the uridylation and trimming machinery to analyze their role not only in Ago2-dependent miRNA production but also in canonical small RNA biogenesis and turnover during vertebrate development (Aim 3). The use zebrafish embryos will be crucial to perform these analyses in a genome-wide manner. The use of the zebrafish model organism removes the restrictions of using single tissue or cell types, which have limited repertoire of small RNAs. To accomplish all of these objectives I will combine biochemistry, mass spectrometry, genetics and highthroughput sequencing. The experiments in this proposal will identify an evolutionarily conserved machinery to process small regulatory RNAs in vertebrates. The results derived form this project will be instrumental to understand how pervasive modifications of the 3?-end by tailing and trimming affects miRNA-target selection in vivo during early embryogenesis. miRNAs play a key role during early embryogenesis clearing maternal mRNAs and mechanisms controlling miRNA turnover will have a direct impact in embryonic development. Furthermore, given the relevance of trimming in miR-451 processing, the discovery of the underlying machinery will potentially set the framework for therapeutic intervention in human hematopoietic disorders and cancer."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Abstract: Our research team has been studying Gulf War Veterans with chronic gastrointestinal pain disorders for over a decade (Dunphy et al., 2003). Many Gulf War Veterans developed chronic gastrointestinal pain during their deployment to the Persian Gulf in 1990-91. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of this chronic gastrointestinal pain are not well understood but cause significant morbidity in our Gulf War Veteran population. The mechanisms underlying this chronic gastrointestinal pain disorder in Gulf War Veterans need to be established. In preliminary studies, we have identified unique microRNAs (miRNAs) present in the colon tissue of Gulf War Veterans who returned with chronic gastrointestinal pain. Based on these preliminary findings, our overall hypothesis is: Aberrant expression of specific miRNAs dysregulates downstream miRNA targets (?glutamate & ?opioid receptors) that cause, contribute to, or facilitate chronic gastrointestinal pain in Gulf War Veterans.  We have established techniques to determine inter- and intra-cellular roles of miRNAs in the epigenetic regulation of the expression of their down-stream target genes. These methods include: (i) interaction analysis of miRNAs; (ii) transfection of miRNAs into cultures of human colonic epithelial cells; into rat colonic epithelial cells and into rat dorsal root ganglion cells (Aim 3) (iii) in vivo injection of miRNAs in a validated rat model to test for a reduction in visceral hypersensitivity (Greenwood-Van Meerveld et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015).  Identifying the role of miRNA signaling should: (i) Fill an important gap in our understanding of chronic gastrointestinal pain, especially the dysregulation of nociceptive pathways. (ii) Lead to therapeutic strategies that use small molecules that mimic or inhibit specific miRNAs that target gene expression. This will overcome a critical barrier - lack of effective treatments for our Gulf War Veterans who suffer from chronic gastrointestinal pain disorders and lead to the development of novel, miRNA-based sets of diagnostic markers."
"9461662","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite decades of research characterizing the structure and function of numerous cell types in the retina, the encoding properties of retinal amacrine cells remain largely unknown. The overall goal of my research is to contribute to our current understanding of visual processing in the retina by characterizing the intrinsic properties and connectivity of two newly identified retinal amacrine cell subtypes. To determine the physiological properties and synaptic microcircuitry of the CRH-1 retinal amacrine cell. I will be the first to (A) characterize the light responses of genetically labeled CRH-1 amacrine cells to a variety of visual stimuli. I will then (B) place CRH-1 into the context of a functional circuit by identifying postsynaptic retinal ganglion cells. These measurements will allow me determine whether CRH-1 cells could mediate feedforward inhibition in the inner retina. To examine the dynamics of gap-junctional coupling between nNOS-2 amacrine cells and the role of this network in visual processing. In preliminary experiments characterizing another genetically labeled amacrine cell, nNOS-2, I have discovered that these cells form an extensive coupled network. I will examine (A) whether nNOS-2 coupling is modulated by mean luminance and whether the modulatory signaling pathway involves dopamine or nitric oxide. I will also (B) determine how nNOS-2 coupling impacts visual response properties by measuring dendritic morphology and receptive fields in the same cells."
"9243492","PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: David Kao MD is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Cardiology at the University of Colorado Denver (UCD). In addition to clinical training in internal medicine and cardiology, he has completed 1 year of postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics (T15 LM007033, PI: Altman) and 2 years in cardiovascular research (T32 HL007822, PI: Buttrick). He uses bioinformatics methods applied to data ranging from regional administrative data to patient-level data from clinical trials to longitudinal gene expression data in order to develop multi-tiered strategies for personalizing of heart failure (HF) management. Training: The proposed career development plan will apply Dr. Kao's prior research experiences, which have exclusively used publicly available and clinical trial data, to real-world clinical data in three focus areas: 1) management and governance of disease-specific institutional data warehouse construction, 2) high-throughput analysis methods using real-world clinical data, and 3) dissemination and implementation of evidence-based practice recommendations for HF patients. Additional training in these focus areas will enable Dr. Kao to apply his clinical and informatics knowledge to real-world clinical data, preparing him to be an independent, funded investigator in research studying development and prospective implementation of personalized, patient- centered heart failure management strategies using electronic health record data. Accordingly, Dr. Kao's mentorship team consists of experts in cardiovascular disease registries and personalized HF management and experts in data warehouses, bioinformatics, and decision support. Mentors/Environment: Michael Kahn MD PhD (co-Primary Mentor) is a Professor at UCD, Director of the UCD's institutional clinical data warehouse, and Co-Director of the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute; he will provide mentorship regarding data warehouse construction and governance, and decision support. Michael Bristow MD PhD (co-Primary Mentor) is a Professor at UCD with over 30 years of experience in clinical and translational HF research; he will provide mentorship for translational of clinical phenotype analyses to prospective clinical trials investigating personalized HF management. John Rumsfeld MD PhD is a Professor at UCD, Chief Innovation Officer for the American College of Cardiology, Chairman of the National Cardiovascular Data Registries (NCDR) Management Board (formerly Chief Science Officer), and Chairman of the AHA Scientific Council on Quality of Care and Outcomes Research.

"9476026","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal of a five-year Institutional NRSA application for the support of predoctoral students in the interdepartmental Graduate Program in Neuroscience at Emory University. A fundamental strength of this program is the broad interdisciplinary training provided in a wide spectrum of neurobiological issues spanning several basic and clinical neuroscience-related disciplines. Because of the significant growth in highly qualified applicants to this program during the past funding period and the high success rate of current trainees in building up an outstanding record of peer-reviewed publications and successfully competing for external funds at the national level (among the top programs for NRSAs at the national level), we seek support for 10 students per year in this renewal (i.e. 3 more than the current funding state). A total of 94 PhD students (+ 14 new recruits for fall 2015) are enrolled in this program, which has consistently attracted a large and very high quality applicant pool from all over US and a significant number of international applicants with outstanding academic credentials. The program has been extremely successful in enrolling outstanding underrepresented minority (URM) students during the past 5 years, and in attracting a larger pool of high qualified URM to apply. Fifteen percent of the current pool of students in the program are from URM ethnic groups. An Executive Committee representing the 131 (96 on this grant) faculty from 23 departments and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center administers the program. This committee is headed by the Director, who oversees all aspects of program operation, two Directors of Graduate Studies, who monitor student progress, and the Director of Admissions, who is in charge of recruitment of new students in the program. Students in the program receive a broad curriculum of molecular, cellular and systems neuroscience courses in their first two years. A required hypothesis design and grant writing course helps students prepare their thesis proposal (with oral defense) in the form of an NRSA predoctoral fellowship application. They are also required to participate in 3 laboratory rotations before they pick their advisor (usually at the beginning of year 2). A wide variety of elective courses ranging from Basic Mechanisms of Neurological Diseases, Brain imaging and Computational Neuroscience are available to advanced trainees. Finally, students actively participate in various seminar series and receive significant training in teaching, neuroethics and scholar integrity."
"9285840","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substantial evidence has shown that there is significant genetic component to the susceptibility of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). However, only a small proportion of heritability can be explained by the genetic factors already discovered. One hypothesis is that genetic interactions play an important role in disease susceptibility as genetic interactions have been confirmed in several studies of complex disease. However, current methods for sequencing analysis do not consider the effect of genetic interaction. The objective of this proposal is to develop novel approaches for next-generation sequencing data by incorporating the effects of genetic interactions to identify genetic determinants associated with complex diseases, COPD in particular. Since network is a natural representation of interactions, the proposed approaches will be based on weighted networks representing genetic interactions. Gene-based and pathway-based association methods will be developed in Aim 1. A software toolset implementing the proposed methods and existing methods for the identification of gene-gene interactions will be provided for public access in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will analyze the whole-exome sequencing data of 399 selected subjects from the COPDGene study to identify candidate genes and pathways in COPD using the proposed and existing methods, with validations using an independent whole-exome sequencing data of 600 subjects. We will also integrate the genetic network constructed with co- expression network and protein-protein interaction information to identify candidate gene-set modules. In sum, this proposal will help to elucidate our understanding of the genetic architecture of COPD, which will be beneficial to the improvements in prevention, diagnosis and treatment."
"9436576","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will analyze three key, interrelated social determinants of HIV/AIDS and STIs-mass incarceration, housing stability, and subsidized housing policies -and the mechanisms through which they intersect to shape HIV-related sexual risk behaviors and race disparities in these behaviors. To date, research on the association between mass incarceration and HIV/AIDs and STIs has focused on incarceration's effects on relationship stability. Less attention has been paid to its effects on housing stabilityas a linking mechanism. Yet, extensive research has established housing stability as a social determinant of HIV/AIDS, though it rarely includes attention to mass incarceration. Nor has attention been paid to how policies that limit access to subsidized housing based on drug use and criminal history may impact on housing stability. At a time when subsidized housing increasingly represents the only available affordable housing option for the poor, such policies likely affect housing stability, not only among those directly involved with the criminal justice (CJ) system but among their loved ones as well. Thus, there is strong rationale to investigate the intersecting impacts of mass incarceration, housing stability, and subsidized housing policies on HIV/AIDS. Toward this end, this project has three specific aims: (1) To analyze variation across the US in the degree of restrictiveness of subsidized housing policies as it relates to rates of HIV/AIDS and STIs, and race disparities in these rates. This will be done through systematic coding of policies according to their degree of restrictiveness, and analysis of how policy variation is associated with disease rates; (2) To understand from the perspective of vulnerable populations how mass incarceration-including history of CJ involvement (personal, family, and sexual partner) and exposure to 'hyperpolicing-housing stability, and experiences with subsidized housing policies intersect to impact HIV/AIDS/STI related sexual risks, and produce race disparities in these risks. This will be done through analysis of longitudinal qualitative and quantitative data collected from individuals recently involved in the CJ system and/or living in or seeking subsidized housing; and (3) To examine from the perspective of various stakeholders, including policymakers, program implementers, landlords, CJ personnel, and housing and legal service providers, how subsidized housing policies are interpreted and implemented locally and why they are interpreted and implemented in this way. This will be done through analysis of semi-structured interviews with these stakeholders."
"9220785","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The neural mechanisms of sensory conflict and plasticity are not well understood, yet common in everyday life. If sensory conflict is not ameliorated or reduced, problems to human health, such as motion sickness, can be harmful. Perceptual plasticity can ameliorate motion sickness by reducing sensory conflict. Here we hypothesize that multisensory plasticity enables our senses to dynamically adapt to each other and the external environment. Recent work using human/monkey psychophysics has distinguished two multisensory plasticity mechanisms, unsupervised and supervised. How and where multisensory plasticity takes place in the brain is unknown and this proposal explores specific hypotheses about its neural basis. In aim 1, we will search for neural correlates of adult multisensory plasticity in single cortical neuron activity and population responses from the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and ventral intraparietal area (VIP). In aim 2, we will search for direct links between neuronal activity and multisensory plasticity using reversible chemical inactivation. The aims outlined here test the hypothesis that unsupervised plasticity occurs in the relatively low- level multisensory cortical area MSTd, whereas supervised plasticity occurs in higher-level multisensory VIP, an area thought closer to where the perceptual decisions that guide behavior are formed. Results from aim 1 about neuronal tuning curve shifts, choice probabilities and noise correlations will be used to compute population thresholds as well as simulate specific cortical lesions. These model simulations will be directly compared with the inactivation experiments in aim 2, thus providing novel information about neural decoding. Results from these experiments are critical for understanding the neural basis of multisensory plasticity, a fundamental operation our brain performs throughout our lives. Our combined use of psychophysics, single cell and population responses, causal manipulations while monitoring perception, as well as computational modeling, represents a state-of-the-art approach and ensures substantial successes."
"9404513","4.4.7: Project Summary Pollen allergies afflict over 35 million Americans, and the economic cost of treating these allergies exceeds 12 billion dollars annually. The effects on human health are considerable because pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing asthma and can trigger fatal asthma attacks. Despite the importance of these public health concerns, urban areas are filled with plants that produce allergenic pollen, many of which are intentionally cultivated. This preventable situation is caused by a lack of knowledge concerning: 1) how pollen production and dispersal from individual plants leads to heterogeneity in airborne allergenic pollen concentrations on small spatial scales (e.g., tens to hundreds of meters); and 2) the extent to which exposure to allergenic pollen is responsible for triggering asthma attacks and other respiratory symptoms. This project's objective is to quantify these processes and show how allergenic pollen producing plants affect human health. The main components of this research include: ? Characterizing pollen production and spatial dispersal patterns using a pollen sampling  field study focused on Norway maple (Acer platanoides), white mulberry (Morus alba),  box elder (Acer negundo), and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia); ? Creating a spatially explicit model of airborne pollen concentrations as a function of  plant composition using a comprehensive street tree database; ? Adding a temporal dimension to the spatial pollen count predictions using  meteorological data, daily pollen count data from a National Allergy Bureau pollen  counting station, and a small citizen science plant phenology monitoring program; and ? Linking pollen exposure to health effects including asthma attacks and respiratory  symptoms, using existing datasets collected in the study area, Detroit, MI. These include  respiratory related hospital visits extracted from geocoded Medicaid claims data and  cohort studies that tracked 255 children's respiratory health for >12 months. Understanding the contribution of particular plants to pollen concentrations in urban areas has will allow land owners, municipalities and others to actively manage plant composition to reduce allergenic pollen exposure and its health effects. These translational benefits are especially important in both highly vegetated and shrinking cities, such as Detroit, where large vacant areas are providing habitat for allergenic plants that likely exacerbate health disparities."
"9258756","PROPOSAL SUMMARY Perturbations in the development of the cerebral cortex underlie a wide array of common neurogenic syndromes, ranging from dyslexia to cerebral palsy. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate mechanisms by which improper formation of the cortex occurs, and ultimately discover novel targets to treat patients. Here we use next-generation sequencing to isolate genes involved in cortical malformations complemented with an in vitro model in which we can experimentally determine pathways leading to aberrant phenotypes. For this, we will use human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to recapitulate the development of human cerebral cortex in vitro. Importantly, in this in vitro cerebral model we will study neuronal activity, a key biomarker and essential contributor to neural circuit development. Further, using hiPSCs derived from individuals with cortical malformations, we can study aberrant neurodevelopmental features along a range of time points during embryonic development. Wide-field fluorescence imaging will enable the analysis of large populations of neurons, which can be probed in real-time with targeted pharmacological agents and stimulation paradigms. The proposed work will have immediate health benefits; the discovery of genes involved in disease can be promptly used to screen children with undiagnosed disorders. Additionally, using neuronal activity as a biomarker, we plan to develop this novel tool for isolating new mechanisms of cortical malformation."
"9328397","    ABSTRACT Diabetes affects more than 387 million individuals worldwide. In the U.S., a condition that precedes type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, impacts 37-38% of Americans. Of these individuals, 15 million Americans have diabetic neuropathy (DN), a debilitating microvascular complication that results in the progressive loss of sensory nerve function in the extremities. Despite the deleterious impact of DN, therapies for the disease are limited to symptomatic relief. To develop effective treatments that specifically target DN, a mechanistic understanding of molecular pathways that result in neurological dysfunction associated with prediabetes is needed. Recent evidence suggests that dyslipidemia, rather than hyperglycemia, is the clinical parameter that correlates with the progression of DN. Since metabolic pathways converge on mitochondria (Mt), these organelles play a central role in maintaining neuronal cellular function and energy homeostasis through mitochondrial (Mtl) trafficking mechanisms and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated calcium signaling pathways. However, metabolic overload associated with prediabetes may result in aberrant calcium dynamics in the primary sensory neurons of the nervous system, the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), resulting in diminished Mtl trafficking and cell death induced by ER-Mt contact sites. We hypothesize that hyperlipidemia increases the level of ER- Mt contact in DRG neurons, creating localized calcium flux which triggers Mtl apoptosis and halts Mtl trafficking by inducing conformational changes in motor proteins. We will test this hypothesis by 1) evaluating the role of ER-Mt interactions in Mtl dysfunction and neuronal cell death in the DRG and sural nerve of a high fat (HF)-fed mouse model, and 2) identifying structural and functional changes in Mtl motor/adaptor protein complexes that impair Mtl trafficking in hyperlipidemic DRG neurons. These studies will provide important insight into the role of Mtl dynamics in DN and support our long-term goal of identifying therapeutic targets that improve Mtl function and restore nerve function to patients with DN.  "
"9265918","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Food insecurity increases one's risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer (via its links to poor diet and nutrition), conditions highly prevalent among Native Americans in Oklahoma (obesity 42%, diabetes 15%, and hypertension 38%).1 Our pilot study shows that 3 times as many Natives in Oklahoma are food insecure as Whites (21.3% vs. 7.3% respectively).2 Yet few or no studies have assessed individual- and environmental-level correlates of food insecurity among Natives and none have developed interventions or broad-based educational materials within Oklahoma tribal nations.3,4 Aims and Methods: This study, led by a Native American Choctaw Investigator will, Aim #1: Assess correlates (sociodemographics, health behaviors, perceived food environment) and outcomes (dietary intake including vegetables and fruits, BMI, diabetes, and hypertension) of food insecurity in the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations in Oklahoma. A telephone survey will be administered to 500 Native American adults (18+) randomly sampled from tribal registries. Clinical measures will be validated for 200 of those surveyed using tribal clinic electronic health records. Perceptions of food environments will be compared to objective store measures using GIS data. Aim #2: Design, implement, and evaluate a convenience store intervention to increase the availability and intake of vegetables and fruits among tribal members. Using a cluster-randomized design with 20 matched tribally owned convenience stores (5 cases and 5 controls in each tribe), we will implement evidence-based strategies (increased availability and variety, point of purchase information, reduced prices/coupons) to increase the sales and intake of vegetables and fruits among tribal members. Store-level changes will be measured by pre/post sales records and the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey; individual-level changes by two cross-sectional surveys, administered to 300 convenience store shoppers before and 300 shoppers after the intervention. Tribal members will use video voice,3 an action-oriented participatory media research method to collect qualitative and environmental data (e.g. types of foods/beverages sold and promoted in the convenience stores) to facilitate community planning and channel recommendations to policy makers. Aim #3: Create a multimedia manual, co-developed with tribal members, guiding tribes in food environment changes, and disseminated over a free and open source Website allowing for tribal user- created content. Innovation: Each of the 3 aims builds on our preliminary data and/or best practices, and leverages tribal resources and partnerships to enhance survey participation rates and convenience store healthy makeovers. Significance and Impact: The knowledge from surveys on food insecurity correlates and health outcomes will inform the design of the convenience store intervention to increase availability of vegetables and fruits. The resulting multimedia manual will guide food environment changes among tribes nationally to address the critically high rates of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension within this population."
"9257442","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although arithmetic tutoring narrows the achievement gap between at-risk 1st graders and low-risk classmates on arithmetic problems, the gap for word-problem (WP) achievement steadily widens over the course of that tutoring. This is alarming because WP performance, an early form of complex mathematical reasoning, is the best long-term math predictor of employment and wages in adulthood and because scientific knowledge about early WP development lags behind arithmetic. The focus of this renewal is an innovative approach to preventing WP difficulty by embedding tutoring on language comprehension (LC), a cognitive resource associated with WPs, in the same academic material used to build WP skill. At-risk children are randomly assigned to 4 conditions. WP tutoring alone (the conventional, validated approach) is designed to compensate for limitations in working memory & reasoning. Embedded LC+WP tutoring (the innovative approach) is designed to strengthen LC while compensating for limitations in working memory & reasoning. Arithmetic tutoring is included to assess whether WP, arithmetic, & number knowledge learning is superior for either or both WP tutoring conditions compared to arithmetic tutoring. No tutoring is included to control for maturation and classroom instruction. At-risk children are followed through grade 3. Low-risk classmates are followed on the same measures at the same time points to assess achievement gaps. Aim 1 is to assess the efficacy of embedded LC+WP tutoring for promoting WP, arithmetic, & number knowledge outcomes and for narrowing the achievement gap in these domains. Aim 2 is to increase understanding about the role of LC, working memory, and reasoning in WP & arithmetic performance. This renewal has the potential to impact science by providing experimental evidence about the role of LC in WPs and insight into the process by which individual differences in LC, working memory, & reasoning interact with different forms of intervention on different math outcomes. The goal is to improve clinical practice by expanding the framework for preventing mathematics difficulty specifically and academic difficulty generally by assessing the added value of embedded cognitive resource training. If successful, we create the basis for scientific work on other forms of embedded cognitive resource training to extend the framework for academic intervention. This effort also provides a platform for transdisciplinary work across learning sciences, speech-language sciences, cognitive psychology, text comprehension, and learning disabilities. This transdisciplinary work is critical because current evidence indicates that LC difficulty negatively impacts response to academic intervention."

Training occurs at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research (Sheps Center) at UNC and the Mental Health Services Effectiveness Research Program and Center for Developmental Epidemiology in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Duke University Medical Center (Duke). The TP goals are to expand the pool of independent investigators capable of undertaking policy-relevant mental health services and systems research in three areas: mental health laws and state policies, mental health and criminal justice, and child and adolescent mental health services.  This TP for social/behavioral scientists and clinicians has two components: (1) core activities and (2) individualized study. The core component involves alternating bi-weekly research seminars and journal club meetings, a semester-long research proposal writing seminar, departmental seminars and grand rounds at the collaborating institutions, and other research seminars/workshops at UNC or Duke. The individualized study component is tailored to the special interests and needs of each fellow. It is based on an apprentice-type model whereby each fellow is linked to one or more mentor(s) who works with the fellow to develop research skills and opportunities. The TP remains committed to interdisciplinary training, a public sector orientation, and a special focus on persons with severe and persistent mental illness.  The success of this interdisciplinary training can be measured by the accomplishments of the 48 fellows who have participated to date. Most now hold academic or other research positions, have numerous publications, and funded research projects. Innovative emphases have been continually added to the TP since its inception to assure that graduates are capable of pursuing the latest developments in services and systems research. During the next five years, we will introduce and enhance fellows' research in comparative- effectiveness and patient-centered care, integration of mental health and health care, and legal aspects of population mental health. Given the sustained excellence of this training program, funds are requested to continue NRSA-support for four postdoctoral fellows each year during the next five-years."
"9270595","Abstract  Nearly every form of cardiac disease involves changes to the myocardial stiffness. Current clinically-viable measurement techniques to assess myocardial stiffness are ei- ther invasive and/or involve image-derived metrics. We propose the use of a new imaging method, called Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging, in measuring the me- chanical properties of myocardial tissue. The technique employs ultrasonic radiation force to displace tissue. Conventional ultrasound is then used to observe the response of the tissue to the force. We present preliminary data showing the success of this technique in imaging the changes in stiffness that occur under normal myocardial function. We pro- pose to further develop the ARFI imaging technique and then investigate the use of ARFI imaging in detecting abnormal heart function using animal models. In addition, we pro- pose human clinical studies with pediatric cardiac transplant patients. These studies will evaluate the potential of ARFI imaging to provide early detection of transplant rejection, in grading the severity of heart failure, and in distinguishing between systolic and diastolic heart failure."
"9418470","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the application for the K23 Mentored Patient-oriented Research Career Development Award for Dr. Michael Rosenberg, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.  Dr. Rosenberg is seeking to become an independent clinical investigator in genetics of cardiac arrhythmias.  This award will provide Dr. Rosenberg with support necessary to acquire the following research skills: 1) Understanding of human genetic variation and its relationship to complex and Mendelian traits, 2) Clinical study design and implementation; and 3) Tools of large-­?scale data management, statistical analysis, and interpretation.          Drug-­?induced QT-­?interval prolongation, and resultant lethal arrhythmia torsade de pointes (TdP), is the number one clinical toxicity leading to removal of medications from the market.  Most concerning, this toxicity can occur with medications prescribed for noncardiac conditions, such as allergic rhinitis and depression.  For patients with cardiac conditions that require use of antiarrhythmic medications, such as dofetilide, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandates a period of hospitalization to monitor for excess QT prolongation during initiation. Better risk stratification is clearly needed for drug-­?induced QT prolongation. The possibility that genetics might be used to identify susceptible individuals presents a unique opportunity for direct clinical application from ongoing population studies.  The electrocardiographic QT interval is heritable, and has a graded relationship to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in the general population.  Recently, 68 common genetic variants in 35 genes were predictive of variability in QT duration.  Prior studies had shown that the top quintile of a QT genetic score predicted a 10-­?15ms difference in QT interval. This duration is longer than the QT prolongation that forced some non-­?cardiac medications from the market. However, the demonstration that genetic risk can predict drug-­?induced QT prolongation remains elusive.  Dr. Rosenberg's research will focus on the use of a polygenic risk score derived from these 68 common variants associated with QT interval to predict drug-­?induced QT prolongation in healthy young individuals selected by genotype (Aim 1), in 'real-­?world populations' mined using electronic health records (Aim 2), in high-­?risk patients being administered anti-­?arrhythmics associated with QT prolongation (Aim 3), and in survivors of torsade de pointes lethal arrhythmias (Aim 4). Through completion of these aims, Dr. Rosenberg will establish the role of genetic testing in predicting drug-­?induced QT prolongation.           The activities proposed in this Career Development Award application will provide Dr. Rosenberg with outstanding training in preparation for an independent research career in genetic epidemiology, and at the same time, bring important new insights into common cardiovascular disease."
"9249116","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   A five year program to Enhance Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Experiences (ENDURE) will be developed at Michigan State University (MSU). Its goal is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) Ph.D.s trained in neurosciences: specifically to facilitate their entry into high quality and highly competitive mainland Ph.D. or dual degree (M.D. / Ph.D., D.O./Ph.D., D.V.M./Ph.D) programs with a Neuroscience emphasis and enhance their likeliness of their success in the program. Central to this is the need to 1) identify talented students with potential for Ph.D studies in Neuroscience; 2) introduce them to career opportunities in neuroscience; 3) provide research training and individual mentoring; 4) increase their competitiveness for graduate study; 5) and provide additional professional development activities. To do this a bridge program is proposed encompassing the last two years of undergraduate study. It entails established partnerships between MSU and 4 minority serving institutions (MSIs): two campuses in Puerto Rico in the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) system (UPR-Cayey and UPR-Arecibo), as well as two MSIs in the Southwest (Northern New Mexico College and St. Mary's University). To introduce students to neuroscience, a day-long workshop entitled, What is Neuroscience? will be held annually on each of the partnering campuses. Annual support will be provided for 8 summer students to work full-time at MSU on a 10-12 weeks research project in productive laboratories which are actively funded by extramural grants. To sustain student interest in neuroscience, a two semester videoconference journal club will be held at MSU and broadcast live to the 4 MSIs. It will be led by URM grad students in the neurosciences at MSU. Six URM students annually from the four MSIs will spend the fall semester between their 3rd and 5th yrs at MSU taking 9 credits of classwork and continuing on an original, hypothesis-based research project. Included will be a seminar-type course stressing translational and interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the etiology of human disease. This course will entail significant practice in writing, as well as an integral journal club. Improvement of communication skills will involve both informal and more formalized settings (research presentations, participation in class, journal club participation and paper writing). Student progress in both course work and research will be closely monitored and externally evaluated. This program will increase the number of URM students entering Ph.D programs in Neuro-/Behavioral Science, by 1) increasing the student's awareness for research career opportunities in neuroscience, 2) improving their English language skills, 3) providing high quality mentored research experience during the undergraduate studies to `springboard the student into the Ph.D program, and 4) providing further didactic training in neuroscience principles, scientific writing and career enrichment activities. Through these combined activities, the student will become more confident in the application process, present a more competitive application and make valuable contacts (network) with researchers at MSU and elsewhere."
"9411219","Alcohol abuse contributes significantly to disease burden and mortality in the United States, with an annual healthcare cost of $223 billion and death toll of nearly 88,000. It is well known that chronic alcohol consumption leads to gut injury, malnutrition/malabsorption, and increased incidence of colorectal cancers. Studies have implicated quantitative and qualitative alterations of gut microbiota as well as dysregulation of tight junction proteins as key contributors to gut injury, but our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced pathologies remains incomplete. Gut homeostasis is achieved through tightly regulated interactions between epithelial cells, immune cells, and the microbiome. Deeper understanding of the interplay among these three components is necessary to fully identify processes of alcohol-induced gut injury. However, studies to date have not fully uncovered ethanol- induced changes in epithelial cell gene expression or specific microbial shifts that are responsible for tissue injury. More importantly, dose- and region- specific changes have been largely understudied despite the fact that they are likely to play distinct roles in the initiation or exacerbation of various aspects of ethanol-induced pathophysiology. In this application, we will simultaneously define ethanol-mediated changes in the (i) microbiome, (ii) mucosal, and (iii) immune cell gene expression within all major sections of the gut (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon) using a translational nonhuman primate model of voluntary ethanol self-administration. This unique animal model provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to investigate region- and dose- dependent alterations in gut homeostasis caused by alcohol. Completion of these studies will provide us with the knowledge necessary to design interventions to repair alcohol-induced tissue injury."
"9209593","The problems of obesity and insulin resistance have been linked to type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is on the rise and fully effective treatments are lacking. In the spectrum from obesity and insulin resistance, to diabetes, profound metabolic dysfunction is linked to increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In this Program Project, our goal is to uncover fundamental mechanisms by which macrophage inflammation impacts metabolic dysfunction in diabetic atherosclerosis and obesity. Published and preliminary data reveal that in high fat feeding and obesity in human subjects and in mice, ligands of the receptor for AGE (RAGE) are increased in adipose tissue and other key metabolic tissues, even in the absence of diabetes. Our data reveal that genetic deletion of Ager (gene encoding RAGE) results in significant protection against high fat feeding induced obesity and insulin resistance. Importantly, the accumulation and inflammatory polarization of adipose tissue macrophages are greatly reduced by deletion of Ager. Project 3 will address the hypothesis that RAGE/DIAPH1 regulates obesity, adiposity and metabolic dysfunction in high fat feeding, both via cell autonomous mechanisms, and via macrophage cross-talk with the adipocyte. Our Project will explore four key properties of macrophage inflammation to discover RAGE-dependent mechanisms in high fat feeding: monocyte recruitment; macrophage retention and egress; polarization; and metabolic regulation. Project 3 will work closely with Projects 1 and 2 to address the common vs. distinct mechanisms of macrophage inflammation in diabetic atherosclerosis and in obesity. Project 3 will work closely with Project 1 to test novel small molecule antagonists of RAGE/DIAPH1 interaction in atherosclerosis and in high fat feeding, and will work closely with Project 2 to discern common vs. distinct mechanisms by which RAGE/DIAPH1 contribute to regulation of NETRIN1/UNC5B and metabolic dysfunction in macrophages in high fat feeding. Project 3 will utilize all three Cores of the Program over all five years."
"9222809","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Down Syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting 1 in every 700 newborns in the US. DS patients exhibit impaired language ability and developmental delays in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Though DS is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, how such genetic change leads to altered physical and neurocognitive growth remains largely unknown. Consequently, no therapies or drugs are currently available for impaired cognition associated with DS. A major obstacle to understanding DS has been the lack of model systems representing the development of human neural circuitry. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology have made it possible to investigate pathogenesis of DS in human cellular models. These elegant recent studies revealed altered neuronal morphology associated with DS, however, no significant physiological alterations in neuronal and synaptic activity were observed in neurons derived from iPSCs of DS patients. Astrocytes are an important and somewhat underappreciated neural cell. At synapses, astrocytes make contacts with pre- and post- synaptic neurons, acting as integrators and modulators of neural circuitry throughout the brain. Our preliminary results, as well as work of others indicate that astrocytes differentiated from DS patient-specific iPSCs adversely affect neurons. We therefore hypothesize that astrocytes play an important role in modulating neuronal activity in DS brains and that reconstruction of synapses formed between hiPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes may provide a window for the observation of neuronal phenotypes reflective of DS pathophysiology. We believe that a new culture system enabling analysis of neuron-astrocyte crosstalk with cell-type specificity and at the level of synapses will be better suited to study human neural circuitry than currently available culture and animal models. We propose to develop microfluidics-based cell culture system for modeling and analyzing the diseased neuron-astrocyte network of DS. The neural cells will be derived from patient-specific iPSCs and then organized into functional units of neural circuitry - tirpartite synapses - using microfluidics and surface micropatterning approaches. For sensing synaptic activity, we will implement genetically encoded intracellular biosensors to monitor the communication at synapses. This project will be an important step towards our understanding of DS pathophysiology by connecting genetic mutations associated with DS to the structure and function of the human neural circuitry."
"9295352","PROJECT SUMMARY Patient Oriented Research (POR) that focuses on understanding disease mechanisms and classifying diseases based on biology is especially powerful in this era of genomics and informatics. By combining a firm understanding of the design and conduct of rigorous human studies with the growing toolkit of the molecular biologist and geneticist, modern patient-oriented physician-scientists have the potential to overcome age-old barriers to the development of targeted therapies in common and morbid respiratory diseases. The goal of this application is to effectively mentor young patient-oriented research scientists in translational POR in a way that integrates clinical research methods and innovative bench methods (applied to human samples) to advance precision medicine. My research career has been devoted to integrating clinical and bench research methods to ask clinically-relevant questions in human studies. These include: (1) applying molecular phenotyping to asthma and COPD to identify subgroups characterized by type 2 inflammation and (2) revisiting the basic clinical criteria for diagnosis of COPD to account for ?smokers with symptoms despite preserved pulmonary function?, a subgroup that is not captured in existing guidelines, and then studying the biology underlying this condition. The goal of this K24 grant application is to further augment my capabilities in POR and to provide mentoring to junior investigators in translational approaches to POR. Some of these mentees, especially my direct mentees, are already pursuing work at the interface of clinical and translational research. Others are primarily trained in traditional clinical research methods and have expressed a desire to gain bench experience with human samples. Finally, a smaller but important group consists of mentees trained in basic science who wish to learn the methods of POR to forge human relevance for their work. I believe all of these diverse approaches to translational POR are valuable. With the support of my Division, I am starting a ?Pulmonary Precision Medicine Core Laboratory? at UCSF which will provide scalable space and resources and a common area for didactics and informal research interactions all oriented towards translational POR. This K24 grant will protect my time and provide resources (some matched by Divisional resources) to ensure the success of this endeavor. This K24 grant application proposes three aims. The first two are scientific aims that reflect two overarching research areas and provide ample opportunity for mentees interested in POR in asthma and COPD. My third aim, which is organizational, describes my approach to developing this core training laboratory designed to mentor junior investigators who are interested in translational POR in a range of pulmonary diseases."
"9477803","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early drug use significantly increases the odds of developing a Substance Use Disorder (SUD), and risk is exacerbated among Children of Substance-abusing parents (COSs) for whom earlier initiation predicts faster escalation in drug use and more rapid initiation-to-disorder trajectories (Hussong & Bauer, 2008). This underscores the need to identify early risk mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of addiction. Research shows that parental substance use robustly predicts child emotion dysregulation which, in turn, predicts risk for youth substance use (Zucker et al., 2009). Thus, child emotion dysregulation may be a critical link in transmission of substance use risk across generations. In order to identify the highest-impact prevention targets most likely to minimize intergenerational transmission of addiction, it is imperative to understand the mechanism by which parental addiction compromises child emotion regulation, setting the foundation for substance use initiation and escalation later in adolescence. Among low-risk non-substance-using samples, parent emotion socialization (i.e., supportive / unsupportive reactions to child distress) is a unique predictor of child emotion regulation (Eisenberg et al., 2011). However, the field has been remiss because very little is known about parent emotion socialization behaviors among substance-using parents, or how it relates to child outcomes. Findings from the PI's program of research indicate that parent emotion socialization may be the critical link explaining the relationship between parental substance use and child emotion regulation; however, this risk process has not been examined longitudinally or in the context of predicting later substance use risk among youth. It also remains unclear if this mechanism unfolds among community parents and youth and is thus generalizable to the broader population. Thus, the current application will test these questions via secondary data analysis of an ongoing large-scale longitudinal study which employs a multimodal assessment strategy with 579 youth. It is hypothesized that parental drug use, parent emotion socialization, and child emotion regulation will uniquely influence one another over time (i.e., transactional effects). Furthermore, it is expected that more severe parental substance use will predict less supportive parent emotion socialization which, in turn, will predict poorer child emotion regulation as an early developmental risk pathway, ultimately predicting earlier substance use onset and faster escalation in use among youth. The impact of this study lies in testing parent emotion socialization as the critical link explaining the relationship between parental drug use and child emotion dysregulation over time. By focusing on this early risk mechanism preceding actual substance use onset, this longitudinal study will further examine if early risk processes involving emotion socialization and early emotion dysregulation predict distal substance use outcomes into adolescence. Results will inform public health efforts aimed at minimizing intergenerational transmission of addiction by identifying parent emotion socialization as a critical early prevention target."
"9300724","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) is poised to have significant impact in biomedical and bio behavioral research (BBR) both regionally and nationally. SIUE has a unique mix of healthcare and associated disciplines that are not similarly represented in universities in the metropolitan St. Louis and southern Illinois regions and offers nearly 20 graduate and professional degrees in the biomedical and behavioral fields. The goal of the proposed project is to increase the quality and quantity of support for BBR, resulting in SIUE faculty submitting a greater number of and more competitive proposals for external funding and more faculty and students from underrepresented groups (URG) participating in BBR. SIUE will implement strategies for strengthening research administration support through the following three specific aims. 1. Improve pre-award and compliance services in the areas of BBR by:  1.1. Adding a staff member specifically trained to support BBR to the pre-award staff of ORP 1.2. Expanding the overall knowledge base of pre-award research administration staff in BBR projects 1.3. Developing expanded ORP support services and tools to increase the efficiency of grant administration 2. Increase the interaction o faculty with interest in BBR to increase research collaborations. 3. Increase involvement of URG in BBR activities by:  3.1. Leveraging current internal programs to increase support to students and faculty of URG 3.2. Leveraging current and instituting new mentoring opportunities for faculty and graduate students. These aims will increase the ability of the Office of Research and Projects (ORP) to assist with pre-award, post-award, and compliance issues; increase the number of faculty pursuing external support for BBR; as well as facilitate collaboration across disciplines and between faculty at SIUE and two research intensive universities with strong BBR programs, Washington University in St. Louis and the SIU School of Medicine. The resulting research activity and collaboration will provide unique experiential learning opportunities for students and mentoring for graduate students and faculty, including those from URG. With SIUE's long history of service to the people of the region, many of whom live in the most economically depressed areas in the state, the project also has the potential to increase substantially the quality of life in the region."
"9244868","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a leading cause of physical disability worldwide. Successful rehabilitation of motor function is critically dependent on the ability to learn to produce coordinated movement. In this project we will investigate the role of the motor cortex and the cerebellum in a form of learning, known as motor adaptation, which has shown to have promising potential for rehabilitation. Adaptation paradigms are extensively used in rehabilitation to promote stroke recovery; some examples are split treadmill belts moving at discordant velocities to entrain cadence, robot-augmented arm training to improve arm coordination, prism adaptation to treat hemispatial neglect, and discordant visual feedback in virtual reality to restore hand function. Numerous meta-analyses and reviews highlight the relatively marginal differences between therapies and the varied capacity for adaptation in patient populations. In order to address the Accelerating the Translation of Preclinical Stroke Research Into Clinical Studies of Stroke Prevention, Acute Treatment, and Recovery and Recovery Translational Research Using Brain-Computer Interface Devices for Stroke and Other Neurological Disorders priorities set forth by the NINDS, and significantly impact the future of adaptation paradigms used for rehabilitation, it is necessary to understand neural machinery of adaptation. Recent work has suggested a physiological link between the cerebellum and motor cortex during adaptation. Other studies, however, have shown that stroke lesions involving primary motor cortex do not affect adaptation. Therefore, the overarching aim of this project is to conduct a focused and novel investigation into two key neural substrates thought to mediate motor adaptation: the cerebellum and motor cortex. Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques will be used to noninvasively track changes in motor cortex intracortical physiology (short intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation) and cerebellar modulatio of the motor cortex as subjects learn to adapt to a visuomotor gain perturbation of their finger movement in virtual reality. It is hypothesized that measures of M1 intracortical physiology and cerebellum-motor cortex interactions should track with the reduction of movement error, when explicit information of the perturbation is not provided. The public health relatedness of this project is to explain the unique contributions of cerebellum and M1 to the different phases of learning and pave the way for lesion-specific therapeutic interventions using virtual environments and/or non-invasive brain stimulation."
"9209591","Project 2: Summary During obesity, the increased accumulation of macrophages in VAT and other metabolic organs (liver, skeletal muscle) propagates chronic inflammation, which is associated with systemic insulin resistance, the development of type 2 diabetes, and its associated co-morbidities such as atherosclerosis. While the mechanisms regulating macrophage recruitment have been well studied, the signals directing macrophage persistence and failure to resolve inflammation in metabolic tissues are poorly understood. Identifying the mechanisms contributing to non-resolving macrophage inflammation and crucial pathways amenable for intervention is a key objective of this application. Emerging data suggest that neuronal guidance cues typically expressed during development, such as netrin-1, have additional roles outside the central nervous system in the induction and inhibition of cell migration. Our proposal investigates the concept that netrin-1 is expressed by adipose tissue macrophages and regulates immune cell trafficking, survival and accumulation in obese VAT, thereby leading to metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance. We will use novel mouse models of tissue-specific or conditional deletion/gain-of-function of netrin-1 and its receptor Unc5b to determine how this guidance cue/receptor pair alters macrophage migration into and out of VAT, macrophage survival and inflammatory polarization. In addition, using nanoparticle technology, we will test how targeting netrin-1 and Unc5b alters metabolic inflammation and dysfunction. Furthermore, we will work with other projects to determine the role of factors that accumulate in hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in the induction of netrin- 1 in macrophages from obese VAT and atherosclerotic plaques in order to glean common and tissue-specific mechanisms promoting macrophage dysfunction. These studies will provide insight into the signals that promote macrophage accumulation during obesity and the potential of netrin-1 and its receptor as therapeutic targets in obesity and type 2 diabetes, and potentially other chronic inflammatory disorders."
"9260745","Project Summary Recent findings from CREATE III indicate that a simple to use Personalized Reminder Information and Social Management System (PRISM 1.0) software application designed for older adults was beneficial in terms of enhancing social support, reducing feelings of social isolation and increasing general well-being among older people living alone, ?at risk? for social isolation. Participants also indicated that they enjoyed using the system; it made life easier and was easy to use. PRISM was designed to support social connectivity, procedural and prospective memory, knowledge about topics and resources (relevant to seniors) and resource access. In the proposed study, we will evaluate an expanded version of PRISM (PRISM 2.0) with diverse populations of older adults in diverse contexts. PRISM 2.0 will have expanded functionality (e.g., videoconferencing) and new platforms (tablet), be available in Spanish, and evaluated in rural locations, assisted living facilities and senior housing units. The system will be compared to a standard computer tablet alone control condition. The goal of the study is to gather rigorous systematic evidence about the value of the enhanced version of PRISM with other older adults who live in other contexts. We will also gather data to identify individual difference factors that affect use, usability, acceptance and adoption of the PRISM 2.0 system and longitudinal data on the benefits of the system. Participants (aged 65+) will be randomly assigned, following baseline assessment, to one of the two conditions. We will build on the protocols developed for the PRISM 1.0 trial. The trial intervention period will be 9-months. A battery of measures (refined from the PRISM 1.0 trial) that includes demographic information, attitudes towards technology, computer proficiency, technology, computer and Internet experience, functional independence and well-being, social support/isolation, and quality of life will be administered at baseline, and 5 and 9 months post randomization. We will also assess cognitive abilities at baseline and 9 months. We will also conduct interviews at 5 and 9 months and a telephone interview at 15 months. The living contexts will vary by site according to site characteristics (e.g., FSU has access to rural populations) to allow us to examine a broader and more diverse sample and living contexts. Phase 1 will involve: cross-site focus groups with a sample of older adults to obtain their initial perceptions of the system and feedback about proposed applications (N = 75); pilot testing; refinement of the system and training protocols; and modification of PRISM materials. Phase 2 will be the actual implementation of the trial (N = 258).  "
"9291390","Project Summary The integrity of cells is tightly controlled to keep organisms alive in the face of environmental change. The normal process of growth, however, requires that cells partly disrupt cellular structures that provide stability. These conflicting cellular priorities create challenges for cells in balancing integrity and extensibility. The root of Arabidopsis is adept at dynamically regulating growth in response to stressful environments such as salinity and provides a model developmental system where growth is localized to a specific region of the organ that is accessible to high-resolution imaging. Recent work has revealed that cell integrity during salt stress is maintained through the mechano-sensitive receptor-like kinase FERONIA. Identification of this essential regulatory pathway provides opportunities to understand the mechanism cells use to integrate information on cellular mechanics into decisions that control the biosynthesis of the extracellular matrix, which determines the growth potential of cells. Current understanding of how growth is organized in plants has largely focused on cellular contexts where tip- growth is predominant and wall biosynthesis is localized to a discrete focal area in the cell. This process is thought to be distinct from the major mode of cell growth in organs where delivery of new wall materials occurs in a distributed manner across the cell. New work presented here identifies an essential function for the FERONIA (FER) kinase in regulating the mechanical properties of the wall and cell integrity under salt stress. These findings suggest that dynamic regulation of wall biosynthesis by mechanical cues may be necessary to maintain cell integrity during stress. The project aims to elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which salinity disrupts cell integrity and the role of FERONIA in reorganizing the biosynthesis of the extracellular matrix to permit growth while maintaining cell integrity. To achieve this goal we will use high-resolution imaging approaches including light and force measurements and advanced proteomic methods that enable molecular insight into the biochemical pathways that link wall mechanics to intracellular signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics and ECM biosynthesis. Specifically we aim to 1) Understand the role of FER in regulating vesicle trafficking and dynamical properties of the actin and microtubule-based cytoskeleton to understand how these processes affect delivery of cargo for wall biosynthesis during stress. 2) FER-dependent intracellular calcium transients will be used as beacons of signaling activity to determine the cell-autonomy of FER function with respect to cell integrity and vesicle trafficking. 3) Quantitative phosphoproteomics will identify signaling components that directly interact with FER and the Rho-GTPase from Plants (ROPs) to link receptor activity to wall biosynthesis and calcium signaling. The proposed research is significant as it will advance our understanding of cellular homeostasis mechanisms that integrate mechanical and environmental stress cues using root growth as a model."
"9252456","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of our T32 grant entitled is to rigorously train clinically oriented post-doctoral scholars from both adult and pediatric backgrounds in clinical investigation focused on prevention and treatment of kidney disease. The training program strives to supplying the workforce with outstanding clinical investigators in adult and pediatric nephrology who will lead the field in discovery of new treatments and preventive strategies for the expanding population of adult and pediatric kidney disease patients throughout their careers. The training will be provided through four structured modules, supplemented by elective coursework, seminars, and individual mentoring. The first module provides a 2-year mentored primary research project, supervised by a T32 faculty member and a 3-faculty Scholar Oversight Committee created individually for each scholar. This T32 places a strong emphasis on training in epidemiology and biostatistics, which will assist scholars regardless of their primary focus within clinical investigation. Thus, in the second module, all scholars will complete the UCSD CREST program; a highly rated and successful two-year Master's program in clinical research that is specifically designed to train clinically oriented scholars in research methods. Understanding the key aspects to measurement, including topics such as precision, limits of detection, and different platforms of measurement are key tools in clinical investigation. Moreover, skills to test the kidney's ability to metabolize and clear compounds will be necessary if scholars are to deliver new treatments to kidney disease patients. Thus, the third module is designed to provide the scholar hands-on experiences with in vivo pharmacology and measurement methods in both animal models and in humans. Finally, success in investigative careers requires skills in scientific writing, grantsmanship, and leadership; structured training i these areas is often overlooked. Thus, the fourth module will provide structured training in these areas. In proposing a new T32, we have specifically designed this grant with a modest request of post-doctoral fellow positions. We request 2 slots in year 1 and 3 slots in subsequent years. One in every 3 scholars will be trained in pediatric nephrology. Recognizing the importance of strong commitment of our faculty to a new T32, we have prioritized the quality and breadth of expertise of faculty, rather than quantity of faculty. The faculty was selected based on their commitment to clinical investigation, commitment to mentorship, and breadth of expertise in all aspects of clinical investigation spanning from physiology and pharmacology in animal models to clinical trials in humans. The scholar and faculty are supported by the great wealth of expertise of the larger faculty at UCSD which will be used to supplement needs of individual scholars. In aggregate, we propose an innovative, supportive environment for outstanding training in all aspects required for successful careers in clinical investigation in adult and pediatric nephrology."

"9274295","Summary Pilot & Feasibility Program The UCSF DRC's Pilot & Feasibility Program aims to contribute to the building of a robust diabetes research community at UCSF by fulfilling the following goals: ? Identify, attract and support new investigators and junior faculty establishing research programs in diabetes. ? Foster new and innovative collaborations amongst DRC/UCSF faculty. ? Enable established faculty to transfer skills and research developments to the arena of diabetes research. ? Encourage highly innovative early stage investigation in basic and clinical diabetes research. ? Provide seed funding that can be leveraged to increase external grant funding in emerging areas of research  During the current funding cycle, the DRC P&F Program supporting diabetes research at UCSF with a total of $980,000 in funding for 23 projects out of 63 applications over six Requests for Applications. An additional 3 proposals ($70,000) were funded with UCSF Diabetes Center funds. The DRC Program placed a high priority on providing support for young faculty intending to establish research programs relevant to diabetes, and 16 of the successful applicants were New/Early Stage Investigators. The Principle Investigators on 8 of the funded project were new to diabetes research, and the remaining two were established diabetes investigators proposing new and exceptionally innovative translational research directions. The P&F program was dedicated to facilitating all UCSF Faculty wishing to pursue new initiatives in basic or clinical diabetes research. The successful research programs were conducted in 18 different departments or Organized Research Units and 3 campuses.  Projects that were initiated with seed funding have, to date, resulted in 30 publications and successfully competed for $6,560,351 in external grant funding, of which $2,780,351 went to early stage investigators. This outstanding return reflects the extremely high quality of the applications received. As a result of this funding success, and the P&F Program mentoring program, all but 2 of the P&F awardees remain in diabetes research, and 8 are now permanent members of the DRC. This success in expanding and enriching the diabetes research community at USCF lead to a 2 million dollar private donation to the UCSF Diabetes Center to expand the P&F program.  Our goal is to build on this success in the coming cycle. Our RFAs will reach a broader segment of UCSF by participating in a recently set-up campus-wide intramural grants support system. The increased average grant size will capture an even larger number of high quality applications and permit grantees greater leeway in proposing innovative projects. Finally, we have exciting plans to improve our mentoring and feedback mechanisms that ensure our P&F grant recipients take full advantage of the local expertise."

"9260936","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, or IPF, is a terminal disease affecting as many as 500,000 Americans with no FDA-approved therapies capable of stopping disease progression. The disease is characterized by excessive assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM) by activated fibroblasts termed `myofibroblasts'. Recently, studies have demonstrated that tissue mechanics, specifically tissue stiffness resulting from myofibroblasts assembly of ECM and contraction, is capable of driving the differentiation of myofibroblasts and thus disease progression. In short, myofibroblasts are capable of recruiting more myofibroblasts leading to a disease that progresses unchecked. Despite these recent findings we still do not understand how the process is initiated, nor do we have any therapies that effective halt disease progression. In the current research proposal we hypothesize that an emergent fibroblast subpopulation displays dysregulated mechanotransductive phenotypes due to an inability of these cells to sense the stiffness of their environment. These fibroblasts are thus capable of assembling and contracting the ECM, like myofibroblasts, even in soft environments, thus skewing the matrix from normal to pro-fibrotic. We propose to define the aberrant phenotypes, identify the molecular mechanism, and propose a novel approach toward the normalization of aberrant fibroblast mechanotransduction. We will use a host of cell sources from human to mouse, model ECMs from purely synthetic to human disease-derived, and animal models of disease along with advanced biophysical and cell biological assays to complete the project. The research proposed in this application is significant not only in terms of its potential impact on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of IPF, but also in its impact on our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the transition from normal wound healing to fibrotic progression within the lung."
"9412062","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important biomedical research goal is to reconstitute human tissues from induced pluripotent cells for in vitro interrogation of human disease states. However, our ability to coax stem cells to form complex multi- cellular structures is currently limited by deep conceptual and technical challenges. While high-throughput gene expression and biochemical measurements allow us to reconstruct the molecular circuits that control stem cell fate, these circuits are enormously complex, and the maps produced by genomics are static. Therefore, we do not understand how individual stem cells dynamically integrate signals from their environment while communicating with other cells to coordinate and construct multi-cellular tissues. The major goal of my research is to combine high-throughput single cell imaging and mathematical modeling to derive reduced, predictive models of cell fate circuits and to exploit these models with new optogenetic tools to manipulate stem cell fate with spatial and temporal control. In this application, I use mouse Embryonic Stem (ES) cell differentiation as a powerful model system for quantitative single cell analysis of fate selection n a stem cell population. In response to Wnt and Fgf signals, ES cells leave the pluripotent state and select between two alternate germ layer cell fates. A complex network of transcription factors controls the ES cell, but, in previous research, I showed that a circuit of just two transcription factors, Oct4 and Sox2, controls germ layer fate selection. Now, I use Oct4 and Sox2 as the essential nodes in a quantitative and predictive model of germ layer fate selection that incorporates both single cell information processing and inter-cellular communication. First, I will perform high-throughput single cell time lapse imaging of Oct4 and Sox2 protein levels to quantify the ES cell's response to a large array of Wnt and Fgf inputs. With statistical analysis,  will reduce these measurements to a predictive dynamical systems model of signal integration. Second, to determine the impact of inter-cellular communication on ES cell fate selection, I will quantify the spatial and temporal propagation of differentiation signals through the Wnt, Fgf, and Notch pathways in ES cell populations and construct a population level model of cell fate selection. Third, I will combine the model with new optogenetic tools to modulate the single cell response to Wnt and Fgf in order to direct germ layer differentiation with spatial control. Since germ layer differentiation is a foundational process of both mammalian development and in vitro differentiation, optogenetic control of this process would provide a platform for in vitro construction of complex multi-cellular structures from germ layer derivatives. Together, these aims will provide conceptual insight into how stem cells communicate to execute multi-cellular processes like tissue development, homeostasis, and repair. Further, my application will provide a proof of principle for optogenetic light-gated control of in vitro embryonic stem cell differentiation to synthetically generate tissues for studies of human disease."
"9244779","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project examines the role of protein acetylation in mediating nutrient-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Lysine acetylation (AcK) has emerged as an important reversible post-translational modification. The biochemical environment of the mitochondrial compartment is particularly favorable for acetylation and recent studies have identified multiple AcK sites on a large number of mitochondrial proteins, including several metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Increased mitochondrial AcK levels correlate with metabolic dysfunction in the context of aging and obesity. A growing body of evidence suggests that acetylation of specific lysine residues on mitochondrial proteins impairs metabolic regulation leading to glucose intolerance, and compromises skeletal muscle performance during exercise. The protein responsible for deacetylation within the mitochondria, sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), has been identified. However the molecular events that promote mitochondrial AcK remain poorly understood. Acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), a metabolic intermediate of glucose and fat catabolism, is the proposed substrate required for reversible acetylation. In vitro studies  suggest mitochondrial AcK can occur non-enzymatically as a result of elevated mitochondrial acetyl-CoA production and/or accumulation. In addition, recent studies of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) underscore an important link between elevated acetyl-CoA levels, mitochondrial AcK and metabolic regulation. CrAT converts acetyl-CoA to its membrane permeate carnitine conjugate, acetylcarnitine. The CrAT reaction permits the mitochondrial efflux of excess acetyl groups and thereby has the potential to influence AcK events that are driven by mass action. This prediction is supported by preliminary studies from the laboratory showing that CrAT deficiency in mice exacerbates mitochondrial AcK in response to nutrient excess. Furthermore, CrAT ablation in the skeletal muscle results in metabolic dysfunction and exercise intolerance. The objective of this proposal is to determine if lysine acetylation of mitochondrial proteins contributes to the metabolic consequences of CrAT deficiency. The proposed studies will focus upon the molecular and physiological characterization of CrAT deficient cells and mice. First, we will test the hypothesis that stimuli that decrease mitochondrial acetylation can restore metabolic function in CrAT deficient myocytes. Second, we will use mice with a muscle-specific deletion of CrAT to determine whether normalization of mitochondrial AcK status restores glucose and/or exercise tolerance in the absence muscle CrAT. The results from these studies will expand our understanding of the functional relevance of mitochondrial AcK and could lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for treating age- and obesity- related skeletal muscle metabolic dysfunction and exercise intolerance."
"9260746","Project Summary This project consists of two studies involving older adult decision-making that are linked by the common CREATE goal of understanding how older adults make decisions that can significantly impact the quality of their lives in contexts where technology plays a critical role. Study 1's goal is to understand and thus better predict the decisions older adults make with respect to their willingness to adopt technology applications that hold potentially high value in improving their independence and well-being, but which also require expenditure of cognitive effort to adopt. For example, older adults may need to learn a software application to increase their prospects of finding employment or engage in online self-learning activities such as learning a new language. In Study 1, we will recruit 48 participants into 6 focus groups, in English and Spanish, to identify four such applications across three age groups: young-old (65-74), middle-old (75-84), and old-old (85+). We will then test a model containing five facilitators and inhibitors that are predicted, through their interplay and direct influences, to impact the decisions older adults make regarding pursuit of such technologies using 225 participants, 75 from the three age groups. Self-appraisals related to these facilitator/inhibitor variables will also be elicited. Findings from this study will provide valuable insights into theories and guidelines for technology uptake. Study 2 will comprehensively examine the relative roles of six different sources of health information, characterized from most traditional to least traditional (e.g., newspaper, physician advice versus Internet-based guidance, simulated online social network), in influencing the choices that both younger and older people make with regard to both low and high risk healthcare decisions using four healthcare decision making scenarios. Participants will be asked to provide their most preferred decision option from a list of available options, which will be ranked by the research team, including a physician, from best to worst. For each decision problem scenario, participants will also be asked to choose their most preferred source of information from the six sources, and the number of sources they used to support their decision making process. The study will also examine how these choices are impacted by individual characteristics such as age, cognitive abilities, personality, health literacy, numeracy ability, risk attitude, and trust in information source. Study participants will include 50 younger (20-40 years), 50 middle-aged (41-64 years), and 50 older (65+) adults. Findings from this study can be used to help develop a framework for understanding healthcare decision making among older adults. "
"9251928","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the training program outlined in this renewal application is to provide short-term intensive research experiences to professional veterinary medical students. The short-term goal is to stimulate an interest in the pursuit of hypothesis-based research that examines mechanisms, treatment, and prevention of disease. The long-term goal is to increase the number of veterinary students that embrace research as part of their career, with a focus that ranges from basic science/discovery to translational and epidemiological studies. These individuals fill a unique niche in the biomedical community, combining a comparative medical education with investigatory skills that are essential to advancing human and animal health. The program is based upon a research intensive summer experience that is part of a larger Summer Research Program. First- and second- year veterinary students select mentors from graduate faculty of the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM), the Ohio State University (OSU). These faculty include individuals with primary appointments in the Colleges of Veterinary Medicine, Medicine and Pharmacy, assuring broad exposure of students to all facets of the health sciences community. Projects are developed in collaboration between student and mentor, assuring that the project reflects student interests and ideas. Development of the proposal and preliminary training activities occur prior to summer, and presentation and publication of research results are emphasized in the period following summer. The latter includes an end-of-summer research symposium, at which students make oral presentations of research results, and poster/platform presentations at the CVM Research Day the following spring. Accordingly, students are selected from within the OSU CVM community. The most meritorious projects are now selected based upon proposals submitted to and ranked by the CVM Council for Research, with final award decisions made by the Executive Steering Committee of the Summer Research Program. This change has resulted in increased quality of students and projects, with now over 50 applications for 10 T35 positions. Recruitment of new faculty mentors now provides international research opportunities, particularly in the field of epidemiology, and we have achieved a 3:1 faculty mentor: student ratio, assuring a large number of training options that will assure a fit with student interests. W have implemented a mechanism for student feedback and as a result, summer seminars are increasingly focused on career development. Subsequent pursuit of graduate education is used as an indicator of program success. Of the 40 T35 trainees that have completed the program in the current funding interval, 25% are engaged in graduate education (with 45% still in veterinary school)."
"9461665","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The context in which a stimulus appears can have a profound effect on how it is perceived and processed by the human brain. For example, the neural response to a visual stimulus is often suppressed when seen in a cluttered background. This effect is termed surround suppression, and its magnitude depends on the similarity of visual features between the center and surrounding stimuli. It is not yet clear what neural mechanism(s) underlie this effect, or how they may be divided in to separate processing stages. It is also not clear how differences in the spatial and functional properties of different suppression mechanisms might give rise to the various forms of spatial context effects observed in human vision. Using psychophysics, functional MRI, and electroencephalography, this project seeks to define three distinct mechanisms that contribute to surround suppression, each with different functional properties. A range of different stimulus and optical display configurations will be used to separately quantify the perceptual and neural response during short-range, mid- range, and long-range suppression. This will provide insight into the neural underpinnings of spatial context effects that play an important role in a number of visual processes including edge detection and figure-ground segmentation. Differentiating these mechanisms may also elucidate contextual processing strategies conserved across many brain systems, and how such processes may become disrupted in clinical conditions such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and amblyopia."
"9418925","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural women living with AIDS (WLA) in India continue to face profound challenges in accessing and following treatment regimens, caring for family members, and maintaining positive mental health. Furthermore, they are generally underweight and malnourished, with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) at levels lower than 50%. While the Indian Government's National Rural Health Mission utilizes a successful model to address the health needs of the rural population by training village women as Ashas (Accredited Social Work Activists) to enhance health of pregnant women and their infants, the focus on rural WLA needs to be significantly strengthened. U.S. and Indian collaborators recently completed an R34 pilot study which has demonstrated successful improvement in ART adherence, CD4 levels, and physical and mental health among rural Indian WLA. In total, 34 rural intervention WLA were supported by grant-trained, HIV-focused Ashas who provided assistance to WLA in decreasing barriers to ART adherence and provided protein supplementation compared to equal numbers of usual care WLA who received minimal protein supplementation. While very successful, our Asha pilot study monitored only WLA, despite the fact that many rural children are also at risk for delayed physical growth and psychomotor development. More importantly, we were not able to separate the nutritional component from the care and support component of the Asha, did not incorporate nutritional biomarkers, and were limited by only a six-month follow-up. In light of the mandate to advance both the science of nutrition and sustainability in real settings, our experienced team proposes to build on and extend our successful pilot work to meet this need, by assessing the incremental advantages of nutritional support to Asha care and support alone, and the impact of these programs on an index child (oldest between 3-8 years). In addition, we will take advantage of rural India's excellent mobile phone coverage and computer technology for both wireless data collection and data transfer. The proposed longitudinal study will use a 2x2 factorial design, specifically, 1) Asha support alone for WLA , vs. 2) Asha support for WLA + nutrition (food-based) training, vs. 3) Asha support for WLA + food supplementation, vs. 4) Asha support for WLA + nutrition training + food supplementation, to test the effects of nutrition training and/or food supplementation on primary outcomes of anthropometric parameters and immune status (CD4 levels) of the WLA at 6-, 12- and 18-month follow-up; and secondarily on ART adherence, psychological health, nutritional adequacy and lipid status of the WLA over time. Based upon reviewers' comments, among index children, we streamlined our assessments to include anthropometric parameters and psychomotor development; and among those HIV positive, immune status."
"9402405","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nanotube-based chemical sensors are an emerging class of devices that are able to detect analytes for applications related to human health and security. Current methods to fabricate these devices involve the introduction of carbon nanotubes onto a surface without any methods to facilitate their alignment, and thus networks of randomly oriented nanotubes are formed. Block copolymers, where two different types of polymers are tethered together, are known to assemble into well-ordered morphologies which can be changed by varying the volume fraction of each type of polymer. Thin films of these polymers can be formed on a surface with domains of controllable size. Previously, metals have been deposited on block copolymer thin films to form metal nanowires in an elegant, bottom-up approach. The research outlined in this proposal will explore the alignment of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) on block copolymer thin films with well-ordered morphologies. The SWCNTs used here will either be unfunctionalized or functionalized on the nanotube's sidewall and end. Devices will be fabricated from the nanotube-substituted polymer thin films and tested for their ability to sense different chemical analytes. Devices that can sense minuscule amounts of gaseous and volatile organic compounds have proven to be important because they can prevent human exposure to hazardous compounds. The research proposed here addresses ways to detect these types of analytes with improved sensitivity derived from the high alignment of the nanotube networks.       Similar devices that detect the presence of specific sequences of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) have the potential to be used extensively for disease diagnosis and biowarfare agent detection. While many sensors for the detection of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) have been developed, the direct detection of naturally occurring dsDNA would represent a major improvement in the field. The dsDNA detector developed in this proposal will be evaluated as a tool for the diagnosis of the bacterial infection, Lyme disease, derived from Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. Popular diagnosis techniques involve identifying the presence of antibodies that the human host raises to B. burgdorferi. The identification of bacterial dsDNA in a human host is a more accurate method to diagnosis Lyme disease, however the current polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods are expensive and require extensive pretreatment. The nanotube-based dsDNA detector proposed here will be able to directly and accurately identify the presence of specific sequences of dsDNA in human blood serum. This could be useful for Lyme disease diagnosis since misdiagnosis can lead to serious long-term side effects and high health care costs. The detector proposed here would represent a powerful tool for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of many diseases caused by bacterial infection."
"9450706","Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., resulting in over 480,000 deaths every year and costing $278 billion in loss of productivity. Smoking is also the leading cause of cancer and of deaths from cancer. Smoking causes cancers of the lung, larynx, mouth, bladder, liver, kidney, colon, rectum and others. While smoking rates in the U.S. have declined over recent years, continued smoking is strongly associated with both depressive disorders and depressive symptoms, with smoking rates remaining at 30-50% among individuals with depressive disorders. Depressive symptoms have also been shown to predict smoking cessation failure. While clinical practice guidelines for nicotine dependence treatment suggest the need to address psychological issues such as elevated depressive symptoms, empirically validated interventions to address this important risk factor are lacking. Tobacco quitlines are the major vehicle through which smoking cessation services are delivered in the U.S and are available in every U.S. state via a national quitline portal, 1-800-QUIT-NOW. However tobacco quitlines, as they currently exist, deliver standard behavioral smoking cessation treatment and are not well equipped to effectively help smokers with conditions such as comorbid depression. Indeed, a recent study reported that 24% of smokers calling a state tobacco quitline had a significantly elevated level of depressive symptoms and that these smokers with depressive symptoms, compared to those without, were significantly less likely to successfully quit smoking. Tobacco quitlines would derive significant benefit from an adjunctive psychosocial approach to address the depressive symptoms experienced by many of their clients. While issues of feasibility limit the use of such approaches in a standard delivery method, their use in the form of a mobile application (app) holds significant promise. Behavioral Activation is an empirically supported treatment that is straightforward, easily understood, and as such is particularly amenable to a mobile platform and to systematic integration with tobacco quitline counseling. Across studies, Behavioral Activation is effective for reducing depressive symptoms among individuals with sub threshold depression as well as individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and it meets the criteria to be established as an empirically supported treatment. The aims of this Phase I application are to employ user centered design processes to develop and test the acceptability and efficacy of a mobile health app, Act2BSmokeFree, which will incorporate brief Behavioral Activation vs. a relaxation app, Breathe2Relax in a small randomized controlled trial of smokers with elevated depressive symptoms. All participants will receive tobacco quitline counseling. The expected outcome of this project is the development of a prototype of Act2BSmokeFree, which can readied for Phase II testing of clinical efficacy in a future randomized controlled trial in conjunction with tobacco quitline counseling."
"9259235","PROJECT SUMMARY  Bestrophinopathies are a class of inherited blinding diseases that cause debilitating central vision loss. The study of these diseases plays a central role in efforts to understand and treat a variety of related retinal diseases, including age related macular degeneration. Bestrophinopathies are diagnosed clinically as five distinct conditions that are linked to over 200 separate mutations in the BEST1 gene. Efforts to understand the specific genotype-to-mechanism relationships?that explain the diverse clinical presentation of these conditions?have been hampered by a deficiency of accurate disease models. Recently described patient- specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) disease models have incrementally improved the representativeness these model systems. Unfortunately, patient-derived iPSC disease models remain poorly suited to large-scale genotype-specific studies necessary to evaluate personalized therapies for the hundreds of reported bestrophinopathy mutations. Existing models are hampered by limited accessibility of patient- samples and from confounding effects of variable genetic backgrounds in patient-derived iPSCs.  This work aims to address the challenges of accessibility and genetic variability by using gene-editing to create a selection of iPSC lines, each with a unique disease-associated mutation, from a single commercially available wild-type (WT) iPSC line. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the disease phenotype of two gene edited iPSC derived disease models in comparison to bestrophinopathy patient-derived iPSC models. In Aim 2, we will apply our genotype-specific disease models to evaluate the extent that a proof-of-principle gene therapy strategy can rescue quantifiable disease phenotypes. These studies will inform the study and treatment of bestrophinopathy as well as other genetic diseases of the retina."
"9272271","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young female sexual minorities (YFSM) are at exceptionally high risk for intimate partner violence (IPV), with over half of YFSM reporting physical or sexual abuse by a dating partner. These young IPV victims may be particularly vulnerable to the negative physical and mental health consequences of IPV, including substance abuse, depression, and suicide, due to minority stress and diminished protective resources (e.g., parent support, community connectedness). In addition, YFSM may be less likely to report and to seek or receive help for IPV because they are not out about their sexual orientation or they fear stigmatization and discrimination. Women who seek help for same-sex IPV are often denied services (e.g., two-thirds of LGBT IPV survivors were denied access to domestic violence shelters) and feel marginalized and unsupported by domestic violence service systems. Basic research is clearly needed to inform development of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV in YFSM and to support female sexual minority IPV victims. The existing literature, however, has almost exclusively focused on IPV in heterosexuals. Because LGBT teens and young adults face unique issues surrounding their relationships and sexual behaviors (e.g., pressures to deny or conceal sexual identity and activities), the risk and protective factors for IPV, help-seeking behaviors, and consequences of IPV in sexual minority youth are likely quite different from those observed in heterosexual youth. The overarching goal of this project is to begin to address these disparities by conducting an innovative study of IPV in female sexual minority adolescents and young adults (YFSM). We propose a novel, minority stress-informed dynamic developmental systems perspective of IPV in YFSM, which we will test using a mixed-methods, accelerated longitudinal design. Building upon the longest running study of LGBT youth, we will collect quantitative data from two ethnically diverse cohorts of YFSM (N= 530; ages 16-26) every six months for two years, as well as qualitative data from 50 selected participants. We will accomplish the overarching goal with four primary specific aims: (1) Describe the nature and trajectories of IPV in YFSM across adolescence and young adulthood; (2) Identify risk and protective factors for IPV among YFSM, including factors that differentiate violent vs. non-violent/healthy relationships; (3) Examine factors that affect YFSM's reporting of IPV, help-seeking for IPV, and ability to benefit from help  provided (e.g., cultural competence of providers); and (4) Evaluate the consequences of IPV in YFSM, identifying factors that raise risk for or protect YFSM victims from revictimization and negative health consequences of IPV. Integration of the resulting quantitative and qualitative data will be used to inform the development of evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV among YFSM and better serve those who experience IPV. 1"
"9251090","ABSTRACT The goal of this Fast-Track proposal is to develop a novel non-cytotoxic, epigenetic therapeutic for life-long disease modification of sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD is a morbid, life-shortening condition caused by mutated hemoglobin (sickle hemoglobin, HbS). The pathophysiology triggered by sickle hemoglobin is interrupted by another hemoglobin that the body usually produces in utero, fetal hemoglobin (HbF). The epigenetic protein DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) is known to directly silence HbF. DNMT1 is depleted by the generic drug decitabine (Dec). Moreover, because of its chemistry, Dec can deplete DNMT1 without cytotoxicity. Early-phase clinical trials that repositioned Dec for non-cytotoxic DNMT1-depletion in HU- refractory SCD have demonstrated notable efficacy. Unfortunately, marketed Dec has severe pharmacologic limitations, undermining viability for life-long disease modification: (i) it is rapidly destroyed (within minutes) by the enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA). This is a significant problem because DNMT1-depletion by Dec is S- phase dependent, in other words, exposure-time dependent; (ii) Very high CDA levels in the intestines and liver are a barrier to oral bioavailability, undermining feasibility for life-long disease modification. To solve these related problems, we combined oral Dec with an inhibitor of CDA, tetrahydrouridine (THU). A Phase I clinical trial has demonstrated that THU-Dec solves the fundamental pharmacologic limitations of Dec alone. However, the Phase I trial was conducted `powder-in-bottle': patients attended the clinic for API reconstituted in the pharmacy then drunk orally. Also, THU, a new chemical entity, is synthesized by a batched, poor-yield, very expensive synthesis scheme (~$70,000/kg). We will address these two major, but technically tractable, hurdles to clinical adoption via the following aims: Phase 1 - Aim 1: Complete process optimization of THU synthesis. Instead of combining hydrogenation and reduction of uridine in a 1-step process, we pursue a 2- step reaction scheme that separately optimizes hydrogenation and reduction reactions, to produce higher, scalable, stereo-selective THU yields at substantially lower costs. We have very promising preliminary data. Phase 2 - Aim 2: Formulate oral THU and oral Dec into a combination drug product that releases THU immediately and Dec about 60 minutes later. We will pursue a combination THU-Dec `tablet-in-tablet' strategy such that THU is released immediately in the stomach but the Dec component, coated with a pH- sensitive polymer, is released in the small intestine (neutral-pH). In vivo studies in a baboon model will be used to confirm that the product recapitulates or improves over `powder-in-bottle' PK. Phase 2 - Aim 3: Conduct a Phase IIa clinical study to confirm the dose of the combination drug product to be used in subsequent studies. The body of scientific, safety and efficacy data already generated for THU and Dec has de-risked this endeavour to an extent very unusual for most early stage drug development efforts; completion of this project promises rapid movement through pivotal clinical trials, to NDA, and to patients in need."
"9231475","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This two-phase project will test the feasibility of integrating into Early Intervention (EI) services an intervention to enhance communication between infants and toddlers with diagnosed or suspected developmental disabilities and their depressed mothers. Federally-funded EI services are provided in all 50 states to infants and toddlers with developmental delays to improve long-term child cognitive and behavioral outcomes. EI services are optimized when the child receives consistent developmentally supportive activities as part of the family's normal routines throughout the day, every day. EI services frequently include parent-implemented language enrichment interventions to increase child-centered speech and reciprocal (turn-taking) communication, which have been linked to positive child outcomes. Such interventions are dependent on consistent parent attentiveness, reciprocal interactions, and sensitivity to child cues. Depressive symptoms, prevalent in mothers of EI-enrolled children, can rob mothers of these capabilities. Fortunately, providing depressed mothers with concrete, attainable skills for improving interactions with their child can reduce the impact of depression on mother and child. EI is an ideal setting in which to integrate screening, support, and targeted communication skills for depressed mothers in order to improve EI child outcomes. First, we will use focus group and interview data to tailor a toolkit and training program for EI staff and determine whether it is feasible for staff to identify, screen and support mothers with depressive symptoms. Data on the toolkit will be collected from 4 EI staff on feasibility (ease of use, time required) and acceptability to mothers. Then, we will determine whether it is feasible for mothers to engage in an intervention to increase their child-centered speech and reciprocal communication using a technology-supported Language ENhancement Assessment/intervention system (LENA) embedded in EI services. The LENA uses an infant or toddler garment with an integrated audiotape device that records adult speech centered on the child, child vocalizations, and reciprocal turn-taking conversations between parent and child. The LENA software produces visual feedback that a mother can use to focus her language-based interactions with her child. The LENA-supported communication feedback intervention will be implemented with 10 mothers and 10 EI staff by using LENA one day a week for 16 consecutive hours for three consecutive weeks. Feasibility data, LENA communication data (adult word count, child vocalizations and conversational turn-taking), the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scale, maternal depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and child disability profiles (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) will be analyzed to determine the potential usefulness of the approach. The tailored intervention package will be designed for maximum scalability, with the ultimate goal of use by EI professionals across the country to enhance mother-child communication and maximize EI outcomes for children."
"9228392","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite major advances in genomic technologies, the integration of genetic data with clinical management remains challenging. This problem is particularly poignant for copy number variants (CNVs), lesions that typically perturb the dosage of dozens of genes and, as recent data have revealed, are major contributors to genetic disorders, most notably neurodevelopmental traits. Recent advances that afford superior resolution in the detection of genomic lesions have accelerated the discovery of CNVs in patients; however, with the exception of rare cases with point mutations of discrete genes within a CNV, the transition from CNV detection to assigning phenotypic contribution of specific genes remains largely intractable. We have taken an orthogonal approach to the problem, grounded on two key observations: a) that some CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental traits exhibit quantitative anatomical phenotypic surrogates; and b) that some CNVs manifest in reciprocal relationships (deletions and duplications of the same or overlapping genomic segment) with either similar or mirroring clinical phenotypes. Grounded on these observations, we have performed systematic overexpression and suppression studies in zebrafish embryos and have identified KCTD13 and CHD1L as the primary drivers of the neuroanatomical phenotypes associated with the 16p11.2 and 1q21.1 CNVs respectively, results that have been substantiated by the subsequent identification of rare atypical de novo deletions in these two genes in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here we propose to develop further our tools to systematically dissect other reciprocal CNVs associated with neurocognitive traits. Under a series of filters that select for number of protein encoding genes, and mandate tractable anatomical features that can be recapitulated in zebrafish embryos, we will focus initially on 12 CNVs and assay in vivo the possible contribution of each gene contained within these lesions. Additionally, we will ask whether concomitant dosage misregulation of the primary CNV driver locus and each additional gene within the CNV might influence the expressivity of relevant anatomical, quantitative phenotypes. For the resulting group of candidate or contributing CNV driver genes, we will ask whether these genes a) are also involved in atypical, rare deletions identified by high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) datasets generated from cohorts with an enrichment of neurocognitive phenotypes; and b) bear point mutations in ASD exomes that will be functionally tested using a zebrafish model to assay pathogenicity and direction of effect. Finally, we will ask whether testing of all alleles detected for each transcript in cases and controls might reveal a mutational burden at these loci that is invisible by statistical means alone. Together, these data will identify a number of genes that drive neurocognitive effects in humans and provide an efficient platform for the systematic dissection of CNVs discovered in patient exomes and genomes."
"9405171","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the face of chronic kidney disease is a frequent clinical problem with an increasing incidence, an unacceptably high mortality rate that has not improved in more than 50 years, and no specific treatment. Interest is keen for the pursuit of methods for quantifying structural and functional disruption in progressive chronic disease and acute injury that might improve the sensitivity, specificity, and time in which renal injury is diagnosed, and facilitate risk stratification and/or provide prognostic information including prediction of recovery of renal function. Furthermore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to meet the medical need for both safe and effective preventative and post-injury applications in AKI. We have recently proposed and evaluated new image based methods for mapping intrarenal blood volume and PO2 on a voxel- wise basis with perfluorocarbon nanoparticle contrast agents employing fluorine (19F) imaging and spectroscopy. We also have discovered new highly specific biomarkers of proximal tubular injury (myo-Inositol Oxygenase: MIOx) that can be applied for early detection and management of AKI.  We now seek to define the potential broader translational utility of these tools as objective, noninvasive, quantitative approaches for assessing renal inflammation, coagulation, and hypoxia over time and space in animal models. The rationale for these efforts emerges from growing evidence that interactions among inflammatory and coagulation pathways play a pivotal role in AKI. Such vascular damage not only causes an overall reduction of renal blood flow that compromises glomerular filtration but also leads to regional perfusion deficits, extended hypoxic/ischemic injury, necrosi, and apoptosis that impair tubular cell regeneration and repair. We will design and deploy new nanoparticle therapeutic agents that are active against selected inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., NF¿B, apoptosis: Bak/Bax, and thrombin/PAR-1) in unique and effective formulations that provide localized sustained release of agents (peptides, siRNA) that may be complementary and synergistic in early and advanced AKI, or even when applied as preventative measures. Accordingly our aims are to:  AIM 1. Deploy selected and synergistic nanoparticle agents singly and in combination against promising  molecular targets in AKI (NFkB, thrombin, Bak/Bax) and define efficacy for early and late AKI, and as  preventive agents in a mouse model of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. AIM 2. Apply dual 1H/19F MRI and spectroscopy of PFC NP in vivo to quantify intrarenal blood volume, PO2, and inflammation in injured kidneys over time, and delineate responses to nanotherapies, in concert with new biomarkers specific for proximal tubular damage (MIOx)."
"9459028","The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively characterize the functional sequence elements encoded in the human genome that are recognized by 250 RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in two cell lines. To do this, we will generate stable HeLa-S3 and GM 12878 cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RBPs and determine the sub cellular localization pattern of each RBP. These cells will be used to perform CLIP-Seq assays to define genome-wide, and at single-nucleotide resolution, the RNA sequence elements recognized by 250 RBPs. The RNA sequence elements identified will be validated using sequence-based in vitro binding assays. Furthermore, ChlP-Seq will be performed for all nuclear localized RBPs to determine the regions of the genome and chromatin that each RBP associates with. These binding assays will be supplemented with functional assays in RBP-depleted cells that will be critical for assigning functions to the identified binding sites. These assays include RNA-Seq of total cellular RNA and RNA purified from various cellular fractions, ribosomal footprint profiling, and Gro-Seq. Together, these assays will provide functional information regarding the roles of each RBP in splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, RNA stability, RNA editing, translation, RNA localization, and transcription. Bioinformatic analysis will be performed, largely  using software generated by our group, to quantitate all assays and to associate functions to the sequence elements identified in the binding assays. Together, these experiments will provide a comprehensive and in depth measure of the functions of approximately half of the human RBPs and the functional sequence elements that they interact with. This project will fill a major gap in the catalog of functional elements encoded in the human genome that are being characterized by the ENCODE consortium. The product of this project will be a unique and valuable community resource that will push the field forward in new and exciting ways and will almost certainly create new paradigms regarding the functions of RBPs and RNA-protein networks in human biology and disease."
"9327220","Abstract  Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, making it an essential enzyme to the life of all living organisms. As such, RNR has been a successful drug target for treating a wide range of cancers. However, only in a few cases such as the RNR from the Herpes virus has the ?2?2 subunit interaction been utilized as a drug target. This is largely due to the lack of structural information on the RNR ?2?2 subunit interface, despite the fact that the crystal structures of the individual ?2 and ?2 homodimers of the E. coli class Ia RNR have been known for more than two decades. The relative orientations at which ?2 and ?2 bind to form the complete ?2?2 complex is generally understood, but there is little atomic resolution information on the subunit interaction, as many of the residues at the interface are unresolved in crystal structures.  The objective of this work is to use the E. coli class Ia RNR as a model system to solve the structure of the ?2?2 interface region by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This structural information will be important for understanding the complicated proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes that take place across the subunit interface, and lays a foundation for the development of drugs designed to inhibit PCET between ?2 and ?2 in class Ia RNRs. While ?2?2 formation normally occurs only transiently during turnover, we demonstrate that a stable ?2?2 complex can be trapped on a timescale and protein concentration sufficient for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. One subunit will be 13C-labeled, and the other 15N-labeled, allowing for an investigation of the intersubunit heteronuclear dipolar contacts unique to the interface region between ?2 and ?2. The sensitivity of the experiment will be enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization experiments utilizing the biradical polarizing agent AMUPol (5-10 mM). 13C-15N contacts will be probed by the FS-REDOR and ZF-TEDOR pulse sequences. The final modeling of the ?2?2 interface region will make use of molecular dynamics simulations of the available crystal structures constrained to previous cryo-electron microscopy data, previous pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance data, and the 13C-15N distance constraints determined in this work.  Obtaining a structural model for the class Ia ?2?2 subunit interface region of RNR is expected to aid in understanding the mechanism of proton-coupled electron transfer between ?2 and ?2, opening the door for drug development efforts targeting the RNR class Ia ?2?2 subunit interaction."
"9477801","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Several new HIV prevention interventions have proven to be highly effective at reducing transmission of HIV and have offered hope for containing and possibly reversing epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. Modeling studies suggest that investment in rapid, coordinated scale-up of a combination of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions, including HIV testing and counseling (HTC), male circumcision (MC), antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), can significantly reduce population-level HIV incidence and may be cost-effective. Rigorous evidence-based outcomes to support these projections of population-level impact are needed if national and international bodies are to justify further investment in combination prevention strategies.     The primary objective of this funding is to complete an ongoing evaluation of the impact of a combination prevention package on population-level HIV incidence in Botswana and estimate the cost per HIV infection averted. The over-arching study design is a pair-matched Community Randomized Trial with an intervention arm that receives the combination prevention package and a control arm that receives standard of care with clinical, laboratory, and data management strengthening. A baseline household survey of approximately 20% of randomly selected households in each community is implemented to (1) establish an HIV incidence cohort and (2) estimate baseline and annual coverage of the combination prevention package. Individuals who enroll in the baseline household survey are followed annually to assess uptake of study services in both study arms and describe major outcomes. The HIV incidence cohort is followed annually to assess cumulative HIV incidence over 36 months, which is the primary study outcome of interest.     An end-of-study survey targeting 100% of households in four community pairs (4 combination prevention communities and 4 enhanced care communities) will be used to estimate and compare combination prevention package uptake between arms. Additionally, laboratory research activities will be used to map genotypes from HIV-infected individuals identified during the study to inform viral genotype maps of enhanced care community and combination prevention community arms.     Data regarding the magnitude of reduction in HIV incidence with the combination prevention intervention, if a reduction is observed, and the cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention will provide key information for policy and program design about how to most effectively allocate limited resources to eliminate HIV transmission. The study will also provide valuable data about the feasibility and acceptability of scaling up a combination of biologically efficacious interventions to a level that will have impact. Finally, data from this study will be informative o sexual networks and risk groups and the most effective approaches to implementation in different settings, allowing for the design of more targeted treatment and prevention interventions for HIV."
"9265783","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmodium vivax (Pv), the second most important human malaria parasite, causes more than 80 million cases annually including severe, fatal disease. Prevention and control are challenged by emerging drug resistance and relapses from dormant liver stage parasites called hypnozoites. The only therapy against relapse, primaquine, causes life threatening acute hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, the most prevalent human genetic disorder, affecting 8% of people in malaria-endemic nations. This barrier to treatment results in repeated Pv attacks, aggravating the problem of control. The demonstration of high level (100%), long-lasting (at least 12 months) protective efficacy of Sanaria's sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines against Pf malaria is a significant milestone, and indicates that such vaccines will constitute a viable approach to containing and eliminating Pf. We believe that the same vaccine approach could work for Pv. In the development of the Pf vaccines, controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) has been an engine of progress, accelerating the testing of vaccine candidates. Pf CHMI has recently been revolutionized by the development of Sanaria's PfSPZ Challenge, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, fully infectious PfSPZ derived from in vitro cultures of Pf gametocytes, enabling the successful infection of volunteers by intradermal, intramuscular, and intravenous injection in 3 countries in Africa and 2 countries in Europe that had never conducted CHMI before. In contrast, development of Pv SPZ-based products has suffered from lack of available technology to culture Pv parasites in vitro, such that generating infected mosquitoes for CHMI required membrane feeding on fresh, Pv-infected blood from Pv patients. We have now overcome this major limitation by using Pv gametocyte- infected Saimiri boliviensis non-human primates (NHPs) to produce PvSPZ. In fact we are the only laboratory with an inventory of vialed PvSPZ made from NHP-infected blood, having produced as much as 80 million PvSPZ vialed in 1 day from 2,000 mosquitoes. These cryopreserved PvSPZ are 1) infectious to hepatocyte cell lines in vitro in traditional monolayer formats over 3-6 days and in micro-patterned co-cultured primary human hepatocytes over 12-21 days, and 2) infectious to NHPs in vivo. We now propose to produce aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, infectious PvSPZ (PvSPZ Challenge) by using a specific germ free colony of the permissive S. boliviensis as the source for Pv-infected blood. This novel pipeline will generate cGMP-compliant, controlled batches of PvSPZ including a wide variety of primary and clonal Pv lines isolated from humans. This innovation by Sanaria will offer a consistent, quality-controlled stock of cryopreserved PvSPZ to promote well-controlled, reproducible in vitro and in vivo studies in Pv including CHMI. This enabling technology will support the development and testing of anti-Pv drugs and vaccines in CHMIs world-wide, just as PfSPZ Challenge has done for Pf CHMIs. It will also form the basis of a powerful vaccine approach to preventing Pv malaria when administered with anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis, the PvSPZ chemoprophylaxis vaccine (PvSPZ-CVac)."
"9209585","CORE B: Summary Accumulation of inflammatory macrophages is a common feature in the atherosclerotic plaque and the visceral adipose tissue during obesity1, 2. In diabetes, this pathogenic process hinders the regression of atherosclerosis, and in obesity, it promotes insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. The ability to examine plaque and adipose tissue macrophages, and associated changes in gene expression and biochemistry within these macrophage populations during diabetes and diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance are important features of this Program Project. As such, a Core will be established to: (1) Isolate and quantify macrophage subsets, and other immune cell subsets from atherosclerotic plaque and adipose tissue by FACS, and (2) monitor changes in gene expression and metabolic parameters within atherosclerotic plaque and adipose tissue macrophages. These procedures are key to the successful execution of the Aims throughout this Program Project, and centralizing the gene expression analyses, immunohistochemical and biochemical assays will ensure consistency and reproducibility, which in turn will maximize the efficiency and productivity of the scientists within each project."

"9240580","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug users with and at-risk for HIV continue to have poor access to health care and poor treatment outcomes. In addition, opioid addiction involving prescription opioids has skyrocketed. In this proposal for a mid-career investigator award, Dr. Chinazo Cunningham proposes to address the opioid epidemic and its intersection with HIV infection by: 1) becoming an internationally recognized leader in the field of drug abuse and HIV, expanding her research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research [CER] methods and complex clinical trials methods); 2) developing a standardized and structured mentorship approach to mentor junior investigators to conduct patient-oriented research related to drug abuse and/or HIV infection; and 3) becoming an effective leader in academic medicine, ensuring that the institutional infrastructure facilitates junior investigators obtaining skills necessary to become independent investigators. To achieve these goals, Dr. Cunningham will participate in courses and national conferences, have directed readings, and regularly meet with national leaders in related fields. Dr. Cunningham will particularly focus on mentoring women and racial/ethnic minorities-two groups who are under-represented in senior positions in academic medicine and NIH-funded research. Dr. Cunningham will utilize her existing research program as a foundation for which she will provide mentoring and expand her research skills to include CER and complex clinical trials methods. The aims of her research are to: 1) test the efficacy of a 16-week abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention on HIV viral load suppression among opioid-dependent HIV-infected individuals, using a randomized controlled trial design; and 2) examine mechanisms of achieving viral load suppression with the abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention. Dr. Cunningham's future research will include the establishment of a comprehensive live database of all opioid users within a large urban medical center. This database will be used to examine health outcomes associated with types of opioid use and to develop and test interventions focused on opioid use. Dr. Cunningham's long-term career objective is to improve access to care and health outcomes among drug-abusing populations with or at-risk for HIV infection by developing interventions that can reduce their disparities in health care and health."
"9263461","The Data, Biostatistics & Modelling Core will act as a repository for data collected during the field-based projects, enabling efficient linking of epidemiological, molecular, immunological and other biological data measured from the participants. Mathematical models will play an integral role: analysing collected data to generate hypotheses which will be verified or falsified against subsequently collected data. In Project 1: Epidemiology, data collected during the initial cross-sectional surveys in Papau New Guinea, Thailand and Cambodia will be used to inform the design of various surveillance strategies. The potential effectiveness of these strategies as interventions to reduce malaria transmission will be simulated using data driven mathematical models of P. vivax and P. falciparum transmission. The most promising strategies will then be taken forward for testing in field trials. Mathematical models will also make an important contribution to Project 3: Relapse. Samples collected during longitudinal studies will be genotyped to provide a detailed understanding of the dynamics of P. vivax and P. falciparum infection. The combination of epidemiological data and genotyping methods will not allow for definitive classification of P. vivax infections into relapses, re-infections, or recrudescences. Instead, this classification will be done probabilistically using a specially designed within-host mathematical model. This model will generate probabilistic phenotypes which can be compared to a wide range of potential genotypic markers."
"9241418","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette smoking dramatically changes the architecture of the airway epithelium relevant to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the major smoking-induced lung disorder, for which no disease-modifying therapies that reduce mortality are available. The major airway epithelial remodeling (AER) phenotypes induced by cigarette smoking are basal cell (BC) and mucous cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, reduced number of ciliated cells, shorter cilia, and decreased junctional barrier integrity. However, specific mechanisms responsible for common pathogenesis of smoking-associated AER phenotypes in the human airways are unknown. Based on the knowledge that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is altered by cigarette smoke, and our previous observations that EGFR is highly expressed in airway BC, the stem/progenitor cells of airway epithelium, and mediates squamous metaplasia and epithelial leak, we have further focused on the EGFR signaling as a central element in the pathogenesis of all major smoking-induced AER phenotypes. Our preliminary studies have shown that: (1) EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG) is up-regulated in the AER areas of the airway epithelium of smokers and COPD smokers; (2) smoking-associated factors (EGF, TGF-beta, cigarette smoke extract) induce AREG expression in vitro in airway BC undergoing squamous differentiation; (3) AREG, by acting on human airway BC in vitro, promotes AER phenotypes, including BC- and mucous cell hyperplasia, decreased ciliated cell differentiation and junctional barrier integrity; (4) AREG-induced effects are distinct from those evoked by EGF: EGF does not induce hyperplasia, while AREG induces delayed and sustained EGFR activation associated with the maintenance of the receptor on the BC surface; (5) AREG promotes its own expression in airway BC. These data led to central hypothesis of this study, i.e., that up-regulation and unique signaling of AREG in airway BC stem/progenitor cells mediate smoking-induced COPD-relevant remodeling of the airway epithelium. To test this hypothesis, 3 Specific aims are proposed. Aim 1. Identify the common molecular pathways activated in human airway BC by smoking-induced factors responsible for generation of AREG-producing cells and increased AREG expression in the human airway epithelium. Aim 2. Determine specific molecular mechanisms of AREG signaling in airway BC that mediate AREG-induced smoking-associated airway epithelial remodeling (AER) phenotypes. Aim 3. Evaluate the hypothesis that inhibition of mechanisms of AREG up-regulation and signaling in airway BC will prevent or suppress the development of smoking-induced airway epithelial remodeling (AER). If proven correct, this study will provide the basis for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat airway epithelial disordering in COPD by targeting smoking-induced AREG up-regulation and signaling in airway BC stem/progenitor cells."
"9404144","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the inhibition of synaptic vesicle fusion by monomeric alpha-Synuclein (alphaS). This research will establish the foundation for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). There is growing consensus that monomeric alphaS is a central regulatory component of synaptic vesicle trafficking. Although the formation of Lewy bodies, mediated by the aggregation of alphaS into insoluble fibrils, is commonly associated with PD, high levels of alphaS have also been shown to disrupt normal vesicle trafficking and markedly inhibit neurotransmitter release without the formation of alphaS aggregates. Our approach will involve quantitative studies of the biophysical and mechanical properties of synaptic vesicle membranes for which we will combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with a panel of complementary biophysical experiments. A precise understanding of the native interactions between monomeric alphaS and synaptic vesicle membranes will position us to evaluate the protein's role in vesicle trafficking defects as they relate to PD. Limited biophysica data have yielded conflicting views on how alphaS over-expression inhibits vesicle trafficking and fusion in the absence of fibril formation. In multiple model systems from yeast to rodents, an overabundance of alphaS has been shown to stall proper synaptic vesicle cycling at the plasma membrane. One view is that this pathology may be driven by interactions between alphaS and other synaptic or plasma membrane proteins (e.g. SNARES). We propose an alternate view based on recent work both from our labs and others. According to this view, alphaS can directly alter the physical properties of lipids within membranes - namely membrane rigidity and phase. This is achieved in the absence of specific interactions with other proteins. We therefore reason that alphaS might have an intrinsic capacity to control synaptic vesicle fusion. This hypothesis is motivated by our preliminary data and published result from biophysical experiments, which show that alphaS reduces a membrane's rigidity, can alter membrane curvature, and can inhibit fusion of synthetic (otherwise protein-free) lipid vesicles. Our proposed research intimately combines computational modeling with experimental x-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy to bridge a critical gap in understanding how alphaS creates physical barriers to vesicle fusion. The proposed research avenue will provide critical information about PD associated trafficking defects. Ultimately, our work will lead to better understanding of normal and abnormal functions of alphaS and position the community to develop new therapeutic strategies that exploit the native state of the protein (i.e., restoring proper vesicle trafficking."
"9429214","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a global epidemic that greatly increases chronic disease burden. Overeating of highly palatable (HP) foods, especially in the ubiquitous food cue environment and in the context of stressful life events, are known to promote HP food craving, intake and weight gain, but the differential biobehavioral mechanisms underlying these effects is unclear. Using a novel experimental paradigm, promising preliminary results indicated that brief exposure to food cue and to emotional stress increases motivation for and intake of HP snack foods in the laboratory, more so in overweight (OW/OB) than in lean (LN) individuals. Furthermore, OW/OB individuals show altered biological stress and metabolic states with different biobehavioral responses during food cue and stress exposures which predict HP food craving and intake. On the basis of these results, we propose a 5-year experimental study with a prospective 2-year longitudinal follow-up in healthy men and women categorized on the basis of lean (body mass index: BMI<25), overweight (BMI=25-29.9) and obese Class I (BMI=30-35) groups to test the hypothesis that food cue and stress will increase HP food craving and intake, and higher BMI-related metabolic and stress system adaptations will predict HP food motivation and intake, which in turn, will promote future weight gain and obesity. The specific aims are: (1) to examine if exposure to food cue and to stress vs. neutral relaxing cues differentially increase HP food craving, eating topography, emotion, hunger and alters physiological and biochemical responses, and if changes vary across BMI groups; (2) to assess differential increases in HP food intake in each condition and whether it varies as a function of BMI group; (3) to identify whether HP food craving, emotion, hunger, physiological and metabolic responses is predictive of eating topography measures, calories and weight of HP food intake in each condition; (4) to assess whether stress- and food cue-induced HP food craving, intake and laboratory responses are predictive of food motivation, dietary intake and weight gain over the 2-year follow-up period; and (5) to explore the influence of key individual differences variables of cumulative stress, eating patterns, and physical activity on stress and cue-related responses and food intake in the laboratory and on motivation for HP food intake in the two-year follow-up period. Successful completion of the project will lead to an innovative and valid method to model of HP food craving and intake in the laboratory, which may be utilized for testing novel intervention strategies to decrease high levels of food motivation, overeating and obesity risk."
"9311354","ALL blood-wetted devices, without exaggeration, are susceptible to unintended thrombosis and bleeding ? with dire consequences. In spite of decades of clinical experience, basic research, and computational fluid dynamics modeling, it is still virtually impossible to avoid deleterious hematological effects without experimental trail-and-error. In fact, in recent years, the incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic adverse events in ventricular assist devices (VADs) has increased, not decreased. The unfortunate consequence is an unacceptable rate of debilitating adverse events such as stroke and hemorrhage. This has motivated the PI and colleagues over the past two decades to develop an accurate, computational model to simulate the process of thrombus deposition on artificial surfaces. The computer simulation is unique in its ability to account for physical and biological phenomena on multiple-scales, including the trafficking of red blood cells and platelets in small spaces, synthesis and transport of chemical agonists, and several pathways for positive- and negative feedback of platelet adhesion to artificial surfaces. The current model has demonstrated excellent agreement with experimental observations in microfluidic channels and the HeartMate-2 blood pump.  The objective of this competitive renewal is to continue improvement of the versatility of this model, and to demonstrate its translation to full-scale blood-wetted devices. The two Specific Aims of this study are: SA1, to improve the fidelity of the model by adding important mechanisms of platelet disaggregation, thrombolysis, and von Willebrand mediated platelet adhesion; and SA2, to demonstrate and further validate the performance of the model with contemporary blood pumps and oxygenators in clinical use.  Successful completion of these aims will yield a comprehensive computational model for thrombosis in blood-wetted devices, which we believe will contribute to the inevitable paradigm shift in developing these devices: replacing trial-and-error with prescriptive quantitative methods. Combined with computer optimization, the use of this model will greatly accelerate development of safe and effective new devices, and will reduce the occurrence of adverse complications. We also envision that the models will also be used forensically to analyze thrombosis-related adverse events, and help guide management of anticoagulation therapy."
"9249101","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nuclear lamina is important for maintaining nuclear architecture, chromatin organization, and gene expression. Mutations in lamin genes cause a wide variety of diseases called laminopathies. While tremendous gains have been made in understanding the molecular basis of these rare diseases, mechanistic links between the mutation's location and resulting disease phenotype are largely unknown. Furthermore, these gains have been made from relatively few mutations characterized mostly in mouse models. This project aims to increase our understanding of laminopathic mutations by developing a novel, high-throughput platform for characterizing nuclear defects using recent advances in RNA-guided, gene-editing technology and clinically relevant human cardiomyocyte models. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on developing a label-free, microarray platform to easily screen the nuclear defects of a subset of mutations linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) using an over-expression human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell model. This platform will set the stage for Aim 2 where a large library of lamin A (LMNA) mutations - generated by error-prone PCR and an inducible gene editable cell line - will be screened for nuclear defects. In Aim 3, pure cardiomyocytes differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) will be used to study adenovirus-mediated overexpression of laminopathic mutations and endogenously generated laminopathic mutations. These cardiomyocyte models will validate results obtained from Aims 1 and 2 and also be used to test several reported therapeutic strategies."
"9263366","Malaria diagnosis and infection characterization have definitively moved into the molecular era. Gone are the days of microscopy alone for determining malaria infection. Molecular diagnosis is no longer just a research technique used on a limited number of samples; it has moved to a high-throughput method used for standard detection of the important sub-microscopic malaria infection pool. This proposal completely eschews microscopic diagnosis and instead will require molecular testing of more than 150,000 samples over the course of seven years for detecting malaria infections. In addition to identifying individuals with asexual forms of the malaria parasite in peripheral blood, molecular techniques will be used for to determine which infection characteristics are potentially infectious (Project 2, Transmission Reservoirs) and which characteristics are associated with different levels of disease severity (Project 3, The Pathogenesis Spectrum). For Project 2, the Molecular and Genomics Core will use molecular methods to measure the levels of asexual as well as sexual parasites and also to determine whether male and female gametocytes are present in the same sample (both are required to propagate infection). For Project 3, the Molecular and Genomics Core will be measuring various parasite characteristics, including growth rate and genetic complexity, both of which could influence disease severity. The continued presence of the Molecular and Genomics Core is justified by the volume of the standard molecular assays required, as well as the need for more sophisticated characterization of infections. By supporting each of the three scientific projects with timely and accurate results, the Molecular and Genomics Core will be a vital contributor to the overall scientific success of the proposal."
"9246456","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MDM2 is an important cancer-related protein that induces cancer cell survival and progression through both p53-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. In previous investigations of the p53-independent role of MDM2, we found that the oncoprotein MDM2 can increase the expression of the anti-apoptotic factor XIAP through binding of MDM2's RING domain to the XIAP IRES mRNA, inducing its translational activity. Our preliminary studies for this renewal application demonstrated that when XIAP IRES bound to the MDM2 RING domain protein, MDM2 protein stabilization increased. Based on these findings, we believe that the binding action between XIAP IRES and the RING domain of MDM2 can simultaneously increase expression of XIAP and MDM2, through activation of IRES-dependent translation and by inhibition of protein degradation, respectively. In cancer cells, increased expression of both MDM2 and XIAP may aid cancer progression or resistance to anticancer treatment. Accordingly, we hypothesized that inhibition of this molecular interaction would result in a simultaneous decrease in the expression of both MDM2 and XIAP, leading to not only suppression of the cancer, but a reversal of drug resistance during therapy. The goals of this project are: to identify small molecule inhibitors that can disrupt the MDM2 protein/XIAP IRES interaction, to characterize whether the identified MDM2/XIAP inhibitors are able to induce MDM2 self-ubiquitination and degradation as well as inhibition of XIAP translation, and to ascertain the potential use of the identified inhibitors as new drugs able to treat refractory cancer patients. Specifically, Aim 1 is to perform HTS to select small-molecule compounds that block or disrupt the interaction between XIAP IRES mRNA and the RING domain protein of MDM2; Aim 2 will investigate how selected MDM2/XIAP inhibitors disrupt that interaction at the molecular level and find the mechanism of action by which the inhibitor targets MDM2 degradation. For Aim 3, we will examine the effects of MDM2 degradation and inhibition of XIAP translation by selected compounds on cancer cell growth and apoptosis in vitro, plus perform translational studies in animal models to ascertain these identified compounds as clinically viable anticancer drugs. Because a significant number of cancer patients have malignant cells that are overexpressing MDM2 and XIAP and their survival remains poor, we hope our studies will lead directly to the discovery of several useful new drugs to treat these refractory cancer patients."
"9251733","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (Sz) is associated with deficits in cognitive function that represent a core feature of the disorder. Traditional dopaminergic models stress dysfunction within higher order associational brain regions. In contrast, more recent glutamatergic models predict widespread dysfunction across cortical regions, including primary and secondary sensory cortices. Over the past project period, we have documented deficits in early auditory and visual processing in Sz using behavioral-, event-related potential (ERP) and MRI-based approaches, supporting distributed models of cortical dysfunction in Sz. In addition, we have demonstrated significant contributions of early sensory processing deficits to higher order cortical impairments. These studies have permitted us to formulate specific hypotheses concerning neural mechanisms underlying sensory/cognitive dysfunction in Sz, as well as novel approaches to potential treatment development. In the auditory system, early deficits include impaired ability to match tones following brief delay, as well as impaired generation of mismatch negativity (MMN), auditory N1 and auditory steady-state (ASSR) responses. Furthermore, deficits in low level auditory processing contribute to higher order dysfunction, such as impaired ability to interpret prosody, leading to deficits in auditory emotion recognition (AER), which, in turn, contributes to impaired social function. In the visual system, deficits include reduced contrast sensitivity particularly to low contrast, low spatial frequency (LSF) stimuli that preferentially engage the magnocellular visual system, as well as impaired generation of steady state visual evoked potentials (ssVEP), visual P1, and impaired fMRI activation of magnocellular-recipient regions of primary visual cortex. Low level deficits contribute to higher order impairments including in perceptual closure and face emotion recognition (FER). Both auditory and visual deficits contribute to progressive impairment in reading ability, which may be an early marker of Sz. Finally, both auditory and visual deficits correlate with impaired structura and functional connectivity within low level sensory regions, as assessed using diffusion tensor (DTI) and resting state (rsfMRI) imaging. To date, neurophysiological abnormalities have been assessed mainly using time-domain approaches. Over the upcoming period, we will incorporate advanced frequency-domain and oscillatory hierarchical approaches as well, which provide separate indices of spontaneous and event-related dynamics of neuronal oscillations. Visual ERP will be combined with eye tracking to permit evaluation of naturalistic scene processing. We will also explore patterns of dysfunction within both prodromal and first episode (FE) cohorts using paradigms validated during our prior grant cycle. Finally, we will incorporate novel brain stimulation approaches including Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) applied over sensory vs. frontal cortical regions to disrupt local processing in healthy controls as a model for Sz; and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied over sensory or frontal brain regions as a prelude to plasticity-based stimulatory intervention in Sz."

"9428395","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed implementation research addresses a longstanding and vexing problem in behavioral health care: Access to integrated services for persons with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders. Despite decades of awareness of this problem, at present, less than 10% of treated patients with co-occurring disorders receive evidence-based integrated services. Implementation science holds to key to addressing this persistent gap. The present study unifies and operationalizes three major implementation research heuristics: the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, the Stages of Implementation Completion, and the Proctor et al (2011) taxonomy of implementation outcomes. Developed by industrial engineers, a multi-faceted implementation strategy, NIATx, has proven to be effective in implementing and sustaining simple interventions in behavioral health care services. The overarching goal of this project is to test whether NIATx strategies are effective in implementing a complex evidence-based intervention: Integrated services for persons with co-occurring disorders. Promising pilot data suggest that NIATx actually can integrate services, but a more rigorous study is needed. We now take this step and herein propose a cluster randomized wait-list control group design, in which a cohort of 23 agencies receive the active NIATx approach while the other cohort of 23 agencies are waitlisted. In the second phase, the wait-list group of 23 agencies participates in NIATx and the initial group enters a sustainment phase. Hypothesized to install and sustain integrated services, NIATx is examined for effectiveness on two core implementation outcomes: fidelity and penetration, as well as patient care outcomes (psychiatric and substance use symptom reduction). Variation in the extent of and fidelity to which NIATx strategies are delivered are evaluated using the NIATx Fidelity Scale, which embeds the Stages of Implementation Completion measure. Primary outcomes are assessed at pre- implementation, post-implementation and at sustainment follow-up periods. Qualitative and economic analyses augment the quantitative data, and add to the interpretation of organizational and social dynamics, as well as resource costs. We assemble a multi-disciplinary research team with considerable and complementary expertise and experience. Capitalizing on a technically sophisticated clinical management information capacity across a state system of care (Washington), the study engages representative outpatient programs across 20 counties. Consistent with US data, the participating agencies and their key stakeholders are highly motivated to improve services for patients with co-occurring disorders. Practical implementation strategies, including their associated costs, and the measurable impact on services and patient outcomes, will be definitive research products. Findings from this robust study are immediately applicable to improve clinical services, to advance implementation research, and ultimately, to guide future implementations with other behavioral health systems and settings."
"9209589","Project 1: Summary The relationship between diabetes and atherosclerosis is well established. Indeed, people with diabetes are overwhelmingly likely to suffer from coronary heart disease (CHD). Though the relative risk of CHD falls with statin treatment of diabetics, the absolute risk remains elevated compared to non-diabetics, consistent with our finding in animal models that diabetes impairs plaque regression after lipid lowering. In Project 1, we propose to use these models to determine how diabetes maintains in atherosclerotic plaques high levels of macrophages and their inflammatory state despite aggressive reductions in hyperlipidemia. A major goal is to determine the kinetic bases for the increased content of plaque macrophages in diabetic atherosclerotic mice after lipid reduction. The possibilities include changes in the recruitment of monocytes to the plaques, the retention or chemostasis of plaque macrophages, the degree of macrophage apoptosis or efferocytosis, and the proliferation of macrophages in the plaques. We will extend our initial studies in mice with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) and insulin-resistance (IR) as a model of the IR, high-CHD risk states (metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes), prevalent in the US population. We will also test the roles of candidate factors in the maladaptive macrophage responses to diabetes despite lipid lowering. These include netrin-1, a macrophage retention molecule (also to be studied in adipose tissue under Project 2), RAGE, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (which we find also promotes macrophage retention), and ACSL1, an inflammatory factor induced by hyperglycemia. For the first 2, we will explore their translational potential. We will also employ unbiased, genome-based, bioinformatic approaches to uncover new factors/pathways that regulate macrophage content and inflammation not only in plaques, but in combination with Projects 2 and 3, also in adipose tissue in DIO mice."

"9351398","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major determinant of mortality and morbidity in hospitalized veterans. Understanding the pathophysiology of AKI is essential for the development of therapy. This application proposes to study the role of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) in AKI. This protein is expressed exclusively in the kidney by cells of the thick ascending limbs (TAL) of Henle. In the last funding cycle, we uncovered a key role of THP in mediating a protective tubular cross-talk in AKI. We showed that THP regulates inflammatory signaling and injury to S3 segments, which are neighboring tubules to TAL in the kidney outer medulla. The immediate goal of the current proposal is to study the importance of the interaction of THP with S3 segments in regulating neutrophil infiltration in AKI. These studies will form the basis to transition into therapeutic applications. Indeed, the PI's long term goal is to understand how the role of THP can be modulated to treat veterans who develop AKI. The central hypothesis is that Tamm-Horsfall protein regulates the inflammatory response triggered by ischemic injury in the outer medulla; an effect that requires an interaction of THP with the surrounding tubular elements. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary and published data. The following specific aims will be used to investigate this hypothesis. Aim 1 will investigate the role of THP as a key regulator of neutrophil infiltration in the kidney after AKI. Aim 2 will study specific inflammatory pathways regulated by THP in the neighboring epithelium during kidney injury Aim 2 will investigate therapeutic modulation of THP to inhibit neutrophil influx and promote recovery after AKI This research will involve the use of THP knockout and wild type mice. The animal model used for AKI is renal ischemia-reperfusion injury achieved through renal pedicle clamping. Other techniques used in this work include: Immunofluorescence laser micro-dissection of specific tubular sections, Immunofluoresence confocal and intravital microscopy, flow cytometry, real time-PCR, western blot, various forms of chromatography and mass spectrometry. This research is innovative, because it will uncover novel regulatory functions for THP that may be relevant not only in kidney injury but also in other forms of acute or chronic renal disease. Future strategies that enhance the role of THP in the kidney will be of important therapeutic significance."
"9274291","Abstract/Summary Core B: Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting Core. The initiation and progression of events leading to type 1 and type 2 diabetes is accompanied by alterations in multiple cell types within the subject. Characterization, tracking and isolation of those cell populations by DRC investigators are enabled by the instruments and expertise available in the Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting Core. Purpose: The Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting Core assists investigators whose research requires the characterization of molecular markers in dispersed cells and/or the isolation of cells based on those markers. The Core provides the following services that is currently averaging 5501 accesses and 9419 cytometry/sorting hours by 143 researchers in 20 DRC laboratories:  1. Flow Cytometry. Five high-speed, multi-laser flow cytometers and analysis programs with highly complementary capabilities are available to meet DRC demand for cell characterization.  2. Cell Sorting. Six high-speed, multi-laser fluorescence activated cell sorters enable DRC investigators to isolate cell populations that can then be extensively characterized molecularly or that may be re-introduced to host animals to examine the effect of those cells on disease progression.  3. Information and Training. The Core trains investigators on the proper use of equipment and provides advice on the application of the technology. Benefits to DRC Community: The Core accelerates diabetes research by providing DRC investigators with access to advanced technologies and operational expertise that are beyond the abilities of individual laboratories to maintain. 39 NIH-funded and 31 other diabetes-related projects totaling $13,640,397 annual direct costs have benefited from the practical and economic access to this highly needed technology. Technology Development: Few laboratories have the resources to develop the most advanced capabilities to realize the full potential of the instruments. Support from the DRC enables one Core staff member to spend up to one day a week developing advanced capabilities that the DRC Executive Committee finds to be required by large numbers of DRC investigators. For example, new spectral analysis capabilities on advanced instruments not yet publicly available are now being developed in the Core to increase the accuracy and number of channels available for the analysis of specific cellular populations during disease progression.  In the past three years, this Core has been successfully consolidated with other UCSF cytometry and cell sorting facilities to coordinate equipment procurement, expand instrument access and enhance staff availability. A robust co-pay mechanism ensures that DRC support is channeled to diabetes research in an institution-wide Core that provides access to a much greater degree of complementary instrumentation at lowered costs through the defraying of Core maintenance and personnel costs over a larger user base.."
"9252507","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in women. Psychosocial stress increases CVD and CVD risk factors in women and female cynomolgus monkeys, and leads to depression and ovarian dysfunction which are especially important CVD risk factors for women. Environmental stimuli that affect CV health are initially processed by the brain which is nutrition-sensitive, modulates the function of downstream stress-sensitive systems, and may be structurally different in CVD patients. Importantly, most of the data demonstrating stress effects on CVD have been derived from subjects consuming a Western diet. In contrast, prudent diet consumption is associated with decreases in risk of depression, infertility, traditional CVD risk factors, and CVD. Emerging experimental data suggest that certain characteristics of a Western diet exacerbate physiological and behavioral stress responses, and these acute effects reflect associations linking Western diet consumption with perceived stress in population studies. Thus, psychosocial stress effects on CVD/CAA risk may not be simply main effects of stress; they may reflect diet-exacerbated stress reactivity. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that psychosocial stress-associated CVD risk is due in part to Western diet exacerbation of stress reactivity; therefore, consumption of a Prudent diet will reduce physiological stress reactivity an mitigate the deleterious effects of psychosocial stress on CVD risk. Behavioral and physiological indicators of stress and depression, food consumption and activity levels, CVD risk factors, body composition, tissue gene expression, and volumetric and other measures of key neural regions will be assessed in adult female monkeys at Baseline, and after 18 and 36 months of a Western or Prudent diet. Atherosclerosis will be measured in iliac, carotid and coronary arteries. The aims are to determine the effects of Western and Prudent diets on 1) physiological responses to an acute stressor, 2) physiological and behavioral indices of chronic stress, 3) CVD risk, atherosclerosis and artery gene expression, and 4) structural characteristics of key neural regions in socially stressed subordinate and dominant monkeys. This is a more invasive and detailed investigation of behavioral, physiological, and pathological effects of diet than can be conducted in human studies and the data from this model are more amenable to clinical translation than other animal models. If successful, the proposed studies will demonstrate that a Prudent diet can ameliorate some deleterious effects of psychosocial stress on CVD risk, and thus provide a cost-effective intervention on psychological stress with the promise of wide-spread efficacy."
"9278441","PROJECT 3 SUMMARY (Manipulation of sperm-specific proteases using genetic and chemical approaches) The overall goals of Project 3 are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of male reproductive tract-specific serine protease-like enzymes through the use of genetics and chemical biology, and to use these data to guide discovery of novel non-hormonal contraceptive agents. Biological targets ideal for drug discovery endeavors are those with significant and non-redundant biological effects, highly specific molecular functions, and biochemical features amenable to molecular inhibition. No single definitive methodology exists for the identification or validation of efficacious drug targets, and certainly the processes of evolution are not driven to yield numerous physiologically vulnerable pathways, particularly for contraception. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing fertility as well as an approach that samples a wide array of intervention points is desirable. As a complement to targets emerging from Projects 1 and 2, Project 3 will focus on the genetic and chemical analyses of five serine protease-like enzymes with expression limited to the male reproductive tract. These mechanistic studies will allow us to place these serine protease-like enzymes into reproductive pathways and simultaneously determine the utility of each of these proteins as a contraceptive target. Early studies of the sperm-zona pellucida interaction assumed that enzymes contained within the sperm acrosome were required for penetration of cumulus cell layers and the zona pellucida. More recently, it has become apparent that whereas the exocytotic event associated with release of acrosomal enzymes (during the acrosome reaction) is essential for fertilization, it is neither induced by contact with the zona pellucida, nor required to occur in proximity of the outer vestments of the oocyte. Similarly, motile sperm are essential for successful fertilization. Our overall hypothesis is that serine protease-like enzymes are a novel class of proteins required for male fertility and the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors for these spermatogenic-required enzymes will lead to the development of unique male contraceptives. Our Specific Aims are as follows: 1) Use CRISPR/Cas9 models of male reproductive tract-specific proteases to clarify their requirement in reproduction; 2) Aid in the expression and purification of recombinant proteins from Projects 1, 2, and 3 for DNA-encoded chemistry technology (DEC- Tec) affinity selections; and 3) Use DEC-Tec to uncover small-molecule probes and inhibitors of novel serine protease-like enzymes required for fertility and evaluate early drug-like leads and analogues with acceptable pharmacokinetic properties in proof-of-concept contraceptive studies in vivo."

"9278438","PROJECT SUMMARY - DNA-Encoded Chemistry Technology (DEC-Tec) Core The overall goals of the DNA-Encoded Chemistry Technology (DEC-Tec) Core are to use DNA-encoded small-molecule libraries to cost-effectively identify specific drug-like probes and preclinical candidates to target reproductive tract-specific proteins for a contraceptive effect, and to empower our academic biologists to translate their fundamental science into next generation non-hormonal contraceptives for men and women. The discovery of new contraceptive medicines to treat rampant population growth and prevent unplanned pregnancies is one of the most challenging scientific and healthcare problems of our time. A major roadblock is the cost to develop new medicines. The preclinical phase of drug discovery, which utilizes high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies and extensive medicinal chemistry, typically takes >4 years and cost >$20 million for each drug campaign. These costs are untenable in academia and unsustainable in industry for many therapeutic areas. To overcome this hurdle in academic drug discovery, this NIH P01 grant takes advantage of DNA-encoded chemical libraries, a unique resource available at BCM. DEC-Tec has emerged as an alternative technology for ligand discovery that addresses the limitations and economic shortcomings of HTS. DEC-Tec samples chemical space on an unprecedented scale by allowing interrogation of >1,000-fold more molecular species (1 billion compounds in our DEC-Tec libraries to date compared to 1 million compounds in the ?best? HTS collections), resulting in the direct determination of high-affinity ligands and structure?activity relationships for our contraceptive targets. In this P01 grant, our DEC-Tec Core will interrogate novel collections of 3 billion DNA-encoded drug-like molecules to identify drug-like compounds that possess physiochemical characteristics well-suited for rapid progression to preclinical evaluation. Further optimization can be achieved using our X-ray Crystallography and Drug Metabolism facilities. Our overall hypothesis is that DEC-Tec will allow us to rapidly and cost-effectively identify multiple drug-like molecules that are directed at essential spermatogenic-specific and fertilization-specific proteins, and thereby to create an assortment of unique contraceptives for men and women. The three Projects will utilize the DEC-Tec Core equally. The DEC-Tec Core will promote the concept of ?Target Action Teams? in which Project scientists work side-by-side with DEC-Tec leadership, selection scientists, chemists, and cheminformatics staff to review in vitro and in vivo findings for each drug-like molecule tested. These Target Action Teams will be accountable for designing and prosecuting the compound discovery campaign and progressing drug-like leads through additional optimization and testing. The DEC-Tec Core will provide our P01 scientists with a unique and cost- effective drug discovery resource to produce non-hormonal chemical probes and preclinical drug candidates that will positively transform the discovery of contraceptives and help to contain world-wide population growth."

"9389130","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The birth of the University of Washington School of Medicine in the early 1950's coincides with the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. As a founding component, the Medical Genetics Training Program has kept apace of genetic advances and has served as the linchpin between the clinical and molecular sciences that has propelled this institution to a position of academic leadership. The Training Program's graduates have made outstanding contributions to the body of knowledge of genetic disease and occupy top faculty positions throughout the international medical genetics research community. The Medical Genetics Training Program is coordinated with the separately administered Medical Genetics Residency, which is the primary, but not the only, recruitment vehicle for fellows entering this Program. The Program offers comprehensive research and continuing didactic training in human genetics for physicians following completion of the residency in clinical genetics, and for Ph.D.'s in the basic sciences who seek a broader and translational appreciation of medical genetics. Training focuses on highly collaborative mentor-based, research laboratory experience and is complemented with courses, seminars, clinical conferences, a journal club, and participation in national meetings. The Program emphasizes recruitment of underrepresented minority fellows and has taken the lead in the university-wide instruction in the responsible conduct of research. The forty-one participating faculty are primarily drawn from the two Medical Genetics units in each of the Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, but also consist of productive and talented mentors performing relevant research and teaching in other departments, most of whom have joint appointments with the Division of Medical Genetics in the Department of Medicine. Only about one half of the twenty-nine fellows participating in the Training Program in the most recent funding cycle, including all physicians who have completed the Medical Genetics Residency, have been supported through one of the four funded positions per year on this grant, necessitating a requested increase to six funded positions per year. As they progress, trainees are encouraged to seek individual fellowship awards. The Program continues in its successful mission of launching independent, research-focused careers in medical genetics."
"8908263","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (Sz) is associated with deficits in cognitive function that represent a core feature of the disorder. Traditional dopaminergic models stress dysfunction within higher order associational brain regions. In contrast, more recent glutamatergic models predict widespread dysfunction across cortical regions, including primary and secondary sensory cortices. Over the past project period, we have documented deficits in early auditory and visual processing in Sz using behavioral-, event-related potential (ERP) and MRI-based approaches, supporting distributed models of cortical dysfunction in Sz. In addition, we have demonstrated significant contributions of early sensory processing deficits to higher order cortical impairments. These studies have permitted us to formulate specific hypotheses concerning neural mechanisms underlying sensory/cognitive dysfunction in Sz, as well as novel approaches to potential treatment development. In the auditory system, early deficits include impaired ability to match tones following brief delay, as well as impaired generation of mismatch negativity (MMN), auditory N1 and auditory steady-state (ASSR) responses. Furthermore, deficits in low level auditory processing contribute to higher order dysfunction, such as impaired ability to interpret prosody, leading to deficits in auditory emotion recognition (AER), which, in turn, contributes to impaired social function. In the visual system, deficits include reduced contrast sensitivity particularly to low contrast, low spatial frequency (LSF) stimuli that preferentially engage the magnocellular visual system, as well as impaired generation of steady state visual evoked potentials (ssVEP), visual P1, and impaired fMRI activation of magnocellular-recipient regions of primary visual cortex. Low level deficits contribute to higher order impairments including in perceptual closure and face emotion recognition (FER). Both auditory and visual deficits contribute to progressive impairment in reading ability, which may be an early marker of Sz. Finally, both auditory and visual deficits correlate with impaired structura and functional connectivity within low level sensory regions, as assessed using diffusion tensor (DTI) and resting state (rsfMRI) imaging. To date, neurophysiological abnormalities have been assessed mainly using time-domain approaches. Over the upcoming period, we will incorporate advanced frequency-domain and oscillatory hierarchical approaches as well, which provide separate indices of spontaneous and event-related dynamics of neuronal oscillations. Visual ERP will be combined with eye tracking to permit evaluation of naturalistic scene processing. We will also explore patterns of dysfunction within both prodromal and first episode (FE) cohorts using paradigms validated during our prior grant cycle. Finally, we will incorporate novel brain stimulation approaches including Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) applied over sensory vs. frontal cortical regions to disrupt local processing in healthy controls as a model for Sz; and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied over sensory or frontal brain regions as a prelude to plasticity-based stimulatory intervention in Sz."
"9257437","Abstract: Primary cilia are microtubule-based cellular projections that play an essential role in developmental signaling pathways, particularly the development of the central nervous system. Defects in cilia formation and structure are associated with a broad spectrum of human genetic diseases disrupt a variety of tissues, including the brain and CNS. The importance of cilia in human health is now well established, however a number of important questions remain, including how cilia assembly is regulated, and whether cilia mediate pathways important for tissue homeostasis in adults in addition to their role in regulating developmental signaling pathways. To begin to address these questions, I will make use of a unique ENU-induced mouse mutant I have begun to characterize during my postdoctoral studies, which is a null allele of Tau tubulin kinase 2 (Ttbk2). We found using this allele that Ttbk2 is required for ciliogenesis, and independent studies linked Ttbk2 to the human neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11). To further examine the link between cilia and neural development and disease I will: (1) Define the pathway in which TTBK2 acts to control cilia formation; (2) Identify additional substrates of TTBK2 important in cilia formation; and (3) Characterize the requirements for TTBK2 and TTBK1 in the nervous system. The mentored phase of this award will be carried out at Sloan-Kettering Institute (SKI) under the mentorship of Dr. Kathryn Anderson. During this phase, I will have the opportunity to complement my strong foundation in developmental genetics by gaining experience in biochemistry and in neurobiology. In this period, I will use cell biological, biochemical and proteomic approaches to identify substrates of Ttbk2 required for ciliogenesis (Aims 1 and 2) with guidance from two SKI faculty members, Drs. Bryan Tsou and Prasad Jallepalli, who have agreed to serve on my advisory committee. Also during this period, I will use conditional alleles of Ttbk1 and Ttbk2 to analyze developmental phenotypes within the CNS, focusing on the cerebellum, the tissue affected in SCA11 (Aim 3), with guidance from my third advisory committee member, Dr. Alexandra Joyner, who is a leading expert on the development of the cerebellum. During the independent phase of the grant, I will continue to define the developmental phenotypes of the Ttbk2 and Ttbk1 conditional mutants and use the conditional alleles to examine the requirements for these genes in the adult nervous system. In this analysis I will test whether the phenotypes of Ttbk conditional mutants are due to disruptions in ciliary signaling by comparing these phenotypes to those of conditional mutants of Ift88 and Kif3a, two proteins essential for ciliogenesis. Thus through these studies, I will further define the requirements for cilia in the CNS as well as examine the cellular basis of a human neurodegenerative disorder, SCA11."
"9268405","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with substance use disorders require a multi-pronged therapeutic approach incorporating behavioral interventions and medications; however, cocaine use disorder, a major public health concern in the U.S., is without an FDA-approved medication. At the core of severe cocaine use disorder is an undeniable compulsion toward drug-seeking and -taking that has been linked to cocaine-induced, long-term plasticity in key brain circuits resulting in a propensity towards relapse, even after years of abstinence. Compelling preclinical evidence suggests that decreased serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR) signaling during withdrawal from cocaine self-administration promotes relapse phenomena. Therefore, restoration of 5-HT2CR signaling capacity during the critical stages of withdrawal provides the conceptual framework for the development of pharmacotherapies to treat cocaine use disorder. We hypothesize that rationally designed positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) will selectively enhance 5-HT2CR function and provide the necessary structure-activity relationship (SAR) data required for structural optimization toward the development of neuroprobes for elucidating 5-HT2CR signaling and medications for cocaine use disorder. We aim to utilize our well-established, cell-based calcium release assay as a primary readout of positive modulation at the 5-HT2CR and establish a strategy that affords unparalleled improvements in selectivity by targeting the topologically distinct allosteric site, as opposed to the conserved orthosteric site. Our previous studies have provided several selective 5-HT2CR PAMs and established project feasibility. The project will benefit greatly from the collection of SAR data and structural optimization of novel pharmacophores that have not been extensively explored toward the goal of generating small molecule neuroprobes and preclinical candidates. The proposed innovative project will expand the current knowledge of 5-HT2CR function and has a foreseeable high impact translational value with the potential to produce a first-in-class pharmacotherapy toward the treatment of cocaine and other psychostimulant use disorders. The applicant has designed the described project and individual training plan to incorporate the necessary interdisciplinary skills and knowledge required to secure a postdoctoral appointment and to subsequently become a successful, independent investigator at the university level with a research focus on the design, synthesis, and pharmacological characterization of molecular probes and therapeutics for substance use disorders. Specifically, completion of the aims will afford the applicant with the following skills: synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry; cell culture and cell-based assays; experimental design and chemical/pharmacological characterization of small molecules; G protein-coupled receptor targeting; the fundamentals of drug discovery in the allosteric modulation, neurobiology and the psychostimulant addiction fields; preclinical models; and important skills such as project design, grant and manuscript writing, networking, teamwork, and oral presentation skills."
"9256641","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT How dominant mutations in glycyl tRNA synthetase (GARS) cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type 2D (CMT2D) peripheral neuropathy is still unclear and controversial. The technical challenge of studying the mammalian peripheral axon in vivo has contributed to the lack of a disease mechanism. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how mutations in ubiquitously expressed GARS lead to the specific and progressive degeneration of peripheral axons. The immediate objective is to use an in vivo, cell type- and compartment-specific approach to test the hypothesis that mutations in Gars cause impaired translation in two mouse models of CMT2D. Evidence points to a toxic gain-of-function of mutant GARS as the cause of neuropathy, but a dominant negative mechanism has not been ruled out. In Drosophila, overexpression of human mutant GARS in peripheral neurons causes neurodegeneration and reduced translation without altering aminoacylation. Because at least four other tRNA synthetases are linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth, impaired translation is an attractive potential disease mechanism, and its detailed testing through the following experiments will further elucidate the gain-of function vs. dominant negative question: 1) We will test the hypothesis that mutant GARS impairs translation in motor neurons using two in vivo, cell type-specific techniques; non-canonical amino acid-tagging (NCAT) will provide the location, identity, and quantity of newly translated proteins, and ribosome-tagging will catalog ribosome-associated RNA. Motor neuron cell bodies are gathered from the spinal cord and axons from the sciatic nerve, providing cell compartment-specificity. Although local translation in adult, mammalian axons has not been established, it is required for normal regeneration after injury and preliminary data show that ribosomes are present and associated with mRNA in motor axons of the sciatic nerve. Wild-type sciatic nerve controls will be used to establish axonal translation. 2) We will test the hypothesis that translational impairments are independent of transcriptional changes. Thiouracil (4-TU)-tagging, a third in vivo, cell type-specific technique, will be used to catalog newly transcribed RNA in motor neuron cell bodies and newly transported RNA in axons. 3) Finally, we will test the hypothesis that mutant Gars axons attempt regeneration, but fail because of impairments in translation. NCAT, ribosome-, and 4-TU-tagging will be performed using wild-type regenerating motor neurons and the data compared to Gars mutant samples. The proposed experiments will test a hypothesized disease mechanism and uncover new motor neuron biology. Their completion will result in a comprehensive profile of translation and transcription in CMT2D, wild-type, and regenerating wild-type motor neuron cell bodies and axons. Identifying local translation in peripheral axons will represent a departure from the current model of axonal homeostasis, revealing the axon as a cell compartment with unique translational needs and its own ways of meeting them. Dependence of axons on local translation could explain their sensitivity to mutations in tRNA synthetases."
"9232898","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Loss of dopamine neurons leads to many of the clinical features of Parkinson disease (PD) but does not account for the progression of critical axial motor features, including postural instabiliy and gait impairments that tend to be refractory to dopaminergic medications and play a large role in disability. We recently published cross-sectional findings linking cardiovascular risk factors with the rate of axial motor feature accrual in PD. This effect was partially explained by the severity of chronic microvascular pathology, measured as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) seen on brain MRI. If microvascular brain pathologies are responsible for causing medication-refractory motor impairments in PD, the early identification and treatment of high-risk subjects using targeted cardiovascular risk factor reduction interventions has the potential to serve as a disease modifying strategy impacting the health care of many Veterans with PD, in whom cardiovascular comorbidities are seen more commonly. In order to design effective clinical trials aimed at lowering complications due to comorbid microvascular brain pathology, however, a more detailed understanding of the mechanistic link between cardiovascular risk factors and clinically meaningful outcomes is essential. I propose to study the impact of cardiovascular risk factors and microvascular brain pathology on axial motor features in a 2-year longitudinal cohort study of individuals with early Parkinson disease. Aim 1 will test a longitudinal hypothesis drawn from our preliminary cross-sectional data: PD patients with greater baseline cardiovascular risk factor burden develop more rapid progression of axial motor features and greater WMH burden at 2 year follow-up. Aim 2 will use arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI to identify regional impairments in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CvRC) in early PD subjects with cardiovascular risk factors before the progression to irreversible microvascular injury takes place. These studies will not only serve as a novel natural  history study of microvascular changes in PD, they will also facilitate the identification of PD subjects at highest risk for comorbid microvascular changes, permitting the design of a future intervention trial focused on targeted, early cardiovascular risk factor reduction. The goal of thi potential disease modifying strategy would be to slow the rate of medically refractory axial motor feature accrual in Veterans with PD. If successful, this approach would have implications for other neurodegenerative conditions as well. The practical experience of this project along with the formal training plan in neuroimaging, epidemiology, and clinical trials methodology included in this CDA-2 proposal will facilitate my career growth into a MERIT-funded clinician-investigator who aims to usher novel therapeutic strategies into the realm of PD clinical trials."
"9306484","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in understanding the specific speech contexts in which perception predicts production in children with speech sound disorder (SSD). This gap critically hampers our ability to design efficacious treatments for these children. The long-term goal is to specify how speech perception impacts speech production in children with SSD, and to contribute to the development of evidence-based assessment and intervention for these children. The overall objective of this application is to learn how perception of systematically-varied consonantal contrasts in different contexts predicts and facilitates speech production in 4- and 5-year old children with different profiles of SSD. The central hypothesis is that children with SSD and concomitant language impairment (LI) have less detailed underlying phonological representations in general than children with SSD-only; we expect children with SSD+LI to experience difficulties perceiving a wide range of consonantal contrasts, whereas children with SSD-only are expected to have difficulties perceiving only the specific contrasts that they misarticulate. The rationale for the proposed research is that it is expected to provide essential preliminary data for a larger scale determination of the impact of speech perception intervention on speech production learning. Guided by preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine how discrimination of word-medial consonantal contrasts predicts speech production and language abilities of three groups of children (typically developing, SSD-only, SSD+LI); 2) Determine the profile of mispronunciation detection skills of consonants in multiple word positions by these three groups of children; and 3) Reveal how mispronunciation detection training with self-produced words influences speech production in children with SSD-only and children with SSD+LI. For the first aim, identification of systematically varied word-medial consonantal contrasts will be compared across the three groups of participants. For the second aim, mispronunciation detection abilities of consonants in multiple word positions will be compared across the three groups of children. Under the third aim, we will compare speech perception training focused on judging the accuracy of their own speech or the accuracy of multiple talkers in children with SSD-only and children with SSD+LI. This approach is innovative because novel focus on word- medial consonants will bring new insights as well as encourage generalization from clinic to natural conversational settings. In addition, by systematically investigating perception of consonantal contrasts in different contexts, our approach has enhanced potential to identify specific speech perception deficits in children with SSD-only and children with SSD+LI. Proposed studies are significant because they will clarify contributions of speech perception to development of speech production in children with SSD with or without concomitant LI. Ultimately, such knowledge will lead to improved evaluation and treatment of SSD."
"9281894","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general."
"9235624","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic pain affects more than 100 million people in the United States and produces annual costs up to $635 billion. While pain affects all segments of the population, the burden of chronic pain and associated disability disproportionately affects non-Hispanic Blacks (?Blacks?) compared to non-Hispanic Whites (?Whites?) as well as individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) compared to those with high SES. Blacks often experience more frequent, severe and disabling chronic pain compared to Whites. Further, SES factors, such as lower levels of education, low income, and unemployment are associated with higher rates of chronic and disabling pain. Despite growing documentation of racial differences in chronic pain outcomes, relatively little research has focused on differences in the experience of chronic low back pain (cLBP) between Blacks and Whites in a socioeconomic context. This is concerning because cLBP is one of the most prevalent and severely disabling painful conditions, yet it remains unclear whether specific disadvantaged subgroups of society such as Blacks with low SES may be at heightened risk for poor cLBP outcomes. The proposed hypotheses are based on the theory of fundamental causes as a socioeconomic framework for explaining why cLBP severity and disability, as well as the factors predicting these outcomes, may differ as a function of racial background. Guided by the theory of fundamental causes, the overall aim of this study is to characterize racial and SES differences in cLBP severity and disability. Further, we aim to examine important biopsychosocial predictors of racial and SES differences in cLBP outcomes. To explore this overall aim, we will first characterize racial and SES differences in cLBP clinical symptoms, perceived disability, and functional performance. Next, we will invoke endogenous pain inhibitory and facilitatory processes using quantitative sensory tests of conditioned pain modulation and temporal summation, respectively. Biologically-driven factors including sleep, vitamin D, oxytocin, and C-reactive protein, in addition to psychosocial factors including depressive symptoms, racial discrimination, perceived injustice, access to social support, and psychological resilience will then be assessed. We will determine whether endogenous pain modulatory processes, as well as important biopsychosocial factors differentially predict cLBP outcomes for Blacks and Whites, and whether the strength of prediction varies according to SES. This study will be the first to directly and comprehensively apply a socioeconomic framework to the study of racial differences in cLBP outcomes. The findings will also provide novel and important information regarding biopsychosocial predictors of racial and SES differences in clinical pain responses and related disability among those with cLBP. Whether these biopsychosocial predictors may subsequently serve as viable treatment targets for cLBP tailored to meet the specific needs of disadvantaged population subgroups can then be addressed in future research."
"9258463","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Leiomyomas (uterine fibroids) are a major disease that affects women but remain shockingly understudied with few nonsurgical therapeutic options. Leiomyomas are characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix and enhanced proliferation and tumorigenesis of uterine smooth muscle cells. Currently available treatments for leiomyomas are limited due in large part to the fact that the mechanisms regulating the development and growth of these tumors are still not well understood. We and others hypothesize that leiomyomas develop in the uterine myometrium as a response to inflammation or injury caused by local ischemia or hypoxia during menstruation or the presence of bacterial or other pathogens. We also hypothesize that dietary intervention with compounds known to inhibit inflammation-associated pathways, will decrease growth of fibroids leading to decreased size and amelioration of symptoms. We believe that dietary intervention with compounds containing high levels of omega-3 fatty acids (OM-3FA) will have a beneficial effect on leiomyomas by reducing inflammation and subsequent growth. Recently our lab has characterized oviductal leiomyomas that occur spontaneously in hens as they age as a new, relatively inexpensive, naturally occurring animal model for leiomyomas. We now have preliminary data showing that hens fed a flaxseed diet showed a decrease in size of leiomyomas compared to hens fed the normal corn-based diet. We propose to test our hypothesis in the hen model for leiomyomas with the following aim: To evaluate the efficacy of a one-year dietary intervention with regular flaxseed vs. high lignan/low omega-3 flaxseed (Linola) vs. flaxseed oil-derived omega 3 (OM-3FA) on the incidence and severity (size) of oviductal leiomyomas in aging laying hens. This will be accomplished using older hens in their 3rd year of lay in a one year feeding study in which hens will be fed one of four diets; control with 10% corn oil; 10% whole (regular) flaxseed; 5% OM-3FA; or 10% high lignin/low OM-3FA. Leiomyomas will be harvested from all birds at the end of the 12 month feeding period to determine numbers of leiomyomas/bird, numbers of birds with leiomyomas, and size of leiomyomas. We will also assess a number of surrogate endpoints in leiomyomas including changes in expression of cyclo- oxygenase (COX) and prostaglandin synthase enzymes, prostaglandin levels in leiomyomas, expression of fibrotic genes and matrix proteins, proliferation/apoptosis indices, and measures of oxidative stress. The long term goal of this research is to develop clinical trials for dietary intervention in women with leiomyomas. The proposed aims will advance our knowledge of this highly prevalent public health challenge for which treatment options are currently limited at best. The proposed work is scientifically, translationally, and clinically significant because it provides a new perspective on and better understanding of the mechanisms underlying leiomyoma development and opens up possibilities for identifying additional therapeutic targets and strategies."
"9474800","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural processing of auditory and vestibular information plays a crucial role in healthy human communication and balance. This process starts when hair cells transform a mechanical stimulus into a biological signal, and continues as the signal is subsequently transmitted to downstream neural components. We know comparatively little about how information is processed at the next level after hair cells; the primary afferent neurons. This proposal focuses on understanding the relationships among morphology, connectivity, physiology, and development in hair cell afferent neurons. A comprehensive understanding of organization and function is challenging in mammalian afferents due to their inaccessibility and sheer numbers of neurons. In contrast, functional organization of afferents is relatively straightforward to analyze in tractable systems where cell morphology can be visualized in vivo, like the zebrafish lateral line. Zebrafish have quickly established a powerful presence as a model genetic system, which, when combined with their transparency at the larval stage, allows direct observation of afferent connectivity and physiology. Zebrafish display key features of vertebrate hearing and balance circuits, showing similar afferent subtypes and patterns of hair cell connectivity. The goal of the experiments proposed here is to provide an unprecedented, detailed characterization of afferent neurons to understand their role in signal processing more broadly in vertebrate hair cell systems. The intrinsic membrane properties of afferents may be directly related to their somata size or number of hair cells that they contact. This does not seem to be entirely related to their developmental stage, as we have data that suggests that physiology of different cell types is established early on and preserved throughout growth. Furthermore, we will test whether the system is redundantly designed, or has substantial compensatory mechanisms in place, by removing afferent neurons to see their effect on stereotyped motor responses. Without detailed knowledge about how we process information downstream of hair cells we cannot make continued progress towards diagnosing auditory and balance disorders, which have devastating social and health consequences for millions of Americans worldwide."
"9276889","Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, is a highly infectious obligate intracellular bacterium. The vast majority of the individuals exposed to M. leprae becomes infected, but only a small proportion of the infected individuals evolves to active disease. Previous work in leprosy and tuberculosis demonstrated a major role of interferon-?, an effector cytokine produced by pathogen-specific memory CD4 T cells, in the control of the infection by these intracellular pathogens. Our preliminary data show a progressive reduction in M. leprae-specific IFN? levels in individuals that correlates to indicators of level of exposure to M. leprae and to bacillary load in individuals with leprosy. When we evaluated the interaction of M. leprae with Schwann cells and mononuclear phagocytes, we observed an induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the lipid mediator PGE-2. Metabolomics analyses of lesions and sera from leprosy patients also demonstrated clear differences in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) derived lipid mediators that correlated to the clinical forms of leprosy and bacillary loads. Other investigators detected frequencies of Foxp-3 positive T cells in the blood and lesions of leprosy patients that correlate to the expected inhibition of cellular immunity and effector function against M. leprae in the multibacillary forms of leprosy. Taking in to account these findings, we hypothesize that M. leprae interactions with Schwann cells and mononuclear phagocytes generate a microenvironment via the activities of lipid mediator that facilitates the inhibition of pathogen-specific IFN-? response by Treg. We will test these hypotheses in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1-Evaluate the phenotype and functionally the Treg present in the blood and skin lesions of M. leprae-infected individuals and leprosy patients, to define the role of Treg in Th1 regulation during leprosy disease. 2- Investigate specific lipid mediators of inflammatory and immune responses and their alteration of the immune responses in M. leprae- infected individuals. Negative regulation of the immune response entails several different mechanisms that are present but less visible in asymptomatic individuals in the initial stages of the silent, long-evolving steps of chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Looking at changes in regulatory T responses that precede the onset of active disease using epidemiological and functional data as clues has the potential for reducing the individual and economic costs associated to these major health problems."
"9263367","Despite widespread anti-malaria interventions throughout Malawi, including country-wide distribution of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and free treatment, the burden of malaria remains extremely high, with no measurable decrease in incidence of infection or disease over the past decade. Many factors have been hypothesized to explain such intransigence of malaria in Malawi, and in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such as unavailable treatment, drug resistance, improper diagnosis, silent reservoirs of infection, and failure of prevention measures. This project, which is integrated with two others in the Malawi ICEMR, addresses the epidemiology of disease risk from the perspective of human-vector interactions as influenced by ITN use and effectiveness and insecticide resistance (IR). We have designed systematic studies to understand why the burden of malaria remains high in Malawi, despite such intense efforts to reduce infection and disease. Our previous work in Malawi has shown that IR is high among major vectors such as Anopheles funestus, and that these mosquitoes are biting before and after usual sleeping time when ITNs could be useful. We hypothesize that ITN effectiveness will vary based on the intensity of transmission, IR, and human and mosquito behaviors. Hence, the goals of this proposed research are:  1) Understand how human infection and disease risk changes with ITN use and effectiveness across  diverse environmental contexts and vector-human contact scenarios,  2) Determine how Plasmodium infection in vectors and humans varies with pyrethroid IR and vector  behavior across three levels transmission intensity, and  3) Evaluate how human behaviors and biting behavior of Anopheles species alter the entomological  inoculation rate (EIR) and human disease risk. To broach these objectives, we will undertake cohort-based, field studies of human and vector populations, measuring infection and disease incidence before, during and after the 2018 Malawi ITN mass distribution campaign. This effort allows us to evaluate the impacts of a massive experimental intervention by monitoring effectiveness of interventions and any changes in disease risk. Two cohorts will be established around a government health center in each of the three ecologically and epidemiologically different study sites. The infection cohort will allow measurement of incidence of P. falciparum infection and the disease cohort will be used to assess the incidence of malaria illness. By understanding these factors and their interactions across a range of endemic transmission settings, critical intervention failures can be identified and new strategies to prevent malaria designed. Our results should help improve intervention effectiveness in Malawi, and many other settings in sub-Saharan Africa where malaria burden remains high despite concerted efforts."

"9310035","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In our information-driven society, math ability is essential for success, particularly in the STEM fields that drive the modern economy. Within the population, however, there exist large variations with regard to math ability, and this variabilityis already present in the first year of formal schooling. Furthermore, math ability in kindergarten is a strong predictor of a child's later academic and professional achievement. Many interventions have focused on executive functions (EFs) and early number knowledge as routes to improve preschool-aged children's math proficiency, though they have been met with mixed success. However, reasoning ability, which is critical for flexible problem solving and correlates strongly with math ability, has received relatively little focus despite the possibility that improving reasoning ability in young children may be a promising route to impacting later math performance. The NICHD strives to develop more personalized and effective cognitive interventions. In line this with this goal, the specific objective of this application is to identiy the cognitive skills and neural substrates that support the link between reasoning and math. Aim 1 will test the causal role of specific cognitive skill sets in the growth of math achievement. Preschool-aged children will receive game- based interventions that target either reasoning ability or EFs. The hypothesis is that growth in reasoning will lead to improvements in children's ability to recognize ordinal relations between numerical magnitudes, which will result in greater improvements in arithmetic performance relative to the EF-focused intervention. Pupillometry metrics during a reasoning task will be used to investigate the temporal dynamics of children's ordinal reasoning, providing insight into the mechanisms of change promoted by the interventions. Aim 2 will characterize the links between reasoning ability, math achievement, and brain function in children aged 6-19 years. This aim takes advantage of a preexisting longitudinal dataset investigating the neural and cognitive factors that support reasoning development. The NIMH aims to understand the neural bases of complex behaviors. The hypothesis is that growth in math performance will be related to changes in functional activity and connectivity within the fronto-parietal brain networks implicated in reasoning development. Together, these data will tell us which targets of intervention are most effective at improving children's math performance and will provide insight into the neural changes that support growth in math performance. This approach is innovative it its multimodal methodology, because it combines methods from developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience in order to improve our understanding of the factors that promote growth in math ability. The proposed research is significant because understanding the connection between reasoning and math is critical for the development of novel assessments of math ability and educational interventions to promote growth in math, both of which are necessary to improve school readiness and academic performance in young children."
"9471503","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the renewal of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Cancer Health Disparities Training Program (CHDP). The current proposal requests twelve postdoctoral positions. The aim for continuation of CHDP is to train a diverse cadre of scientists at the postdoctoral level to work to improve the science of cancer health disparities research that will lead to reduction and elimination of these disparities. To accomplish this aim, we have added new training elements that will take full advantage of the unique resources and opportunities of the T32 training mechanism to: Recruit three postdoctoral Fellows per year who have an explicit commitment to conducting research on cancer health disparities. A program of this size is necessary to initiate and sustain a specialized, interdisciplinary training infrastructure. Successful efforts to recruit minority Fellows will be enhanced with special strategies to recruit Latino and American Indian Fellows. Develop and deliver a specialized two-year curriculum that fosters an interdisciplinary understanding of  cancer health disparities. The curriculum will continue to build on the institutional strengths of nationally  recognized educational and training programs at UNC. New interdisciplinary courses, graduate certificate programs, and workshops on community engagement in research will be added as recommended opportunities for Fellows. Provide program participants with individualized career development experiences that enhance professional skills and build professional networks. The program will continue to assign each Fellow with mentors in more than one discipline. Additional emphasis will be placed on including steps toward seeking academic research positions to foster transitions from training to productive career paths. Provide CHDP Fellows with individualized mentored research experience with interdisciplinary research teams that focus on understanding complex issues underlying cancer health disparities, based on a social- ecological model of health. Evaluate the success of the program in meeting its objectives by employing explicit benchmarks and will follow well-defined procedures for capturing, analyzing, and reporting outcomes. The evaluation will serve the dual purposes of program accountability and continuous improvement. CHDP has been operative since 2009 and has supported seven Fellows, including five minority Fellows. Four fellows have completed the program, and three have faculty positions. We are confident that with our curriculum, faculty, projects, and research resources, CHDP will continue as a highly successful and vibrant training environment in which Fellows will be exceptionally well prepared for a productive career in cancer disparities research."
"9254387","Cachexia is a complex syndrome characterized by involuntary weight loss and skeletal muscle wasting that leads to fatigue, weakness and a loss of appetite that is not reversed by increased caloric consumption. More than half of all cancer patients develop cachexia and it is responsible for more than 20% of all cancer deaths. Numerous complications associated with cachexia include an impaired response to drug treatment, an increased chance of infection, a poor prognosis and a decreased quality of life. Currently, there are no FDA- approved treatments for cancer cachexia, but the hormone ghrelin has recently emerged as a molecule with great potential. Several studies in both animals and humans have shown that ghrelin increases food intake, stimulates the release of growth hormone, increases muscle mass, and reduces markers of inflammation. However, the use of ghrelin as a treatment is limited for several reasons: 1) ghrelin must be dosed 2-3 times daily to see efficacy due to its inherently short half-life of 30 min; 2) deacylation of ghrelin to an inactive form occurs in less than 5 min; and 3) ghrelin is currently dosed intravenously to see a therapeutic effect. The studies completed during SBIR Phase I address each of these issues, resulting a long-acting ghrelin derivative that could be dosed subcutaneously once every other day in rats to reverse the effects of cachexia in the Yoshida rat model. The studies proposed in this Phase II application will investigate the ability of our long- acting ghrelin to ameliorate cachexia in two additional models. Methods for cGMP production of the long-acting ghrelin will be put in place. We will perform IND-enabling GLP toxicity and immunogenicity studies using the cGMP material. These studies are needed prior to beginning human trials. Once fully developed, this long- acting ghrelin derivative would provide a patient-friendly cachexia therapy that would significantly improve the prognosis and quality of life in patients with cancer and also in patients with other chronic disorders such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."
"9250743","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this ongoing interdisciplinary training program, currently in the 25th year, is to bring together pre-clinical scientists and translational investigative researchers to catalyze the transformation of postdoctoral students from both basic science and clinical disciplines into independent academic faculty committed to kidney-relevant research. The training program builds on new initiatives in renal pathophysiology, cell and molecular biology, vascular biology, basic immunology, genetics, transplantation, acute and chronic kidney disease and in clinical and translational research. The UAB Clinical and Translational Science Award and the Office for Postdoctoral Education provide essential facilities that embrace trainee education as well as mentor training, also a major goal of this program. The Program accepts PhD and MD scientists from a large applicant pool that now includes physicians in the American Board of Internal Medicine Research pathway, which recruits highly meritorious candidates to pursue a career in academic medicine.  Twenty-two (50%) of our 44 trainees are in academia, 20% are still pursuing post-graduate training and 7% have pursued non-academic positions, although still in science-based careers. Trainees have been successful in obtaining 20 highly competitive extramural grants, including 13 career development awards. During the past 10 years, 18 trainees have published 68 peer- reviewed publications including papers in high-impact journals.  The program has benefitted from a multidisciplinary collaborative faculty from 9 Departments (Medicine, Cell Developmental and Integrative Biology, Epidemiology, Microbiology, Emergency Medicine, Genetics, Pathology, Pediatrics, Surgery) and robust institutional infrastructure and support. The strong commitment of the 34 preceptors, organized in four thematic areas - renal physiology and pathophysiology, epithelial biology, vascular biology related to kidney disease and clinical and translational research - who are actively involved in the training of young scientists in the use of basic and applied approaches are also strengths of this training grant. The collaborative environment of our institution, embodied in the University-Wide Interdisciplinary Research Centers Program, the Nephrology Research and Training Center, and the NIDDK-funded O'Brien Center, provides an ideal setting for the implementation of interdisciplinary kidney-related research and training. Based on the accomplishments during this cycle, continued support of four postdoctoral trainees is being requested in this competing renewal application."
"9253441","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary torsion dystonias (PTD) are a group of movement disorders characterized by twisting muscle contractures, with dystonia as the only clinical sign (except for tremor) and in the absence of neuronal degeneration or an acquired cause. There are multiple genetic causes, with overlapping phenotypes. We have now identified a series of mutations in GNAL, encoding G?olf, in patients with early onset torsion dystonia (EOTD) who do not harbor mutations in TOR1A or THAP1. G?olf is a G protein that couples striatal dopamine D1 (D1R) and adenosine A2a (A2AR) receptors to adenylyl cyclase V. Therefore, it is expressed in striatal output medium size spiny neurons and cholinergic interneurons. Abundant evidence supports dysfunction of the basal ganglia in dystonia, although other regions, e.g. cerebellum and cortex, are also involved. Within the basal ganglia, the focus has been on the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and striatal cholinergic interneurons. Other than mutations in the tyrosine hydroxylase biosynthetic pathway, GNAL is the first EOTD gene that directly points to the DA signal transduction system as the origin of pathophysiology, particularly to D1R. TorsinA is a AAA-ATPase protein and Thap1 is a transcription factor. Their specific functions, however, remain enigmatic, particularly as to how their mutations result in dystonia. Therefore, the connection between G?olf and the nigrostriatal dopamine system allows for directed, comparative assays of this system in mouse models of the three forms of EOTD. The rationale behind these studies is that dissecting the direct effects and compensatory maladaptations in neurotransmission, particularly dopaminergic and adenosinergic, Gnal heterozygote-null mice will offer clues to pathophysiology in DYT1 (TOR1A) and DYT6 (THAP1) EOTD as well. In Specific Aim 1, it will be determined whether mutations in EOTD genes TOR1A, THAP1 and GNAL result in similar altered DA neurotransmission in the striatum as evidenced by DA level and release, G protein activity, and cAMP production. In Specific Aim 2, baseline and pharmacologically induced behavior will be analyzed in the same genotypes. The molecular counterparts of the behaviors will be assayed via measures of induction of phosphorylation of ERK and DARPP-32, following D1R, D2R, and A2AR receptor agonists and antagonists. In Specific Aim 3, RNA-seq will be performed in the Gnal+/- mouse and THAP1-C54Y knockin mouse, and compared to those in the Tor1a GAG+/-mouse (via collaboration) to identify downstream targets, particularly in neurotransmitter pathways. Identification of a final common pathway in different forms of EOTD will aid in directing discovery of therapeutic targets for this currently incurable disorder."

"9251929","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The population of Cambodia is rapidly aging. Life expectancy at birth has increased from 58 years in 1995 to 71 years in 2012 driving the rate of previously unknown non-communicable diseases (NCDs) skyward. Ischemic heart disease and stroke are now the top two causes of mortality in this low income country and rates of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension and diabetes are dramatically increasing. While the Cambodian government has done little to address the growing burden of NCDs afflicting its people, a non- governmental organization (NGO), MoPoTsyo Patient Information Center, has stepped in. Using a model of community-based patient-led Peer Educator Networks, MoPoTsyo is currently delivering self-management training and medications to over 21,000 hypertensive and diabetic patients in Cambodia. In spite of the considerable success this model has demonstrated, control of these conditions - particularly hypertension among non-diabetics - remains a challenge. The primary aim of this application, in response to PAR-14-028, Mobile Health: Technology and Outcomes in Low and Middle Income Countries (R21), is to enhance the communication network between the MoPoTsyo patient database, Peer Educators, pharmacies, and patients, using mobile eHealth tools to activate better compliance with treatment guidelines. Specifically, we plan to 1) Finalize enhanced features of the mHealth communications application for self-management of hypertension and diabetes, and pilot test it with end-users for acceptability and ease of use; 2) Implement a randomized controlled clinical intervention to assess the mHealth communications application in rural and urban-poverty communities for reducing study outcomes related to diabetes and hypertension; and 3) Share results with the Cambodian Ministry of Health and development partners in order to inform health policy makers of study findings and to develop strategies for improving control of hypertension and diabetes throughout Cambodia. This e-health communication system using mobile phone technology will include (a) voice messaging in Khmer allowing illiterate users to participate; (b) interactive tailored reminders and messages to patients for improving support for treatment adherence and goal achievement; (c) integration of messages received and responses from users into the health care database to trigger new messages; (d) access to pharmacy data to monitor individual adherence to medication; (e) access of health care information to Peer Educators to improve monitoring of patients over time; and (f) use of the system to integrate data into the MoPoTsyo database for reports and surveillance of patients. Fifty Peer Educators representing over 6000 rural, sub-urban, and urban patients will be randomized to the intervention or control. Process outcomes and health indicators including control of blood pressure and glucose, medication adherence, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, body- mass index, diet and exercise, will be evaluated. Results will be used to help develop national health policies addressing the great need for NCD control in Cambodia and serve as a model of other countries in SE Asia."
"9461668","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental gap in knowledge in prostate cancer (PCa) is how to distinguish indolent from aggressive disease. Further, genetic events that switch an indolent PCa to an aggressive phenotype are not well understood. Our proposed investigations will utilize two state-of-the-art genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of PCa generated by the PI to address these gaps in knowledge. Expression of the Myc oncogene exclusive to mouse prostate epithelium results in indolent organ confined PCa. We have combined the Myc transgenic mouse model with additional models to establish novel GEMMs of PCa to perform a gene candidate and gene discovery approach to delineate genetic drivers of aggressive PCa progression. Specifically, aim 1 will determine if the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a suppressor of PCa metastasis. Specific aim 2 will utilize a sleeping beauty mutagenesis screen to identify novel candidate genetic drivers of PCa metastasis. Ultimately, these novel and state-of-the-art mouse models allow for prostate specific molecular events to be investigated. Our principle objective is to characterize our GEMMs to discover genetic switches which drive aggressive PCa. Overall, our proposed studies will significantly impact PCa research and how patients are clinically assessed to determine stratification of indolent from aggressive disease. In addition, through completing these studies, we will continue to achieve our longer term goals which are to identify and validate new therapeutic pathways/targets that may ultimately be used to treat patients with advanced PCa, and serum available biomarkers of PCa that identify aggressive PCa phenotypes."
"9361317","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metabolic Engineering of Cancer for Selective Immunotargeting  Cancer is one of the most common and fatal diseases and, in general, it is difficult to cure. Among the different strategies probed for cancer therapy, treating cancer patients with cancer vaccines or cancer-targeting antibodies is especially attractive as the human immune system can be extremely effective and selective to eliminate tumors in the human body. In the development of cancer vaccines used for patient immunization or antibody preparation, the abnormal glycans expressed by cancer cells, called tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs), are valuable molecular targets, as they are abundant, exposed, and conserved on the cancer cell surface. However, the problem is that TACAs are usually poorly immunogenic or tolerated by the patients' immune system, which has severely hindered the delivery of functional TACA-based cancer vaccines or immunotherapies.  To address the problem and develop effective cancer cures, a new immunotherapeutic strategy was proposed. First, animals (or patients) are immunized with a vaccine made of an unnatural TACA derivative to elicit a specific immune response. Next, the animals are treated with a similarly modified monosaccharide to bioengineer tumor cell expression of the unnatural TACA derivative (cancer cell glycoengineering). Then, the trained immune system will specifically recognize and kill the glycoengineered tumors. The new immunotherapy can also be realized with a TACA derivative-specific antibody, instead of a vaccine, for the treatment. For the strategy to work, it has to mee two conditions, namely, a potent vaccine that can be used for patient immunization or antibody preparation and an effective method for cancer cell glycoengineering. It has been proved that the latter can exploit the flexible biosynthetic pathways for glycans. To create potent and reliabl TACA-based vaccines, a new vaccine strategy is proposed here, namely, to have TACAs linked to a bacterial monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). The hypothesis is that MPLA can act as a powerful vaccine carrier and built-in adjuvant to formulate fully synthetic, self-adjuvanting, structurally defined, readily reproducible, and robust glycoconjugate vaccines. This proposal aims to: (1) study the structure-activity relationship of MPLAs and identify new, potent vaccine carriers and adjuvants, (2) prepare and study the immunological properties of TACA-MPLA conjugates and identify the proper vaccines for cancer immunotherapy, and (3) use the new TACA-MPLA conjugates as vaccines for active and passive immunotherapy of cancer such as melanoma and breast or colon cancer by the above therapeutic strategy.  One innovation of this project is the use of MPLA as a carrier and adjuvant for fully synthetic self-adjuvanting carbohydrate vaccine development and related studies. Another innovation is the combination MPLA conjugate vaccine with cell glycoengineering for cancer therapy. This combination will solve the immunotolerance problem of TACAs, a central issue in cancer immunology, and help develop functional cures for various tumors. The new vaccine strategy will be applicable to other vaccine design as well. Thus, both strategies should be widely useful, and this research program should be of general significance and have a broad impact on cancer research."
"9442358","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 60,000 individuals undergo surgery for lung cancer in the US annually. For these patients, whether, or not, cancer has spread to their lymph nodes is the main determinant of their prognosis and guides post- operative treatment decision-making. Unfortunately, most lung cancer operations done in the US do not provide a sufficient sample of lymph nodes to make an accurate determination of pathologic lymph node stage. Therefore, a larger number of patients die of lung cancer than would have been predicted by their post- operative stage. Examination of the quality of lung cancer surgical resections in the greater Memphis Metropolitan Area reveals close approximation to the US national quality-of-care gap. Deploying a specially designed lymph node specimen collection kit for use in lung cancer resections significantly improves the quality of pathologic lymph node staging and increases the detection of patients with lymph node metastasis. We now want to test the implementation of the routine use of this unique specimen collection kit in the tri-state area of Eastern Arkansas, Northern Mississippi and Western Tennessee, which has the combination of challenging socio-economic demographics and some of the highest lung cancer mortality rates in the US. Based on our prior work, we hypothesize that successful implementation of this surgical lymph node specimen collection kit will improve the quality of pathologic staging of lung cancer and increase the detection of lymph node metastasis in a diverse mix of patients operated on by a diverse mix of surgeons in a diverse mix of institutions. Our objective is to study the implementation process of routine use of this kit in a demographically diverse, high lung cancer incidence region of the US, in order to maximize its impact in future dissemination. We propose to achieve this by performing the following Specific Aims: 1.) Recruit at least 90% of eligible hospitals (those within our defined catchment area with >5 lung resection operations annually) and surgeons to participate in an implementation study of the lymph node specimen collection kit for lung cancer resections; 2.) Evaluate the effectiveness of the kit in surgery performed in a diverse mix of institutions, using a staggered implementation, multiple baseline study design; 3.) Study the implementation process using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Our study will demonstrate the practical possibility of significantly improving the quality and outcomes of surgical lung cancer care across heterogeneity of practice settings. General improvement in pathologic staging will set the stage for future translational work on development of independently prognostic gene and protein expression profiles by optimizing the use of the Tumor, Node, and Metastasis (TNM) staging system, which is currently our best risk stratification system. The ultimate goal of this project i to provide the clinical infrastructure to support future studies of such prognostic molecular signatures that will supplement, and eventually supersede the current TNM staging system."
"9327641","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tremor is an uncontrolled oscillation of muscle activity that is present in many neurological disorders and can severely disrupt the execution of daily tasks. Despite its prevalence and impact on quality of life, the specific patterns and pathways of neural activity that lead to tremor remain unknown. This is especially problematic in disorders in which tremors are not only the main symptom, but also the disease itself. A case in point is essential tremor (ET), which is the most prevalent of all tremor disorders. There has been a long-standing debate about whether the cerebellum plays a key role in the generation of tremor in ET, and there are three disparate theories of how this may occur. Purkinje cell loss, GABA receptor reduction, and inferior olive oscillations have all emerged as potential mechanisms to generate tremor. This proposal seeks to define the areas and activity that drive ET-like tremor while also directly challenging the existing theories using a combination of genetic, pharmacological, electrophysiological, and optogenetic approaches. A Cre/loxP genetic approach was used to conditionally remove the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) specifically from Purkinje cells, resulting in ?silenced? Purkinje cells that cannot communicate with their downstream partners, the cerebellar nuclei. Preliminary data suggest that the loss of Purkinje cell signaling does not cause tremor, contrary to theories that suggest Purkinje cell loss or GABA receptor reduction lead to tremor. Data has also been collected showing that pharmacologically forcing inferior olive oscillations, which normally induces tremor in control mice, is ineffective in mice without Purkinje cell signaling. Characterization of Purkinje cell and cerebellar nuclei activity in actively tremoring mice has begun to uncover critical clues for how the cerebellum might initiate tremor. This proposal expands on these data by testing the hypothesis that a unique pattern of Purkinje cell misfiring causes ET-like tremor by promoting 10Hz activity throughout the motor system. The first aim tests how Purkinje cell signals facilitate tremor. In vivo awake electrophysiology and genetic approaches will be used to determine the specific firing patterns of Purkinje and cerebellar nuclear neurons that propagate tremor and whether there is a developmental component to susceptibility to tremor. The second aim tests how the cerebellum interacts with other areas of the motor system, including thalamus and motor cortex, during tremor. This will determine whether the effects of Purkinje cell silencing extend outside the cerebellum to other motor areas, particularly when under conditions that normally result in tremor. Preliminary data suggests that Purkinje cell silencing blocks the propagation of tremor. Therefore, pharmacological methods will be used to determine if the Purkinje cell has a unique and privileged position in the tremor circuit. Optogenetics will also be used to mimic tremor signals by driving specific patterns of activity in the Purkinje cells. These experiments will be used to directly pinpoint the cell types and activity patterns that are sufficient to trigger tremor signals in the motor system and to determine how of these cells drive pathological oscillations in downstream areas."
"9447270","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this three-year postdoctoral training program is to empower the applicant with the necessary skills and network to establish an independent laboratory in the United States studying regeneration in newts (salamanders). Newts are critical components of the regenerative research landscape due to their ability to replace complex body parts after loss. Limb regeneration is an important model in this regard. Central to newt limb regeneration is the formation of a blastema; a heterogeneous mass of cells that develop into the new limb. Despite its centrality, we have a minimal understanding of the blastema and lack any specific expression markers. The applicant will identify the genes and cis-regulatory elements that regulate blastema formation in the Iberian newt and develop fluorescent expression markers to identify blastema cell types in vivo. This will be accomplished through the following research plan. First, functionally relevant genomic regions will be sequenced and assembled by a combination of whole genome sequencing and selectively sequencing open chromatin (Aim 1). Second, using single-cell transcriptomics, the cell types contributing to the blastema at will be classified and marker genes identified. Additionally, by integrating this single-cell transcriptomic information with obtained genomic sequences, cis-regulatory elements that are over- or under- represented in blastema markers genes will be identified (Aim 2). Third, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, transgenic newts expressing fluorescent blastema markers will be developed (Aim 3). The identified genes, cis-regulatory elements and transgenic newts will offer unprecedented knowledge and tools to further understand the regulation of regeneration, thereby enabling the applicant to begin a promising independent career in regeneration research."
"9452707","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Auditory efferents shape afferent auditory processing. The normative features of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent effects and their functional significance in children are not known. Although the MOC reflex is mature around full-term birth, evidence suggests that its strength can be altered through short-term training and experiences. The overall goal of the proposed work is to characterize features of the MOC reflex and investigate its functional significance in auditory perception in typically developing, normal-hearing children. The central hypothesis is that the MOC strength is important for listening in noise during development and that auditory attention plays a prominent role in modulating MOC activity. A combination of perceptual and physiologic (otoacoustic emissions) tests will be used in this project. In Specific Aim 1, the distribution or continuum of the MOC reflex strength, measured via innovative and refined click evoked OAE methods, will be characterized in children. It is predicted that robust measurements of the MOC reflex can be obtained that will allow for observing subtle changes in the MOC reflex due to experimental manipulation. The MOC reflex is expected to show a normal variation in strength from weak to strong across normal hearing children. Further controlling auditory attention is expected to alter the size of th MOC reflex and may reduce the variability among children. Data from adults will be obtained for comparison. In Specific Aim 2, the relationship between the MOC reflex and auditory perception in noise will be investigated in children and adults. Specifically, performance in frequency discrimination in noise will be correlated with the magnitude of the MOC reflex measured in no-task and auditory task conditions. A significant correlation is expected between the strength of the MOC reflex (measured in the auditory task condition) and auditory perception in both children and adults. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the role of efferent mechanisms in auditory perceptual development. The MOC tests developed in this work should be useful both clinically and scientifically in the diagnosis and monitoring of auditor disorders (specifically listening-in-noise deficits), may guide habilitative (training) efforts, an should demonstrate the role of MOC feedback during development."
"9329312","Project Summary  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the cellular organelle primarily responsible for the ability of cells to regulate secretory protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Deficiencies in the ER proteostatic network are implicated in cancer, metabolic disorders, inflammatory diseases, and an assortment of etiologically-diverse neurodegenerative disorders. In order for eukaryotes to maintain proper proteostasis in the ER and throughout the secretory pathway, mammalian cells have evolved the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress-responsive signaling pathway comprising three distinct stress sensors and signaling arms. Stress-associated activation of all three arms of the UPR induces the expression of chaperones, activates autophagy, alters lipid biosynthesis, as well as influencing pro-apoptotic / pro-survival signaling pathways.  In this proposal, I seek to understand how pharmacologic or genetic arm- selective activation of the UPR in the absence of stress influences autophagy and the lipid composition of membranes. I will characterize the induction of autophagy and its key enzymes after administrating our chemical genetic and pharmacologic activators of the UPR (Specific AIM 1), either in isolation or in combination. Autophagy regulation is a key process in proteostasis and its induction can promote pro-survival and amelioration of aggregation-associated degenerative diseases. In addition, I will explore the effect of pharmacological and genetic activation of the ATF6 and/or XBP1 arms of the UPR on membrane lipid composition (Specific AIM 2) and the interplay between lipid composition and UPR modulation. Recent evidence suggests that lipid homeostasis may play a role in UPR regulation and represents a novel point of control, which could ultimately be useful therapeutically."
"9258816","PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 400,000 people in the United States are living with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a neuroinflammatory disease that affects a disproportionate amount of young people between the ages of 20 and 40 years of age. Immune infiltration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain parenchyma is one of the initial processes in the disease progression of multiple sclerosis and is poorly understood. We hypothesize that gaining a better understanding the mechanism of immune infiltration across the blood brain barrier and the contribution of various leukocyte subsets may lead to the discovery of new therapeutics for minimizing immune infiltration for multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases of the brain. We propose to create, characterize, and validate our brain post-capillary venule platform and to use this platform to visualize and quantify the various steps in the mechanism of immune infiltration, as well as to investigate potential therapeutics for multiple sclerosis. This will be accomplished via the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, a brain post-capillary venule platform will be designed that incorporates the physiological characteristics of brain post- capillary venules based on in vivo studies. These vessels will be characterized and analyzed using a toolbox of parameters to establish baseline conditions. In Aim 2, the mechanisms involved in leukocyte infiltration across the blood-brain barrier will be investigated. Using live-cell time-lapse microscopy, the multi-step process of leukocyte infiltration (including rolling, adhesion, diapedesis, cell fate etc.) of various leukocyte subsets will be visualized and quantified to assess the differential leukocyte infiltration. In addition, this platform will also be used to investigate potential therapeutics for multiple sclerosis, including testing minocycline, a well-known antibiotic with anti-inflammatory effects, and receptor blockers. Furthermore, this in vitro brain post-capillary venule platform has the potential to be modified and adapted to study many other central nervous system disorders that involve the blood-brain barrier."
"9241149","Lung cancer-related death is primarily due to disease recurrence, drug resistance, and metastasis. Platinum compounds such as cisplatin (CDDP) and carboplatin (CBDCA) and their derivatives are widely used in the treatment of lung cancer. Although the tumors initially respond to platinum drugs, they adeptly develop resistance thereby escaping therapy. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade therapy and develop resistance is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches for lung cancer.  This application addresses a highly innovative and high-impact area of translational research that focuses on investigating how platinum-based drugs impact the proteasome and sequestosome (SQSTM1)/P62 function in cancer cells to produce drug resistance in lung cancer. Further, a nanodelivery approach targeted towards the proteasome and SQSTM1/P62 in combination with CDDP for overcoming resistance is proposed.  Our interest in testing the proteasome and SQSTM1/P62 in chemoresistance stems from a serendipitous observation made in the laboratory. We observed beta 5 (?5) expression, a subunit of the large 26S proteasome complex was markedly reduced in cisplatin-resistant (CDDPR) cancer cell lines when compared to its isogenic cisplatin-sensitive (CDDPS) cell lines. ?5 is the chymotryptic component of the proteasome that is required for degrading ubiquitinated proteins and recycling of amino-acids for synthesis of new proteins in the cell. Associated with reduced ?5 expression in the CDDPR cells was the intracellular accumulation of proteins. Investigation into how the cellular stress induced by intracellular accumulation of proteins is overcome by the cells revealed a role for SQSTM1/P62. The primary function of SQSTM1/P62, a scaffolding protein that is activated in response to cellular stress, is to prevent cell death by aggregating intracellular accumulated polyubiquitinated proteins into aggresomes and directing towards autophagy, thereby promoting cell survival. Further, analysis for P62 expression in a subset of human lung tumor tissues showed that chemoexperienced lung tumors had higher P62 expression compared to chemonaive tumors. Although, reduced proteasome function and increased SQSTM1/P62 expression have previously been reported in cancer cells and in stem cells, the impact of chemotherapy drugs on these cellular machineries and their role in contributing to resistance has not been previously investigated and is the basis of this innovative proposal. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that alterations in the proteasome and SQSTM1/p62 function in cancer cells contributes to platinum resistance. To test our hypothesis we have identified three specific aims. Aim 1. Investigate how modulating the proteasome and SQSTM1/P62 in CDDPR and CDDPS cancer cells and in normal cells alters the therapeutic response to platinum drugs in vitro.  In this aim, the requirement of beta-5 subunit of the proteasome and SQSTM1/P62 to platinum sensitivity and cross-resistance to other anticancer drugs will be investigated using isogenic human cancer cell lines and compared to normal cells. Aim 2. Demonstrate restoring beta-5 subunit of the proteasome with simultaneous knock-down of SQSTM1/p62 using multifunctional nanoparticle reverts CDDPR lung tumor sensitivity to cisplatin in vivo.  In this aim, we will use lung tumor xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) to test a) whether restoration of beta-5 with simultaneous silencing of P62 in CDDPR tumors restores platinum sensitivity and b) knock-down of beta-5 with concomitant overexpression of P62 in CDDPS tumors results in platinum resistance. Aim 3. Determine the biological significance of beta-5 and SQSTM1/P62 protein expression in chemonaïve and chemotreated human lung tumor tissue specimens with clinical benefit.  In this aim, archival lung tumor specimens representing primary and metastatic tumor will be examined for beta-5 and SQSTM1/P62 expression and correlate with clinical benefit."
"9315458","Project Summary/Abstract  Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are essential for animal fertility because they repress transposable elements (TE) and regulate germ cell-specific genes. Although vertebrate genomes encode hundreds of piRNA cluster loci, we know little about the impact and gene regulation roles of individual piRNA clusters. The reason is because Piwi pathway mutants disrupt all piRNAs and cause widespread germ cell death, thereby obscuring the dissection of functions for individual piRNA Cluster loci. Major knowledge gaps include: (1) Which genes besides TEs impact fertility and are being targeted by PIWI/piRNA complexes? (2) Will a single piRNA cluster mutation affect the production of piRNAs from other clusters? (3) How will the regulation of Piwi targets and vertebrate germ cell development be affected by mutating a single piRNA cluster?  This exploratory project will address these questions by first generating a list of Xenopus Piwi- associated transcripts (PATs) and testing their mechanism of regulation in Xenopus oocyte extracts. We will then create an intergenic piRNA cluster locus mutant in Xenopus tropicalis, and examine which PATs are affected in this mutant so as to gain insight into the relationship between specific groups of piRNAs and target genes regulated by Piwi/piRNA complexes. The frog is an experimentally tractable vertebrate system for dissecting the role of individual piRNA clusters. These Xenopus studies will reveal how a single major intergenic piRNA cluster will affect gonadogenesis and embryonic development. The future characterizations of mutant phenotypes are considerations for a longer-term project after the initiation of this exploratory project. The focus of this exploratory project is to create a list of PATs, test for PAT regulation in oocyte extracts, and then create a valuable mutant that will enable precise examination of which PATs are mis-regulated. Given our foundation of expertise described in this proposal, we are confident in achieving the goals of this exploratory project."
"9463154","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeting of neurotransmitter receptors to synapses is essential for efficient synaptic transmission and plays an important role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the brain. AMPA receptors are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system. We have identified several PDZ domain-containing proteins that specifically interact with AMPA receptors and are critical for the regulation of AMPA receptor membrane trafficking and synaptic plasticity. Several of these proteins, including GRIP1 and GRIP2 (Glutamate Receptor Interacting Proteins) and PICK1 (Protein Interactor with C Kinase), specifically interact with the C-terminal domains of the AMPA receptor subunits. We have found that these interactions are dynamically regulated by protein phosphorylation of the receptor subunits. We have identified additional members of this protein complex, including NSF, GRASP1, KIBRA, WWC2 and SNX27, which are involved in the regulation of AMPA receptor membrane trafficking. Interestingly, genetic variants of these proteins have recently been associated with several cognitive disorders. In this research proposal we plan to use several complementary approaches to further characterize the structure and function of this PDZ based membrane trafficking complex and determine its role in AMPA receptor synaptic targeting, synaptic plasticity and cognitive behavior. In complementary experiments, we will use knockout and knockin mice of this complex to elucidate the role of the PDZ domain-based receptor complexes in several forms of plasticity in the hippocampus, cerebellum, amygdala, somatosensory and visual cortex. Finally, we will analyze behavioral phenotypes, including spatial and motor learning and fear conditioning and extinction, in these knockout and knockin mice to determine the role of these regulatory mechanisms in higher brain processes."
"9268408","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The spleen is required for the generation of systemic tolerance to apoptotic cells. We have recently shown a specialized set of macrophages residing in the marginal zone region of the red pulp drive immunologic tolerance to apoptotic material and in their absence apoptotic cells induce inflammation and autoimmune reactivity. While it is not known how this occurs on a mechanistic level, we have found apoptotic cells provoke expression of a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), which is critical for immune suppression in a variety of inflammatory settings. Further we discovered blockade of IDO greatly altered the way macrophages and dendritic cells respond to apoptotic cells with increased inflammatory immunity and autoimmune disease activity in lupus-prone animals. Thus the data suggest a novel mechanism whereby IDO activity in macrophages controls both innate and adaptive immunity to apoptotic cells. Our proposed project will examine how apoptotic cells driven IDO activity impacts mTOR signals in marginal zone macrophages, how IDO-driven tryptophan metabolism impacts apoptotic cell-mediated tolerance, and mechanisms by which IDO may influence Treg activation; finally testing these mechanisms in an experimental model of systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, the findings of this project could have enormous implications in diseases of hypo and hyper-immunity where modulation of the tolerogenic rheostat would provide significant clinical benefit."
"9246574","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced layer 3 pyramidal cell dendrite length and complexity, spine density, and somal volume have been reported in multiple brain regions, including in primary auditory cortex (AI), in schizophrenia (Sz). Because these structural features are critical for signal processing, they likely underlie the correlated observations of impaired auditory processing and auditory cortex gray matter volume reductions in Sz, and contribute to disability. Dendrite length, complexity, and spine density are shaped by the effects of activity-dependent glutamate signaling on the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton; disruption of this signaling causes structural reductions similar to those in Sz. During the current funding period we have found alterations of proteins at multiple points within this pathway: presynaptic- SYN1, SYP; receptor- GRIA3; signal transduction- kalirin-9, MAP2. These findings have led us to hypothesize that glutamate signaling to the cytoskeleton is altered in AI in Sz, and contributes to the impairments in pyramidal cell structure. We now propose to test this hypothesis in an integrated set of experiments designed to delineate the specific nature of the alterations in these proteins within AI using a combination of targeted proteomics of synaptosomal preparations and quantitative fluorescent microscopy in human tissue (Aim 1 & 2); to determine the mechanisms by which these alterations may lead to morphologic changes in layer 3 pyramidal cells using over-expression and RNAi for WT and mutant kalirin-9, RhoA, RAC1 and MAP2 constructs in vitro and in layer 3 pyramidal cells in AI in vivo (Aim 3); and to place the alterations in the context of the larger glutamate signaling network in AI using targeted proteomics and network co-expression topology analyses (Aim 4). These Aims provide potential translational impact by examining proteins (i.e. possible drug-able targets) and by the integration of approaches such that alterations can be discovered, and their specificity delineated in diseased tissue, and then their mechanisms determined in model systems. Inclusion of an in vivo model provides a bridge to future studies to test interventions derived from our mechanistic findings with the goal of preventing morphologic changes in layer 3 pyramidal cells in AI and assessing the effects on auditory function."
"9397860","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Learning reflects the ability of animals to constantly update their behavioral responses with new information obtained from their environments. Habituation is a simple form of learning, and allows animals to cease responding to repeated and non-threatening visual, tactile or acoustic stimuli. In humans, habituation learning is disrupted in schizophrenia and attention deficit disorders. Yet despite its importance, the genetic  programs and molecular mechanisms that govern the assembly and function of the neuronal circuits critical for habituation are not well understood.  Larval zebrafish exhibit numerous complex behaviors relevant to the study of neuropsychiatric disorders, including prepulse inhibition and startle habituation. The Granato lab has developed an automated, high-throughput assay that measures startle habituation, and has conducted a small molecule screen that revealed that the neuro-pharmacological substrates for startle habituation are conserved between zebrafish and humans. Furthermore, the Granato lab has conducted the first forward genetic screen for genes critical for vertebrate startle habituation. This screen has identified eight mutants with deficits in habituation learning, and the lab has already identified the molecular lesions for three of these mutants. One of the mutant phenotypes is caused by a presumptive null mutation in pregnancy associated plasma protein a (papp-a), a vertebrate specific gene previously not implicated in habituation learning. Although papp-a is expressed in the mammalian brain, its role in nervous system development or function is unknown. Here, I propose to identify where and when this gene acts to regulate habituation (Aim 1). Since papp-a plays a well-documented role in insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, I will determine whether papp-a's regulation of habituation is executed through the canonical IGF signaling pathway or through a novel, IGF signaling independent pathway (Aim 2). To identify additional regulators critical for startle habituation, I will apply whole genome sequencing to identify the genes mutated in two additional habituation mutants isolated in the screen.  Combined, these experiments will characterize the function of the papp-a gene in regulating habituation behaviors and identify novel genes required for the regulation of habituation behaviors in a vertebrate context. These studies will illuminate the cellular and molecular mechanisms required for the development and function of cells mediating startle habituation. Given the importance of startle habituation and learning processes for nervous system function in healthy and disease states, the proposed studies are of high relevance to both basic science and human health."
"8806441","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (Sz) is associated with deficits in cognitive function that represent a core feature of the disorder. Traditional dopaminergic models stress dysfunction within higher order associational brain regions. In contrast, more recent glutamatergic models predict widespread dysfunction across cortical regions, including primary and secondary sensory cortices. Over the past project period, we have documented deficits in early auditory and visual processing in Sz using behavioral-, event-related potential (ERP) and MRI-based approaches, supporting distributed models of cortical dysfunction in Sz. In addition, we have demonstrated significant contributions of early sensory processing deficits to higher order cortical impairments. These studies have permitted us to formulate specific hypotheses concerning neural mechanisms underlying sensory/cognitive dysfunction in Sz, as well as novel approaches to potential treatment development. In the auditory system, early deficits include impaired ability to match tones following brief delay, as well as impaired generation of mismatch negativity (MMN), auditory N1 and auditory steady-state (ASSR) responses. Furthermore, deficits in low level auditory processing contribute to higher order dysfunction, such as impaired ability to interpret prosody, leading to deficits in auditory emotion recognition (AER), which, in turn, contributes to impaired social function. In the visual system, deficits include reduced contrast sensitivity particularly to low contrast, low spatial frequency (LSF) stimuli that preferentially engage the magnocellular visual system, as well as impaired generation of steady state visual evoked potentials (ssVEP), visual P1, and impaired fMRI activation of magnocellular-recipient regions of primary visual cortex. Low level deficits contribute to higher order impairments including in perceptual closure and face emotion recognition (FER). Both auditory and visual deficits contribute to progressive impairment in reading ability, which may be an early marker of Sz. Finally, both auditory and visual deficits correlate with impaired structura and functional connectivity within low level sensory regions, as assessed using diffusion tensor (DTI) and resting state (rsfMRI) imaging. To date, neurophysiological abnormalities have been assessed mainly using time-domain approaches. Over the upcoming period, we will incorporate advanced frequency-domain and oscillatory hierarchical approaches as well, which provide separate indices of spontaneous and event-related dynamics of neuronal oscillations. Visual ERP will be combined with eye tracking to permit evaluation of naturalistic scene processing. We will also explore patterns of dysfunction within both prodromal and first episode (FE) cohorts using paradigms validated during our prior grant cycle. Finally, we will incorporate novel brain stimulation approaches including Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) applied over sensory vs. frontal cortical regions to disrupt local processing in healthy controls as a model for Sz; and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied over sensory or frontal brain regions as a prelude to plasticity-based stimulatory intervention in Sz."

"9274292","Abstract/Summary Core C: Microscopy Core. Diabetes research depends on studies of the spatial relationships of cells within tissues or structures within cells, and the relative positions and amounts of molecular factors at those sites. Microscopy enables the detection of alterations in those differences upon the initiation of disease and/or during the normal developmental and physiologic processes investigated as a component of diabetes research. Purpose: The Microscopy Core consolidates, enhances and disseminates resources and expertise in tissue and cell imaging technologies. The Core provides the following capabilities that, in the past 2 years, were used by 122 researchers in 22 DRC laboratories. DRC use averaged 2,332 hours/year over the last four years.  1. Fluorescence Microscopy. Three optical sectioning (two confocal; one Apotome) and two widefield microscopes with highly complementary capabilities are present in the Core. Up to five different markers may be imaged in a single sample. The inverted microscopes also are retrofitted for live cell imaging studies.  2. High Throughput Fluorescence Microscopy. Up to 80,000 fields per day can be collected on a robotic system for large-scale identification of compounds or factors affecting microscopically measurable processes.  3. Histology. Three microtomes, a cryostat, a tissue processor, a histoembedder and a brightfield microscope are available in the Core.  4. Image Processing. Three computers are available exclusively for post-acquisition image analysis.  5. Information and Training. The Core trains investigators on use of equipment, provides advice on the application of imaging technology, and provides software and reagents for microscopy applications. This includes advice and/or assistance with multiphoton and electron microscopy available in other UCSF Cores. Benefits to DRC Community: The Core accelerates diabetes research by providing DRC investigators access to advanced imaging technology in a practical and economic fashion. 27 NIH-funded and 29 other diabetes- related projects totaling $13,769,481 in annual direct costs currently benefit through these efforts. Technology Development: The Core continues to evolve to meet demand. Over the past four years of operation, existing equipment continues to be maintained under Core recharge mechanisms. New Zeiss Apotome and Leica SP5 confocal microscopes were purchased through shared equipment grants, departmental funds and gifts from donors. Access by DRC investigators to electron microscopy was enabled under an arrangement in which the DRC Core Manager manages microscopes owned by others. For all acquisitions, the DRC Microscopy Core defined equipment needs, acquired the instruments and trained investigators in use of the equipment. Other services under development activities approved by the DRC Executive Committee include three-dimensional imaging on stained, whole-mount tissues. These mechanisms for providing instruments and support will continue to evolve the Core in alignment with DRC needs."
"9430477","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital cataracts are one of the leading causes of blindness among children. For children born with a unilateral cataract, early surgical intervention and consistent optical correction and patching therapy are critical to achieve good vision in this eye. Glaucoma continues to be one of the most serious long term complications in eyes undergoing cataract surgery during early infancy. The Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS) was designed to compare the visual acuity of children after unilateral congenital cataract surgery randomized to either intraocular lens (IOL) or contact lens (CL) correction. Enrollment and randomized treatment of the target sample size of 114 patients (IOL, n=57; CL, n=57) began in December 2004 and was completed in January 2009. We found that the optotype acuity was not significantly different between the study eyes in the two treatment groups at age 41/2 years (p=.54). However, at the full clinical assessment performed at age 5 years, we found that significantly more study eyes in the IOL group had had at least 1 adverse event (p=.02) and at least 1 additional intraocular surgery (p<.001). We also noted that the cumulative incidence of a diagnosis of glaucoma was similar in study eyes in both treatment groups at age 5 years (IOL group, 19%; CL group, 16%). However, using the combined diagnosis glaucoma or glaucoma suspect status, there was a trend noted for more study eyes in the CL group to be affected between ages 1 and 5 years compared to the IOL group (IOL group, 28%; CL group, 35%). In this renewal application for years 13-16 of the IATS, we are proposing to examine these children one more time, in their 10th year (Phase 3), to further elucidate the relationship between initial optical correction, an IOL or a CL, and the incidence of glaucoma. In addition, we will better characterize the longer term myopic shift that occurs in the eyes randomized to primary IOL implantation."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugee children and families who are resettled in the United States face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war- related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond holistically to the needs or priorities of refugee communities; few interventions are designed for use across diverse cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics. Consequently, mental health service usage is low in resettled refugee populations. For refugee children and adolescents characterized by risk factors such as parental trauma, intergenerational conflict and other acculturative and resettlement stressors, preventive interventions hold great promise but are exceedingly rare. Cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of responsive, flexible, interventions to promote healthy family functioning and child mental health and help prevent mental health disparities. We propose a CBPR-driven hybrid implementation effectiveness trial that builds upon ongoing collaborative research and community awareness-raising within Somali Bantu and Lhotshampas Bhutanese refugee communities in New England. Preliminary research and CBPR-based needs assessments with these groups has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of difficult parent-child interactions, poor communication, and family conflict which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Using a CBPR approach, a family based prevention model, the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) was adapted from a tested model used in Africa and designed for delivery by refugee community health workers with through a process involving stakeholder consultation and local refugee Community Advisory Board input. Pilot data on the FSI-R demonstrates strong feasibility and acceptability, but further data are needed on effectiveness as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation by community health workers embedded in refugee-serving social services agencies. Specific aims are to (1) examine the impact of a family-based preventive intervention on outcomes of parent-child relationships, family functioning, and child mental health using a Hybrid Type 2Effectiveness-Implementation Design (families with children aged 7-17 in a two-arm randomized controlled trial); (2) identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the FSI-R by community health workers by conducting a process evaluation concurrent with the delivery of the intervention; and (3) strengthen the science of community engagement to address health disparities by fortifying CBPR-based pathways of change via collaborative partnerships between refugee communities, service providers, and academic stakeholders."
"9251208","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This exploratory/developmental project is designed is to establish novel methodology as a research tool in the PI's laboratory to explore the neurobiological basis of intriguing preliminary findings that brief treatment with the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol significantly reduces ethanol (EtOH) seeking with effects that outlast treatment by several months. A major factor contributing to the compulsive and chronically relapsing nature of alcoholism is EtOH desire elicited by environmental stimuli that have become conditioned to the drug's subjective effects. Indeed, the efficacy of these stimuli to elicit EtOH seeking perseverates over long periods of abstinence despite frequent exposure under non-reinforced conditions, reflective of the compulsive nature of alcoholism. In preliminary studies, cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychoactive and non-addictive component of the cannabis sativa plant significantly attenuated reinstatement in an animal model of compulsive-like perseverating EtOH seeking, with effects that were still unabated five months after treatment termination. These findings suggest that CBD reverses neuroplasticity linked to maladaptive learning underlying EtOH craving and relapse, beyond mere transient pharmacological amelioration of vulnerability to relapse. Insight into the mechanisms underlying these effects may therefore have major implications for treatment drug development and understanding of the neural and molecular basis of compulsive EtOH seeking. The objective of this proposal is to explore the neurobiological basis of CBD's lasting anti- reinstatement actions by exploiting recent advances in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and associated methodologies. These advances, spearheaded by the Co-I, Dr. Hope, permit rapid high-throughput regionally specific identification (neural mapping) of Fos-expressing neurons that encode specific behaviors while at the same time providing RNA in a rapid and quantitative manner to permit characterization of molecular alterations in behaviorally activated neurons from single rats. The research plan is to extend the exploration of CBD's long-lasting effects on responsiveness to EtOH cues and ensuing EtOH seeking at the behavioral level, and to establish FACS and associated methodologies in the lab to identify brain sites and gene expression linked to the lasting attenuation of EtOH seeking by CBD. The results are expected to provide essential insight into neural and molecular targets through which CBD exerts its actions and to lay the foundations for subsequent full-scale projects ranging from systematic investigation of causal roles of identified neural targets and gene expression changes in mediating CBD's interference with EtOH seeking, to utilization of FACS for the identification of key genes and their epigenetic regulatory mechanisms responsible for the persistence of CBD's actions, and thereby to reveal novel therapeutic targets for relapse prevention."
"9232173","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Candidate/Environment: Dr. Shah is a board-certified Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrician who is    committed to engaging in research that bridges the fields of Developmental Pediatrics and Infant Mental Health. She has received training in medical and behavioral sciences and was supported by an early career development award (K12 HD041648) which provided her with introductory training in statistics, resulting in a Master's of Clinical Research. She has develope a programmatic research focus on social-emotional outcomes of infants at developmental risk, with a special focus on these processes in preterm infants. This mentored career development award will allow her to continue her programmatic development in an emerging area of research (outcomes of late preterm infants (LPIs)). She has identified a comprehensive mentoring team at the University of Michigan Center for Human Growth and Development, an interdisciplinary child development research center, to provide methodological and content expertise, including Pamela Davis-Kean, PhD (Associate Professor of Psychology and Center Director: Institute for Social Research); Niko Kaciroti, PhD (Research Scientist of Biostatistics); John Barks, MD (Professor of Neonatology); Brenda Volling, PhD, (Professor and Chair, Developmental Psychology) and Julie Lumeng, MD (Associate Professor of Pediatrics).    The University of Michigan has demonstrated a commitment to her career development. She has also    Identified additional faculty members with specialized expertise in the areas of early brain development    (Hannah Glass, MDCM, UCSF), late preterm infants (Lucky Jain, MD, Emory University), and    neuropsychological assessment (Seth Warschausky, PhD, University of Michigan) who will provide additional training experiences that will integrate with her future career goals focused on understanding the mechanisms in the perinatal and postnatal environments associated with increased developmental risk in LPIs. Training and Career Goals: Dr. Shah's career goal is to improve outcomes for late preterm infants by better understanding the mechanisms in the perinatal and post-natal environments that are associated with increased developmental risk. Her career goals will focus on answering the following questions: (1) What features of the perinatal period are associated with increased developmental risk; (2) How do differences in parenting and the quality of the early caregiving environment modify the developmental trajectories of these infants; (3) Which late preterm infants are most likely to benefit from the provision of early intervention services; and (4) What are the key developmental time periods when intervention effects are most robust, and should be implemented?  To prepare her to address these questions, Dr. Shah has identified 5 key training goals which she will achieve during this 4-year K-award: [1] Develop skills in conducting longitudinal data analysis; [2] Develop knowledge of the biologic mechanisms by which features of the perinatal period may contribute to developmental vulnerabilities in LPIs; [3] Develop increased content expertise and skills in the measurement of family systems and parenting behavior in infancy; [4] Develop skills in primary data collection; and [5] Develop familiarity with neuropsychological tools to assess neurocognitive functioning. These training goals are overseen by an integrated mentoring team, and will facilitate her ability to develop refined hypotheses regarding how features of the perinatal environment may be associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in late preterm infants. Research: Late preterm infants (LPIs) (infants born between 34-36 weeks gestation) account for 75% of infants born prematurely. LPIs manifest increased developmental vulnerabilities compared to full term infants, though reasons for their developmental vulnerability remain largely under-researched. Understanding the biological vulnerabilities and the potential modifiable factors associated with suboptimal development in this population has the potential to inform the clinical management of LPIs in the peri- and postnatal environments. Using a nationally representative sample containing over 1100 late preterm infants, this investigation will address 3 specific aims: SA-1: Examine how variations in brain development characterized by differences in gestational age, neonatal risk and intrauterine growth status are associated with cognitive trajectories of LPIs from 9mo-kindergarten. SA-2: Examine how variations in the proximal (e.g., parenting) and distal environments (e.g., early intervention enrollment and socioeconomic status) are associated with differences in cognitive trajectories of late preterm infants. SA-3: Examine how specific sequelae in the immediate perinatal period and proximal neurocognitive processes (e.g., self-regulation) are associated with differences in cognitive outcomes of late preterm infants. Future Implications: This research can elucidate the perinatal biological and environmental factors associated with developmental vulnerability in late preterm infants. Results can inform practice regarding care in the immediate post-partum period and shape policy recommendations for developmental surveillance for LPIs who account for >400,000 preterms born each year and who currently receive no specialized follow-up care."
"9252472","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intercellular fusion is fundamental to the conception, development and physiology of multicellular organisms. Compared with vesicle fusion and virus-cell fusion, relatively little is known of the mechanistic underpinnings of cell-cell fusion. A mechanistic understanding of cell-cell fusion is not only important for fundamental biology but may also provide basis for its manipulation in therapeutic settings. With the long-term goal of understanding the mechanisms underlying cell-cell fusion, we have reconstituted cell fusion by co-expressing a Drosophila cell adhesion molecule Sns and a C. elegans fusogen Eff-1 in a fly cell line that otherwise does not fuse. Our studies using this culture system have revealed a general function for actin-propelled membrane protrusions in promoting fusogenic protein engagement at the site of fusion, known as the fusogenic synapse. This culture system also provides a great platform for gain-of-function and loss-of-function screens for new components of cell-cell fusion, which are otherwise difficult to uncover by loss-of-function genetic screens due to maternal contributions and functional redundancy. Moreover, this culture system makes biophysical manipulations of cell-cell fusion possible, which is technically challenging in an intat organism. Our recent functional screens using this culture system led to the identification of cholesterol-efflux ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in cell-cell fusion, opening up an exciting new research direction in the field. We will elucidate the molecular function of ABC transporters in S2R+ cell fusion by testing whether the Drosophila ABC transporters function as conventional ABC transporters; whether these ABC transporters specifically transport cholesterol; and whether these ABC transporters regulate cholesterol distribution at the fusogenic synapse. Our recent studies have also identified a role for membrane skeletal protein Spectrin in cell-cell fusion. Spectrin co-localizes with MyoII at the fusogenic synapse and is ideally positioned as a mechanotransducer that links the plasma membrane to the actomyosin network. Moreover, Spectrin is required for restricting the localization domain of the cell adhesion molecule Duf. We will explore how Spectrin restricts Duf localization using a combined approach including biochemistry, genetics and super-resolution imaging. We will also investigate the potential function of Spectrin in mechanotransduction during cell-cell fusion using genetic, cell biological and biophysical methods. These proposed studies promise to bring novel mechanistic insights into the function of lipids, especially cholesterol, and membrane-cytoskeleton mechanotransduction during intercellular fusion."
"9232174","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Most children in school are attracted to science, but only few persist to pursue research as their adulthood career. Even fewer enroll in a graduate PhD or MD/PhD degree, and of these only a relative handful chooses an academic career path. Studies investigating persistence of students in science agree on the importance of hands-on laboratory experience. Vitally, and as we prioritize on precision medicine, the workforce of the future will have to be receptive and prepared to embrace the notions of transdisciplinary and intersectionality over that of individualism. These are difficult concepts to teach in schools wher the didactic material is segmented into subjects and student performance is marked by grades. This results in the student perceiving personal strengths and weaknesses in different fields, which inevitably will reflect in their choices of colleges, majors and adulthood careers. The scope of this application is to take our existing summer student research agenda to the next level with the Futures Matter Program, a 10-week summer research experience on the campus of The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus Ohio. Our reshaped and expanded program will be specifically designed to expose talented students from local high schools to transformative real-life transdisciplinary research in areas aligned with the NICHD priority areas and mission. The Futures Matter Program will leverage our existing community outreach programs to attract underserved students who are an underrepresented minority, economically disadvantaged, and/or disabled. A total of 20 students are planned for the Futures Matter Program with 13 students directly supported from this grant. The organizational structure of The Research Institute into Centers of Emphasis and the proposed structure of the expanded Future Matter Program is ideally suited to provide 1) a high-quality, individual hands-on science experience in state-of-the-art research facilities; 2) exposure to discussions and interactions among researchers with different trainings, skills and opinions yet working together productively, and collaboratively; 3) exposure to educational seminars led by faculty and year-round trainees and 4) additional age-appropriate activities designed to enrich the experience. The complexity of pregnancy, birth and transition to childhood through the neonatal period requires analytic models capable of integrating large sets of biological data along with external modifiers operating dynamically together and over time. What results from these data will need to be practically useful and easily translatable into changes to old practices, new practices and clinica trials. In pregnancy and child-health related research, there is a need to grow a diverse workforce that in addition to in depth knowledge in one field is also willing to explore without fer wide areas of knowledge and seek, motivate and broker additional expertise in many scientific disciplines including bioinformatics."
"9244677","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by a triplet repeat expansion whose abnormal methylation silences expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation protein, FMRP. Loss of function of this neuronal RNA- binding protein results in the intellectual disability, seizures and autistic features characteristic of FXS. FMRP is widely accepted to regulate translation of specific mRNAs and many forms of synaptic plasticity in neurons are dependent on its function. A missense mutation occurring in a Fragile X patient within an RNA binding domain of FMRP is sufficient to cause the disease and abolishes FMRP's polysome association, suggesting that identifying FMRP's mRNA targets and how FMRP regulates their translation is key to understanding the molecular basis for the cognitive and behavioral changes typical of the disease. A new technique designed to capture in vivo interactions of RNA binding proteins with their RNA targets, UV crosslinking- immunoprecipitation combined with high throughput sequencing (HITS-CLIP), was used to identify FMRP- interacting mRNAs in total brain polysomes including a mixture of many neuronal subtypes in different states of development or activity. FMRP was found to regulate mRNAs encoding both pre- and postsynaptic proteins important for synaptic function, suggesting that their mis-expression in the absence of FMRP might underlie defects in synaptic plasticity. This list of 842 FMRP targets is a resource for focusing research to ameliorate symptoms of FXS by inhibiting the activity of proteins that may be overexpressed in the absence of FMRP. To identify the subset of targets of FMRP that are most relevant for phenotypic defects this proposal aims to develop and apply an innovative approach to measuring cell-specific interactions of FMRP with RNA by engineering a new mouse (cTAG) which will conditionally tag FMRP from the endogenous locus in specific cells with temporal control by breeding with inducible Cre lines so that the tag can be used for HITS-CLIP.  FXS arises due to loss of FMRP in the context of normal expression of its two family members, FXR1P and FXR2P, which share some functional redundancy with FMRP. This has led to the fundamental question of whether FXS arises due to loss of a function specific to FMRP and not shared by its paralogs, or whether FXS results from decreased dosage of a family of functionally redundant proteins. This proposal will test in vivo functional redundancy of the three paralogs with regard to RNA interactions, both globally and in specific neurons with FXR1/2P cTAG mice, and test whether increasing expression of FXR1/2P in the absence of FMRP can rescue phenotype. Successful accomplishment of the proposed Aims has significance for understanding the molecular basis of synaptic function as well as the human diseases that result from its dysfunction, including Fragile X Syndrome and autism. Identification of specific, phenotype-relevant mRNA targets of FMRP not shared by its paralogs will focus attention on inhibition of this subset while evidence for redundancy will spur attempts to therapeutically upregulate the levels of the FXR1/2P proteins in FXS."
"9263365","The goal of the Data Management and Biostatistics Core (DMBC) is to create an autonomous and sulf- sufficient data coordinating center to support optimal design, conduct and analysis of the malaria research carried out within the Malawi ICEMR network. Specifically, the Core will update and expand the current network; continue to upgrade, develop and customize the Data Management System based on REDCap; develop a more comphrehensive and reliable sample tracking system; extend and intensify monitoring of study conduct and data quality; increase the capacity to provide biostatistics support; enforce and extend use of secure repositories to file documents and programs; provide mentoring and training to DMBC staff and investigators; maintain and expand the staff of the DMBC to meet requirements for the new project activities. The DMBC will be housed in the Malaria Alert Centre (MAC) on the campus of the University of Malawi College of Medicine, with satellite facilities in the index health centres in Chikhwawa, Phalombe and Karonga. The Malawi team will expand to include a Data Core Leader, 3 Data Managers, 3 Data Coordinators, 2 Data Entry Clerks, amd 1 IT technician. The Malawi team will be supported by a Data Analyst, a contracted SAS programmer, a Data Core Advisor, a Data Management Expert, and a contracted developer. Data will be collected via passive case detection at health centers, active case detection at/near households, during household assessments (for net integrity and to collect mosquitoes) and from laboratory assays (entomological, molecular, immunological). Nearly all data will be captured directly in computers or on tablets. Interfaces between REDCap and the Demographic Health Surveillance system will ensure that data collectors can identify study subjects promptly and accurately. An offline GPS system will allow field workers to locate scheduled mosquito capture points. Data from the field sites will be transmitted to a cloud server through the cell phone network; laboratory data will be transmitted via Ethernet connections. The sample tracking system will use Freezerworks. Data quality assurance and quality control activities will start in the field, even before data are synchronized from tablets, and will continue via regular monitoring, query, and metrics reports. All processes and procedures will be tested before the studies start and will be detailed in Data Management Plans. The Core will also support ICEMR investigators in designing, planning and conducting studies so that all projects comply with high standards of data quality and by providing statistical support for study design, study reporting, and with interim and final analyses. The research projects supported by the DMBC will successfully address scientific questions while complying with all regulatory standards."
"9324469","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main purpose of the Biological Sciences Training Program in the Department of Psychiatry at Yale is to train postdoctoral fellows in biological and behavioral sciences relevant to mental illness and health. To attain this goal, the program recruits two groups of postdoctoral trainees: 1) psychiatrists, generally after completing two or three years of clinical residency, and 2) individuals with a Ph.D. degree in a basic science. To help fill a nationally recognized need, the aim of the program is to both increase the number of research psychiatrists with a grounding in basic biological sciences and to develop the interest of basic scientists in clinical problems as well as in interdisciplinary aspects of thir own basic research. Thus, the overall aim is to promote cross-fertilization between basic researchers and individuals who are experienced clinically. Extensive research collaboration between training program faculty members further contributes to interdisciplinary experience of the trainee. It is expected that trainees coming out of this program will be able to bridge the gap between basic and clinical neuroscience in psychiatry.  There are 29 faculty members in the program consisting of both basic and clinical researcher scientists. The number of postdoctoral training slots requested is five, the same number as the current grant. The program typically involves training for approximately 2 years in one primary discipline but usually includes direct or collaborative interactions with other disciplines. Laboratory training is offered in the followig fundamental areas of research: neurochemistry, molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomics, electrophysiology, systems neurobiology, and behavior. Clinical research training is offered in behavioral assessment, genetic analysis, biological measurements, and imaging techniques. In addition to specific research training, there are courses in Clinical Neuroscience and Neuropharmacology as well as seminars and regular Workshops in which Fellows present ongoing research to the entire group of faculty and trainees.  The training proposal is directly relevant to the research objectives of NIMH by fostering the training of researchers to elucidate the neurobiology of mental disorders and maladaptive behavior. Thus, basic and clinical research is carried out in areas related to anxiety (e.g., panic and post- traumatic stress disorder), obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, affective illnesses (depression and bipolar disorder), and substance abuse. The basic research conducted by the faculty and trainees during their time at Yale and later in their careers will lead to identification and development of novel and more effective therapeutic strategies."
"9352542","Project Summary/Abstract  Excessive production of glucose by the liver plays a central role in the development of diabetes, where the ability of insulin to regulate hepatic glucose production (HGP) is impaired. FoxO transcription factors are major targets of insulin and play an important role in mediating effects of insulin on multiple aspects of glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver, including gluconeogenesis, glycolysis and lipogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which FoxO proteins exert these diverse effects in an integrated fashion remain poorly understood.  During our previous funding period, we found that a) FoxO proteins also exert important effects on intrahepatic lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation via the regulation of adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL), which mediates the first step in lipolysis, and its inhibitor, the G0/S1 switch 2 gene (G0S2), and b) ATGL-dependent lipolysis plays a critical role in mediating diverse effects of FoxO proteins in the liver, including effects on gluconeogenic, glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression and metabolism. These studies also indicate that ATGL-dependent lipolysis is required to mediate effects of FoxO1 on glycolytic and gluconeogenic gene expression, and additional studies are planned in mouse models and isolated hepatocytes to better understand specific mechanisms mediating this novel link between lipid metabolism and glucoregulation by the insulin/FoxO pathway.  In addition, using liver-specific insulin receptor (IR) knockout (LIRKO) and IR/FoxO1 double knockout (LIRFKO) mice, we also found that disrupting FoxO1 in the liver was sufficient to restore the ability of insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis and suppress HGP (based on euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies) in mice lacking the hepatic insulin receptor. These results indicate that (a) inhibition of FoxO1 is critical for both direct (hepatic) and indirect effects of insulin on HGP and glucose utilization, and (b) extrahepatic effects of insulin are sufficient to maintain normal whole-body and hepatic glucose metabolism when liver FoxO1 activity is disrupted. Based on these findings, additional studies utilizing transgenic and knockout mouse models, cell culture and insulin clamp techniques are planned to determine whether ATGL- dependent lipolysis also plays a critical role in mediating effects of FoxO1 on hepatic glucose metabolism in the setting of hepatic insulin resistance, and whether targeting ATGL and its downstream effectors may provide an effective strategy for treatment of diabetes mellitus in patients with hepatic insulin resistance."
"9268462","?    DESCRIPTION:     This Career Development Award proposal, Detection and Treatment of Sarcopenia and Myosteatosis in Older African Americans, was submitted in association with the VA Historically Black College and University (HBCU) Research Scientist Training Program. This proposed study and training program will be jointly conducted at VA and HBCU facilities under the direction of Dr. Michael Harris-Love with project mentorship provided by Dr. Marc Blackman (DC VAMC) and Dr. Vernon Bond (Howard University). The rationale for this study is the high prevalence of excessive intramuscular fat tissue (i.e., myosteatosis) in African Americans, which may worsen the age-related functional decline associated with sarcopenia (i.e., loss of muscle mass) and contribute to a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes. Health disparities associated with age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction may be exacerbated by the lack of a formal screening and diagnosis process for older adults in standard healthcare settings. The objectives of this proposal are to validate a rapid, portable, cost-effective method for screening myosteatosis and sarcopenia using diagnostic ultrasound, and develop a novel approach to progressive resistance exercise involving eccentric muscle actions (i.e., force produced when muscle lengthens) that will counter the effects of myosteatosis and sarcopenia. These objectives will be addressed through a prospective clinical study with a projected enrollment of 140 African American participants (young reference group, 18-30 y.o.; young-old group, 65-84.9 y.o.; 50% female; 70 participants in each group) for a joint VA and HBCU clinical study conducted over a 5-year period. The study is comprised of 2 projects: Project 1: Determine if ultrasound can provide a valid measure of muscle mass and myosteatosis. Muscle mass will be estimated via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and myosteatosis will be measured via computerized tomography (CT) scanning. The ultrasound estimates of muscle mass and myosteatosis will be analyzed for their relationship with the corresponding DXA and CT scan values. The contemporary diagnosis of sarcopenia is a loss of muscle mass with diminished strength or a loss of function. Therefore, 'myosteatosis' will be added to 'muscle mass' as a predictor variable of muscle strength and functional performance to determine if estimates of both muscle mass and muscle tissue composition improve the sarcopenia diagnostic model in African Americans. Project 2: Determine the efficacy of eccentric exercise to mitigate myosteatosis, and increase muscle mass and strength values. Eccentric muscle actions are infrequently used for therapeutic exercise, yet they yield higher forces at a lower metabolic cost in comparison to the concentric muscle actions that characterize conventional exercise. These qualities make eccentric exercise ideal for older adults. Participants in the young- old group will be randomized into eccentric exercise and conventional home exercise groups to engage in a 12-week resistance training regimen. Peak knee extensor/flexor torque and assessments of myosteatosis and muscle mass will be assessed pre- and post-training, and compared between both groups. Completion of this VA HBCU Research Scientist Training Program project will improve our understanding of age-related muscle changes in African Americans, yield tangible outcomes such as the development of a non- invasive, portable sarcopenia and myosteatosis screening method, and provide an innovative intervention approach suitable for older adults with muscle dysfunction."
"9263368","Malaria in Malawi has been recalcitrant to the interventions associated with decreased incidence in some neighboring countries. The reasons for the failure of standard prevention and control measures to reduce the burden of malaria in Malawi remain unknown. One possible component is that current interventions aim to control malaria disease but do not adequately target transmission reservoirs to interrupt the spread of infection in this highly endemic setting. Characterizing transmission from humans to mosquitoes is complex. Identifying which humans harbor gametocytes is insufficient because successful transmission involves multidimensional relationships between human and vector behaviors, and complicated human, vector, and parasite biological interactions. Few studies have attempted to fully describe and model the factors that contribute to human to mosquito transmission, yet this information is essential. Our overall goal is to identify the most important sources of malaria transmission in the human population and to apply this information to optimize the design of new strategies to target these reservoirs. We will conduct longitudinal cohort studies including molecular detection of gametocyte infection, entomological assessments, human behavior characterization and membrane feeds to: 1) systematically characterize human-to-mosquito transmission patterns to identify the important transmission reservoir group(s) for malaria in Malawi, 2) assess the impacts of current interventions on these human reservoirs, and 3) develop analytical models using these data to design and monitor targeted interventions to efficiently reduce transmission. Our previous work has shown that school-age children have the highest prevalence of infection and of infections containing gametocytes, and are more available to vectors due to relatively infrequent ITN use. We hypothesize that school-age children are the primary reservoirs of Plasmodium transmission, that current interventions fail to adequately reach this group, and that interventions targeting this group would considerably reduce the burden of malaria in Malawi. Better understanding of human-to-mosquito transmission dynamics and the transmission reservoirs of Plasmodium in Malawi will improve the design and evaluation of interventions to target the most important human reservoirs of transmission and enhance the impact of interventions. The development of evidence-based targeted interventions will aid Malawi and other high burden settings to tackle the challenge of persistent malaria."

"9244863","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Complex movement disorders (CMDs), defined as disorders in which patients are affected by more than one movement disorder (such as parkinsonism and dystonia, or myoclonus and tremor), are a continuing challenge for diagnosis and treatment. CMDs are usually progressive, prevent patients from performing basic daily functions such as walking, eating, and talking, and result in high disease-associated financial and personal burden for patients and their families. Moreover, the already-known phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity associated with movement disorder genes is quite striking and presents a significant challenge for treatment. Therefore, early diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment to restore motor activities and improve patients' quality of life. Since genetic studies in movement disorders (MDs) have demonstrated their success in the discovery of underlying pathologic processes and have helped researchers to understand both disease manifestation and progression, the identification of genetic factors underlying, or contributing to, the development of MDs provides a powerful tool for understanding their associated pathology. Accordingly, in an attempt to identify molecular networks associated with these CMDs and to facilitate novel treatments, this proposal focuses on the recruitment of familial and sporadic patients with CMDs, and the identification of their disease-causing alleles. Because whole exome sequencing (WES) has proved its ability to identify causative alleles for inherited diseases, even in families previously deemed statistically underpowered for positional cloning, and has become a fruitful strategy for gene identification in both Mendelian and more complex traits, WES, along with SNP-based arrays, which will reduce the search for causal variants, will be used for disease- causing mutation identification in this proposal.  We believe that intense study of these disorders represents a powerful approach to elucidate disease mechanism for both CMDs and for more common disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and will lead to improvements in both diagnoses and treatments. In conclusion, this study will contribute enormously to the identification of novel CMD genes and the characterization of their phenotype, which not only are essential for understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of CMDs, but also for developing more targeted and efficient therapeutic strategies that will be of great benefit to human health."
"9242642","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, damages the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL), which consists of retinal ganglion cell axons. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent irreversible visual loss. Current optical methods used in clinical diagnosis of glaucoma are often limited to assessing RNFL thickness, which is insensitive to detect early glaucomatous damage. Critical barriers to effective early detection of glaucoma include 1) incomplete understanding of the relationship between RNFL optical properties and its underlying structures and 2) lack of knowledge of changes in the relationship in glaucoma. The goal of this proposal is to identify the relationship between RNFL optical properties and its underlying structures. F-actin, microtubules (MTs) and neurofilaments (NFs), the major cytoskeleton of axons, are the possible candidates for RNFL optical properties. In this project, we will 1) determine the role of F-actin in RNFL reflectance, 2) provide quantitative relationships between RNFL reflectance, birefringence and MTs and 3) test if change of RNFL reflectance speckle, an optical interference pattern, can differentiate between normal and glaucomatous retinas. Our central hypothesis is that ultrastructure change in early glaucoma manifests itself as changes in RNFL optical properties. We will test this hypothesis by determining the relationships among RNFL optical properties, axonal cytoskeleton and glaucomatous damage. Our long term goal is to provide sensitive assessment methods for early diagnosis of glaucoma and prevent irreversible visual loss. Aim 1: Hypothesis: axonal F-actin contributes to RNFL reflectance. We will determine F-actin's contribution to RNFL reflectance by depolymerizing F-actin with depolymerizing agents. Significance: Understanding the role of F-actin in RNFL reflectance enables us to assess the capability of RNFL reflectance measurement to detect F-actin alteration, an early sign of glaucoma damage. Aim 2: Hypothesis: change of RNFL reflectance and birefringence can provide a quantitative estimate of MT change in glaucoma. We will determine the relationships between RNFL reflectance, birefringence and MT density by measuring these properties and MT density of the same nerve fiber bundles. Significance: The obtained relationship will provide a direct estimate of MT change in glaucoma. Aim 3: Hypothesis: temporal change of RNFL reflectance speckle can differentiate between normal and glaucomatous retinas. Our recent study demonstrated that temporal change of RNFL speckle is associated with axonal dynamic activity. We will take a series of RNFL reflectance images and quantify RNFL speckle in normal and glaucomatous retinas. Significance: Because glaucomatous damage impairs axonal transport, this study is expected to demonstrate that change of RNFL speckle can detect change of axonal dynamic activity, a novel idea for detecting physiologic activity of axons with non-invasive optical methods. The knowledge gained can be used to design sensitive methods able to detect early glaucomatous damage."
"9274290","Abstract/Summary Core A: Islet Production Core. Islet function and integrity represent a critical node in glucose homeostasis. The Islet Production Core supports research by DRC investigators who analyze the functional responses to genetic or pharmacologic interventions in islets isolated from pancreases of mice and humans. The UCSF DRC also has a very strong islet immunology and transplantation program. Isolated islets are essential for studies oriented towards counteracting islet autoimmunity and minimizing transplant rejection. Purpose: The DRC Islet Production Core consolidates, enhances and disseminates expertise and resources in islet preparation to DRC investigators who currently study or have plans to study pancreatic islet cell biology, islet function and/or transplantation. The Core provides the following capabilities:  1. Islet Purification. Processing and preparation of human and mouse islets for use in islet biology, autoimmunity and transplantation studies.  2. Islet Functional Analysis. Real time biological and biochemical analysis of insulin production and other functional aspects of human and mouse islets to characterize islet activity under different conditions and to assess islet preparation quality for transplantation studies. Benefits to DRC Community: DRC investigators need not commit time and resources to establishing this highly specialized capability within their laboratory. The uniform islet preparation methods used by different DRC investigators also can enable cross-study comparisons to generate unanticipated linkages between studies. 35 different projects totaling $6,580,009 annual direct costs currently are benefiting from this Core.  In the past 2 years alone, mouse islets were prepared a total of 807 times (from 1 to 20 mice per prep) for 12 DRC research laboratories. A further 45 mouse islet preparations were conducted for 3 other investigators as they considered whether their studies had applications to diabetes research. UCSF also has a leading clinical islet transplantation program. The facilities developed for those human islet transplants have been leveraged by the DRC for making human islets available for research studies. In the last year, human research islets were prepared for studies by six DRC investigators. With the capacity of the facilities and the availability of human research-grade pancreases, we propose to provide this unique human islets capability to investigators beyond UCSF (see Regional Core). Technology Development: Unique capabilities in human and model organisms facilitate translational research by Core users at UCSF and throughout the region. The DRC also has robust programs, funded through the DRC grant, that have successfully developed improvements in the monitoring of islet preparation and function. This enables the activities of the Core to benefit not only translational and basic research, but also clinical trials and the patients participating in them."
"9237271","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver fibrosis represents the body's response to chronic liver injury and appears to be similar mechanistically to the fibrogenic response in other organs. The fibrogenic process is a complicated one, but at the same time, highly integrated. The pathobiology of fibrogenesis includes increased production of extracellular matrix proteins, tissue contraction, and ultimately, disruption of normal tissue structure architecture. It has been well established over the last 2 decades that in the liver, a key cellular effector of this processis the hepatic stellate cell. Hepatic stellate cells exhibit a further unique characteristic in that ater injury, they become activated and transform into a myofibroblast. This myofibroblastic transition is characterized not only by increased production of extracellular matrix (resulting in the fibrogenic response to injury), but also the expression of large quantities of the actin isoform, smooth muscle ? actin (also known as Acta2). The result of ongoing stellate cell activation and hepatic fibrogenesis is cirrhosis, which results in many serious clinical complications such as impaired hepatocellular function, hepatocellular carcinoma, portal hypertension with its associated disorders including ascites and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  Because of their central role in fibrogenesis and our goal to better understand the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis,  specific area of investigation in our laboratory has been in the cell and molecular biology of hepatic stellate cells during the activation and wounding response. We have in particular been focused on the stellate cell myofibroblastic transition, and in this application focus on smooth muscle ? actin molecular biology - and its associated cell biology. Thus, in an effort to better understand smooth muscle ? actin biology in stellate cells, we have developed a series of tools, including ideal cell and animal systems that have allowed us to extend our work in a highly novel direction, to include exploration of the regulation of the stellate cell smooth muscle geneti program and the role of smooth muscle ? actin in fibrogenesis. The proposed studies have substantial implications for wound healing biology not only in the liver as well, but also in other organ systems. Finally, we propose a potential translational therapeutic approach as a result of the work with smooth muscle ? actin."
"9315413","1 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  2  1 Physical activity is essential for healthy development in youth and prevention of chronic diseases such as  2 obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some types of cancer. Youth typically need to accrue physical  3 activity across multiple settings, including at home, at school, in recreation areas, and through active travel, to  4 meet the 60 minutes per day guideline for total physical activity. Active travel to school, in particular, is  5 promising for improving youth health because (1) youth who regularly walk to school have an average of 15-20  6 more minutes per day of total physical activity, and (2) less than 25% of youth walk to school, suggesting  7 substantial room for improvement. Walking School Bus programs, which involve adult chaperones walking to  8 school with groups of students, are gaining popularity across the US and world, but little evidence exists on  9 implementation of Walking School Bus programs. Initial evidence suggests that levels of fidelity and 10 sustainability are highly variable in existing programs. The proposed study will use the Consolidated 11 Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and mixed-methods to systematically evaluate 12 implementation contexts (i.e., barriers, facilitators, and processes) and implementation outcomes (i.e., 13 implementation success) within existing Walking School Bus programs. Our team includes experts in youth 14 physical activity, implementation science, qualitative methods, and Walking School Bus practice. Our specific 15 aims are to (1) describe implementation contextual factors that distinguish between existing Walking School 16 Bus programs with high- vs. low- implementation success, and (2) determine whether key program descriptive 17 factors are associated with implementation success. A concurrent mixed-methods design will be used to merge 18 quantitative and qualitative data to maximize the ability to capture both breadth and depth of information. First, 19 we will conduct a brief survey of 200 existing Walking School Bus programs from across the US and world to 20 learn from a variety of approaches. Then, we will interview 12-15 programs with high-implementation success 21 and 12-15 programs with low-implementation success to capture in-depth information on factors related to 22 success. Interviews will be transcribed and content analyzed by two researchers to rate the impact of each 23 CFIR construct on implementation, and garner in-depth descriptions of the implementation factors. The 24 identified best practices, as related to implementation fidelity, penetration, and sustainability, will inform the 25 development of a set of implementation principles and quantitative measures to support a future R01 hybrid 26 implementation/effectiveness evaluation study of Walking School Bus programs across the US. Evidence- 27 informed guidance for implementing effective Walking School Bus programs could have meaningful impacts on 28 improving overall physical activity and population health in youth. Such programs could be better incorporated 29 into existing widespread Safe Routes to School efforts, which receive national funding, to provide a multi-level 30 approach (i.e., social and environmental) for supporting walking to school."
"9328532","Abstract Phosphoinositides (or phosphatidylinositol phosphates, PIPs), resulting from the reversible phosphorylation at the 3, 4 or 5 positions on the inositol ring of Inositol phospholipids, play an important role in various cellular processes, ranging from extracellular signal transduction, vesicle trafficking and cytoskeleton regulation. It is therefore crucial to keep the level of PIPs within the physiological range. Mutations of PIP kinases and phosphatases have been shown to cause various human diseases such as cancers and neurological disorders including Lowe syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Alzheimer?s disease. For instance, subtle changes of PTEN level, a 3?-phosphatase of PI(3,4,5)P3, can increase tumorigenicity tremendously. Voltage- sensitive phosphatase (VSP) is a one of the most intriguing players in PIP signaling. VSPs contain a phosphatase domain (PD) that shares sequence homology with PTEN and a membrane spanning voltage- sensing domain (VSD), which controls the PD. Through the lab?s structural analysis of the inter-domain linker and the PD complemented by Voltage Clamp Fluorometry (VCF) analysis of the conformational changes in the VSD triggered by membrane depolarization, a working model has been proposed in which the conformational change of inter-domain linker induced by voltage-driven rearrangement of the VSD displaces a ?gating loop? in the PD to open access to the catalytic site for PIPs at positive voltage. More recent work from the lab suggested that a further gating loop rearrangement or a change in the shape of the catalytic site may account for the substrate selectivity. This proposal seeks out to answer this question by mapping the movement of the intracellular linker domain and the PD, probing the conformational change in the catalytic site and monitoring molecular dynamic at the single molecule level in response to the voltage changes. These together will help visualize the sequential conformational changes during the enzymatic cycle controlled by movements of the voltage sensor. The major approach includes site-specific labeling with fluorescent unnatural amino acid (fUAA) and Cy-dye incorporated non-canonical amino acid in combination with the voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) and single-molecule imaging/FRET approaches. Understanding the voltage-gating mechanism of the phosphatase activity in VSPs opens up the possibility of modulating the PIPs level in the cells. This would potentially benefit the treatments for many human diseases related to the malfunction of PIP binding proteins in the cell."
"9314745","ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposal is to provide me with the skills and expertise necessary to launch my career in translational medical research in the field of urologic disease, particularly bacterial infections of the urinary tract. To achieve this goal, I will use the K01 mechanism to meet the following training objectives: Objective 1: Generate innovative data for publication in highly regarded peer-reviewed journals. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) disproportionately affect women and are common, costly and sometimes life threatening. Escherichia coli is the most frequent causative agent of UTI, and has been shown in mouse models to establish antibiotic-resistant tissue reservoirs that persist long after acute infection of the bladder lumen is resolved. Bacterial emergence from such reservoirs has long been regarded as one likely origin of recurrent infections in humans. We have shown in a novel mouse model that Gardnerella vaginalis, a common member of the urogenital microbiota, causes E. coli to emerge from bladder reservoirs and initiate a recurrent UTI episode. The experiments outlined in this research plan test the hypothesis that G. vaginalis induces UTI recurrence by damaging the bladder epithelium (Aim 1) and modulating the host inflammatory response (Aim 2). These studies will increase our understanding of the mechanisms driving UTI recurrence and have the potential to identify G. vaginalis as a biomarker of risk in susceptible women. Objective 2: Gain expertise in performing translational research. I will engage in training activities, including seminars and didactic coursework offered by the NIH Clinical Center and through the Clinical Research Training Center (CRTC) of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS) at Washington University School of Medicine. This instruction will teach me the language and procedures of clinical study design and execution and is essential for me to meet my goal of leading a transdisciplinary team doing T1 clinical research. With guidance from my co-mentors and the Research Design and Biostatistics Group of the ICTS, I will hone my skills in this area by performing a nested case-control study that seeks to confirm the findings of our mouse model in human clinical specimens. Objective 3: Develop my professional abilities and grow my professional network. Washington University has a wealth of career development mechanisms offered through the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning, the Offices of Postgraduate and Faculty Affairs and the CRTC. I will attend seminars and courses on research ethics, scientific manuscript and grant writing, academic job interviewing, laboratory finances and management. Additionally, I will attend instructive seminars at national meetings on urology and infectious diseases, where I will present my research findings and network and build collaborative relationships with leading researchers in the field. I have assembled a mentoring committee that includes leaders in the field of UTI research, which will evaluate the completion of both my scientific and career development milestones and facilitate my transition to an independent investigator."

"9474432","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, are serious mental illnesses that occur twice as frequently in women compared to men. Despite this disparity, we do not understand the biological basis of these sex differences. Human studies have revealed differences in the levels of the neuropeptides orexins in anxious and depressed patients compared to controls. Additionally, animal studies have revealed that orexins contribute to the stress response and to anxiety-like behavior. We have obtained preliminary data indicating orexins are differentially expressed in the brains of male and female rats. Consistent with previous research, we found that female rats exhibit a higher hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis response to repeated stress compared with males. Furthermore, females exhibited a stress-related impairment in cognitive flexibility but males did not. Therefore, we hypothesize that this sex difference in orexin expression contributes to the exacerbated stress response and poorer stress-related cognitive flexibility in female rats. The proposed research aims to elucidate how orexins contribute to sex differences in the stress response at both a single cell and behavioral level. Specifically, Aim 1 of this proposal will use in vitro electrophysiology to determine if sex differences are observed i the membrane and firing properties of orexin neurons before and after stress. Morphology of orexin neurons in males and females will also be examined using Neurolucida neuron tracing software. Aim 2 will directly test the hypothesis that increased orexin expression mediates the higher stress response and poorer stress-related cognitive flexibility. We will use DREADDS (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) technology to manipulate orexin action during stress. We expect that inhibition of orexin neurons in females will decrease the stress response and improve subsequent cognitive function. These experiments provide the first evidence linking orexins to sex differences in stress and cognition, but these results will also have immediate implications for treatment. Orexin antagonists are currently used to treat insomnia, so it is crucial we understand how these neuropeptides differ between males and females, as there may be a future need to develop sex-specific guidelines in dosing. Moreover, orexins may regulate stress responses, food intake, autonomic responses, and emotional memory and thereby contribute to a variety of psychiatric symptoms. In this way, targeting orexins may treat a broad range of psychiatric symptoms in a sex specific manner."
"9470143","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to an emerging need for scientists who can bring innovative skills and perspectives to problems in the hearing sciences, we continue to build upon our well established Training Program in Comparative and Evolutionary Biology of Hearing at the University of Maryland, College Park. The 17 Core Faculty in our group bring an extraordinarily broad range of expertise, from cellular and molecular biology to systems neuroscience, while also demonstrating a successful track record in training students. These capabilities allow us to offer a training program that not only emphasizes a comparative and evolutionary perspective to understanding the auditory system, but also does so across different levels of analysis. We propose new approaches to train the next generation of scientists to translate knowledge and methodologies across biomedical sciences, enabling breakthroughs that cannot be achieved through work confined to a single discipline and using a single model system. The next cycle of our training program promotes a focus on translational research, in which we will continue to expand our trainees' appreciation of the biomedical applications of basic research to solving problems concerned with hearing across the human life span, including prevention, diagnosis, and genetics of hearing impairment and relevant therapeutic interventions. Core Faculty are from four departments: biology, psychology, hearing and speech sciences, and electrical and computer engineering. Additional associated faculty from other UMD programs, NIDCD, and other regional institutions, such as the University of Maryland- Baltimore (UMB) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, work closely with the Core Faculty and provide further research and training opportunities for pre- and post-doctoral trainees. The Training Program includes support for five predoctoral and three postdoctoral trainees. Predoctoral trainees are generally selected in middle to later training years, when they are primarily engaged in research. In addition to research training, all trainees take courses in the fundamentals of hearing and research ethics, attend seminars/courses in professional development and translational auditory science, as well as participate in all program activities. Emphasis throughout the program is to expose trainees to the breadth of work done in the program's participating labs, and through this exposure, gain a better appreciation for the range of questions being asked and interdisciplinary research methods applied today in the hearing sciences"
"9379906","Contact PD/PI: Brady, Kathleen Theresa OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY As part of the CTSA consortium since 2009, the South Carolina Translational and Clinical Research Institute (SCTR) created an academic home for clinical and translational research in South Carolina that has transformed the research environment across the state with the goal of accelerating efficient translation of biomedical discoveries into improvements in human health. Headquartered at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, SCTR created a ?front door? for access to statewide research resources, providing more than 700 direct consultations and innumerable website ?hits? each year. We successfully engaged local and regional stakeholder communities in facilitating and guiding research, implementation and dissemination activities. We catalyzed the formation of interdisciplinary research teams through innovative translational pilot projects and integrated training programs. We worked across the state and with national CTSA colleagues to streamline and improve efficiencies in research processes, including the development of a research service ordering and fulfillment system (SPARC) that is deployed within SCTR and four other CTSA hubs. A major focus of this renewal application is to advance Learning Health System (LHS) principles by: (a) providing real-time access to data to guide decision-making and continuous quality improvement efforts, (b) facilitating robust relationships with patients and other stakeholders to ensure clinical and translational research relevance, and (c) fostering a culture of collaboration, teamwork and adaptability. We will work with SCTR affiliates in South Carolina and collaborate with the CTSA Network to achieve the following specific aims: 1) Build on our clinical and translational research strengths to enrich and expand our integrated, statewide research environment and expand our CTSA Network collaborations; 2) Develop and implement high quality, innovative, flexible curricula and training experiences for all levels of the translational research workforce with a focus on enhancing diversity and advancing team science; 3) Promote community engagement throughout the translational research continuum and facilitate robust relationships with patients and other stakeholders to ensure CTR relevance; 4) Create an efficient enterprise-wide clinical and translational research ?Quality System? driven by continuous quality improvement and innovation; and 5) Promote the engagement of diverse populations across the lifespan in clinical and translational research.   Project Summary/Abstract Page 279 Contact PD/PI: Brady, Kathleen Theresa"
"9242105","Project Summary This project will allow us to obtain a greater understanding about Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) in children. The specific aims of this proposal are to develop symptom profiles by creating a symptom assessment tool for children with MPN and examine cytokine and protein derangements, and to identify causative lesions for these diseases using a targeted genetic analysis (since these lesions are likely different than the causative lesions identified in adults with MPN.) We have begun to leverage a state-of-the-art genomics platform, analyzing 600 genes relevant to MPN and hematological malignancies, to identify novel targets in pediatric MPN patients. The long-term goals include gaining an understanding of the genotypic- phenotypic correlations of MPN so that risk stratifications and treatment algorithms can be designed to manage these children, as well as identifying new or relevant molecular targets for novel therapies to be used in children with MPN, and to allow for future clinical trials to be developed in this population. This proposal will help the PI develop the additional skills needed to become an independent clinical researcher and physician- scientist specializing in pediatric MPN, through research plans, formal didactic coursework, and individual tutorials with her expert advisory committee members. This proposal is highly relevant to the NHLBI's mission of translating basic discovery into clinical practice and helping improve the health and lives of individuals living with blood diseases."

UW-Madison has a long and rich history as an international leader in basic, translational and clinical cancer research reflected in its history of two NCI-designated and -funded cancer research centers founded by Dr. Harold Rusch on the UW-Madison campus. The McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research was founded in 1940 and received its initial NCI funding in 1946. UWCCC has received continuous NCI funding since 1973 when it was awarded NCI funding as one of the first six comprehensive cancer centers. After a coordinated process during the late 1990's, both centers were consolidated under UWCCC in 2001 when the first NCI Cancer Center Support Grant representing the consolidated centers was awarded. The consolidation of the two centers has generated tremendous enthusiasm and growth for cancer research on the UW-Madison campus over the past ten years. This has resulted in a Center greater than the sum of the two parts existing before the consolidation. With the completion of the Wisconsin Institutes of Medical Research (WIMR) Tower 1 in 2008 and with Tower 2 completion projected for 2013, UWCCC will have approximately 350,000 sq ft of contiguous space dedicated to cancer clinical care and research, a nearly three-fold increase over the past ten years. In addition, the new Wisconsin Institutes of Discovery (WID), a $200 million UW-Madison central campus research facility that also includes the privately-operated Morgridge Institute for Research (MIR), opened in 2011. WID/MIR will house 10 focused research teams of four or more faculty each. Five of these teams are led by UWCCC members representing a strong cancer research presence in the WID/MIR. Three quarters of the faculty in WID will be new recruits to UW-Madison. The three future highest goals of UWCCC are unchanged from the current goals: 1) to conduct the highest quality research into the origins and control of cancer; 2) to translate these research findings to evaluation in the clinic through well-designed clinical trials with corresponding biologic endpoint whenever possible; and 3) to provide the best care possible to all cancer patients by carefully integrating high quality, cutting-edge care with clinical research in a compassionate and individualized manner. UWCCC has $30.7 million in NCI funding (direct) and a total of $83.7 million cancer focused research funding."
"9297942","Confirming the efficacy/mechanism of an adaptive treatment for adolescent anorexia nervosa In adolescent anorexia nervosa (AN) 30-40% fully recover with Family Based Treatment (FBT) and remain so 3-4 years after treatment, but those who do not remit have a high risk of developing enduring AN with accompanying co-morbidities, much reduced quality of life, premature death, and for which there is no evidence-based treatment. Studies of FBT find that weight gain by session 4 predicts outcome in 85-90% of cases;  thus, one way to improve outcomes in line with precision medicine is to match treatments to patients depending on weight gain at session 4 by offering an alternative treatment to meet the specific needs of poor early responders (~44%). The aim of this study in response to RFA-MH-16-425 is to determine if an adaptive outpatient treatment compatible with FBT could significantly improve outcomes by addressing poor early response and add to our understanding of the mechanisms of treatment in FBT. We developed a 3- session (Intensive Parent Coaching-IPC) intervention to increase parental skills at re-feeding for this poor early responding group demonstrating the feasibility of using a randomized adaptive design employing IPC. Compared to expected weight restoration rates in poor early responders, 50% more participants achieved weight restoration than expected with an average mean weight of 96.7% by EOT (preliminary efficacy signal of Cohen's d= 0.82). Previous studies have shown that FBT specifically targets parental self-efficacy as the mechanism to promote weight restoration in their children with AN. Consistent with these studies, data from the current pilot RCT suggest that parents whose children do not gain 2.4 kg by session 4 report lower levels of self-efficacy related to re-feeding as early as session 2; however, after receiving FBT+IPC, parental self- efficacy scores in this group improve and become indistinguishable from those of parents of early responders. While these preliminary data are promising, a sufficiently powered and controlled RCT using an adaptive randomized design employing FBT+IPC as the adaptive intervention for poor early responders is needed to understand the role of parental efficacy and re-feeding behaviors in FBT before recommending an adaptive approach. To conduct an adequately powered study (0.87 (alpha=.05, two-tailed)), 150 adolescents (75 per site) will be randomized at 2 sites (Stanford University and the University of California, San Francisco) to either standard FBT or an adaptive treatment arm (FBT+IPC) where those who do not gain 2.4 kg by session 4 will receive additional treatment (FBT+IPC). Assessments (blinded to treatment condition) will be conducted at baseline, 3, 9 (EOT) and at 6 and 12-month follow-up. Our primary outcome will be achievement of weight remission (>94% expected mean percent BMI adjusted for age, height and gender).  "
"9263465","Summary Despite having reduced malaria transmission to historically low level, in many Asia-Pacific countries endemic areas transmission continues and common vector control tools seem not able to interrupt transmission. The reasons for the resilience of malaria transmission are on unclear but are likely to involve not only parasite but also host and vector factors. At low transmission, asymptomatic infections account for up to 90% of infections and it they are able to transmit efficiently they could be a key component of the infectious reservoir. The only way to accurately ascertain if an infection can transmit is to feed the blood to mosquitoes and determine rate and density of infections of the mosquito midgut. Such xenodiagnostic studies are severely lacking, in particular in predominantly P. vivax endemic area. We are now proposing to conduct an in-depth dissection of the contribution of host, parasite and vector factors to maintaining malaria transmission by conducting a set studies that combine assessment of the infectivity of well characterized field samples using direct membrane feeding (DFMA) with in-depth laboratory studies in 3 sites with substantially different transmission scenarios. Initially we will investigate the relative infectivity of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections establish the association of parasite and gametocytes density with infectivity and study effect of transmission blocking immunity, vector microbiome and type parasite for gene associated with evasion of mosquito immune responses and markers of artemisinin and partner drugs resistance to determine their effect on transmission potential. As parasite and gametocyte fluctuate over time, so may their infectivity. We will therefore determine the temporal variation in infectivity an in-depth cohort study in PNG, where asymptomatic carriers will be followed for 3 weeks and mosquitoes fed every 3-4 days. Addition, we will determine proportion of pre- and post-treatment infectivity in in artemisinin-resistant and sensitive symptomatic P. falciparum. Together with our large epidemiological datasets (see Project 1), this will allow us not only clarify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission but also resistance may come with a transmission associated fitness cost, which may slow down the spread of resistance. Both human and vector behavior may limit human-vector contact in the Asia-Pacific, where vectors are frequently / predominantly outdoor biting, leading to transmission away from people?s dwelling. The low biting rate and unclear location of human-vector contact makes it difficult to identify its determinants. We will we study patterns of human vector contact by determining the presence of antibodies against salivary gland protein antibodies proteins from An. dirus. An. minimus and An. Farauti in samples from cross-sectional and cohort studies in Project 1. By providing an in-depth understanding of the transmission characteristics at each of our sites, the proposed studies will not only contribute to developing biologically accurate transmission models but will help us design better methods to track and eliminate transmission even in hard to track populations such asymptomatic carriers."

A standardized protocol for treatment and data collection is being used by all centers. The primary outcome is change in Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) score assessed longitudinally at follow-up, taking place at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months following the initial treatment session. Secondary outcomes include change in TQ sub-scores, in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Tinnitus Functional Index scores, and in the visual analogue scale of the TRT Interview. Other secondary outcomes include audiometric measures, psychoacoustic measures, and change in quality of life. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of TRT (DC and conventional SG) compared with SC. The secondary objectives are to evaluate (1) the efficacy of DC plus placebo SG versus SC, and (2) the efficacy of conventional versus placebo SG in study participants assigned to DC. We hypothesize that (1) full TRT will be more efficacious than SC, (2) DC + placebo SG will be more efficacious than SC , and (3) conventional SG will be more efficacious than placebo SG, in habituating the tinnitus awareness, annoyance, and impact on the study participant's life. Study centers will include a Study Chair's Office, Data Coordinating Center, and Clinical Centers housed in U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force military hospitals. Results from the TRTT are anticipated to impact the clinical practice for severe debilitating tinnitus."
"9263364","The Malawi ICEMR will be administered from two offices: one at Michigan State University (MSU), and the other at the center of the research activities, the Malaria Alert Centre (a research affiliate of the University of Malawi College of Medicine), in Blantyre, Malawi. Dr. Terrie Taylor, the Program Director (Administration) will lead the Administrative Core. She divides her time between Malawi (January-June) and Michigan (July- December). The MSU office will be responsible for the overall fiscal management, all travel arrangements (domestic/US and international) and for coordinating ICEMR teleconferences. The Blantyre office will be responsible for fiscal management of the subcontract that supports 26 team members in Blantyre + 40 field workers across three different field sites. In addition, the local human resource management, procurement, and program management activities will be centered in the Blantyre office. A redundant system for Internet access is another responsibility of the Blantyre Administrative Core; maintaining functional Internet access is critically important for the electronic data capture that is the backbone of the field-based data collection activities, and for the frequent teleconferences that are important for coordinating the Projects and Cores. The Administrative Core will be responsible for coordinating the monthly Steering Committee meetings, the regular Core and Project team meetings, for writing the annual Progress Reports (and developing the attendant budgets), for organizing the twice yearly meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) (one face- to-face, one virtual), and for facilitating communications within the ICEMR, between ICEMRs, and with the NIH. In Years 3-7 of ICEMR 2.0, the Administrative Core will coordinate the application process for Special Projects, including internal review by the ICEMR Steering Committee, and external review by the SAG. The Administrative Core will work with the Special Project awardees to ensure that the projects have the appropriate regulatory approvals, and that the work is carried out in a fiscally-responsible manner."
"9036367","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug users with and at-risk for HIV continue to have poor access to health care and poor treatment outcomes. In addition, opioid addiction involving prescription opioids has skyrocketed. In this proposal for a mid-career investigator award, Dr. Chinazo Cunningham proposes to address the opioid epidemic and its intersection with HIV infection by: 1) becoming an internationally recognized leader in the field of drug abuse and HIV, expanding her research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research [CER] methods and complex clinical trials methods); 2) developing a standardized and structured mentorship approach to mentor junior investigators to conduct patient-oriented research related to drug abuse and/or HIV infection; and 3) becoming an effective leader in academic medicine, ensuring that the institutional infrastructure facilitates junior investigators obtaining skills necessary to become independent investigators. To achieve these goals, Dr. Cunningham will participate in courses and national conferences, have directed readings, and regularly meet with national leaders in related fields. Dr. Cunningham will particularly focus on mentoring women and racial/ethnic minorities-two groups who are under-represented in senior positions in academic medicine and NIH-funded research. Dr. Cunningham will utilize her existing research program as a foundation for which she will provide mentoring and expand her research skills to include CER and complex clinical trials methods. The aims of her research are to: 1) test the efficacy of a 16-week abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention on HIV viral load suppression among opioid-dependent HIV-infected individuals, using a randomized controlled trial design; and 2) examine mechanisms of achieving viral load suppression with the abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention. Dr. Cunningham's future research will include the establishment of a comprehensive live database of all opioid users within a large urban medical center. This database will be used to examine health outcomes associated with types of opioid use and to develop and test interventions focused on opioid use. Dr. Cunningham's long-term career objective is to improve access to care and health outcomes among drug-abusing populations with or at-risk for HIV infection by developing interventions that can reduce their disparities in health care and health."
"9274297","Abstract/Summary Administrative Core. The UCSF Diabetes Research Center (DRC) provides Programs and Cores that foster research collaborations and interactions to accelerate the pace of diabetes research. The Administrative Core is charged with providing leadership that responds nimbly to the current and future needs of DRC members. The Administrative Core is responsible for evaluating and setting the goals of the Center and for allocating and coordinating Center resources to ensure that the DRC evolves in alignment with those goals. The Administrative Core realizes these tasks by providing a defined governing structure that coordinates leadership, infrastructure, administrative support, advice and oversight to all DRC activities. The Center Director (or when absent, the Associate Director) provides day-to-day leadership and interacts regularly with the Directors of the DRC Research Programs, DRC Cores, DRC members and administrative staff. The Center Director and the Directors of the four Research Programs (in Islet Biology, Obesity & Metabolism, Autoimmunity & Inflammation, and Translation) constitute the Executive Committee. The UCSF DRC interfaces with its membership, the NIDDK, other NIH Diabetes Centers, and the lay community through the Center Director and the Executive Committee and through outreach programs including the Enrichment Program, the Pilot & Feasibility grant program, DRC service/training Cores and the UCSF DRC web site The Executive Committee is the major, governing body that sets the long-range goals of the DRC and assesses how well the Programs and Cores achieve them. The Executive Committee meets quarterly and, when necessary on an ad hoc basis, to consult with and provide guidance to the Director of the Pilot & Feasibility Program, the Director of the Enrichment Program and the Core Coordinating Committee, which consists of all five DRC Core Directors and an overall Director of Cores who oversees the day-to-day coordination of Core activities. The Core Coordinating Committee discusses issues and solutions related to Core operations and the provision of Core services to the DRC membership. The Executive Committee also evaluates proposals from the Core Directors and Core Managers for the development of new Core services and triages DRC support for those service development proposals according to current and future DRC needs. The Executive Committee also evaluates the external reviews from the Pilot & Feasibility applications, ensures continuing mentorship and advice to Pilot & Feasibility grant recipients and evaluates DRC membership. The Executive Committee meets annually with an External Advisory Committee which provides valuable insights into the scientific and operational directions of the DRC. A biannual meeting of the Executive Committee with an Internal Advisory Committee, which consists of institutional leaders with interests in DRC-related research, coordinates DRC progress in relationship with developments and goals throughout UCSF. The Administrative Core thus coordinates all DRC activities to coordinate the future of diabetes research at UCSF."
"9246984","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning."
"9411541","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposed SBIR Phase I is to complete the proof-of-principle of a novel blood based biomarker assay for the diagnosis and management of Sepsis, pScreen-Sep(tm). pScreen- Sep(tm) has several unique features. It is fully disposable (single use) and does not requires external electronic equipment (i.e., benchtop or handheld devices), hence it is easy to use and very affordable; it is also a quantitative and sensitive platform, hence it provides an accurate and precise quantification of the level of key sepsis biomarkers, such as procalcitonin (PCT). Current research has shown PCT to be a promising biomarker for indicating early onset of sepsis in at risk patients. Severe sepsis, systemic infection and organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion, affects over a million Americans every year, and the incidence of sepsis is increasing at a drastic rate. Severe sepsis kills 20-50% of patients and is the 10th leading cause of death overall in the US, while patients who survive often experience pain, impaired physical functionality, and overall worse health than the general population during their lifetime. Sepsis and related hospitalization cost over $20 billion annually in the US alone, making it the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals. One of the major challenges associated with effective sepsis treatment is the difficulty  in early recognition and diagnosis. Starting antibiotics within one hour following the observation of hypotension was found to significantly decrease mortality from sepsis, yet over 50% of patients do not receive antibiotics from more than six hours following onset of hypotension. One study showed that survival decreased by 7.6% per hour that antimicrobial therapy was delayed in the first six hours following the onset of hypotension. A clear and critical need for a prognostc tool exists for diagnosis and management of sepsis. Our solution enables physicians and first responders to rapidly monitor and diagnose potential sepsis at the Point-of-Care of patients. pScreen-sep(tm) is based on a patent-protected technology developed at Carnegie Mellon University, which has been extensively verified in our laboratory. In this Phase I proposal, we will optimize key elements of our latest prototype and complete a detailed validation study that includes positive and negative controls. A clinical trial to support the FDA premarket approval would then follow in a Phase II effort."
"9318667","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a new training program, Psychosocial Determinants and Biological Pathways to Healthy Aging (PATHWAYS), that builds on our established track record in pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training. Consistent with goals of NIH to encourage interdisciplinary training and research, the PATHWAYS program focuses on the junction of behavioral, social and biological research. In addition, our training program is positioned to meet a critical set of training needs that have been identified as central to NIA's Division of Behavioral and Social Research 2013 BSR Review Committee Report. Specifically, this report identified the high priority area that illuminates the pathways by which social, psychological, economic and behavioral factors affect health in middle-aged and older adults. The PATHWAYS training program will fill a unique niche in the NIA portfolio by providing cutting-edge training to graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who are focused on understanding the linkages among behavioral, psychosocial and biological mechanisms that codetermine healthy and unhealthy aging. We request positions for 2 new pre-doctoral trainees and 2 new post-doctoral trainees per year. Each trainee will be enrolled in the program for approximately 2 years. In addition, academic units affiliated with the training program and the office for Penn State Vice President for Research have committed a combined total of $831,950 in real dollar matching support to the PATHWAYS T32 training activities. This support will cover the tuition and stipend costs for up to an additional 6 pre-doctoral trainee slots over the course of the training program. The combined sources of funding will result in training a total of up to 1 pre-doctoral and 8 postdoctoral trainees throughout the proposed 5 year funding period. Trainees will be provided with the foundational training needed to integrate a broad range of psychosocial and biological concepts, and to use advanced data acquisition and analysis methods in their own research. Additionally, all trainees will receive instruction in research ethics and in approaches to research with underserved minorities. Faculty for this training program have active and funded research programs on various aspects of health in adulthood and later life and a strong record of collaboration and mentorship. Our expected outcome is to train a cadre of scholars who will go on to careers in research that explore the interface of stres and health in adulthood and old age, and who bring to their research knowledge of basic and emerging methodological approaches for addressing the types of multidimensional and longitudinal data needed to tackle key issues in this field."
"9257190","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The potential involvement of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans with blood lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and weight maintenance has gathered significant scientific attention. Until recently, the persistence of BAT from childhood into adulthood was thought to not occur. Prior research linking the presence of BAT inversely to development of metabolic syndromes was performed in animal models (chiefly mice and rats). Little, however, has been determined clearly regarding the function of BAT in humans (hBAT). This limitation could be due in part to a lack of techniques permitting longitudinal study of the function of hBAT with excellent temporal resolution. Despite the recent advent of MRI-based imaging techniques quantifying BAT mass and detecting activation by thermometry, the primary technique used to date has been 18F-FDG-PET/CT. In addition to its radiation exposure risk, the technique has come under scrutiny for its likelihood in underreporting the prevalence of hBAT: Glucose uptake by BAT is not the preferred energy substrate. Recent report of the detection of BAT in mice using lipophilic hyperpolarized (HP) natural abundance xenon-129 gas dissolved in the blood compared favorably with 18F-FDG-PET/CT for detecting BAT activity and thermogenesis. However, xenon imaging of BAT has not been performed to date in humans. Therefore, in our work we will have subjects inhale hyperpolarized xenon-129 gas to obtain sub-second acquisition of MRI images of BAT activation in an upright posture 0.05 T clinical multi-nuclear imaging system. In addition to the primary goal of successful detection of hBAT activity by HP 129Xe, our study will examine differences in activation after hBAT thermogenesis stimulation of lean and obese adult humans selected for age, gender, and body mass index. In pursuit of these goals, in this study we will pursue the following three Specific Aims: [1] Construct 129Xe radiofrequency detection coils for a 0.05 T clinical imaging system interfaced to a clinical 129Xe hyperpolarizer; [2] Develop 129Xe imaging protocols for the 0.05 T MR scanner; [3] Detect brown adipose tissue response to thermogenesis stimulation in adult humans. Impact: Molecular imaging of hBAT by highly polarized (>50%), low-cost (<$20/dose), natural abundance 129Xe will provide an efficient and sensitive means for conducting longitudinal intervention studies seeking to counteract metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes by enabling therapeutic enhancement of hBAT activity."
"9251795","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With 17% of American adults (36 million) reporting some degree of hearing loss and 14.9% of 6-19 year-old children displaying hearing loss of greater than 16 dB in at least one ear, auditory deficits constitute a significant health concern. These deficits can be genetic, noise-induced, or drug- induced, and often involve hair cells, our auditory detectors and amplifiers. Understanding the mechanisms underlying normal auditory sensation is thus essential to developing new therapeutic interventions for these deficits. This study proposes to elucidate the molecular basis of fast adaptation, one of the processes underlying sound detection by hair bundles, our mechanosensitive organelles. Fast adaptation is a rapid calcium-sensitive negative feedback mechanism that resets the hair bundle's operative range after stimulation. In this study, I propose a novel approach wherein hair bundles are permeabilized to allow direct control of the internal calcium concentration. The calcium concentration will be increased through photolysis of caged calcium compounds, granting me exquisite temporal and spatial control over it, with minimal diffusion-related delays. I will detec a hair bundle's calcium-dependent motion with a flexible glass probe attached to the hair bundle's side. This preparation will allow me to determine whether fast adaptation occurs through one of the several currently proposed theoretical models, and to construct a new model if not. I will then identify a molecular candidate for the mechanism of fast adaptation by studying its properties, such as calcium affinity, and modulating specific candidates known to be present in the mechanotransduction apparatus, such as myosin, calmodulin, and the transmembrane-channel-like proteins (TMC 1 and 2). Elucidating the mechanism of fast adaptation will be a significant development in our understanding of hearing, and will open the door for future investigations of fast adaptation's role in the active process."

"9269896","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this three-year postdoctoral training program is to empower the applicant with the necessary skills and network to establish an independent laboratory in the United States studying regeneration in newts (salamanders). Newts are critical components of the regenerative research landscape due to their ability to replace complex body parts after loss. Limb regeneration is an important model in this regard. Central to newt limb regeneration is the formation of a blastema; a heterogeneous mass of cells that develop into the new limb. Despite its centrality, we have a minimal understanding of the blastema and lack any specific expression markers. The applicant will identify the genes and cis-regulatory elements that regulate blastema formation in the Iberian newt and develop fluorescent expression markers to identify blastema cell types in vivo. This will be accomplished through the following research plan. First, functionally relevant genomic regions will be sequenced and assembled by a combination of whole genome sequencing and selectively sequencing open chromatin (Aim 1). Second, using single-cell transcriptomics, the cell types contributing to the blastema at will be classified and marker genes identified. Additionally, by integrating this single-cell transcriptomic information with obtained genomic sequences, cis-regulatory elements that are over- or under- represented in blastema markers genes will be identified (Aim 2). Third, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, transgenic newts expressing fluorescent blastema markers will be developed (Aim 3). The identified genes, cis-regulatory elements and transgenic newts will offer unprecedented knowledge and tools to further understand the regulation of regeneration, thereby enabling the applicant to begin a promising independent career in regeneration research."
"9258474","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Platelets play a major role in the development of atherothrombotic cardiovascular diseases. Platelet hyperaggregation is an important intermediate phenotype for myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, and strokes. We have discovered and replicated GWAS signals for platelet aggregation in two-generational families of premature coronary disease probands (GeneSTAR), 334 European Americans and 232 African Americans. These families are highly enriched with both platelet hyper-aggregation and incident acute cardiovascular events. Although platelet aggregation is highly heritable, all of the identified GWAS signals together explain only a small fraction of its variance among individuals. In addition, most of the identified GWAS signals are located in introns and intergenic regions, so it is not clear how the variant is functionally related to the aggregation response. In this application we propose to discover new pathways regulating platelet aggregation by determining which genes are expressed in subjects with platelet hyperaggregation. By sequencing the entire platelet transcriptome we will identify changes in the amount or quality (e.g., splice variants) of mRNA transcripts that are associated with specific platelet hyperaggregation phenotypes. Our aims are to: (1) use a unique family-based design to discover the genes that are differentially expressed in white and African American subjects with platelet hyperaggregation compared to control subjects, (2) leverage our prior GWAS to identify eQTLs associated with transcript expression to help prioritize transcripts/genes for further study, and (3) use quantitative mass spectrometry to determine whether changes in gene expression in hyperaggregating platelets are accurately reflected in corresponding changes in expressed proteins. This study will produce a complete quantitative inventory of all mRNA transcripts present in platelets, as well as a complete eQTL map of genetic loci responsible for transcript expression specifically in platelets in both European and African Americans. The inclusion of both ethnicities will allow us to both replicate mRNA findings and amplify biological insights, given the different LD patterns of the two groups. The results will provide new insights into the functional pathways mediating the most important genomic associations with platelet hyperaggregation identified in previous GWAS studies. We expect that our studies will identify previously unknown proteins and biological pathways responsible for platelet hyperaggregation, which may then serve as new therapeutic targets and ultimately more effective and specific approaches for inhibition of platelet function in the large number of people at risk for thrombotic vascular occlusions being treated with anti-platelet therapy."
"9309257","Project Summary This is a 4-year renewal for a multi-generation, 30-year longitudinal study of families at high- and low-risk for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The project has yielded important findings on the familial transmission of mood disorders and has contributed to the field's understanding of the long-term temporal sequences of  disorders from childhood to adulthood, as well as the neurobiological correlates of these processes. However,  despite these advances, the mechanisms through which familial risk leads to offspring impairment remains  underdeveloped. NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) offers a compelling model for testing potential  mechanisms, by proposing functional systems (?constructs?) that combine neurobiological and behavioral  information. This renewal therefore aims to prospectively test whether RDoC constructs are mechanisms  (i.e., mediators) through which family history leads to adult functional outcomes and symptom trajectories. Leveraging a rich, 30-year, 3-generation longitudinal dataset, we will integrate data from multiple units of analysis (multiple MRI modalities, electrophysiology, behavior, and self-report) to define latent variables corresponding to 3 latent RDoC constructs: Acute Threat, Approach Motivation, and Response Inhibition. First, we will quantify the  test-retest reliability of our RDoC indicators (MRI, physiology, behavior, etc.) by re-assessing each of these  indicators in a representative subsample of participants (Aim 1). This is an important first step as it will afford robust modeling of the latent RDoC constructs and bolster the premise that the RDoC constructs are trait-like (i.e., stable) mechanisms of familial transmission. Second, we will use structural equation modeling to create the 3 RDoC constructs from these indicators and their reliability estimates. We will then prospectively examine whether the 3 latent RDoC constructs instantiate mechanisms by which family history of MDD leads to  negative outcomes in adulthood (Aim 2). Third, we will leverage our multigenerational dataset to examine the  inter-generational transmission of the RDoC constructs. We will test the incremental validity of the RDoC constructs over DSM defined psychopathology by examining whether their familial transmission is independent of the  familial transmission of MDD (Aim 3). In sum, this renewal application advances this multi-generation study  toward a focus on mechanisms of risk ? a critical step to developing novel interventions to prevent negative adulthood outcomes associated with familial depression. In addition to our Specific Aims, this renewal will also afford the opportunity to furnish the data from this unique study (i.e., many thousands of clinical and neurobiological data points collected from families from 1982? present) onto the NIH RDoC repository, making this 30-year longitudinal dataset available to the entire  scientific community."
