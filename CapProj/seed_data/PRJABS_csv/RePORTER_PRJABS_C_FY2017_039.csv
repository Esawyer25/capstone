"9495669","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While some patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) have etiologies limited to peripheral or end- organ dysfunction (e.g. bladder, urethra, vagina, prostate and/or pelvic floor muscle dysfunction), we hypothesize that many patients have central or systemic pathophysiologic processes contributing to their symptoms. For example, women and men with a history of childhood or adult trauma and those with psychological co-morbidities may represent one group of patients who have a systemic process causing or contributing to their LUTD. To better understand and develop targeted treatment approaches for patients with such central LUTD, the Iowa Research Site proposes to perform multicenter and multidisciplinary research with other sites to 1) develop and test an innovative symptom-based instrument for men and women which will better characterize LUTD patients' urologic symptoms and symptom-related bother and 2) collect detailed and extensive longitudinal data (including symptom-based outcome measures and biomarkers) in men and women with LUTD to better understand phenotypic subgroups of patients. We will recruit equal numbers of men and women with clinically- and urodynamically-defined LUTD, including detrusor overactivity with or without urge incontinence, stress urinary incontinence and obstruction. Data collection will occur at baseline, monthly and at 12 months, including symptom progression and flares. Furthermore, we will obtain both systemic (salivary cortisol, serum C-reactive protein, and resting heart rate and blood pressure) and urinary (inflammatory cytokines, neurotropins, stress proteins, tissue remodeling proteins) biomarkers related to neuroendocrine dysfunction and systemic inflammation, which may correlate with systemic vs. peripheral LUTD phenotypes."
"9279109","Overview. The Pilot and Feasibility Project (P/F) program is an important component of Core Center activities that facilitates and promotes GI research at JHU. The highest priority of our P/F program is to provide financial support, mentoring, and training to young investigators who have shown interest and significant promise in GI research. In addition, our P/F program supports highly innovative research of more established investigators who are not currently working in the GI field but are interested in applying their expertise to studies that answer important mechanistic questions related to digestive disorders. In agreement with the NIDDK guidelines, the P/F program can offer established GI investigators support to develop new areas of GI research, although we have not yet funded proposals in this category due to lack of compelling applications and our priority of funding young investigators. In the first 3 years of its existence, the P/F program has funded 11 applications; all of those were from junior investigators. In the fourth year, we selected for funding two applications from young investigators and two from more established investigators currently working in non-GI fields. Altogether, over the 4 years, the average success rate (funded/submitted) of applications is 25%, the applications from young investigators represent 82% of funded projects, and the applications from established investigators new to the field constitute 18% of funded projects. Our P/F program has significant outreach, attracting applicants and members from both clinical and basic science departments. About half of our awardees (54%) came from the Department of Medicine, another half (46%) ? from the Departments of Cell Biology, Physiology, Pediatrics, Biophysics, Genetics, and Material Science and Engineering. Over three years, the P/F program invested $275,000 and yielded $2,410,000 of new funds from various sources, an 8.7 fold return on investment (calculated on one year funding, direct costs; considering 5 year funding, yield is $8,800,000, direct costs, a 32 fold return). In agreement with NIH guidelines, evaluation will also be done at 5 and 10 years after investment. Main Goals. Our broad Specific Aims remain the same as previously and follow the NIH guidelines for the P/F programs under the Silvio O. Conte Digestive Diseases Research Core Centers. Specifically, the P/F program will provide financial support to three categories of investigators, with highest priority for category 1: 1) Young and new investigators without current and prior NIH support (R01, U, or P grants) as Principal Investigators, who show interest and great promise in GI related research 2) Investigators, who have NIH funding (at the time of the awards or had such funding in the past), are established in other research disciplines, and have expertise that would move digestive disease research at JHU forward but have not previously taken part in GI research. The supported projects would test innovative tools and concepts in the experimental systems relevant to the digestive tract. 3) Investigators already working in digestive diseases, who propose to make a substantial change in the direction of their research. The P/F awards will support projects that aim to generate additional preliminary data necessary for full-size grant applications to the NIH (the R01 mechanism) as well as other funding agencies. Applications from new and establish investigators that test novel concepts, utilize innovative experimental systems or propose to carry the GI research at the interface of different disciplines will have significant support. In addition to financial assistance, the P/F program offers mentoring and guidance to recently appointed young investigators, as well as opportunity to showcase their research and test their ideas. Specific plans to achieve our goals. The main approaches to application solicitation, selection, and review will remain unchanged from our current P/F program, based on the success we have had with this program. Specifically, identification of P/F projects for funding will follow a 5-step process (outlined in detail in the application) including advertising, internal review for eligibility, evaluation of scientific merit by our External Scientific Advisory Committee (an independent external committee), final selection, and feedback to all (successful and non-successful) applicants. We will further streamline the application process and introduce a pre-application Q&A session (see below) to familiarize the potential applicants with the guidelines as well as review process. We will also continue our program of regular evaluations, as well as encouraging wider dissemination of the P/F results. A newly begun feature of the P/F program involves a brief introductory presentation of the P/F by new awardees at Work-in-Progress at the beginning of the academic year and summary reports by past awardees ending each academic year. We will also enhance current mentoring of young trainees. We will continue to encourage applications from this group for larger NIH R01-type grants; however, a new feature of our P/F program is to advise the applicants to send their grants for initial evaluation and feedback to a recently established JHU ?Experts panel? composed of senior scientists with significant expertise in grant writing/reviewing."
"9303338","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While it is established that the incidence of gastric ulcers in the elderly is primarily due to increased use of NSAIDs and other medications, and increased H. pylori infection, the tissue's ability to repair gastric injuries is impaired. Our impression that ulcers heal normally in the aged stomach is false. The available treatments for peptic ulcer are essentially based on gastric acid suppression with anti-secretory drugs and the eradication of H. pylori infection. Despite the evidence that shows ulcers and their complications are a burden that is focused in the elderly, there is a lack of knowledge as to the molecular mechanisms that disrupt repair even after H. pylori eradication within the aged stomach. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) develop an understanding for the process of gastric regeneration, and to then 2) identify the mechanism by which the basic aging process of the stomach leads to an epithelium incapable of repair in response to injury. The acquisition of such knowl- edge is the first step in a continuum of research required to achieve our long-term goal to understand the proc- ess of gastric epithelial repair in response to injury. The central hypothesis is that loss of Hedgehog signaling within the normal stem cell environment of the aged stomach results in impaired regeneration of the stomach in response to injury. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data that show during re- pair of the stomach in response to ulceration there is the emergence of Spasmolytic Polypeptide/TFF2- Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM) cells at the base of ulcer margin. Our data suggest that SPEM represents the major reparative lineage responsible for wound healing after severe gastric ulcer injury. We have also identi- fied that the cell surface protein CD44, in particular its variant isoforms (CD44v), marks a population of cells within reparative SPEM glands that express Hedgehog receptor Patched (Ptch). Moreover, Hedgehog proteins Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) are key regulatory factors that play reparative roles in re- sponse to injury by regulating macrophage infiltration and CD44v expression, respectively. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis is tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) what is the mechanism by which Hedgehog signaling regulates gastric epithelial repair? And, 2) what is the mechanism by which the aging process of the stomach leads to disrupted repair? The hypothesis will be tested using bone marrow chimeras, heterochronic and isochronic parabioses, a mouse injury/transplantation model using mouse- and human- derived gastric organoids and lineage mapping experiments. At the completion of these studies, we expect to define the molecular events that are crucial for the repair of the gastric epithelium. Outcomes from the pro- posed studies are expected to have significantly advanced our current knowledge of the mechanism by which aging leads to disrupted epithelial repair. The rationale that underlies the research proposed is to develop the potential for testing therapeutic target efficacy and other strategies, such as stem-cell therapy, for the regen- eration of the aged stomach."
"9291460","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glomerular disease is the third leading cause of end stage renal disease in the US, with its related health care costs estimated at $4.1 billion annually. Nephrotic syndrome (NS), characterized by podocyte injury, is one of the most common forms of glomerular disease. Importantly, progressive podocyte injury and loss are also known to be critical determinants of glomerular disease progression. Since the signaling pathways in podocytes most critical for regulation of injury are not yet known, there is an urgent need to better understand which pathways are most able to regulate podocyte injury and recovery to enable the development of more targeted and effective therapies for NS. Our long-term goal is to define specific molecular signaling pathways able to regulate podocyte injury in NS to develop more targeted and less toxic therapies for NS. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the ability of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?), and MAPK signaling pathways to regulate podocyte injury, and to exploit this knowledge to develop more effective novel therapies for NS. Based on this, we hypothesize that specific manipulation of the GR and PPAR? nuclear receptor pathways and MAPK pathways, and cross-talk among them, will reduce podocyte injury during NS. The rationale for the proposed studies is that specific manipulation of GR-, PPAR?-, and MAPK-mediated pathways or cross-talk among them can ameliorate glomerular injury in NS, and will enable the development of more effective novel approaches to treat NS in the future. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine if manipulation of critical components of GR and PPAR? nuclear receptor signaling can enhance podocyte protection from injury, 2) To determine the extent and biologic significance of cross-talk among the GC-, TZD-, and MAPK-mediated signaling pathways during podocyte injury, and 3) To determine if manipulation of GC-, TZD-, and MAPK-mediated signaling can ameliorate glomerular injury in animal models of NS. These studies will identify specific potential targets for future drug therapy in NS, and potentially many other glomerular diseases where podocyte injury plays a central role. Validation of these podocyte signaling components as potential drug targets will guide the development of more targeted, more effective, and less toxic therapies for one of the most common kidney diseases in the US."
"9280762","Aging is commonly associated with impaired memory, which is thought to result from altered synaptic connectivity and function in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), comprised of the hippocampus and medial temporal cortex (entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal regions). Recent studies in rodent models and humans identified two particularly vulnerable elements within the MTL, the layer II pyramidal cells in the lateral entorhinal cortex, and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the dentate gyrus. These two neurons types are crucial for processing in the dentate gyrus (DG) subfield of the hippocampus. The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) cells, along with the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), provide the bulk of the excitatory input to the granule cells in the DG. At the same time, the integrity of inhibitory circuits within the DG are important for ?sparse encoding? in DG contributing to pattern separation. Both, LEC cells and interneurons show early alterations in their molecular make-up during aging that are tightly coupled to memory loss. Notably, levetiracetam treatment (LEV), an intervention that restores mnemonic capabilities in elderly humans and rodents also restores molecular signs of dysfunction in LEC layer II neurons and dentate interneurons. The central goal of Project 3 will be to advance understanding of how aging affects the functionality and plasticity of these circuits at a synaptic level.  Project 3 will combine optogenetics with synaptic electrophysiology for in vitro studies on the strength and function of the two entorhinal input streams (LEC and MEC), the local inhibitory connections in the DG, as well as on the effects of therapeutic interventions on these circuits. We hypothesize 1) that aging alters the functional balance of LEC and MEC inputs to DG in aged rats with cognitive impairment, contributing to the predominance of MEC processing over input from LEC as observed in the encoding properties of hippocampal neurons, 2) that inhibitory function in the DG is crucial for preservation of cognitive performance during aging and may be achieved in unimpaired aged rats in a compensatory manner that distinguishes those aged rats from young adults, and 3) LEV treatment improves cognitive performance by restoring functionality in the balance of EC inputs to granule cells, and/or by promoting compensatory changes in the inhibitory DG network. The proposed studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of how neurocognitive aging affects synaptic function in vulnerable DG/Hilar circuits, and will further our understanding of how therapeutic interventions can ameliorate the effects of aging on cognition."
"9296125","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The LURN Research Network was formulated in order to: 1) develop and test symptom-based measurement tools (patient-reported outcomes) to quantify and measure the entire spectrum of lower urinary tract disorders (LUTD) in men and women, 2) conduct in-depth phenotyping of targeted LUTD subpopulations, 3) identify methods or biomarkers which correlate with clinical symptom initiation or progression, and 4) distribute findings to the research community. This proposal from a team of experienced clinicians and researchers at the University of Michigan demonstrates our ability to recruit men and women with a broad range of LUTD. A series of innovative phenotyping studies are then proposed in order to help the LURN address its stated goals. Our group is committed to working collaboratively with the LURN network to recruit patients into existing protocols or to help in the development of new studies related to symptom measurement and phenotyping. Specific Aim 1 is to successfully recruit patients into the LURN network. The recruitment team includes Urologists (n=5), Urogynecologists (n=4), Family Medicine physicians (n=3), and Physician Assistants (n=2). This group has well established and ongoing clinical and research collaborations, and has demonstrated the ability to recruit a broad range of male and female LUTD patients for research studies, including urinary incontinence, voiding dysfunction, and pelvic pain. Specific Aim 2 is to conduct innovative phenotyping studies in subgroups of LUTD patients. We describe three phenotyping projects which assess different potential etiologic mechanisms for LUTD. Project 1 correlates measures of global (non-urologic) sensory sensitivity with LUTD symptoms. We hypothesize that global sensory abnormalities will be less common in LUTD patients than in pelvic pain patients recruited through the NIDDK MAPP research network. Project 2 will measure the degree of lower urinary tract fibrosis utilizing novel urine markers. We hypothesize that the degree of fibrosis will correlate with LUTD symptom severity in men and women. Project 3 will assess urethral function using urethral pressure profilometry in women with urge urinary incontinence and asymptomatic controls. We hypothesize that women with urge incontinence symptoms will have poor urethral urethral function compared with asymptomatic controls. These three phenotyping projects are designed to identify clinically relevant subgroups of LUTD patient who may benefit from unique, targeted therapies."
"9280924","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the United States and worldwide, impacting the risk and prognosis of many diseases, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, and certain cancers. Therefore, developing prevention and treatment strategies for obesity and its co-morbidities is of the utmost importance for the healthcare and scientific research communities. Brown fat plays a pivotal role in adaptive thermogenesis, a physiological process during which energy is dissipated in response to environmental changes, such as cold temperature and diet. Although brown fat was once considered only necessary in infants, recent studies have provided evidence that, contrary to prior belief, this tissue is present and active in adult humans. The unique property of brown fat to mediate energy expenditure and thermogenesis depends on the presence of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial ion carrier that is uniquely expressed in brown fat and permits proton translocation through the mitochondrial inner membrane, thereby uncoupling respiration from ATP synthesis and facilitating fatty acid oxidation and dissipation of energy. Thus, identification of agents that promote UCP1 expression and function would provide potential avenues for the development of new anti-obesity therapies. We have recently discovered that members of the paracrine Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family can robustly induce UCP1 expression and increase mitochondrial function. Building on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that the paracrine FGF functions as a new regulator of mitochondrial activity and thermogenesis by inducing UCP1 expression and promoting fuel utilization. We propose to directly test this hypothesis by determining the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating FGF's effect on UCP1 expression and mitochondrial function using both in vitro and in vivo systems. Success of the proposed studies would not only launch a new paradigm of energy regulation but also create potential therapeutic approaches to treat obesity and its many related disorders."
"9293308","TR&D1: Rotating Frame MRI Techniques:   Exchange Mediated Imaging Biomarkers    P.I: Ravinder Reddy, PhD  Co-investigators:  Ravi Prakash Nanga PhD, Catherine DeBrosse BS, Arijitt Borthakur PhD, and Hari Hariharan PhD  ABSTRACT   The major barriers for progress in the field of biomedicine are limitations of existing methods in  detecting and quantifying molecular changes during preclinical stages of disease. In this TR&D, as  emphasized by several compelling collaborative projects, we propose to develop and optimize several  molecular MRI biomarkers based primarily on chemical exchange phenomenon.   The primary advantage of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) methods is that, depending  upon the rates of exchangeable spins, they inherently have an order of magnitude or greater sensitivity  advantage over conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In the previous funding period, we  have developed several amine and hydroxyl group based CEST imaging techniques to measure endogenous  metabolites from brain, skeletal muscle, heart and cartilage. While we have made significant progress, as  demonstrated by the number of publications, the methods developed so far have been limited to single slice  imaging with long acquisition times and suboptimal corrections of field inhomogeneities that preclude their  broader application.   To address these issues, in this competing proposal, we will develop and optimize 3D CEST imaging  methods for amine and hydroxyl CEST imaging, with built-in provisions for radiofrequency and static field  inhomogeneity measurements. Custom designed saturation pulses integrated with different 3D readout  strategies will be investigated to determine the optimal method for a given application. In order to improve the  temporal resolution we will also develop and optimize methods for integrated single shot z-spectrum from  localized regions of tissues and evaluate its feasibility in measuring amine and hydroxyl CEST effect from  different organs. Finally, we will design and evaluate a method based on the transverse relaxation (T1? and T2)  enhancement by intermediate to fast exchanging systems (TRACE) and compare its performance with the  conventional CEST in terms of sensitivity and temporal resolution. Successful accomplishment of these aims  will lead to imaging-based biomarkers that are noninvasive and nonradioactive, with high spatial and temporal  resolution. These biomarkers will aid in study of pathologies associated with neurodegeneration,  neuropsychiatric disorders, oncology, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal disease, thereby contributing to  fundamental understanding and improved health care."
"9280923","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 2002-2012, the NIDDK sponsored Phases 1 and 2 of the prospective Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, which enrolled >3,900 adults with chronic kidney disease at seven Clinical Centers to address the overarching goals of identifying risk factors for kidney disease progression and clarifying the relationship between renal dysfunction and the risks of subclinical and clinical cardiovascular events, death, and resource utilization. The initial five-year follow-up of Phase 1 was extended by an additional five years in Phase 2, which ends April 2013.

CRIC-Phase 3 will become an unparalleled resource that will expand the science related to chronic kidney disease natural history as well as the impact of kidney dysfunction on the development and progression of cardiovascular disease and other adverse events. Specific Aims to be addressed by the Kaiser Permanente Northern California/University of California, San Francisco Clinical Center are: 1. To re-enroll a high percentage of CRIC-Phase 1 participants into CRIC-Phase 3. 2. To recruit and enroll an additional cohort of 215 participants with less severe CKD into CRIC-Phase 3. 3. To collect exposure and outcome data per the CRIC-Phase 3 protocol.4.To maintain high levels of retention in the study. 5. To investigate clinical events and obtain supporting medical records and documentation. 6. To enter data and process/ship biological specimens. 7. To implement local quality assurance and quality control procedures as a means to obtain standardized, high quality measurements. 8. To monitor data collection, data entry, and follow-up rates. 9. To participate in governance and oversight of CRIC through study-wide subcommittees and activities. 10. To publish and present findings from the CRIC Study. 11. To promote and support the conduct of ancillary studies in CRIC, including collaboration with the broader nephrology research community."
"9309124","Contact PD/PI: GINSBERG, HENRY N NRSA-Training-001 (406) TL1 Precision Medicine Program Abstract Our goal is to establish the TRANSFORM TL1 Precision Medicine (PM) Program to provide training and mentoring in the methods and applications of PM to pre-docs, post-docs, junior faculty, and a wide range of research personnel. PM is the right treatment for the right patient at the right time; it offers the opportunity to increase effectiveness of health care at reduced cost with improved outcomes, decreased adverse effects, and greater patient satisfaction. Through a suite of innovative programs, we will enhance career development, translational capabilities, and collaborative skills of faculty and research team members from diverse disciplines around the theme of PM. Our goals are to: (i) develop innovative education and career development programs, building on and extending our many successful existing programs, that will build competency in our scholars and trainees to engage in interdisciplinary teamwork, make new discoveries, and translate those discoveries to clinical practice/patient benefit; (ii) demonstrate the effectiveness of those programs through continuous monitoring and assessment for quality improvement, using key metrics to evaluate the impact of our educational programs on research output, career trajectories, and continued engagement in biomedical research; and (iii) To disseminate findings on novel educational delivery approaches, new methods for assessing student learning, and best practices in enhancing interdisciplinary team science skills to our partners at Columbia, the members of the CTSA consortium, and educational programs throughout the nation. Columbia University is a significant contributor, nationally and world-wide, to research in genetics, genomics, data science, phenotyping and risk prediction, biomarker development, and the molecular basis of human disease; as well as to interdisciplinary team science training. These strengths will allow us to offer new and enhanced coursework in PM; create pre-doc and post-doc programs to increase competency in PM; develop short-term training that allows pre-docs to gain facility with PM strategies and methods; and evaluate our educational efforts in an ongoing way to improve programming. In 2013, Columbia's President, Lee Bollinger, announced the University-wide PM Initiative aimed at bringing together all units within Columbia to address the full spectrum of research, education, and implementation sciences in this field. Thus, this is the ideal time to undertake these goals. We are confident we can achieve these goals because of the outstanding CUMC research portfolio, the momentum provided by the new, University-wide PM initiative, our 10+ years of experience in administering successful training and mentoring programs, and the personnel and infrastructure provided by our Irving Institute resources. Through all these means, we are poised to contribute substantially to NIH's goal of building a larger and exceptionally well-prepared biomedical research workforce prepared to advance health through the potential of PM.

"9280744","The Administrative Core (Core A) is led by Dr. Michela Gallagher, who serves as the P.I. of this Program Project grant. The Administrative Core plays an integral role in the research program by coordinating activities and interactions between the Cores and individual projects. The roles of the Administrative Core include 1) animal/tissue assignment to the Projects from Core B, 2) oversight of data transfer from the Projects to Core C, and 3) transfer of Core B data for routine analysis and archiving by Core C, achieving an organizational structure whereby all records of planned research, active experiments, and completed research, including publications, are coordinated and maintained with a central point of contact. The Administrative Core organizes program events and meetings, including meetings with our external scientific advisory board. The participation of a scientific advisory group in our planning/review process provides valuable oversight and consultation. In addition to such meetings, all investigators, including Core and Project Leaders are updated on the work in the research program through regular group meetings and Core A's data sharing function. Together, these activities are integral to guiding the research program through each annual cycle of planning, discovery, and evaluation of research findings/productivity. In these functions, the Administrative Core contributes significantly to the integration of work in the research program with transparency and building consensus on decisions. The Administrative Core has well-established procedures for all of its functions. With respect to the assignment of resources for experiments (animals and tissue), under our long-established system, unique identifiers for each subject/sample ensure that studies in the Projects are conducted blind with respect to cognitive status. Data transfer through the Administrative Core to Data Management (Core C) provides a clear point of contact to ensure complete archiving (data obtained/transferred for all assigned animal resources) and for tracking progress on research in the Projects. The meetings of the entire program project, along with updates managed by the Administrative Core, are integral to the review of our progress, plans for the future, and integration of the program. The Administrative Core also provides routine support for the overall Program Project (oversight of finances, compliance with all NIH guidelines, progress reports and continuation applications). Finally, in addition to its functions in resource sharing (animals/tissue, data) within the research program, the Administrative Core also oversees, manages, and coordinates resource sharing with outside investigators."
"9304291","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  The purpose of this Program Project Grant is to identify brain circuitry that regulates EEG arousal and airway opening during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and to design and test new therapies in OSA patients based on that information. Patients with OSA lose tone in their airway dilator muscles as they sleep, resulting in collapse of the airway and apnea. As CO2 levels rise, there are progressively more vigorous attempts to breathe, until finally there is EEG arousal, the airway opens, and breathing is re-established. These arousals occur as many as several hundred times per night, fragmenting sleep and resulting in cognitive impairments; accelerated atherosclerosis, and increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction; and metabolic syndrome with obesity, which in turn makes the OSA worse and further increases cardiovascular risk. Our investigators have found that in some apnea cycles, patients may generate sufficient airway dilator tone to reopen the airway, without EEG arousal. In such subjects, delaying the EEG arousal may permit the patients to generate enough airway dilator tone to avoid arousals. Our goals then are to find pharmacological means to delay EEG arousal while augmenting airway dilator tone, so that OSA patients have fewer apneas, or if they occur, are able to re-establish the airway without EEG arousal. Projects 1-3 work on the first goal by identifying the brain circuitry that causes the arousal to rising arterial CO2. These projects seek to identify the neurotransmitters and receptors involved in CO2 arousal, as targets for pharmacological manipulation. Project 4 focuses on the control of the genioglossus muscle, the largest airway dilator. It will examine the inputs to the genioglossus motor neurons that suppress tone during sleep, so that we can pharmacologically augment genioglossus motor tone. Project 5 is a human study that uses our hypotheses about control of EEG arousal and the genioglossus muscle to generate and test a novel therapeutic approach to OSA. We hope that as we learn more about this brain circuitry in Projects 1-4, we will to refine our treatment methods in Project  5. Interactions among these Projects are also fostered by frequent meetings organized by Core A, including tri-weekly Investigator Meetings, attended by all Investigators, in which the Projects  take turns presenting their progress and receiving feedback from colleagues to further improve their work; and by annual meetings of our Internal or External Advisory Boards, which provide input from outstanding scientists in this field that inform and refine our scientific approach. In addition, Projects 1-4 share many cutting edge optogenetic and patch clamp physiology methods that benefit from interactions with the Molecular Biology Core B and Electrophysiology Core C. The long term goal is to find a pharmacological approach through which at least a segment of the OSA population can reduce the frequency of apneas and subsequent EEG arousals, thus reducing the cognitive, metabolic, and cardiovascular consequences of OSA."
"9334686","PROJECT SUMMARY (CORE A) The overall goals of the Administrative Core (Core A) are to provide scientific, programmatic and fiscal leader- ship, facilitate lines of communication between the different researchers involved in the PPG, maintain cohe- rence in the PPG's overall and long-range goals, and ensure that resources resulting from the PPG will benefit the scientific community.

In the context of the above, the task of Core A will be the effective coordination of the activities of all the components, such as the selection and design of jointly used models and resources (mouse lines, transposon reporters, sequencing strategies, etc.), the development of new technologies and tools to more effectively promote the research goals, providing statistical services to the members of the PPG, and enabling the scientific community access to the PPG's resources, technologies, and databases. The following activities will also contribute to achieving the overall goals: 1) Core A will ensure that the administrative and financial requirements of the NIH and the participating institutions are met; 2) Core A will organize monthly videoconferences and annual face-to-face retreats; 3) Core A will be responsible for communications between the PPG and the NIH; 4) Core A will facilitate the submission of joint publications and, in collaboration with Core B, the deposition of high-throughput datasets into public databases; 5) Core A will establish the External Advisory Board (EAB) and organize the annual reviews of the PPG."
"9376844","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer cells are characterized by a metabolic reprogramming involving a switch from mitochondrial respiration to aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect and by an elevated level of oxidative stress as a result of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). While low levels of ROS activate signaling cascades, excessive levels of ROS cause cell death. Therefore, cancer cells need to develop mechanisms to maintain ROS at moderate levels. Components of the respiratory chain in the IM generate superoxide (O2) on both sides the IM; both in the matrix and in the IMS. In the matrix, SIRT3 regulates the activity of the superoxide dismutase SOD2, which converts O2 into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the expression of SIRT3 is reduced in 87% of breast cancers and this effect is essential for the Warburg effect. Our work shows that increased expression of SOD1 and its import into the IMS is essential to counterbalance the decrease in SIRT3 so that the total levels of O2 in cancer cells remain moderate. Since we found that the increase in SOD1 is independent of oncogene, increased expression of SOD1 maybe a universal housekeeping function of cancer cells to support their metabolic reprogramming. We show that SOD1 levels are regulated by the mitochondria ubiquitin ligase Mulan. Further, we found that accumulation of ROS in the IMS leads to the elimination of Mulan and the stabilization of SOD1. These findings suggest that Mulan acts as a gatekeeper to limit the entry of SOD1 into the IMS. To further test the essential housekeeping function of SOD1 in cancer and to dissect this entirely new mode of regulation of SOD1 by Mulan, we propose the following specific aims: Specific aim 1: In vivo validation of SOD1 as a target for therapy. Specific aim 2: Testing the regulation of SOD1 by Mulan. Specific aim 3: Regulation of Mulan by oxidative stress."
"9278248","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): UNICEF estimates there are 153 million children and adolescents in the world for whom one or both parents are deceased; millions more have been abandoned. The majority live in low- and middle-income countries such as Kenya. Compared to non-orphans, orphaned youth are at higher risk of HIV, malnutrition, other childhood morbidities, and stigma and discrimination. Our long-term goal is to gather and disseminate evidence on how to improve the health and well- being of orphans and vulnerable children so they can become healthy, well-adjusted adults. A variety of governmental and non-governmental programs and care models have emerged in an effort to fill the gap in care for the millions of orphaned children and adolescents in need. Phase I of our cohort study described models of care for orphaned and separated (abandoned) children and adolescents (OSCA) living in institutional and family-based settings and evaluated the effect of care environment on their physical and mental health. Now in its 4th round of annual assessments, Phase I suggests that OSCA in CCI's are healthier and possibly happier than those in FBS. The primary objective of Phase II is to better understand and explain these differences. We will maintain the cohort and examine specific aspects of their care environments, their cost-effectiveness, and the inter-personal characteristics that predict better physical and mental health outcomes over time and across the developmental spectrum. Enabling the present and future generations of orphaned children, adolescents and youth to develop into healthy, well-adjusted, and productive adults will yield dividends in the economic and political stability of nations such as Kenya. This work directly responds to the mission of NICHD in its aim to ensure that all children, including orphans, have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability, and to ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of them through optimal care environments."
"9278103","The primary objective of this project is to capitalize on a variety of existing data sources by integrating and analyzing them in novel ways to answer key questions related to the chronic effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in Veterans over time. Although prior studies have found that moderate and severe TBI are associated with a variety of adverse clinical outcomes, the effects of mTBI are less well understood. We propose to address this gap in knowledge through four complimentary Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to examine the association between mTBI and important shorter-term clinical outcomes such as accidents and injuries in Veterans from recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, focusing on identifying factors associated with resilience and the potential benefits of adequate treatment. In Aim 2, we propose to expand these analyses to include Veterans from all eras and to study longer-term clinical outcomes including neurosensory disorders and mortality, focusing on the potential confounding effects of comorbid medical conditions and the impact of their treatment. In Aim 3, we propose to identify different trajectories of mTBI-related comorbid burden, with the goal of identifying factors associated with being in low and high distress trajectories. Finally, in Aim 4, we propose to lay the groundwork for future analyses using more detailed and unified mTBI data by developing the groundwork to create a National CENC Data Repository (NCDR). Together, these Aims will advance our knowledge of the effects of mTBI on important clinical outcomes in Veterans of all ages and eras in a highly efficient manner and will provide insight into potential strategies for prevention and intervention."
"9502002","While most women are overweight or obese when they reach menopause, we know little about how obesity  affects this transition and its impact on metabolic health. We have hypothesized that the enhanced  production of estrogens in peripheral tissues of obese women protects adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and  bone from the menopause-related decline in function. We have merged well-characterized preclinical  models of obesity (obesity-resistant/prone rats) and menopause surgical ovariectomy (OVX) to study how  pre-existing obesity affects this transition. In the first aim, we examine obesity's effects on the loss of  ovarian estrogen production and its impact on energy balance, fuel utilization, and metabolic health. The  role of extragonadal estrogen production in obesity's effects will be dissected with the use of aromatase  inhibitors.  Diet-induced weight loss is common in women with weight control problems, but the body compensates with  homeostatic adaptations that drive weight regain. The loss of ovarian function in weight reduced women  may exacerbate this metabolic drive to gain weight and create a potentiated vulnerability to metabolic  disease. Regular exercise and estrogen have many overlapping effects on energy balance and fuel  utilization that may counter these consequences to energy homeostasis and disease. In the second aim,  we examine how energy restricted weight loss from obesity affects the drive to gain weight and the decline in  metabolic health after the loss of ovarian function. The impact of regular exercise, with actions that reflect an  estrogen mimetic, will be examined in weight reduced subjects.  These studies will provide insight into how one of the most common preconditions of menopause, obesity,  affects the loss of ovarian function and its consequences to energy homeostasis and metabolic disease.  Observations from these studies may provide evidence that certain populations of obese woman (treated  with aromatase therapy, energy restricted) who may be particularly vulnerable to menopausal weight gain  and metabolic disease unless they maintain a program of regular physical activity."
"9353206","The implementation science literature underscores the challenges associated with moving research to routine practice, and acknowledges the importance of building the literature base to facilitate scale-up of evidence- based practices. In our proposed U19, our interdisciplinary research team is committed to working with HIV+ youth and youth at risk of infection to improve their health and well-being and to develop the IS field by employing three types of effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs, all addressing self-management: 1) a Type 1 design (Belzer and Brown) in which the primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of clinical intervention with a secondary aim to better understand the context for implementation; 2) a Type 2 design (Parsons) in which the primary aims are to determine both the effectiveness of the clinical intervention and the feasibility and utility of an implementation strategy; and 3) a Type 3 design (Naar), in which the primary aim is to determine the utility of an implementation strategy with a secondary aim on assessing effectiveness on cascade-related outcomes. Consistent with our overall goal of advancing implementation science, our team has established an Implementation Science Core (ISC) to maximize efficiencies across projects and has adopted an implementation conceptual model, Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-Sustainment (EPIS), to ground implementation planning, research, and measurement across the studies. In particular, the Research Projects will examine EPIS inner and outer context factors across phases?from exploring ways to improve fit to characteristics that may influence active implementation, such as the sociopolitical context, leadership, facilitator attitudes toward evidence-based practices, fiscal viability, and acceptability and feasibility of interventions. Specifically, the ISC will: (1) facilitate and support a unified approach to implementation science research particularly as it applies to self-management by HIV+ or at risk youth; (2) provide resources to support early career and other investigators in the newly developed ATN4 with implementation science issues related to their studies; and (3) increase dissemination of interventions, support materials, and implementation study findings relevant to adolescent HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. The inclusion of the ISC provides an opportunity for synergy across Research Projects to systematically expand the implementation science research related to youth HIV self-management interventions, a contribution to field and to those looking towards avenues of scaling up such interventions."

"9293204","PROJECT SUMMARY  Attentional deficits diminish the quality of life for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, however the neural basis for this early impairment is not understood. In mouse models of AD, excitatory neurons are hyperactive near amyloid deposits, which could contribute to defects in information processing underlying behavioral dysfunctions. We hypothesize that hypofunction of cortical GABAergic circuits near amyloid deposits is associated with the aberrant network activity and attentional deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will measure the electrophysiological properties of the major subtypes of GABAergic neurons in an AD mouse model. We will also characterize the dendritic morphologies of the inhibitory interneurons in an AD mouse model and in post-mortem cortical tissue from AD patients. To test the prediction that cholinergic signaling in GABAergic interneurons is compromised, we will measure the ability of acetylcholine to modulate cortical network activity. We will also investigate whether knocking down nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in specific subtypes of GABAergic interneurons can recapitulate the neuropathology. Finally, we will investigate the behavioral relevance by determining whether activating specific GABAergic neuronal populations in the neocortex can alleviate attentional deficits in an AD mouse model. These experiments leverage a combination of optical, electrophysiological, molecular, and behavioral approaches to tease apart the circuit level neuropathology in an AD mouse model. The results will position GABAergic neurotransmission as a point of integration for the synaptic Abeta and cholinergic theories of AD. A positive outcome will also provide evidence for targeting specific cell types for treating attentional deficits in AD."

"9273279","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking during pregnancy is the leading preventable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes in the U.S.  Most pregnant smokers continue smoking through pregnancy producing serious immediate and longer-term adverse health consequences for the infant.    Smoking during pregnancy is highly associated  with  economic  disadvantage and a substantive contributor to health disparities.     Efficacious  interventions  are  available  but  cessation  rates  are  low  (<20 percent)  and  improvements  in  birth  outcomes often modest or absent.  Current treatments usually entail relatively brief, low-cost interventions (e.g. pregnancy-specific quit lines).  There is broad consensus that more effective interventions are sorely needed.    We  have  developed  a  novel  behavioral-economic  intervention  in  which  women  earn  financial  incentives contingent on smoking abstinence.  In a meta-analysis of treatments for smoking during pregnancy, effect sizes achieved with financial incentives were several-fold larger than those achieved with lower-intensity approaches or medications.    The  intervention  also  appears  to  improve  birth  outcomes  and  increase  breastfeeding duration.  While highly promising, further research is needed in at least three areas.  (1) The evidence on birth outcomes and breastfeeding is from studies that combined data across trials rather than a single prospective trial, (2) whether the intervention produces other postpartum improvements in health has not been investigated, and (3) the overall cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been examined.    To  examine  these  unanswered  questions,  we  are  proposing  a  randomized,  controlled  clinical  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  and  cost  effectiveness  throuh  one-year  postpartum  of  current  best  practices  for  smoking-cessation  during  pregnancy  vs.  best  practices  plus  financial  incentives  among  230  pregnant,  Medicaid  recipients.   We  will  also  include  a  third  condition  of  115  pregnant  non-smokers  matched  to  the  smokers on socio-demographic and health conditions to compare the extent to which the treatments reduce  the burden of smoking and to estimate how much more might be accomplished by further improvements in this  incentives intervention without exceeding cost-effectiveness.  We hypothesize that best practices plus financial  incentives will be more effective than best practices alone, that the incentives intervention will be cost effective,  and  that  while  adding the  incentives  reduces  a  greater  proportion  of  the  health  and  economic  burden  of  smoking than best practices alone, more can be done while remaining cost effective.     Overall, the proposed study has the potential to substantially advance knowledge on cost-effective smoking cessation for pregnant women.    Importantly,  because  of  the  strong  association  between  smoking  during  pregnancy  and  economic  disadvantage,  the  proposed  study  also  has  the  potential  to  contribute  new  knowledge relevant to reducing the serious challenges of health disparities."
"9375894","Abstract Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease of poverty caused by a bloodfluke that is transmitted by certain species of freshwater snails. Over 240 million people are infected and as many as 800 million are at risk, principally in sub-Saharan Africa. Parasite eggs that are lodged in the visceral organs induce inflammation and fibrosis leading to chronic pain, malaise and fatigue. If left untreated, the disease impairs the school performance of children and worker productivity which, in subsistence communities, undermines social and economic development. Treatment of schistosomiasis relies on just one drug, praziquantel (PZQ) and in the absence of backup drugs there are concerns regarding drug resistance. Also, PZQ is not particularly effective at the single oral dose administered. The WHO has declared that new therapies are needed to treat schistosomiasis.  Parasites produce proteases (proteolytic enzymes) that are essential to their survival, growth and reproduction in the host. One protease, known as the proteasome, is a multi-subunit protein complex that regulates normal protein turnover and degradation of misfolded proteins in eukaryotic cells. Recent high profile studies, including one by the PI, have shown that proteasome inhibitors that are selective for Plasmodium, Trypanosoma or Leishmania species, can either eliminate or reduce parasite burden by more than 95% in animal infection models. For our study, we employed a mass spectrometry-based, substrate specificity profiling strategy to direct the design of a potent and selective anti-malarial proteasome inhibitor.  Here we hypothesize that the proteasome of the schistosome parasite is a suitable drug target. In support of this, the preliminary data demonstrate that exposure of Schistosoma mansoni in culture to a selection of diverse proteasome inhibitors immobilizes the parasite and causes deleterious phenotypic changes. The data also show that the inhibitors engage the proteasome (Sm20S) target in living parasites. The inhibitors employed so far lack selectivity for Sm20S over the human constitutive proteasome (c20S) and immunoproteasome (i20S). However, our preliminary data show that the peptide cleavage specificity of Sm20S is sufficiently different from those of c20S and i20S to indicate that selective inhibitors of Sm20S could be developed.  In Aim 1, therefore, we will purify Sm20S from S. mansoni and employ our mass spectrometry based, substrate profiling method to define the Sm20S cleavage specificity in relation to c20S and i20S. This specificity information will be used to synthesize peptidyl inhibitors specific to Sm20S using the potent carmaphycin B inhibitor as a scaffold. In Aim 2, we will screen three high-value proteasome inhibitor collections from industrial and academic collaborators. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the potency of hit compounds in S. mansoni culture and in other relevant schistosome species, confirm engagement of the proteasome target and evaluate cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines.  The proposed project will define a set of pre-validated proteasome inhibitors of the schistosome proteasome that can be taken forward into an expanded pre-clinical development program."
"9278015","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely accepted that the in utero environment of the developing fetus influences health outcomes that extend well beyond the perinatal period into adulthood. Aberrant placental development has been linked to virtually every adverse obstetric outcome including abnormalities in fetal growth, preterm delivery and stillbirth. Yet, despite its importance as the mediator between maternal-fetal exchange, the placenta remains the least understood human organ. Adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery are central determinants of placental function and fetal growth. The lack of imaging modalities that facilitate the in vivo study of both normal and abnormal placentas impedes our understanding of placental blood flow and oxygenation. We propose to overcome these limitations using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology.  One of the challenges faced in the development of placenta-specific MRI methods is the complex structure of the placental vasculature in primates. Over the past 5 years we have utilized the nonhuman primate (NHP), which shares developmental features including placenta structure and function with humans, to develop a dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) method that allows for the quantification of placental blood flow from each spiral artery. Although we recently demonstrated that the level of fetal gadolinium exposure resulting from maternal administration of gadolinium-based contrast reagent during DCE-MRI is extremely low, the abundance of caution when imaging pregnant patients makes it highly pertinent to develop functional MRI methods that do not rely on contrast reagent administration. Importantly, we have acquired preliminary data in our NHP model that demonstrates the feasibility of the approach we are proposing. We are proposing to use our clinically relevant NHP model for non-contrast MRI sequence development and optimization. Simultaneous use of DCE-MRI in these studies will allow us to utilize our contrast dependent quantitative measure of placental perfusion as a benchmark for non-contrast modeling. We propose to transition our studies to human subjects to implement newly developed MR imaging procedures and assess their utility for clinical use. The potential clinical benefits of developing MRI protocols for the in vivo assessment of placental blood flow and oxygenation are tremendous; understanding normal placental function will improve clinical monitoring of pregnancy, permit early identification of women at-risk for placental insufficiency, and facilitate intervention to improve fetal outcome. If the proposed studies are successful, then we will have developed a protocol that allows for rapid, reproducible non-contrast mediated means of visualizing and quantifying both placental perfusion and oxygenation."
"9277589","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of high-quality, reliable and monospecific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been validated and optimized for use in mammalian brain (i.e. NeuroMabs) is of utmost importance to many areas of neuroscience research. Having such reagents for each of the proteins expressed in the brain is necessary to undertake biochemical and immunohistochemical studies to begin to link the nucleic acid sequence information derived from genome-based approaches to the function of the encoded gene products in the brain. Unfortunately, the lack of antibodies against a particular gene product, or antibodies that lack specificity, can severely handicap an entire subfield of neuroscience research and thereby impede progress towards understanding the mechanisms that underlie neurological disease. The UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility works towards this unmet need in two major ways: by generating NeuroMabs for targets that are deemed high-priority by NIH and by distributing them on a low-cost non-profit basis to the neuroscience research community. Seed funds from UC Davis and various NIH sources allowed for the creation of our Facility in 2005 and, over the past nine years, we have undertaken mAb projects against over 400 brain proteins and generated a catalog of over 370 NeuroMabs. Through our contractor Antibodies Incorporated (AI), we have distributed over 44,500 vials of NeuroMabs at low cost to hundreds of researchers at a multitude of different institutions worldwide and our end users have cited the use of NeuroMabs in over 1500 original research publications. Assuming a conservative for-profit price of $350 per 100 µg vial of purified mAb, an estimate of the NeuroMab non-profit savings to end users and their respective funding agencies is over $12.5 million. We have proven ourselves to be an establishment with a strong track record of important contributions and we wish to continue serving neuroscience researchers as best as we can. The worthiness of our Facility to the NIH and its mission has been demonstrated time and again through various funding initiatives over the years, most recently from the NIH Director's Transformative R01 Program. In addition, the combined support and cooperation of the NIH, the Regents of the University of California and AI have enabled us since 2011 to collect program income from the distribution of NeuroMabs to support future Facility self-sufficiency and new mAb research and development. However, the combination of the Transformative R01 funds and the accumulated program income is insufficient to hold onto our experienced senior staff, to keep the Facility running at its present-day level of productivity and to continue doing projects of high priority to NINDS. Maintaining strong support from NIH through additional R24 funding would be instrumental to retaining our valuable human and technological resources, preserving our current UC Davis infrastructure and keeping intact our exceptional protection from royalty and licensing surcharges that would unnecessarily raise the prices of NeuroMabs for our end users."
"9276757","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Biomedical Research Partnership (BRP) proposal involves a partnership among a biomedical engineering team, a pulmonary physiology team, and a clinical pulmonary medicine team. This research program will incorporate state of the art optical engineering, advanced in vivo physiologic evaluation, and direct application to human obstructive lung diseases (OLD). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a technology capable of real time imaging of tissue microstructures in vivo, at micron scale resolution, and without ionizing radiation. Due to existing methodological limitations, this technology has not been utilized in any diagnostic or therapeutic venue related to OLD. To overcome these limitations, our partnership will develop and optimize a miniature OCT imaging probe and OCT imaging system. We hypothesize that high-resolution, high-speed, endoscopic OCT systems will allow identification and quantification of critical changes in tissue components in the airway wall that lead to OLD, and we will demonstrate the feasibility and evaluate the resolution of this endoscopic OCT platform in vivo in a canine model. We also hypothesize that this innovative technology can be applied to human lung disease to elucidate the etiology, progression of disease, and response to therapy in humans with OLD. We will demonstrate the efficacy of OCT in subjects with COPD and asthma. This innovative BRP proposal involves a working partnership involving state of the art optical engineering, advanced in vivo physiologic evaluation, and direct application to human lung disease. The biomedical engineering team will design and fabricate an ultrathin high-resolution OCT scanning endoscope systems at two wavelengths with an optimal working distance for accurately assessing thickness and fine structures of the airway walls in the peripheral small airways in vivo. The pulmonary physiology team will determine the accuracy of OCT resolution in vivo in small size canine airways. Finally, the clinical pulmonary medicine team will determine the correlations between the structural elements in the airway wall and the severity of OLD in humans. These works determines the mechanisms of OLD and enable future evaluations of new and existing therapeutic treatments by noninvasively quantifying their effects on airway wall structures and lung function."

"9507380","Project Summary/Abstract Background: Antibiotic overuse threatens patient safety by causing adverse effects and threatens the effectiveness of antibiotics through the development of antibiotic resistance. However, studies to describe and interventions to address these safety risks have focused on visit-based antibiotic prescribing. Non-visit-based antibiotic use and prescribing has been largely invisible. In preliminary work, we found that 23% of patients who received an antibiotic prescription did not have an office visit in the study year. We have also found that clinicians prescribed 39% of antibiotic prescriptions on days when patients did not have visits. Non-visit-based antibiotic fills by patients and prescribing by clinicians may contribute to patients' risk of adverse events and hasten the spread of antibiotic resistance, but non-visit-based antibiotic prescribing has not been measured. Research Strategy: To measure and describe the safety risk and antibiotic resistance pressure from contemporary non-visit-based antibiotic use in the United States, we propose complementary specific aims using claims data and electronic health record (EHR) prescribing data. Our main hypotheses are that 1) non- visit-based antibiotic prescribing accounts for a significant proportion (>20%) of antibiotic use and 2) the majority (>50%) of non-visit-based antibiotic use is untethered to a proximate clinic visit or a chronic, recurrent problem. To address these hypotheses and plan for future interventions, we have 3 Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is to perform a retrospective cohort study of medical and prescription drug claims of care received by over 10 million commercial health plan and 50 million Medicaid enrollees to measure and describe non-visit- based antibiotic prescription fills relative to all antibiotic fills. Specific Aim 2 is to perform a cohort study of electronic health record (EHR) prescribing to measure and describe non-visit-based antibiotic prescribing as well as conduct a mixed-methods study of EHR data and qualitative interviews with clinicians to understand the rationales for non-visit-based antibiotic prescribing. Specific Aim 3 is to use the results of the national study, cohort study, and mixed-methods sub-study to develop an evidence-based toolkit that can be used by other clinicians, health systems, payors, and stakeholders to measure and address non-visit-based antibiotic use. Implications and Future Directions: In the near term, this project will open a novel research front, quickly expanding our understanding of antibiotic use in the United States. In the longer-term ? at a time when the US health care system is moving towards less visit-based care ? this project will lay the foundation for interventions to encourage judicious antibiotic prescribing and use, even in the absence of clinic visits. The ultimate goal of this project and subsequent interventions is to preserve antibiotic effectiveness, limit the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and to promote patient safety in ambulatory settings."
"9462357","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide is a major public health concern as about 35,000 people die of suicide in the U.S. every year. Recent studies of patients with suicidal behavior and of postmortem brain samples of suicide victims strongly suggest that suicide is associated with neurobiological abnormalities, such as abnormalities in serotonin function. It has also been observed that suicide and suicidal behavior are associated with abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis function. The molecular mechanisms and causes of HPA axis abnormalities in suicide, however, are not well understood. It is believed that HPA axis abnormalities may be related to an abnormal feedback mechanism and excessive secretion of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the brain. The main objective of our proposal is to examine if HPA axis genes are abnormally expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex/gyrus (CG), hippocampus, and amygdala of suicide victims. To achieve this specific aim, we will determine the protein and mRNA expression of the HPA axis genes, glucocorticoid receptors (GR-? and GR-?), mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), CRF, the receptors for CRF (CRF-R1 and CRF- R2), CRF binding protein (CRF-BP), and the target genes for GR, which are GILZ and FKBP in the PFC, CG, hippocampus, and amygdala of adult suicide victims of different diagnoses (depression, schizophrenia, other suicide) and in non-suicidal patients with different diagnoses (depression, schizophrenia) as well as normal controls. Abnormalities of epigenetic regulation have been implicated in the regulation of some of the HPA axis genes, especially the GR. We therefore propose to study epigenetic regulation of these genes by examining the effects of DNA methylation on the regulation of HPA axis genes. We propose to determine the protein and mRNA expression of enzymes that methylate DNA (DNA methyl transferase 1 [DNMT1], DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) and hydroxmenthylate DNA (TET1, TET2, and TET3) in the PFC, CG and hippocampus of adult suicide victims, non-suicidal subjects and normal control subjects. We also propose to determine the DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation of promoter proximal regions of HPA axis genes in the PFC, CG and hippocampus of adult suicide victims, non-suicidal patients and controls. We will use methyl DNA immunoprecipitation of DNA (MeDIP) and hydroxymethyl DIP (hMeDIP) to identify differentially ethylated/hydroxymethylated regions of interest in HPA axis genes of adult suicide cohorts. We will validate differences in identified regions using pyrosequencing of DNA isolated from each postmortem region. Together these studies will provide important information to support our hypothesis that suicide is associated with abnormal expression of some of the HPA axis related genes and with abnormal methylation/hydroxymethylation of HPA axis genes critical to the downstream effects of this stress response. These studies will not only enhance our knowledge of the pathophysiology of suicide in general and the role of HPA axis in suicide in particular, but also may result in identifying important sites that may be used for the development of appropriate therapeutic agents for treatment of suicidal behavior and as biomarkers for suicide."
"9437638","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely recognized that despite the enormous progress in vaccine development, a large part of the population does not receive any coverage due to poor access and low socioeconomic conditions. Importantly for several life-threatening infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis or malaria there are no available vaccines. Moreover bioweapon threats could include the deliberate release of an infectious agent that causes one or more of a variety of different diseases. Currently there are no safe and effective vaccines in the pipeline for many biological agents that may pose high risk to national security, due to increased person-to person transmissibility, disease severity and social disruption. For the aforementioned reasons current research focuses not only on the design of new vaccines against a broad range of diseases but also on the optimization of the existing ones, aiming to increased potency, safety, rapid distribution and possibly self-administration. Since many vaccines under investigation are either subunit or split pathogens or highly purified recombinant molecules, they lack the inherent immunostimulatory properties of the original pathogen. It is therefore important to consider the incorporation of adjuvants in the formulations and/or the design of novel delivery systems that will take advantage of the host's immune battery and enhance the vaccine immunogenicity. To address these issues we propose to deliver the vaccine in the skin and combine it with lead adjuvants. We will investigate the role of novel fused cytokines and immunomodulatory chemokines secreted in the skin following vaccine delivery that can alter the magnitude and the quality of immune responses to vaccines. We also plan to take advantage of our extensive experience with microneedles to design novel dissolving polymer microneedle formulations to encapsulate the adjuvanted vaccine while preserving the functional properties of the components. For the purpose of this study, we will use a licensed subunit influenza vaccine as a model antigen because it can benefit from the addition of adjuvants, because of the challenging nature of the virus that continuously mutates to evade host immune defenses and the availability of excellent animal models for immunogenicity, challenge and protection studies. We are motivated by our findings that influenza vaccine delivery to the skin with dissolving polymer or metal microneedle patches induces enhanced immunogenicity, as demonstrated by the longevity of immune responses compared to conventional systemic immunization in small animal models. Our preliminary studies in non-human primates with microneedles delivering unadjuvanted influenza vaccine have also demonstrated the potential of skin immunization. We hypothesize that the appropriate adjuvants will increase immunogenicity of the vaccine in the young and elderly population, as well as the breadth of immunity, which is a critical issue in case of unpredicted outbreaks from emerging strains. Finally, we expect that in the long term, adjuvanted influenza vaccination using a dissolving polymer microneedle patch will enable safe self-administration and more rapid distribution of the vaccine in the case of large epidemics or new pandemics."
"9269243","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Consistent findings across many studies demonstrate that maternal anxiety during pregnancy can have long-lasting effects on children's physical and neuropsychological development in a manner consistent with fetal programming models. The biological mechanisms accounting for these associations remain uncertain, however. In particular, there is little human research that: a) translates the sizable animal literature showin sex-dependent effects of prenatal physiological stress; and b) addresses the mechanisms underlying recent human findings linking prenatal maternal anxiety and life events stress to neurodevelopmental disorders with significant sex differences (learning difficulties, autism) and sexually-dimorphic physical outcomes (anogenital distance). We propose a prospective longitudinal study starting in the first trimester of pregnancy to test the hypothesis that prenata maternal anxiety alters sex-dependent development in infancy by acting on fetal adrenal androgen pathways. We will do this by recruiting a cohort of 290 pregnant women, following them from the first trimester and regularly collecting behavioral and biological data until the chid is 15 months of age using procedures for recruitment and retention successfully applied in prior cohort studies. The research design includes several important innovations in this growing field of study, including a) detailed data on both HPA axis and sex steroid hormone pathways, b) intensive interrogation of placental structure and function using the protocols developed from the work with the National Children's Study (NCS); c) repeated assessments of sex-dependent infant physical and neuropsychological outcomes. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) expand models of maternal psychological anxiety and its biological bases to include multiple hormone pathways; 2) identify evidence of prenatal anxiety-related alterations in adrenal and sex steroid hormone pathways from the placenta and cord blood at birth using our validated NCS protocols; 3) integrate maternal and placental biomarkers in predicting sex-dependent physical, neurocognitive, and social behavior measures at birth, 9 and 15 months. This line of research will complement and extend existing work by clarifying the biological mechanisms by which maternal anxiety is communicated to the fetus and improving our understanding of the etiology of sex differences in health and disease."
"9504328","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of nine polyglutamine expansion diseases and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and neuronal degeneration in the cerebellum and brainstem. Currently, there are no effective treatment strategies for this disease. Previously, we showed that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of ataxin-1 mRNA provides therapeutic benefit in mouse models of SCA1. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery of an engineered microRNA (miRNA) targeting ataxin-1 to the cerebellum of well-established SCA1 transgenic mouse models improved motor phenotypes, neuropathology, and transcriptional changes. We now propose to move our lead vector forward by completing a series of milestones that will lead us to a Phase 1 clinical trial in human subjects. In the UH2 phase of this application we will 1) perform comparability testing of the proposed vector in nonhuman primates to confirm our proposed dosing regimen, and 2) hold a Pre-IND Type B meeting with the CBER of the FDA to receive input on the design of the planned GLP tox study and the proposed Phase 1 protocol. In the UH3 phase of this application we will 1) produce GMP- process comparable vector (GLP vector), 2) perform the planned GLP pharm/tox study in nonhuman primates and rodents, 3) produce GMP-grade vector, 4) prepare and file the IND with the FDA, and 5) perform a phase I/II clinical trial in SCA1 subjects."
"9279278","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder resulting in motor impairment, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms and autonomic dysfunction. Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in PD pathogenesis, and it appears that mitochondrial defects and accumulation of the synaptic protein, ?- synuclein, are common to most forms of the disease. Moreover, there is evidence of a bidirectional interaction between mitochondrial dysfunction and ?-synuclein accumulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I leads to accretion and oligomerization of ?-synuclein, and increased levels of ?-synuclein cause mitochondrial impairment and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The nature of the interaction between ?- synuclein and mitochondria remains obscure, and it is unclear whether unmodified monomeric ?-synuclein is responsible for these effects, or whether posttranslational modifications which have been implicated in pathogenesis, such as oligomerization, dopamine modification, phosphorylation or nitration are important. Mitochondria contain their own genome, but it encodes only 13 proteins, so they must import about 99% of the >1000 proteins they contain. Mitochondrial protein import occurs through complex and highly regulated systems, the best understood of which recognizes N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signals (MTS) on proteins destined for import. While there is no consensus sequence, MTS characteristically form an amphipathic helix that is recognized by a receptor protein, TOM20, which is a subunit of the translocase complex of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM). Although monomeric ?-synuclein is an intrinsically disordered protein in solution, in association with anionic lipids in membranes, it forms an amphipathic helix similar to known MTS motifs. In this context, we have strong evidence that certain forms of posttranslationally-modified ?-synuclein bind specifically to TOM20 and interfere with import of mitochondrially-targeted proteins. We propose to study the interaction of ?-synuclein with mitochondrial import machinery in the following aims: (1) Define the specific forms of ?-synuclein that inhibit mitochondrial protein import; (2) Define key binding partners and binding parameters; (3) Determine functional consequences of ?-synuclein-induced impairment of mitochondrial protein import; (4) Investigate whether blockade of mitochondrial protein import causes nigrostriatal neurodegeneration similar to ?-synuclein overexpression; and (5) Examine the potential for genetic manipulation of mitochondrial import to protect against AAV2-mediated ?-synuclein overexpression in substantia nigra."
"9263940","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression and type 2 diabetes are related pressing public health problems. Depression, antidepressant medications, and the health risk behaviors they are associated with, are all risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The overarching goal of this study is to test the additive effects of two proven health interventions - lifestyle modification ad medication therapy management - on risk for diabetes in persons with depression and functional impairment. Treatments will be delivered through our model designed for patients with mental illness (MI) whose care is challenged by distance, disability, language, and culture. Cambodian Americans are ideally suited for this research question because, compared to the general population and other Asian Americans they have: 1) high rates of diabetes and disability; 2) high rates of MI; 3) high rates of polypharmacy and medication problems; and, 4) a worse profile of the social determinants of health. We will recruit 210 adult Cambodian Americans with major depressive disorder and associated impaired functioning, and who are at high risk for diabetes, from our network of community based organizations in the northeast. Seventy participants each will be assigned to one of three arms. In the lifestyle arm, Community Health Workers (CHWs) will deliver the lifestyle intervention during weekly-to-triweekly tapered group sessions and 5 individual home visits over 18 months. In the combination arm, in addition to lifestyle, a pharmacist will join the patient and CHW during home visits via telemedicine to deliver medication therapy management, during 5 home visits over 18 months. In the enhanced standard care arm, participants will receive their usual healthcare enhanced by supportive services. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. We hypothesize that 1) compared to enhanced standard care, the lifestyle intervention will produce greater improvements in depressive symptoms, medication adherence, objective physical activity, objective sleep quality, and nutrition; and 2) compared to either intervention alone, the combined treatment will improve insulin sensitivity, HbA1c, c-reactive protein, anthropmetrics, blood pressure, lipids and depressive symptoms. If successful, these approaches may apply to other communities with barriers to care and produce diabetes prevention interventions for patients with MI."
"9301665","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV research agenda in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is far-reaching. Much of it has been developed and carried out in partnership with institutions in the United States, Canada, and Europe, leading to gains in local capacity in terms infrastructure and professional development of scientists and physicians. One important domain where capacity building lags well behind is biostatistics and quantitative sciences: African biostatisticians are severely under-represented in international research teams, and many HIV research programs in SSA continue to rely on their western partners for implementation of advanced methods for design and analysis. Moreover, because most leading universities in SSA do not provide graduate-level training in statistics for health research, the pipeline is not being filled. Moi University in Eldoret, Kenya is typical in this regard. Although Moi is the secon university in Kenya and is associated with one of the largest HIV care and research programs in SSA, its College of Health Sciences has only one PhD-level biostatistician on faculty, no biostatistics courses beyond the introductory level. The Department of Statistics and Computer Science at the School of Biological and Physical Sciences offers advanced statistics courses, but they are highly theoretical in nature, with little or no connection to applications in health-related research, let alone HIV. Finally, the small number of African statisticians with advanced training working in HIV research centers in SSA tend to be geographically isolated from their peers, limiting opportunities for professional development and exchange of ideas that are necessary for high-quality scientific research. The proposed training program will respond to this need by establishing a partnership between Moi University Brown University. The program will expand research and curricular capacity in HIV-related biostatistics and advanced quantitative methods at Moi and lay the foundation for sustainable growth in this field by accomplishing the following Specific Aims: (1) providing graduate-level training in biostatistics and related fields,at Brown University, to highly qualified Kenyan candidates; (2) facilitating revision and expansion of the biostatistics curriculum at Moi through faculty development and close consultation with Brown faculty; (3) establishing an annual workshop on advanced biostatistical methods at Moi that will offer short-term training and ongoing professional development activities for faculty members and professionals with throughout SSA. This proposal builds directly upon the recent success of the Brown Fogarty AITRP. Since 2008, this program has supported graduate-level training in biostatistics and epidemiology for 4 Kenyan students, and in 2014 sponsored a highly successful one-week workshop on Causal Inference and Missing Data at Moi."
"9268442","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is very common, affecting up to 24 million people in the United States, and is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality. Cardiac comorbidities are prevalent in patients with COPD and contribute significantly to worse health outcomes. In fact, studies have shown that, in patients with COPD, cardiac causes of death are even more common than COPD-related causes. While COPD and cardiovascular disease share a common risk factor, smoking, it is clear that their association is multifactorial, going beyond this shared risk. One o the factors influencing the relationship is the shared position of the heart and lungs in a closed thoracic cage. It has been shown that many patients with COPD have increased lung volumes and that this hyperinflation impairs cardiac performance. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that the abnormal cardiac performance in hyperinflated COPD patients is at least in part related to changes in the distribution of intrathoracic blood volume (.e. alterations in ventricular preload and afterload) that can be corrected with deflation. She proposes to use a novel noninvasive technique to develop a more detailed understanding of the relationship between hyperinflation and cardiac performance. Specifically, she will utilize computed tomographic vascular measurements to non-invasively estimate the distribution of blood within the thorax and assess how that distribution varies with changes in lung volumes and further, relates to cardiac chamber size and function at rest and during exercise in normals and in patients with different levels of COPD severity.  In her first aim, she will explore the relationships between lung volumes, CT measurements of intrathoracic vessel caliber, and cardiac chamber size and function in a population based cohort (The Framingham Heart Study). This cohort will allow her to develop normative values for the size and relationships of extraparenchymal intrathoracic vessels and small pulmonary vessels. In her second aim, using data from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial, she will assess the effect of lung deflation (via lung volume reduction surgery) and transpulmonary pressure on intrathoracic vessel caliber. Use of this cohort will also allow her to correlate her CT vascular measurements with invasive measures of cardiac filling pressures and function. Finally, in her third aim, she will determine whether CT vascular measurements can predict cardiac performance during exercise. The results of this research may yield new insights into disease pathogenesis and suggest which patients would experience greatest benefit from pharmacologic or surgical deflation.  This work will be performed in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. The division has an outstanding record of training physician scientists, one of the largest NIH grant portfolios of any pulmonary division in the country, and collaborations with multiple local and national institutions. There is abundant opportunity for intellectual stimulation with regular research meetings and seminars. Within the division, the candidate will work specifically in the Applied Chest Imaging Lab, where she will have access to all of the data bases and image analysis tools necessary to complete the proposed project. With the guidance of her mentors, Drs. George Washko, a leader in pulmonary research using quantitative chest imaging and director of ACIL, and Bartolome Celli, a world-renowned COPD clinical researcher, the principal investigator has formulated a comprehensive five-year training program to develop the skills necessary to become an independent physician-scientist conducting patient-oriented research on the association between COPD and cardiovascular disease. This curriculum includes advanced training in cardiac and respiratory pathophysiology, biostatistics, and clinical trial work, as well as in thoracic and cardiovascular imaging. In addition to her mentors, the candidate will have regular interactions with a committee of advisors with expertise relevant to the proposal.  The candidate is dedicated to academic medicine and clinical research and hopes to build a career based on better understanding the heterogeneity and systemic manifestations of COPD. Her current proposal probes the mechanical nature of the heart-lung interaction; in future work, she would like to incorporate additional contributors including the important role of molecular and inflammatory mediators, more broadly considering COPD phenotypes through imaging- and biomolecular-based approaches. Ultimately, she would like to design and perform clinical and translational studies to assess therapies for patients with cardiopulmonary disease and in particular, understand how treatment of one condition (either through medical or surgical approaches) impacts the outcomes of another, and how therapies may be better targeted through improved diagnostic tools"
"9270021","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic liver diseases are the 12th leading cause of mortality and among the most common causes of morbidity in the U.S. with 5.5 million people suffering from the diseases. The liver has an enormous capacity to regenerate itself, but this capacity is greatly reduced in the diseased liver, making liver transplantation the only effective treatment for end-stage chronic liver diseases. The shortage of donor livers however makes this therapy extremely limited, thus necessitating alternative therapies. Augmenting innate liver regeneration can be an alternative therapy because it may mitigate the diseases and improve the quality of life. During innate liver regeneration, regenerated hepatocytes can be derived from preexisting hepatocytes or biliary epithelial cells (BECs). BEC-driven liver regeneration occurs when hepatocyte-driven liver regeneration is compromised, which is the case in patients with chronic liver diseases. It appears that BEC-driven liver regeneration was initiated but failed to b complete in the patients. Understanding of the entire process of BEC-driven liver regeneration should provide significant insights into how to complete this process in liver patients as therapeutics. Thus, we developed an innovative zebrafish liver regeneration model in which regenerated hepatocytes are exclusively derived from BECs. Using this model, we found that pharmacological inhibition of Bmp signaling impaired BEC-driven liver regeneration. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that Bmp signaling plays multiple roles in BEC-driven liver regeneration. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims. Aim 1: We will delineate temporal characteristics of BEC-driven liver regeneration in our zebrafish model by testing our working hypothesis: BECs first proliferate, dedifferentiate into hepatoblast-like cells, the equivalent of oval cells in rodent liver injury models, and then redifferentiate ino hepatocytes that actively proliferate to recover liver mass. Aim 2: We will determine the roles of Bmp signaling in BEC-driven liver regeneration, by blocking or enhancing Bmp signaling at distinct time-windows during hepatocyte ablation and liver regeneration and by examining BEC-driven liver regeneration in smad5 mutants. Aim 3: We will determine the role of Id2a, a member of the inhibitor of differentiation family of transcription factors, which is known to be the direc target of Bmp signaling in several tissues, in BEC-driven liver regeneration by testing the working hypothesis that Id2a mediates the effect of Bmp signaling on BEC-driven liver regeneration. The accomplishment of the proposed work will significantly advance the field of liver regeneration by revealing the mechanisms by which Bmp signaling regulates BEC-driven liver regeneration. Furthermore, they will provide novel insights into how to augment and complete BEC-driven liver regeneration in patients with chronic liver diseases as therapeutics."
"9279261","Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk to suffer from malaria. Other high-risk groups in Africa ? including pregnant women and infants ? are administered intermittent preventive therapy with antimalarials to reduce the burden of malaria, but strategies to do so in SCA children are lacking. Currently, few strategies have been tested, and none with large sample sizes powered on clinically-important outcomes for malaria and SCA. In this project, we propose a three-arm, randomized, active-placebo clinical trial of malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens in children with SCA in Western Kenya. Capitalizing on the clinical trial expertise of the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the global field research footprint of the Duke Global Health Institute, and existing collaborations with Moi University and partners in Western Kenya, we will enroll children with SCA in Homa Bay, Kenya, which is endemic for falciparum malaria. Children will be randomized to either daily Proguanil (current standard of care), monthly sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine-amodiaquine, or monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and followed for 12 months. The primary outcome will be the incidence of falciparum malaria, and other prespecified outcomes compared between allocation arms will be measures of SCA morbidity including painful events, dactylitis, and need for transfusion, measures of malaria severity, and hospitalizations and deaths. At the conclusion of the study, we expect to provide an evidence base for the use of two alternative strategies to protect children with SCA from malaria, and to potentially reduce the morbidity of SCA in malaria-endemic areas in Africa. These data will directly enable clinicians in Africa to improve the care of children with SCA."
"9315182","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric liver disease is rare but can lead to other morbidities, organ transplantation, or even death. The Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN) is a collaborative network dedicated to research endeavors related to eight pediatric liver diseases, namely biliary atresia (BA); Alagille syndrome (ALGS); alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency; progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC); bile acid synthesis defects; mitochondrial hepatopathies; idiopathic neonatal hepatitis; and cystic fibrosis liver disease. ChiLDReN aims to promote clinical and translational research on pediatric liver diseases in hopes of elucidating the pathogenesis and natural history, and developing means of treatment and clinical management. The Network will continue to build its robust biorepository of plasma, serum, urine, DNA, and hepatobiliary tissue specimens for use in future studies and analyses. It will also continue to compile already considerable datasets on demographic, medical history, and neurocognitive characteristics of pediatric liver disease. The Network has also recently initiated a clinical trial to address key gaps in the early management of children with biliary atresia, and is on the brink of initiating several other trials, which will facilitate treatment options for children with rare liver disease. Our site aims to contribute to the goals of ChiLDReN by ensuring continued and future availability of patients for observational and interventional Network protocols. We will also continue to the intellectual needs of the Network by providing committee leadership within the consortium, actively participating in data analysis and manuscript development, and developing novel studies and protocols. To this effect, we propose a novel and exciting protocol to differentiate cholangiocytes from induced pluripotent cells, and to apply this technology to model several biliary diseases of direct relevance to the Network. Through the continuation of its longitudinal observational and interventional studies, ChiLDReN aims to discover new diagnostics, etiologies, and treatment options for children with rare liver disease and those who undergo liver transplantation. The findings from the studies and analyses conducted by ChiLDReN will ultimately help improve outcomes and quality of life for North American children who suffer from liver disease."
"9232977","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Hepatitis C infection affects approximately 3.9 million Americans and disproportionately impacts the health of veterans. Approximately one-third of infected individuals will develop progressive liver fibrosis culminating in cirrhosis. Bacterial infections and sepsis are prominent causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Susceptibility to infections in cirrhosis has largely been attributed to increased bacterial translocation across the gut in the setting of reduced innate immune protective mechanisms. Additionally, antibody responses to vaccines have been long established to be inefficient in cirrhotic patients, suggesting a defect in B-cell activation. However, the contribution of B-cell dysfunction to the cirrhotic immunocompromised state has largely remained unexplored. Our novel preliminary data demonstrate that cirrhosis is associated with the disappearance of CD27+ memory B-cells, leading to impaired B-cell activation and reduced capacity of B-cells to stimulate T-cells. Preliminary investigation suggests that soluble factors elevated in cirrhotic plasma may lead to B-cell hyperactivation, that Fas expression is markedly increased on CD27+ B-cells and expression of pro-survival receptors such as CD268/BAFF-R are reduced. We hypothesize that chronic hyperactivation due to gut translocation leads to either activation-induced apoptosis of memory B-cells or conversion to an exhausted CD27-CD21- memory B-cells population with weak effector capacity. The objectives of this proposal are to longitudinally confirm the association of B-cell dysfunction and cirrhosis identified in cross-sectional studies, to study the impact of cirrhosis o B-cell proliferation and apoptosis, and to explore approaches to reverse this dysfunction in vivo in translational studies. The research encompasses in vitro studies on B-lymphocyte function using blood and tissue samples donated by human subjects in addition to prospective studies of B-cell memory frequency with and without clinical interventions. First, we will examine if the loss of CD27+ B-cells in cirrhosis reflects specific deletion of innate B1-type B-cells critical for protection against bacterial sepsis. Second, we will examine activation of signal pathways such as NF B downstream of CD40, BAFF-R and TLR9 on the activation of CD27+ B-cells in cirrhosis relative to healthy donors. Lastly, we will longitudinally follow the phenotype and function of B-cells in after pharmacological reduction of bacterial translocation, cure of HCV viremia, and in the peritransplant setting to assess the impact of gut translocation, portal hypertension and viremia on maintenance of B-cell dysfunction in cirrhotic patients. The ultimate goal of these studies is to identify conditions under which cirrhotic patient B-cells function can be improved in vivo to reduce the morbidity and mortality of infectious complications of cirrhosis."
"9284452","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SystemCHANGE: An RCT for Medication Adherence in Adult Kidney Transplant Recipients With kidney transplant (KT) recipients as our exemplar population, our goal is to develop and test interventions that increase medication adherence in chronically ill adults. Among adult KT recipients, non-adherence to immunosuppressive medications (MNA) is the leading predictor of poor outcomes, including rejection, kidney loss, and death. An alarming one-third of KT patients experience MNA even though the problem is preventable. Adherence intervention studies have proven marginally effective for those with acute and chronic illnesses and ineffective for adult KT recipients. Using a randomized controlled trial design with an attention- control group, this R01 will test an innovative 6-month SystemCHANGE intervention to enhance immunosuppressive medication adherence in adult non-adherent KT recipients. This intervention shows great promise for increasing adherence with a large effect size of 1.4 in our pilot study. Grounded in the socio- ecological model, SystemCHANGE seeks to systematically improve medication adherence behaviors by identifying and shaping routines, involving supportive others in routines, and using medication taking feedback through small patient-lead experiments to change and maintain behavior. Medication adherence will be measured by electronic monitoring. Medication adherence persistence will be examined by evaluating the difference between the two groups during the 6-month maintenance phase. Mediators and moderators of medication adherence will be examined. Health outcomes will be compared and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted."
"9310235","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minimal Change Disease (MCD), Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Membranous Nephropathy (MN), and IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) are glomerular diseases that despite their rarity, account for a large fraction of prevalent ESKD. There is now consensus that the presently employed histopathologybased classification of these diseases is inadequate because it is not based on an understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases, and because it does not well predict the heterogeneous natural history or response to therapy of individuals within a given glomerular histopathological category. We propose that major barriers must be overcome before more effective interventional studies of primary chronic glomerular disease can be conducted or before patients suffering from these diseases can be properly diagnosed and treated. Among these barriers is the absence of well characterized specific biomarkers of glomerular disease that would allow refined, biologically relevant sub-classification of glomerular disease histopathology. Such disease sub-classification might overcome the effects of glomerular disease population heterogeneity that likely have complicated interpretation of past studies of these glomerular diseases. New glomerular disease biomarkers might also predict disease natural history, allow proper selection of and prediction of response to specific therapeutic intervention, allow early detection of disease, or provide indicators of disease activity. Importantly, a robust investigative infrastructure would facilitate collection, cultivation, and access to human biological material and associated clinical data necessary for biomarker identification, for developing instruments useful for evaluating patient reported outcomes (PRO) that might be useful as endpoints in therapeutic trials, and for conducting pilot clinical studies that would advance the care of MCD, FSGS, MN, IgAN patients. For these reasons, we propose the establishment of PROGRESS, a Participating Clinical Center (PCC) that brings together clinical and translational scientists, a lay research foundation, and partners from the private sector to study patients with MCD, FSGS, MN and IgAN as a collaborator in larger chronic glomerular disease research consortium."
"9293286","Pilot and Feasibility Program: Abstract The Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh has had a Pilot and Feasibility Program in place since 1997. This program has been supported by federal (P50, P30) and non-federal (a research development program from the CF foundation) over the years such that we are currently able to support between 2 and 4 research projects each year. The goals of the program are directed towards fostering and promoting new and innovative research programs directed towards the development of new and innovative research in basic, clinical and translational aspects of cystic fibrosis. Ultimately the goal is to augment and expand the number of individual competitive federal research grants contributing to our cystic fibrosis research center. A second though equally important facet of this effort is to foster the development of the careers of young investigators and to help focus their research themes towards studies in cystic fibrosis Our program has been remarkably successful on both fronts; of the pilots supported by the P30 over the last two cycles of support (n=13), all but one were successful in converting the project to extramural funding, a success rate of more than 90%. We anticipate that the pilots proposed in this P30 renewal will have similar success. Moreover, the Center?s P/F program has brought many significant investigators to CF research over the years, including: Drs. Meir Aridor, Jeff Brodsky, Marcello Carattino/Tom Kleyman, Augustine Choi, Tim Corcoran, Dan Devor, Steve Garoff/Bob Tilton, Ken Hallows, Mike Myerburg, Prabir and Anaradha Ray, Bruce Freeman, Marcel Bruchez/Alan Waggoner, Xinyu Liu and Ron Montalero. Thus, we have had considerable experience and success with this program and its intent of bringing new investigators into the CF field or having CF experienced researchers pursue new direction, amplifying their funding options. In this competing renewal we are submitting pilots from Dr?s Agnes Urban and John Alcorn (see section D) these projects are tightly integrated into this program and interface closely with the basic and translational aspects of the Center and make extensive use of the core support provided by this P30."

"9215629","ABSTRACT Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating and chronic mental illness with limited treatment options. Currently, there are only two FDA-approved PTSD medications both of which are monoaminergic antidepressants. Rates of non-response to these medications are high, in particular in military PTSD. Thus, we are proposing to examine the efficacy of a novel drug, ketamine, in treating antidepressant-resistant PTSD. Mounting evidence indicates that the N- methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, produces a rapid (within 4 hours) and potent (50% to 90% response rate) antidepressant action in patients with severe antidepressant-resistant depression. Pilot evidence and case reports provided preliminary evidence supporting the safety and utility of investigating the therapeutic effects of ketamine in PTSD. However, the efficacy of this drug has not yet been tested in an active duty military or veteran population with PTSD. As a project proposal to be funded under the DoD/VA collaborative Consortium to Alleviate PTSD (CAP), we propose a multisite, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trial to examine the dose-related and multi-dose efficacy of ketamine, as compared to placebo, in producing a rapid and sustained reduction in PTSD and depressive symptomatology in an active duty military and veteran population with treatment-resistant PTSD. Approximately 198 eligible subjects who meet criteria for PTSD and additional inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to the study drug (i.e. ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, or placebo). The study drug will be administered intravenously twice per week for 4 weeks, followed by a 4-week follow-up period. The proposed 4-week repeat dosing study is, to our knowledge, the first test of the therapeutic effects of ketamine in the veteran population, and the first placebo-controlled multisite trial to determine the dose-related effects of repeated ketamine on PTSD. It will also be the largest ketamine clinical trial, which will provide critical information about the safety of repeated dosing and the durability of benefit following a 4-week treatment regimen approach. Blood collection and banking at the CAP Biomarkers and Genomics Core will be performed for future CAP spearheaded analyses."
"9493290","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Background: Falls are currently the leading cause of injurious death and non-fatal injuries for adults over the age of 65. Older veterans may be at greater risk for falls due to their high burden of medical co-morbidity. The VA has made research into fall prevention a high priority. Tai Chi is currently considered to be one of the most effective fall prevention exercise interventions, with an endorsement from the CDC that widely influences health care policy. However, there are few studies comparing Tai Chi with another active intervention. Tai Chi may generally improve balance and provide general lower body strengthening however Tai Chi may not sufficiently improve gait and dynamic mobility and does little to target obstacle negotiation, one of the largest contributors to a fall. The majority of falls occur during walking, with slips and trips beng the most common causes and targeted interventions focused on improving stepping and walking ability may be even more effective at improving balance and reducing falls. Objective: The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate two fall reduction programs in older veterans, Tai Chi and a multimodal balance intervention (MMBI) focused on dynamic stepping, obstacle negotiation, walking, and lower extremity strengthening. We propose that MMBI will provide many of the same benefits of tai chi (strengthening and improved balance) but addresses the deficits in many tai chi programs including environmental negotiation and walking. This program could also be easily implemented in community practice. Methods: We plan to enroll 56 older (age > 65 years) community dwelling veterans with a history of a fall in the last year who are at high risk for a recurrent fall. After baseline testing individuals will be randomized to either MMB or a Tai Chi intervention modeled after the Tai Chi Moving for Better Balance Program. All participants will participate in a group exercise class in their assigned intervention for 1 hour,  times per week for 24 weeks. After the completion of 24 weeks of exercise group changes will be compared for 1) balance (4-square step test), 2) mobility and fall risk (functional gait assessment, clinical gait assessment and gait variability on a GAITrite), 4) questionnaires (falls efficacy and ABC) 5) lower extremity isometric strength testing (biodex), 6) a whole body DXA and CT scan of the abdomen, hips and thighs for determination of lower extremity and core muscle composition. We also plan for follow all participants for 6 months after completion of the intervention to examine differences in fall rates after the cessation of the program between the groups. Impact: This research directly benefits veterans as it may lead to new and effective interventions that could reduce fall risk, injury-related hospitalization and death in older veterans. MMBI is also readily exportable to the community and with minimal resources could be widely implemented at other VAs as part of standard of care, similar to MOVE!. Results from this award will be used to power a larger randomized clinical trial that will examine the effectiveness of the two interventions to reduce rate of falls and risk of falling in older veteran at high risk for falls."
"9364833","Project Summary/Abstract Abstract The immune system manifests itself through various cellular and molecular events at different scales dynamically. The data accumulated at NIH ImmPort repository provide a great opportunity to deepen our understanding of the immune system, in the contexts of vaccine studies, transplantation, infectious diseases, etc. Novel bioinformatics tools are important to integrate and interpret these data, obtained from different technologies and some of high-dimensions. We propose Multiscale, Multifactorial Immune Networks (MMIN) as a framework to effectively integrate different data types. This work will build on our popular tools, blood transcription modules (BTMs) and mummichog, to combine intelligent dimension reduction techniques with partial least square regression to construct association networks that enable cross-type data queries. The MMIN will be provided as a free web service, with the option to be fully integrated into ImmPort. Selected datasets from ImmPort will be used for testing, documentation and reanalysis. We will further apply MMIN to examine the involvement of heme biosynthesis in the immune responses across studies."
"9368502","Project Summary  The long-term goal of this R01 proposal is to develop a circulating tumor cell-based assay to identify prostate cancer (PCa) patients who are at risk for developing visceral metastasis (VM). Drs. Posadas (Cedars-Sinai) and Tseng (CytoLumina) have formed a unique and functional academic/industrial partnership geared toward this project.  VM in metastatic, castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) is an emerging and unaddressed problem. Patients with VM have significantly foreshortened cancer-specific survival and die from organ failure in a fashion distinct from patients with bone-predominant disease. VM are typically found on imaging requested only when organ function is already compromised-typically late in the clinical course but affect over 45% of patients with advanced PCa. Early treatment can improve outcome but this requires timely detection. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify patients at risk for VM to customize imaging surveillance and create an opportunity to alter disease trajectory.  Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare cancer cells that can be isolated from whole blood. The NanoVelcro assay is a novel cellular isolation technology introduced by CytoLumina that is capable of identifying CTCs in small volumes of blood (as little as 1 mL). Use of NanoVelcro assay has led to the identification of CTC subsets based on nuclear morphology including those with nuclei less than 8.5 µm in diameter called very small nuclear CTCs (vsnCTCs). We have found that the appearance of vsnCTCs is associated with the presence of VM in men with PCa.  We hypothesize that vsnCTCs appear before the VM are detectable by conventional radiographic assessment in mCRPC. This hypothesis will be tested by (aim 1) an analysis of CTC samples that have been serially collected over the past 3 years in our annotated CTC/blood bank ? a unique and invaluable resource for this work and, (aim 2) a prospective CTC analysis of men with mCRPC. Our early work shows that vsnCTCs appear months before the VM are detectable by conventional imaging techniques.  This investigative project will create an opportunity for early imaging and therapy which can change the clinical course for patients. As a byproduct, this work will create a new clinical space in PCa by identifying men at risk for VM. The NanoVelcro vsnCTC Assay will provide a simple, minimally-invasive, and cost-effective means of identifying mCRPC patients at risk for VM, thereby allowing physicians to personalize patient monitoring, treatment, and therapy."
"9457092","PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer is a major global health issue; it is the second most common form of cancer in women exceeded only by lung cancer. Current breast cancer treatments are regulated by cell surface presentation; for example, breast cancer cells that express estrogen receptor-? (ER?) and human epidermal growth receptor-2 (HER2) on their surface are treated with hormone (anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitors) or targeted (Herceptin) therapies, respectively. In this proposal, we propose a personalized approach to treat four metastatic breast cancer populations: black, white, over 40 and under 40. These populations were chosen based on statistical differences in survival and rate of diagnoses. I will characterize the surface density and proximity of two G- protein coupled receptors that facilitate tumor chemotaxis, CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and CC chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7). CXCR4 and CCR7 induce directional migration of tumor cells along chemokine gradients in a manner similar to lymphocyte homing. In addition, lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) has been shown to induce the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). I propose to synthesize complementary engineered liposomes (CELs) that cooperatively bind CXCR4 and CCR7 and deliver short interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown Lcn2. Homogeneous and biphasic CELs are designed to complement the relative surface density and organization of receptors on breast cancer cells by allowing conjugated antibodies to rearrange on the surface or clustering antibodies within gel-phase lipid domains. CEL therapies will be designed to enhance cooperative binding to each cell type and be evaluated to reduce cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic studies will complement in vitro studies; the expression of RhoA, Rac1, Erk1, PI3K, E-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin will assess the effect of CEL therapy on cell migration, activation, survival, and the EMT. In vivo tumor progression and metastasis will be evaluated after delivery of CEL therapies. This work will demonstrate similarities and differences between 6 different breast cancer cell lines and deliver a platform technology designed specifically to address tumor metastasis. In comparison to the antibody and the antagonist targeted towards CXCR4 in clinical trials, this method has the advantage of localizing within tumors, cooperatively binding multiple chemokine receptors, blocking chemotaxis, delivering Lcn2 siRNA to impede the EMT, and monitoring biodistribution in vivo via the incorporation of a near infrared chromophore. My previous work, targeting cytokine-activated endothelial cells, presents compounding evidence that vehicles that complement the cell surface enhance binding. I propose to use our knowledge and experience in chemical engineering, material science, and nanotechnology to develop therapeutics that will increase breast cancer patient survival by inhibiting tumor progression and metastasis."
"9247906","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The overall goal of this research is to use our unique mouse models of Types A & B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) to develop new therapies for this disorder and to uncover novel pathogenic mechanisms. Two aims are proposed. Aim 1: Preclinical Evaluation of Two New Therapies. In the first set of studies we will evaluate a novel enzyme enhancement approach using the heat shock protein, Hsp70. These experiments are based on a recent publication showing that Hsp70 enhanced residual ASM activity and reduced lysosomal pathology in cells from Type A and B NPD patients, a finding that has been supported by new in vivo data obtained since the previous submission. The second set of studies will continue our work aimed at improved delivery of ASM to the lung using ICAM-1. A proof-of-principle gene transfer experiment will be undertaken that will use AAV8 vectors to express ASM/ICAM-1 fusion proteins in the livers of NPD mice. Uptake and efficacy of the fusion enzymes in the lung and other clinically important organs will be studied. New in vivo data also has been obtained to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Aim 2: Investigation of Novel Pathogenic Mechanisms Leading to ERT-Related Liver Toxicity. Preclinical ERT studies in ASM knockout (ASMKO) mice have shown that administration of recombinant ASM at doses above 5 mg/Kg results in liver bleeding, the release of liver enzymes, and death. We have recently found that sphingosine, not sphingomyelin, is the major accumulating lipid in the livers of these mice, and hypothesize that sphingosine storage is responsible, at least in part, for the ERT-associated toxicity. We will determine the source of accumulating sphingosine by evaluating the expression of ceramidases, sphingosine kinases and sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase in the ASMKO mice, and breed these animals to mice lacking sphingosine kinase-1 to determine the effects on ERT- associated liver toxicity. These results should provide a mechanistic basis for the clinical observations in the mice, and also may lead to new strategies to overcome this toxicity."
"9293201","SUMMARY OF THE OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT AND EDUCATION CORE  The Outreach, Recruitment and Education Core (Outreach Core) of the Yale ADRC will assist the Clinical Core in the recruitment of a clinical population, which will be accomplished through communication with the general public and health care professionals and service providers. Given that the Clinical Core will focus on the collection of biospecimens and other research materials from a subject population spanning the full continuum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, the Outreach Core will need to facilitate the recruitment of not only symptomatic patients, but also asymptomatic family members. Educational services will be provided to the public through a long-standing collaboration with the Alzheimer's Association, Connecticut Chapter. A key role of the Outreach Core will be to remove barriers to minority research participation and to extend education programs to a racially and ethnically diverse audience. Since scientific focuses of the Yale ADRC include cell biology, the integration of translational neuroscience, and biomarker studies, a particular educational need is in neuroscience education. Aim 1 will assist the Clinical Core in the enrollment of approximately 500 subjects who will enter the Core Population for participation in research in five diagnostic categories on the full continuum of AD (from preclinical to dementia), as well as non-AD dementias and normal controls. Aim 2 will provide educational services for the public about AD and related disorders. Aim 3 will improve minority outreach and minority research participation. We will attain 18% minority participation  commensurate with national demographics. A vital recent addition to this initiative is the Cultural Ambassadors program. Aim 4 will improve educational services for health care professionals and service providers. Aim 5 will enhance didactic and research training related to AD. An essential aim of the Outreach Core is to introduce new and future researchers at all levels to AD and the research opportunities available through the ADRC."

NRSA TRAINING CORE Translation of promising scientific discoveries into effective clinical interventions and best practices to improve public health is a complex process that transcends traditional scientific disciplines. We propose a multi-level training program in clinical and translational science designed to flexibly adapt to the early career education needs and career interests of predoctoral students from diverse disciplines including biomedical science, medicine, nursing, social science, and engineering. We propose innovative training approaches to instill the translational workforce with the skills, knowledge, and attitudes for multidisciplinary team-based science. The Penn State program will include short-term training, year-off training for medical students leading to a Master's degree in Public Health Sciences, year-long graduate credit certificate training, and a novel dual-title PhD in clinical and translational science. We plan to enroll 16 students each year in our short-term program and 6 students each year in one of the longer-term training programs. Given the emerging strengths of the Penn State Institute and challenges representing areas for growth and innovation, our overarching goal is to implement a rigorous educational program in clinical and translational science that grows our community of trainees and can serve as a model program for the CTSA Consortium. We propose translational science education and research training that is customized to the career goals and needs of individual trainees and a framework of core competencies to ensure a knowledgeable and skilled workforce. Programmatic strengths include careful tracking, evaluation, and dissemination of best practices. Our aims are: Aim 1: Expand the community of engaged, clinical and translational trainees at Penn State by increasing the number and disciplinary range of programs from which trainees are drawn, increasing the diversity of trainees in terms of race/ethnicity, and collaborating with other Penn State T32 and K programs. Aim 2: Provide a range of individualized translational science educational opportunities by tailoring education to prior training and career level, current research training goals and career trajectory, as well as by enhancing multidisciplinary research opportunities and collaborative skills. Aim 3: Develop, test, implement, and disseminate innovative education, trainee, and mentor metrics and evaluation tools, including multi-level measures and innovative evaluation metrics for trainees, mentors, and programs, and a customized trainee tracking software system. We will disseminate this tracking and evaluation system resource to the CTSA Consortium for enhanced capacity and evidence-based training improvement. Building on a long history of successful training in clinical and translational research at Penn State, our highly flexible training program will cultivate an exceptional environment in which individual trainees can create a strong foundation of unique skills and knowledge to launch productive careers as translational scientists."
"9293309","TR&D2: Brain Structure and Function    P.I: John Detre, MD  Co-Investigators:  Brian Avants, PhD and Ze Wang, PhD  ABSTRACT   TRD2 focuses on neuroimaging methods for use in basic and clinical neuroscience. Much of this work  concerns the development and application of arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI, a method initiated by  our Regional Resource (1). ASL provides noninvasive quantification of tissue perfusion (blood flow). In brain,  cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantifies cerebrovascular function, but CBF also serves as a means of quantifying  neural function more generally through the tight coupling between CBF and regional neural activity (2, 3). Over  the past project period, TRD2 further developed ASL MRI technologies and applications at 3T and at 7T.  Additional neuroimaging technology developed by TRD2 included imaging of myelin and myelin water,  susceptibility weighted imaging, and the development of new signal-processing strategies for both functional  and structural MRI of the brain. TRD2 also collaborated with TRD1 on metabolic imaging of the brain and with  TRD4 on optical monitoring of CBF and metabolism in the brain. In the upcoming grant period, we plan to  continue these lines of inquiry, and to collaborate with TRD3 on short-TE imaging."
"9293203","SUMMARY FOR PROJECT 2  Synaptic communication is at the crux of brain function, and a key feature of AD is synaptic malfunction and synapse loss. A range of genetic and biomarker data indicate that the A? peptide triggers synaptic disease. The mechanisms by which AD-selective forms of A? damage the synapse are not well defined but have the potential to provide multiple sites for therapeutic intervention, which are distinct from regulating APP and A? themselves. Numerous studies implicate Fyn kinase in the synaptic pathophysiology of AD, with links to both A? and Tau pathology. For transgenic AD mice, genetic removal of Fyn kinase alleviates, and overexpression of Fyn exacerbates, the impairment of synaptic density and spatial memory. Our work, confirmed and extended by others, showed that Cellular Prion Protein (PrPC) acts as a cell surface binding site for toxic A? oligomers. Engagement of PrPC by A? was found to activate Fyn kinase, initiating a detrimental signaling cascade with synaptic dysfunction.  Using Fyn and PrPC as molecular handles for synaptic pathology at the inner and outer surfaces of the post-synaptic density, we have sought to understand how these proteins are coupled and which signal transduction pathways are dysregulated in AD. Our Preliminary data strongly support a crucial role for mGluR5 and Fyn in AD pathophysiology. Here, we seek to validate the role of an A?o PrPC mGluR5 Fyn pathway in AD, identify biomarkers of this pathology, and explore the utility of mGluR5 agents in AD models. This project will advance the hypothesis that selectively blocking A?o mGluR5 signaling provides effective disease- modifying therapeutic strategy for AD."

"9334700","PROJECT SUMMARY (CORE C) The Mouse Interventions and Aging Core (Core C) will provide investigators of the Program Project (PPG) with mouse models necessary to achieve their specific aims and will perform mouse lifespan assays, drug treatments and characterize mouse phenotypes. Experiments of this PPG focus on defining the role played by retrotransposable elements in aging, identifying the molecular mechanisms that control retrotransposons and on testing anti-transposon interventions. Retrotransposable elements move by a copy-and-paste mechanism creating DNA breaks, mutations and genomic rearrangements. Furthermore, the transcription of retroelements which comprise ~45% of the genome can take a toll on the host cell. The recent studies by all the three Projects of this PPG indicate that retrotransposons are activated during aging. The central hypothesis of this PPG is that the activation of retroelements contributes to the onset of aging and that pRb and SIRT6 proteins that regulate repressive heterochromatin are the key components of the pathways responsible for repression of LINE-1 (L1). Our preliminary data suggest that treating Sirt6-/- mice with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which repress L1 retrotransposition, alleviates the premature aging phenotype of these mice, providing support for our hypothesis. Core C Specific Aims will be to: (1) prepare and maintain the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols for all projects within this PPG; (2) breed and maintain mice for project investigators; (3) examine the effect of aging on retrotransposition in L1 reporter mice; (4) examine the effect of hyperactive L1 on mouse lifespan and pathology; (5) breed pRb deficient mice for Project 1 for analysis of retrotransposon activation; (6) introduce Rb and Suv39h1 genes into livers of old mice using Adeno-Associated virus (AAV); (7) breed brain-specific and adult-onset Sirt6 knockout mice; (8) perform interventions to suppress L1 retrotransposition using nRTIs in wild type and three different Sirt6 deficient mouse models and examine retrotransposon activity and pathology; (9) determine whether nRTIs extend lifespan of wild type and constitutive whole body Sirt6 knockout mice; (10) generate and breed transgenic mice with shRNA to L1 to inhibit L1 transcription. Analyze whether shRNA alleviates age-related pathology of wild type mice and extends lifespan and rescues pathology of constitutive Sirt6 knockout mice; (11) generate and breed mice with Sirt6 separation of function and regulatory site mutations for analysis of retrotransposon activity and the ability to complement Sirt6 knockout phenotype; (12) maintain a database of all mice to ensure efficient distribution of materials and data to project investigators. Maintaining the centralized rodent colonies will standardize husbandry conditions, quality control and biological samples for use across the PPG projects, improve reproducibility of results, and allow the analysis of the same individual animals by several assays and projects, as well as minimize animal use."
"9272871","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research supported by grant R01 DK41526 for the past 23 years provided findings which allowed us to propose a new model of diabetic nephropathy that is centered on progressive renal decline, not on abnormalities in albuminuria. We found that onset and early progression of renal decline that leads to ESRD are strongly associated with high plasma levels of TNF receptors 1 & 2 (TNFR1, TNFR2). Mechanisms that account for these associations are unknown. To study them we conducted a preliminary study in 110 T1D patients with CKD stage 3. Using the SOMAscan platform which measures levels of 1128 proteins, we identified 31 proteins in baseline plasma that were extremely good, highly statistically significant predictors of ESRD development during 10-year follow-up. The remarkable finding of our study was that the significant proteins included multiple ligands (n=7) and receptors (n=9) of the TNF superfamily that, except for TNFR1 and TNFR2, have never been implicated in kidney diseases. Considering these new findings, we postulate that many ligands and receptors of the TNF superfamily (or a subset) that contribute to progression to ESRD are also involved in both the onset and progression of early renal decline in diabetes. The proposed research uses a custom-made SOMAscan platform of 35 TNF superfamily members) with 20 additional proteins to measure concentration of these candidate proteins in plasma specimens obtained at baseline and during follow-up of T1D and T2D cohorts. Relating concentrations of candidate proteins at baseline and during follow-up with risk of renal decline or ESRD will allow us to determine which ligands and receptors are initiators/drivers of the disease process and which change as a consequence of progressive renal decline. The proposed research has the following specific aims. 1) To establish plasma profiles of ligands and receptors of the TNF superfamily that are associated with risk of late renal decline that leads to ESRD in T1D in the Joslin Proteinuria Cohort; 2) To establish plasma profiles of ligands and receptors of the TNF superfamily that are associated with risk of onset and progression of early renal decline in T1D in the 2nd Joslin Kidney Study; 3) To establish plasma profiles of ligands and receptors of the TNF superfamily that are associated with the risk of onset and progression of early renal decline in T2D Pima Indians. This will test the generalizability of the findings obtained in T1D; 4) To determine the relationship between the revealed plasma profiles of ligands and receptors of the TNF superfamily and morphological lesions in kidney biopsies from T2D Pima Indians; 5) To determine the relationship between the revealed plasma profiles of ligands and receptors of the TNF superfamily and transcript patterns in kidney biopsies from T2D Pima Indians. The proposed research will test many novel hypotheses and has a very high probability of generating findings that will accelerate etiological studies of diabetic nephropathy Its success is assured as follow-up data and a biobank of specimens from all members of the Joslin Cohorts and Pima Indian Cohort are currently in hand."

Our previous successes in attracting and graduating UR students to our programs have transformed our focus beyond enrollment and degree production, to that of the quality of the academic experience and the long-term outcomes for our UR students. This program will benefit from a dual leadership model that combines two campus leaders in STEM education: an accomplished biomedical researcher and a faculty member nationally recognized for his science education and mentoring activities. We have also garnered significant expertise from 62 tenured faculty representing 12 biological and biomedical research areas (applied math, biochemistry, biomedical engineering, chemistry, computational biology, ecology and evolution, marine sciences, medicine, microbiology, neurobiology, pathology, pharmacology and physiology/biophysics). Our goals will be accomplished through enhanced and funded research opportunities for five new undergraduate students and direct financial support for five new doctoral students annually with provision for broader institutional impact. In close collaboration with the biomedical sciences faculty, particularly the research advisors of IMSD MERGE fellows, and departmental leadership, we will address critical issues that serve as impediments to training and career success for UR scientists with targeted preparation for key junctures in academic development to enhance persistence and performance outcomes. This project has the following three specific aims: 1) Increase to 70% the annual number of UR undergraduate students that are persisting in the biomedical science majors past their sophomore year for a total of 50 new biological sciences UR undergraduate majors in each class and ensure 80% of IMSD MERGE undergraduate scholars pursue doctoral study upon graduation through exposure to meaningful research experiences and professional development; 2) Enhance our present efforts to provide academic enrichment and advancement skills for our incoming doctoral students to reach parity in performance with their non UR peers in core courses, qualifying exams and thesis proposal outcomes; and 3) Provide a rigorous professional development regimen for IMSD doctoral students with an emphasis on improving skills related to research project selection, design, and execution in order to increase a) the average number and quality of publications among UR students by 100% (to 2 publications) to achieve parity with the average publications among the non-UR students and b) the total number of UR students entering postdoctoral positions upon graduation from 46% to 65%. Our strong institutional commitment to the objectives of the proposed IMSD MERGE goes beyond the enthusiastic support of senior leadership and commitment of in-kind support. As stated in their letters of support, our President has made a $100,000 commitment to IMSD MERGE to be used for administrative and programmatic expenses not covered by the project budget; our Graduate Dean has committed two recruitment Teaching Assistant lines to support additional IMSD fellows, allowing us to train a total of 25 IMSD doctoral fellows over the initial project period. he program will also benefit from a strong network of collaborators on campus with numerous program leaders and faculty members serving on our Advisory Committee and subcommittees and strong support from our Provost on efforts to bring synergy to our activities across the campus. To further enhance the proposed research training program, we are instituting a Mentor Workshop, an Individualized Development Plan, and monthly networking opportunities with postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty."

"9353370","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects 1 in 5 men in the United States and has annual healthcare expenditures exceeding $4 billion. The treatment paradigm for ED involves a trial-and-error approach, with the costs of repeated clinic visits now exceeding surgical costs. No candidate molecule has shown clinical potential as a marker of high risk or disease stratification to facilitate either targeted therapy or the prevention of ED. Genetic approaches can accelerate such efforts through mechanistic, drug, and biomarker discovery. Unexplained variation in ED risk points toward genetic influences, supported by heritability of 0.32 in the Vietnam Era Twin (VET) Registry. Small studies in selected populations suggest the influence of specific variants on ED risk and on response to the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) sildenafil citrate. Without replication, these findings cannot drive translational advances in care. We hypothesize that genetic variants are associated with ED pathogenesis and progression/severity. Collaboration within the Kaiser Permanente (KP) Research Program in Genes, Environment and Health (RPGEH), electronic Medical Record and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, and the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) will combine innovative phenotyping with existing and imputed genotypes in a cost-effective strategy of proposed genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We will also focus on elucidating the genetic contribution to ED among diabetic men, a high-risk population. Identifying genes and molecular networks associated with ED and clinical measures of severity will substantially advance our understanding of the disease mechanisms of ED."
"9315510","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Hepatitis B virus infections affect about 350 million people worldwide and constitute a significant risk factor for fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV alters mitochondrial dynamics. HBV has been shown to induce autophagy of mitochondria (Mitophagy) as evidenced by Parkin translocation to mitochondria. We propose to investigate a possible link between mitochondrial dynamics induced by HBV and innate immunity. HBV cripples host innate immunity to maintain chronic persistent infection. Here, we propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms of HBV- induced suppression of innate immune signaling from mitochondrial platform. The key player in this process is a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). There is sufficient supporting information, which shows that Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with MAVS on the mitochondria and that Parkin causes the ubiquitination of MAVS. These investigations will elucidate how MAVS is targeted by Parkin in a supracomplex and affects downstream antiviral signaling of interferon synthesis. These interactions and ubiquitinations eventually cripple innate immunity. These studies will provide unique insights into molecular mechanisms of HBV-induced mitochondrial dynamics and its effects on altering host innate immune response and open new avenues of investigations in the elucidation of innate immune pathways."
"9376871","Summary Currently in clinical practice the detection of acute rejection usually depends on serum laboratory values such as serum creatinine or liver function tests, which tend to be insensitive and non-specific measures of organ injury. Ultimately the diagnosis of rejection requires needle biopsy of the transplanted organ. This invasive procedure is associated with increased cost and potential complications including injury to adjacent organs, bleeding and graft loss. In addition, graft biopsy is limited by sampling error where less than 0.01% of the allograft is examined, as well as inter-observer variability in the interpretation of the result. Patients often require multiple biopsies to assess response to treatment, thus putting them at risk each time they undergo a separate procedure. More recently, there has been significant effort in the development of non-invasive methods to detect rejection including gene expression profiling and -omic analysis of blood and urine samples. Despite recent high impact reports this strategy has not been widely adopted. Here we propose to develop and test non-invasive imaging techniques to monitor the allogeneic immune response to the transplanted organ. Specifically, we will utilize ImmunoPET to track and characterize T cell responses in the setting of CD28 costimulation blockade in vivo. We will use state of the art techniques in mouse models to investigate both naïve and memory T cell responses, where we will better define the mechanisms of costimulation blockade resistant rejection. Importantly, our preliminary data in mouse and NHP models reveal a critical role for CD122 in facilitating costimulation blockade-resistant responses; thus, we will use ImmunoPET to visualize the spatiotemporal patterns of CD122+ T cell accumulation following transplantation. We also propose to use ImmunoPET in our non-human primate kidney transplant model to gain further insight into the mechanisms of clinically relevant costimulation blockade-resistant rejection and assess clinical translatability. PET is already widely used in patients and techniques developed in this preclinical setting could be directly applied to clinical practice. This interdisciplinary application combines the expertise of two investigators: Dr. Santangelo who brings exceptional experience using state-of-the-art techniques to image the immune response such as ImmunoPET and Dr. Adams who brings clinical experience and an extensive understanding of novel anti- rejection therapies in transplantation, including costimulation blockade. The use of this powerful imaging technique combined with novel immunotherapies represents a highly innovative approach to further our understanding of the allogeneic immune response following transplantation. In addition, the ability to evaluate this technique not only in rodents but also in a preclinical non-human primate transplant model provides a clear path for potential development and translation of a non-invasive technique to predict rejection in patients."
"9480889","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The most common adrenal disease relates to excess mineralocorticoid production and is called primary aldosteronism (PA). Despite the common occurrence of PA (approximately 1 in 30 adults), little is known about its cellular origins. Recently, a set of somatic gene mutations that cause renin-independent aldosterone production were identified in adrenal adenomas. In vitro studies have confirmed that these mutations cause aldosterone production through effects on adrenal cell calcium homeostasis. This proposal will test the hypotheses: 1) that most adults have neoplastic cells bearing first hit somatic mutations that cause renin- independent aldosterone production; 2) PA results from the build up of these nests of cells or through additional multi-hit mutations that increase cell proliferatio, tumor development and excessive aldosterone synthesis. To test these hypotheses, two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will define the somatic mutations found in normal adrenals that exhibit adrenal aldosterone-producing cell clusters (APCC) and will test the hypothesis that APCC are dysplastic cells bearing somatic gene mutations that activate aldosterone production. Aim 2 will define the somatic gene mutations present in aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA) and test the hypothesis that APA share some mutations with APCC, but exhibit additional mutations that cause cell proliferation and tumor development. The impact of APCC and APA mutations on aldosterone production and cell proliferation will be determined using primary cultures of normal adrenal cells and the H295R adrenal cell line. Pharmacologic agents that inhibit aberrant mutation-stimulated aldosterone production will be defined. The proposed research will significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms leading to mineralocorticoid excess and provide information needed for the future development of molecular diagnostics and targeted therapeutics to treat PA."
"9296121","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of this proposal are to: (1) recruit subjects with lower urinary tract disorders (LUTDs) to validate the new patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools currently being developed by NIDDK LURN Research Network, and (2) use innovative technologies to extensively phenotype a targeted population to expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of LUTD. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with recognized expertise in male and female LUTDs, urologic phenotyping research, bioinformatics, wireless technologies, functional MRI, and structural neuroimaging. In Aim 1, we proposed a systematic, data-driven, targeted approach to recruit subjects with LUTDs to validate the new LURN PRO instruments. In Aim 2, we will enroll subjects with overactive bladder (OAB), systematically collect their phenotype, symptom data and biospecimens using existing bioinformatics pipeline and wireless technologies at Washington University, and prospectively follow them up for 12 months to identify predictors of OAB progression or regression. In Aim 3, we will use innovative neuroimaging techniques to phenotype OAB patients with and without incontinence."
"9296147","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to develop a digital specimen tomosynthesis (DST) system, based upon the clinical specimen radiography (SR) system for performing rapid, volumetric imaging of breast lumpectomy specimen in or near a surgical suite. Even though SR is used currently for surgical positive-margin evaluation, pathological examination guidance, and other clinical/preclinical applications, its utility is limied by the lack of volumetric information about specimens in SR images. The proposed DST can yield useful volumetric information about the specimen by virtue of which overlapping anatomic structures can be discerned, yet involving only minimal modifications to clinical SR. It can accomplish the imaging task within 1-2 minutes, an acceptable clinical time for a rapid evaluation of the specimen in identifying positive margins in and near an operating suite, thus reducing the frequency of positive margins being identified, and of consequent re- excisions, post surgically. It can also be used for improving accuracy in pathologic examinations by providing guidance to the pathologist to focus on regions in the specimen with the highest probability of positivity, thus increasing the sensitivity of the pathology process by reducing the incidence of missed positive regions due to suboptimal sampling. Because multiple SR images, including the ones used in current clinic evaluation, are collected in DST imaging, the DST thus retains the full functionality of current SR, and would not alter the workflow in the operating room, but only enhance the quality of information obtained from imaging, leading to improved decision making. Because the DST is designed based upon an inexpensive SR system that is used widely in breast-surgery suites, it provides an economical, practical solution which can readily be disseminated. Knowledge gained in the project can be exploited for the design and development of advanced, application- specific emerging X-ray-based tomographic imaging systems in image-guided surgery and radiation therapy, and in extremity imaging. The specific aims of the project are (1) to develop DST for rapid, volumetric imaging of lumpectomy specimen; (2) to develop algorithms for enabling DST imaging of lumpectomy specimen; and (3) to evaluate the performance of DST-scan configurations/algorithms."

"9304457","ABSTRACT African American women have 1.5 times the rates of preterm birth (PTB)(<37 weeks) compared with white women. The high PTB rate for African Americans is a longstanding health disparity that negatively affects the health of African American infants. A contributing factor to the PTB disparity for African American women is chronic stress due to experiencing racial discrimination and living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Indeed, pregnant African American women are more likely to experience racial discrimination and live in disadvantaged neighborhoods compared with pregnant white women. While studies, including our own, suggest that racial discrimination and disadvantaged neighborhoods are related to risk of PTB, the biological mechanism by which these factors operate is not understood. Our overarching hypothesis is that chronic stress due to racial discrimination and disadvantaged neighborhoods is associated with changes in the lipidome profile that may act via increased levels of systemic inflammation to produce a higher risk of PTB. Depressive symptoms may also be in the pathway between chronic stress, the lipidomes, systemic inflammation and PTB. We aim to: (1) Determine the impact of chronic stress on lipidome profiles; (2) Determine the impact of lipidome profiles on systemic inflammation and depressive symptoms; and (3) Examine if a lipidome profile is related to lower gestational age at birth and risk of PTB.  In this longitudinal design, we will enroll 150 African American women who live in the Detroit metropolitan area. Racial discrimination, neighborhood conditions and depressive symptoms will be collected by measures used in our prior studies. Cortisol levels will be measured in hair, an innovative measure of chronic stress. Systemic inflammation will be measured by plasma cytokines (e.g., Interleukin-6), chemokines and C-reactive protein. Plasma lipidome profiles will be determined by ?shotgun? Orbitrap high resolution/accurate mass spectrometry. By utilizing the most comprehensive global lipidome profiling method established to date, we will determine molecular compositions of several hundred lipid analytes in plasma obtained from pregnant African American women. We will measure gestational age at birth from medical records. We will also consider the timing of pregnancy in our analyses, as the prenatal data are collected at three distinct time points. Students will be directly involved at all levels of the proposed project including recruitment and retention of participants, hair collection, blood sample management and dissemination of results. The proposed study will provide critical translational research experience for students, with emphasis on encouraging minority students in higher education. The proposed research is highly relevant to NIH?s mission to elucidate mechanisms underlying health disparities in PTB. Our long term goal is to identify risk of PTB based on chronic stress and biomarkers, which will have potential use in clinical practice and be a target for interventions to eliminate disparities in PTB for African American women."
"9316310","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Health disparities in tobacco and other substance use are well documented between sexual minorities (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer) and heterosexual individuals across the lifespan. In particular, sexual minority youth (SMY) initiate tobacco use at younger ages and smoke cigarettes at higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts. Stigma and discrimination-related stressors specific to their minority sexual orientation (i.e., minority stressors) contribute to our understanding of health disparities among SMY. Minority stressors are often experienced daily by SMY. As such, SMY may smoke cigarettes as a way to cope with negative affect elicited by these stigma-based stressors. In fact, cross-sectional research shows that minority stressors are correlated with cigarette smoking and other substance use among SMY. Important limitations of the extant literature, however, include overreliance on cross-sectional and retrospective self-report data, failure to account for within- and between-individual differences in minority stressors and smoking behaviors, and lack of discernment of unique contributions of minority stressors on smoking beyond individual differences in daily general stressors, lifetime cumulative stress, and mental health. In addition, we know very little about the mediating mechanisms between minority stressors and cigarette smoking. Consistent with Institute of Medicine and the NIH Sexual and Gender Minority Research Coordinating Committee's call to expand our understanding of factors contributing to SMY?s higher levels of tobacco and other substance use, and in response to NIH PA-15-263?s focus on sexual minority health research, we propose an innovative exploratory study (R21). We propose a rigorous examination of the effects of minority stressors on cigarette smoking in real time in the natural environment among SMY using electronic experience sampling methods, specifically ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Our primary aims are to examine: a) the relationship between minority stressors and proximal changes in smoking in real time in the natural environment among 60 SMY who are regular smokers using EMA over a 30-day period; b) the effects of minority stressors on proximal changes in affect and craving; and, c) the mediating effects of affect and craving on the relationship between minority stressors and cigarette smoking. Our secondary aims of this study are to examine the effects of minority stressors on proximal changes in other substance use as well as to test resilience resources and contextual risk factors that might be associated with smoking. Findings from this exploratory study would have important theoretical implications for minority stress theory and inform the development of culturally sensitive smoking prevention and cessation interventions for SMY, targeting specific within-individual mechanisms as well as contextual factors. The proposed R21 will also provide pilot data for large scale research to more rigorously test the fine-grained psychosocial resilience and risk mechanisms associated with SMY?s smoking."
"9297358","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is increasing pressure for integration of the patient's perspective in clinical research. An indication of this growth is the establishment of th Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) offer the patient's perspective. There is ample evidence for not relying solely on clinician reporting of patients' subjective experiences. There is also increasing evidence that PROs can provide more information about toxicity and symptoms than physician or adverse event (AE) reports. These findings support the need for tools to collect patient-reported symptoms and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL).      The need to reduce the number of items administered in measuring PROs has long been a concern in health outcomes research. This concern has led researchers toward emerging theories such as item response theory (IRT) and computer adaptive testing (CAT). By only administering questions targeted to the subject's trait level, CAT models can cut testing times by half while improving overall test reliability. Patients can complete a PRO CAT in an average of five questions with reliability similar to a typical 15-25-item survey measure. With this lower level of overall burden, it becomes much easier to administer more comprehensive assessments to patients.      Funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative developed a broad array of high-quality, state-of-the-art PRO measures using IRT/CAT. The Department of Medical Social Sciences at Northwestern University developed Assessment Center, which is the software that administers PROMIS CATs. Assessment Center is a web-based research management software system that allows researchers to create and administer PRO studies.      PROMIS is unidimensional in that there is a separate item bank and therefore a separate set of questions administered for each measured trait. This has been a good initial step in addressing the issue of patient burden, but there is a distinct and achievable avenue through which we can substantially reduce this burden further. That is, there are correlations between related traits. For example, depression and anxiety are closely related, which means many questions that ascertain level of depression can also ascertain level of anxiety. A multidimensional CAT (MCAT) selects items from an item pool such that the items selected maximize information provided on several correlated traits. Such a model would significantly reduce the number of items administered in measuring PROs and thereby further ameliorate the patient's burden. We propose to develop and test MCAT using existing PROMIS item pools. We will show that MCAT is an improvement over fixed-time measures and unidimensional CAT. We will use an API to distribute the MCAT algorithm and item banks developed under this project.      Being situated at Northwestern University, the home of the PROMIS project, and having on our team Michael Bass, the lead software developer for Assessment Center, and Seung Choi, the principal developer of the PROMIS CAT engine, we are in a unique position to conduct this research."
"9348410","Summary: Public Core The Public Core serves an external, global constituency of population scientists, policy makers, and the public at large. This core creates a ?virtual center? with a very broad reach--one that responds to current demands that research be linked to real world problems and that the methods and data used as evidence be widely accessible. CPC has a strong record in data dissemination and research communications and has an experienced team to lead and support this effort. The Public Core will be directed by Kathleen Mullan Harris; she is eminently qualified to lead this effort based on her extensive experience as PI of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) which has been described as exemplifying dissemination of population research data. Her involvement with a large scientific user community (i.e., key stakeholders) will inform important dissemination and security procedures. A primary aim of this core is to make high-quality survey, contextual, and biological data available to a broad population community so that they can address complex social, behavioral, and health issues. Toward this end, CPC has launched three initiatives that are having an impact on the dissemination of data and its methodology: the CPC Data Center, Carolina Explorer, and Carolina Demography. In 2014, CPC began developing the CPC Data Center with the goals of promoting CPC's original data collections, streamlining the application process for access, and facilitating the dissemination of data to researchers. Beginning with its signature data sets, the CPC Data Center is standardizing the process by which data are shared and is releasing the tools that facilitate data discovery. The CPC Data Center initially focused on Add Health, Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, and the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey but will broaden its reach over time. Carolina Explorer grew out of a need for more efficient access to many contextual data sources that are of interest to population researchers, along with building tools that facilitate their access and use. The Carolina Demography initiative focuses on applied demography, with a particular emphasis on North Carolina population dynamics and a North Carolina constituency. In addition to these new initiatives, the Public Core maintains an extensive biological data resource (over 150,000 biospecimens) and makes some biospecimens available to the research community. CPC's data collection efforts and research projects also provide a rich environment for developing and demonstrating population science methods, including data collection technologies, best practices for collecting biospecimens, and analytic tools. CPC disseminates methods that have wide applicability via the web, seminars, and professional meetings. Also provided are library services tailored to meet the needs of the 21st century population community."

"9336386","PROJECT SUMMARY LMIC: South Africa Institution: Stellenbosch University, Cape Town Scientific Area: Biostatistics for HIV research design and methodology Africa Center for Biostatistical Excellence: Building Biostatistics Capacity for HIV/AIDS Research This application is in response to the FOA ?Fogarty HIV Research Training Program for Low- and Middle-Income Country Institutions? under the D43 grant mechanism (FOA PAR-16-279) and requests 5 years of support to build biostatistics capacity for HIV research design and methodology and establish an Africa Center for Biostatistical Excellence (ACBE) at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. The creation of a sustainable, multidisciplinary health research enterprise in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is of paramount importance for improving health, promoting development and advancing science in the region. SSA continues to experience a disproportionate burden of both HIV/AIDS and TB relative to the rest of the world that has led to increases prevention programs as well as research activities to try and stop the pandemic. The growth in HIV/AIDS and TB research activities has created a demand for well-trained methodologists who can contribute to the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of research studies and provide mentoring and training of the next generation of researchers. Locally trained methodologists, including epidemiologists, social scientists and (to a lesser extent) health economists are now available in many African countries. However, despite various efforts in SSA, there remains a critical shortage of biostatistics expertise. Biostatisticians are integral members of research teams required for their skills in writing competitive grants, executing statistical procedures, conducting advanced data analysis, publishing in high profile journals and teaching biostatistics at the postgraduate level. To meet the demand for biostatistical experts, we propose to setup an Africa Center for Biostatistical Excellence (ACBE) at Stellenbosch University with a mission to implementing high quality training programs in biostatistics to meet the HIV research needs and competitiveness of both Stellenbosch University (SU), and SSA region. The specific objectives of this training grant are to: (1) to build biostatistics capacity through a formal Master level academic program at Stellenbosch University; (2) to build biostatistical literacy among biomedical researchers through short courses in Sub-Saharan Africa; (3) to develop biostatistics teaching capacity through specialized seminars and staff development programs; (4) to setup the Africa Center for Biostatistical Excellence; A Center for Biostatistical Excellence is a direct response to one of Fogarty?s strategic plan of building sustainable research environments through centers of research excellence. These research ?hubs? are a way to enrich and sustain the research capacity of an institution by linking it to other sites within a country and across a region. Our proposed ACBE will complement training efforts in other areas of HIV/AIDS and TB research across the SSA region."

"9375604","PROJECT SUMMARY Work from many laboratories has established that DNA sensors ? both membrane-localized Toll-like receptors (e.g. TLR9) and intracellular DNA sensors (e.g. cGAS and IFI16) ? sense herpesviral infection. In striking contrast, our knowledge about the relevance of cytoplasmic RNA sensors of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family in the detection of herpesviruses remains elusive. Furthermore, the physiological RNA molecules that are recognized by RIG-I and the related sensor MDA5 during herpesvirus infection are currently unknown. The proposed study builds on a recent discovery by the Gack laboratory that RIG-I and the intracellular DNA sensors cGAS and IFI16 sense herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection in a temporally distinct manner. Using next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identified that a subset of cellular non-coding RNAs, rather than viral RNAs, are bound to and activate RIG-I during HSV-1 infection. Molecular and cell biological studies in HSV-1-infected human cells revealed that viral perturbation of the natural life cycle of these host-derived RNAs allows their recognition by the sensor RIG-I, thereby stimulating the innate immune response. Using a coordinated series of molecular, biochemical and cell biological approaches combined with RNA-seq technology in HSV-1-infected cells, we will identify and characterize in precise detail the physiological RNA ligands recognized by RIG-I and MDA5 during HSV-1 infection (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will define the molecular details of how viral perturbation of the life cycle of immunostimulatory RNAs triggers an RLR-mediated immune response (Aim 2). Our studies will provide a molecular understanding of RLR-mediated innate sensing of herpesviral infection, which may provide the foundation for new therapeutic approaches or help design better vaccines."
"9298653","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cells  respond  to  mechanical  forces  in  their  environment.  These  forces  are  likely  to  be  as  important  to  cell  phenotype  as  soluble  factors,  with  similarly  complex  effects.  In  particular,  mechanical  tension  generated  by  cells in response to the stiffness of their environment regulates the behavior of most (if not all) cell types. Over  the last ten years, the importance of matrix stiffness as a mechanism for modulating cell shape and function  has become increasingly studied, and there is now good evidence that changes in stiffness not only correlate  with disease, but contribute to its development.   A limitation of most current work studying the role of tissue stiffness in pathology is an exclusive emphasis on  cell and tissue elastic modulus, which is frequently reported as a constant independent of time or deformation  (strain).  Synthetic  substrates  have  been  used  extensively  for  studies  of  the  cellular  response  to  substrate  stiffness, but have a numberof significant differences from biological tissues: they are linearly elastic, whereas  most  biologicl  materials  demonstrate  non-linearity~  they  fail  to  incorporate  viscosity,  although  biologicl  materials  are  viscoelastic~  and  they  are  two-dimensional  rather  than  three-dimensional.  Thus,  while  cells  clearly respond to changes in the elastic modulus, the impact of viscosity and non-linearity on cells and tissues  is  not  understood  even  though  these  factors  may  be  major  determinants  of  cell  behavior  in  mechanically  physiological environments.    We hypothesize that mechanosensing by cells within tissues or on artificial substrates has characteristic length  and  time  scales  and  that  non-linear  elasticity  and  viscosity  are  important  properties  of  biological  tissues  that  drive  cell  behavior  and  tissue  organizaton  over  both  short  and  long  ranges.  Our  goal  is  to  develop  a  mechanical model of a tissue, and to determine the biological relevance of various mechanical features to cell  behavior and architectural features of this tissue when normal and injured. We will use the normal and fibrotic  liver as a model tissue, since there are extensive preliminary characterizations of liver mechanics, although the  general principles of our work will be applicable to multiple tissues.    We have three specific aims: 1) to carry out a detailed mechanical characterization of the normal and fibrotic  liver, and to develop and test a mechanical model of the liver highlighting the relative contributions of cells and  the matrix~ 2) to develop and characterize novel viscoelastic substrates that mimic the viscoelasticity of normal  and  fibrotic  livers,  and  to  determine  the  response  of  individual  cells  of  the  liver  to  these  biologically  relevant  substrates~ and 3) to computationally model and experimentally test the role of mechanics in large-scale tissue  patterning in fibrosis."
"9355250","Abstract: The University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Imaging Core, led by Noam Harel, Ph.D. and based at the University of Minnesota's internationally renowned Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR), will acquire state- of- the-art, high-resolution MRI for all subjects in Projects 1, 2 and 3. The overall goal of the Imaging Core is to use advanced imaging capabilities for direct visualization of anatomical targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery as well as provide the precise location of individual electrode contacts within the target following implantation. The Imaging Core will combine several cutting edge MRI techniques, including T1 and T2 weighted, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) for tractography to create patient- specific anatomical models of the target region and associated networks. For Projects 1 and 2, PD Parkinson's disease (PD) will be scanned on a 7 T MRI system using tools developed by our team at the CMRR. For Project 3, the non-human primates (NHPs) will be scanned on the newly installed, first of its kind, 10.5 T MRI scanner also at the CMRR. For each PD patient and each NHP, the Imaging Core will acquire high-resolution MRI data prior to implant surgery and a head CT scan after surgery. Images will be fused to provide a comprehensive anatomical model of the DBS target and the precise location of individual DBS contacts within each target. These images will provide unparalleled anatomical characterization specific to each individual. After post- processing analysis, the Imaging Core will create subject-specific computational models estimating the volume of tissue activated by DBS. Subject specific models of anatomical and functional connectivity developed by the Imaging Core will provide data that is vital for the completion of each project in the UMN Udall Center."
"9282553","For this program project, we will establish a bioinformatics core to process and analyze the large amount of data that will be generated by its four projects. We propose a comparative study of genome maintenance and tumor suppression in relation to aging in rodents. While it has long been observed that rodents differ enormously in their life spans, the mechanisms behind this difference remain unclear. Lack of this information is an important problem, because, without this knowledge, acquiring the ability to modulate aging on the whole organism level is highly unlikely. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that determine longevity. The overall objective of the bioinformatics core is to provide computational support and service to the project investigators - namely, both to work with each project to handle data generated therein and to integrate data from all projects to achieve the aims of the program project grant as a whole. The central hvpothesis of this Program is that long-lived rodents have evolved specific molecular mechanisms that mediate their longevity. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories. The rationale for a dedicated bioinformatics core is that a consolidated facility is needed to manage the large amount of data on the whole genome level generated by each of four highly integrated projects of this program project. This bioinformatics core will be established to achieve three specific aims: 1) To deveipp a Web portal to warehouse and share data generated by projects; 2) To facilitate projects to process and analyze the data that they generate; 3) To integrate project data at the systems level and identify genetic network related to life span control. The function of the bioinformatics core is significant, because it will be set up to meet the challenge posed by the high volume of data that need to be generated, examined at multiple levels by a variety of approaches, integrated to develop the models of lifespan control, and shared among project investigators. RELEVANCE (See instructions); The proposed bioinformatics core is relevant to public health because the Web data portal and novel computational methods, which will be developed to tackle the genetic bases behind the enormous difference in life span among rodents, will also be used to disseminate the data to the larger research community. The proposed research is relevant to the Nll-l's mission in that it pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disability associated with advanced age."
"9282556","Genome maintenance capacity has long been implicated in the evolution of species-specific maximum life span. Thus far, this could not be directly tested due to the lack of techniques to comparatively analyze somatic mutations in different species. While ultra-high-throughput sequencing now allows determining germ line mutation rate by comparing parents and offspring after whole genome sequencing, the rate of somatic mutations cannot be measured in this way because each mutation occurs only in one or few cells. Low- abundance, somatic mutations could theoretically be revealed by ultra-deep sequencing of a DNA sample from tissue (i.e., at ~ lOVold coverage). However, true mutations cannot be distinguished from sequencing errors, which occur at frequencies of 0.1-1%. We recentiy developed a method that allows assessing somatic mutation frequencies and spectra using a single-cell genomic sequencing approach. When sequencing the genome of a single cell after whole genome amplification, each mutation in that cell will be amplified and shows up in 50% of the reads at a given locus (one allele only since random mutations are unlikely to hit the exact same basepair in two independent DNA molecules). We demonstrated that this can be done at a very low error rate of amplification. In Project 3 we will use this method to first compare somatic mutation frequencies and spectra in cells from different rodent species with extreme differences in life span, with a focus on the possible role of DNA double-strand break repair, then study the possible effect of several potential mutation rate suppressors and, finally, study age-related mutation accumulation in liver and spleen of a short- and long-lived rodent species. RELEVANCE (See instructions): A major question in the science of aging is what underiies the often dramatic differences in species-specific life span, which even among closely related rodent species can vary at least 10-fold. In this project we will test the hypothesis that long-lived rodent species, such as naked mole rate, can live so much longer than short-lived rodents, such as mice, because of their capacity to better prevent DNA mutations accumulating in the genome of their somatic cells. This is relevant because it will give us insight in the factors that control longevity and cancer risk in mammals."
"9306099","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans recognize and categorize the visual input in about a tenth of a second. However, it is still a mystery how the brain achieves this remarkable ability. The cortical visual recognition system consists of a processing stream starting in V1 and ascending into high-level visual areas associated with recognition in ventral temporal cortex (VTC). The goal of the proposed research is to make important theoretical and empirical progress in our understanding of the neural basis of recognition by examining the interplay between neural implementation, representations, and computations in human VTC. Prior research from our lab used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (HR-fMRI) to advance understanding of the functional organization of VTC by generating an organizational framework detailing its neuroanatomical and topological characteristics. Leveraging these findings, this proposal uses an innovative approach with cutting edge techniques combining HR-fMRI, macro-anatomical, cytoarchitechtonic and myeloarchitectonic measurements, high spatial and angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), advanced tracking algorithms, and computational modeling to address the following three key questions: (1) Is neural microarchitecture an implementational constraint underlying the topological organization of functional representations in VTC? (2) Does structural and functional connectivity regulate functional representations of VTC? (3) How does the neural implementation relate to computations in VTC? Aim 1 will inform if/how the topology of functional representations in VTC is determined by the underlying cytoarchictecture and myeloarchitecture, which may have evolved to optimize particular computations. Aim 2 will investigate the fine-scale functional and structural connectivity of high-level visual cortex determining how information is segregated and integrated within and across adjacent specialized cortical networks. Aim 3 will develop the first generative and quantitative model of VTC computations with the ability to predict responses to stimuli varying in shape, position, and size, while also determining if there is a perceptually-relevant hierarchical processing of information across VTC. This research has important clinical applications for identifying abnormalities in the functional neuroanatomy of VTC within individual brains, and thus, is relevant for patient populations with anatomical or functional VTC deficits, and for individuals with atypical perception or recognition. Overall, the research will break new ground in understanding the neural bases of visual recognition in humans by elucidating the interplay between neural implementation, representations, and computations in human VTC."
"9383780","Abstract  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the USA. The failure of treatment is due to resistance to chemotherapy, one of the biggest obstacles for effective cancer therapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify molecules or pathways that can be targeted to overcome drug resistance and improve cancer treatment.  TGF? plays multiple functions including conferring drug resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying TGF?-mediated chemoresistance are not clear. PDK4 is one of the isoforms of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), which phosphorylate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and regulate glucose metabolism. We have discovered a novel function of PDK4 that mediates the response of colon cancer cells to 5-FU treatment. We show that PDK4, but not PDK 1-3, is differentially expressed in colon cancer cells, and that its expression positively correlates with the resistance to 5-FU treatment. Knockdown of PDK4 sensitizes colon cancer cells to 5-FU- or oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis. Experiments in tumor xenograft mouse models demonstrate that knockdown of PDK4 increases the effectiveness of 5-FU-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, for the first time, we have established a novel crosstalk between TGF? signaling and PDK4: TGF? increases PDK4 expression while PDK4 enhances TGF? signaling, which forms a positive feedback loop. Elevated PDK4 expression contributes to TGF?-mediated drug resistance in colon cancer cells. Studies of patient samples indicate that expression of PDK4 and TGF? signaling positively correlate with each other and with chemoresistance in CRC. Therefore, our studies unveil an important function of TGF?/PDK4 in mediating drug resistance in CRC.  In this proposal, we will determine the mechanism(s) underlying the crosstalk between TGF? signaling and PDK4, elucidate the mechanism(s) of PDK4-mediated drug resistance and identify novel substrates of PDK4. We will determine the functional role of PDK4 in colon cancer metastasis and the contribution of PDK4 and its crosstalk with TGF? in CRC drug resistance using an orthotopic mouse model. We will also demonstrate the clinical relevance in patient samples. The completion of these studies will identify TGF?/PDK4 as a novel regulator of chemoresistance in CRC, substantially advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance and provide proof-of-concept that combinations of 5-FU with inhibitors of PDK4 or TGF? could be potentially effective therapies to overcome chemoresistance for CRC treatment."

"9388843","The goal of our research is to chemically characterize DNA adducts associated with specific human cancers. We will link this structural information to novel mutational patterns identified during this research. These melded data should facilitate significantly the identification of environmental, dietary and endogenous agents responsible for human cancers. The proposed research focuses on renal and urological cancers; specifically, clear-cell renal cell carcinomas, carcinomas of the upper urinary tract and bladder cancer. Additionally, we will attempt to detect and, if possible, quantify single or multiple DNA adducts found in exfoliated urinary cells as an initial step in developing a noninvasive biomarker for carcinogen screening.  In this research, we utilize sensitive, mass spectrometry techniques to detect and quantify multiple DNA adducts in target tissues and urinary cells. For screening purposes, we will employ ultraperformance liquid chromatography/multistage scan mass spectrometry (UPLC/MSn), using a linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The use of UPLC/MSn permits quantitation of known adducts and characterization of unknown adducts, the latter by acquiring MS3 scan stage product ion spectra. We have employed this approach successfully to identify single and multiple DNA adducts in human tissues, saliva, and exfoliated urinary cells.  In Aim 1, we use data-dependent and independent scanning methods to optimize detection of DNA adducts derived from genotoxins found in tobacco smoke and in the diet; also from electrophiles that are produced endogenously by oxidative processes. In Aim 2, we employ targeted as well as data-dependent and independent ?adductomics? approaches, using UPLC/MSn to screen DNA adducts formed in the kidney, upper urothelial tract, bladder, and cells in the urine of patients with target cancers. In Aim 3, we conduct deep sequencing of DNA isolated from tumor and non-tumor tissues to identify mutational patterns that may be linked to specific DNA adducts, chemical exposures or aberrant endogenous processes.  Our research has significant implications for public health. DNA adduct and mutational data are of high translational impact and provide an understanding of exposures to hazardous chemicals that can initiate cancer in humans. By linking these methods, we create a molecular approach that provides clues to the identity of environmental, dietary and endogenous carcinogens and establishes biomarkers of exposure that can be used in epidemiologic studies to identify populations at risk. Once identified, pragmatic measures can be taken to reduce human exposure to these chemicals, by changes in life-style and/or diet, which are probably the most efficient means of chemoprevention."
"9296129","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is common, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing as the population ages. Symptoms of LUTD are costly to diagnose and treat; existing therapeutic interventions are neither highly effective nor durable and have side effects of their own. Not surprisingly, unsatisfactory outcomes from the patient perspective are common. Collectively, these challenges represent important targets of research that are consistent with the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Previous efforts to improve patient reported outcomes (PRO) in this area have relied on incomplete symptom measurement scales and have been hampered by imperfect understanding of the origin and natural history of LUTD. Comprehensive re-evaluation of the symptom universe of LUTD and more precise characterization of patients with symptoms of LUTD (phenotyping) may provide significant new insights, leading ultimately to improved patient lives. The NIDDK-sponsored Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) includes a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to serve as the project and data management nexus for the network. The purpose of this project is to expand the DCC, and increase the number of clinical sites that will enroll patients with symptoms of LUTD into carefully designed studies. There are three specific aims. The first is to expand the infrastructure of the LURN network to accommodate the addition of three to four clinical sites, plus the anticipated increase in complexity in supporting a larger consortium. The second specific aim is to enhance the collaboration between stakeholders by increasing the number of face-to-face meetings of the Steering Committee from one (currently) to three annually. The third aim is to expand the LURN consortium's patient-reported outcome measurement tools to include development and implementation of computerized adaptive testing."
"9276002","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal degeneration is a major cause of blindness, yet no effective treatments are available. It is estimated that one in 3,500 to 4,000 people is affected by retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a group of inherited retinal degenerative disorders. We recently identified a novel RP-causing mutation in the gene that encodes DHDDS (dehydrodolichol diphosphate synthase), a key enzyme of dolichol biosynthesis. A single base c.124A>G mutation changes the highly conserved Lys42 in DHDDS to a Glu residue, resulting in weak substrate binding and lowered catalytic efficiency. This mutation accounts for 12% of all the autosomal recessive RP cases in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) patients and is heterozygous in 1 in 322 in the AJ population. A large knowledge gap exists in our understanding of the link between the DHDDS mutation and retinal degeneration. For example, the exact biological functions of free dolichols, the final products of DHDDS, are not well understood. This mutation provides a rare opportunity to study the roles of free dolichols in photoreceptors. In addition, th molecular and clinical insights obtained from our studies will help to develop novel therapies. Two Hypotheses are proposed: 1) The K42E DHDDS mutation alters dolichol profile and causes dolichol deficiency in photoreceptors, leading to retinal degeneration; 2) Free dolichols play essential roles in the structure and functions of photoreceptors, including membrane trafficking and vesicle fusion, which is vitally important in outer segment (OS) morphogenesis, renewal, and synaptic transmission. We also propose 3 Specific Aims to test these hypotheses: 1) Study the effect s of DHDDS mutations on dolichol metabolism in human ; 2) Study the mechanism of retinal degeneration caused by the DHDDS mutation in mouse ; 3) Study the biological functions of free dolichols in photoreceptors. We will study dolichol metabolism in fibroblasts, as well as blood and urine from patients. We will also use a mouse model that harbors the K42E DHDDS mutation to understand retinal degeneration caused by dolichol deficiency, and the structural and functional roles of dolichols in photoreceptors. Through the proposed work, we will gain an understanding of the disease process and mechanism caused by DHDDS mutations, and the functions of free dolichols in photoreceptors, with the ultimate goal of developing novel and effective therapies."
"9175858","Project Summary/Abstract The beneficial infant outcomes of maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) in pregnant smokers is supported by our robust pre-trial evidence in animal models and convincing human pilot data. This evidence served as the basis for our current multi-center double blind randomized trial ?Vitamin C to Decrease Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function? (VCSIP; NCT01723696). Recruitment is completed as scheduled with 252 pregnant smokers randomized to vitamin C or placebo. VCSIP's primary and secondary outcomes, respectively, are pulmonary function testing (PFT) of infants at 3 months of age, and PFTs and the incidence of wheeze at 12 months of age. This application is a renewal for the VCSIP trial to continue following mothers and their offspring through 5 years of age. Time is critical, as the study population is predominantly under-resourced making rapport crucial to cohort retention, which requires personnel and time. The aim of this renewal proposal is to determine whether prenatal supplementation with vitamin C can improve pulmonary function and decrease recurrent wheeze through 5 years of age in the offspring of smokers. Our hypothesis is that supplemental vitamin C in pregnant smokers will significantly improve their children's pulmonary function and decrease recurrent wheeze. This is a logical continuation for the VCSIP trial as transient versus recurrent wheeze are not clinical distinguishable until 5 years of age. Following infants from the VCSIP until age 5 years: will differentiate patients with transient versus recurrent wheeze (a more likely predictor of asthma); will determine if early life protective effects of vitamin C are sustained to this older age; and will provide structure for continued biologic samples from the children for future mechanistic studies of vitamin C action. All investigators, clinical staff and participants will remain blinded to treatment allocation. We are currently completing the primary outcome, and based on the number of randomized smokers we will have a sufficient number of pulmonary function measurements at 3 months of age in the infants of randomized smokers to meet the predetermined sample size for this analysis. The first infants of VCSIP turned 1 year old in May 2014; therefore this proposal is being submitted now, prior to the analysis of the primary outcome of the VCSIP study, to minimize gaps in the follow-up of this valuable cohort. The children will be followed with quarterly respiratory questionnaires and yearly visits, collecting the following samples: maternal and child hair for nicotine; child buccal swabs; maternal exhaled carbon monoxide; pulmonary function tests at 3, 4,and 5 years of age. This competitive renewal will allow us to study the longer term outcome of our intervention with vitamin C with regards to childhood pulmonary function and the occurrence of recurrent wheeze through 5 years of age. It will also allow us to follow this unique, extensively phenotyped cohort of children born to pregnant smokers to 5 years of age to address important scientific questions related to maternal smoking and childhood respiratory health/wheeze/asthma."

"9280760","The hippocampus and medial temporal lobe structures play critical roles in the formation and maintenance of declarative memories. A consensus is emerging that the hippocampus receives a self-motion-based, spatial signal from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and an external sensory signal about objects and items in the world from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). It combines these inputs to create conjunctive representations of discrete experiences within their spatiotemporal contexts. Because memory loss is one of the hallmark characteristics of both normal and pathological aging, a key challenge is to understand the physiological changes that occur in the hippocampus with aging. Recent results suggest that the LEC is particularly susceptible to age-related dysfunction. Moreover, treatment with the antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, can ameliorate some of the physiological and cognitive impairments associated with aging.  This project proposes a number of experiments to test specific hypotheses about how LEC and MEC inputs affect hippocampal function with aging. Place cells of aged rats with impaired memory show a reduced control by local sensory cues (associated with neural representations of the LEC), whereas they continue to be controlled by global spatial cues (associated with representations of the MEC). Place cells of the CA3 region will be recorded from young rats and from aged rats (with and without memory impairments) in the following experiments. (a) Local and global spatial reference frames will be placed in conflict. It is hypothesized that aged impaired rats will show an abnormal lack of control by the local reference frame, and that this abnormal condition will be ameliorated by treatment with levetiracetam. (b) The geometry and location of a recording chamber will be altered. It is hypothesized that aged impaired rats will show an abnormal stability of their place fields when only the geometry is altered (due to a hypothesized loss of LEC input) but will show normal place field changes when the location is altered (due to a hypothesized normal MEC input). The abnormal stability patterns will be ameliorated with levetiracetam treatment. (c) The formation of new place fields associated with an investigatory behavior known as head-scanning will be investigated It is hypothesized that aged impaired rats will show a reduction in the formation of new place fields associated with this behavior. Treatment with levetiracetam will restore this neural plasticity phenomenon. (d) Recordings from the MEC and LEC will test the hypothesis that grid cells, border/boundary cells, and nonspatial cells of aged impaired rats will be normal, compared to young and aged unimpaired rats. These experiments will provide robust tests of the general hypothesis that LEC neural processing is particularly susceptible to age-related dysfunction, and that levetiracetam treatment is a potential therapy to restore hippocampal function in aged-impaired animals."

"9293198","SUMMARY FOR CLINICAL CORE  The over-arching goal of the Clinical Core will be to provide research diagnostic evaluations for a large clinical population with a special emphasis on subjects who are followed longitudinally to provide well- characterized subjects for the research projects conducted by ADRC investigators and collaborators. Important focuses of the Clinical Core as for the Yale ADRC broadly include cell biology, the integration of translational neuroscience, and an emphasis on systematic storage of biospecimens for current and future biomarker studies. While the importance of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and therapeutic development is well appreciated, recent advances in targeted proteomics have not been deployed in this field. The Yale ADRC Biomarker/Pathology Core and specific Research Projects will seek to develop these methods with relevance to AD and related disorders. In partnership with these efforts, the Clinical Core will undertake the collection of a wide range of biomarker specimens across the full spectrum of AD cross-sectionally and during the full course of AD longitudinally. Aim 1 will provide for the evaluation and enrollment of approximately 500 subjects who will enter the Core Population for participation in research in five diagnostic categories on the full continuum of AD (from preclinical to dementia), as well as non-AD dementias and normal controls. A diagnostic category of special interest for the Yale ADRC is cognitively normal middle-aged (50-65) first-degree relatives at varying APOE4 genetic risk for AD. Aim 2 will enroll these 500 subjects in the Uniform Data Set (UDS) population and make the UDS measures available to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) for national studies. Aim 3 will enroll subjects into the Autopsy Program. Aim 4 will provide appropriate subjects for the clinical studies affiliated with the ADRC. Aim 5 will collect and distribute biological specimens to ADRC and other researchers for biomarker studies. These Aims will provide ADRC affiliated investigators the ready ability to test biomarkers once validated in AD dementia in the earliest stages of AD pathogenesis."

"9278099","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the US, as well as in the VA Health System. However, despite several programs to prevent and treat alcohol abuse, a significant proportion of affected Veterans continue to drink, even in the setting of cirrhosis. This can lead to a substantial burden that stems from an unchecked inflammatory milieu and endotoxemia due to bacterial translocation that precipitates infections, multi-organ failure and death. These patients are poor candidates for abstinence pharmacological therapy, are often non-adherent and cannot be offered liver transplant due to their continued drinking. Therefore prevention of this unchecked inflammation and bacterial translocation is critical; however, the exact mechanisms behind these are unclear, which is a major gap in our knowledge. Bile acids (BAs) and gut microbiota are key components of the intestinal milieu, whose interaction impacts bacterial translocation and inflammation. Our group has focused on delineating the role of microbiota, using culture- independent analyses, with inflammation and their modulation by BAs, especially the membrane-destabilizing secondary BAs in cirrhosis. We also discovered that actively drinking cirrhotics have a highly significant increase in fecal secondary BAs and intestinal inflammatory cytokine expression that may mediate intestinal injury and potentiate inflammation in these patients. Therefore, the study of the role of secondary BAs in the pathogenesis of intestinal and systemic inflammation in the context of altered gut microbiota or dysbiosis, in actively drinking cirrhotics compared to abstinent alcoholic cirrhotics and cirrhotics with non-alcoholic liver disease is critical in delineating the role of the intestinal milieu in the progression of liver disease. Our central hypothesis: Patients with cirrhosis, especially alcoholic cirrhotic patients who continue to drink, develop enhanced intestinal and systemic inflammation due to an increase in secondary bile acids associated with altered gut microbiota. This central hypothesis will be tested using these two specific aims: Specific aim 1: To define the effect of secondary bile acids on systemic and gut inflammation, gut microbiome and endotoxemia in cirrhotic patients with continued alcohol abuse compared to abstinent alcoholic cirrhotics and non-alcoholic cirrhotics using a systems biology approach. We will study the interaction of BAs with microbiome of the duodenal, ileal, colonic and fecal origin with systemic and intestinal wall inflammation in age- and cirrhosis-severity matched actively drinking cirrhotics compared to abstinent alcoholic cirrhotics, cirrhotic with NAFLD and healthy controls using a systems biology approach in 100 subjects. Specific Aim 2: To define the role of bile acids and gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of the increased intestinal and systemic inflammation, endotoxemia and bacterial translocation in a germ-free mouse model after colonization with stool from alcoholic cirrhotic patients. We will be utilizing germ-free mice to elucidate the individual contributions of bile acids and microbiota on endotoxemia, inflammation and bacterial translocation. Six groups of germ-free mice will be used: 1) without intervention 2) fed deoxycholic acid alone 3) colonized with healthy human stool 4) colonized with alcoholic cirrhotic stool. Each group will be evaluated for intestinal and systemic inflammation, endotoxemia, BA profile (serum, gallbladder, liver, fecal, intestinal contents) and microbiome changes (Groups 3-4) will be performed after colonization and compared between groups. The studies will provide a novel integrative platform to study the role of secondary bile acids and gut microbiota in the development of intestinal and systemic inflammation in all cirrhotic patients using cutting-edge translational and systems biology approaches. We expect the results of this proposal to increase our insight into the development of focused therapeutic approaches that benefit this underserved population of Veterans."
"9334701","PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT 1) Retrotransposable elements (RTEs) comprise ~45% of the human genome. RTEs are mobile DNA elements that can insert into new genomic positions using a copy and paste mechanism. This process, termed retro- transposition, can be deleterious at multiple levels by causing mutagenesis and genome structural instability, triggering epigenetic changes, and disrupting normal patterns of gene regulation. Organisms have evolved multiple transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms to protect their genomes. Until recently RTEs were thought to be silent in the soma, however, new evidence points to activity in the brain and in cancer cells. Indeed, initial indications are that somatic retrotransposition is much more frequent than previously anticipated. Our group has reported that retrotransposition is activated during aging and cellular senescence, and hypothesized that it may represent a hitherto unappreciated molecular aging process. These findings however raise important new questions: what is the magnitude of the 'retrotransposition problem', and to what extent is this process damaging to our somatic cells? What are the mechanisms that hold RTEs in check in somatic tissues, and how do they fail with age? Our lack of knowledge in these areas is a key barrier to under- standing the role of RTEs in aging and disease. To break new ground in these efforts our research seeks to elucidate what we broadly refer to as 'the landscape of somatic retrotransposition'. In Aim 1 we will perform a genome-wide quantitative analysis of novel transpositions. The frequency of these events in the genomes of senescent or aged cells, their structures, and their locations are completely unknown. With Jef Boeke and Core B we will apply high-throughput DNA sequencing, including TIP-seq and single-cell whole genome sequencing to comprehensively profile novel transposition events. As an independent method we will use retrotransposon reporters. Aim 2 is based on our preliminary data that occupancy of pRb on the L1 promoter decreases in senescent human cells and aging mouse tissues, that overexpression of pRb antagonizes the activation of L1 in senescent cells, and knockdown in normal cells promotes L1 activation. We hypothesize that pRb, a known regulator heterochromatin, represses L1 in normal cells and that this mechanism fails during senescence and aging. We will therefore examine the composition of pRb-containing complexes and their interaction with L1s, observe their behavior during cellular senescence and mouse aging, and perturb specific components to test effects on L1 activity. In Aim 3 we will modulate RTE activity using genetic and pharmaceutical interventions and investigate the consequences on cellular function. We will use engineered regulatable L1 elements to drive increased retrotransposition activity, develop shRNA or CRISPR interventions to block the transcription of endogenous L1s, and treat cells and mice with reverse transcriptase inhibitors to determine whether age- associated phenotypes can be ameliorated. Our long-term goal is to assess the extent to which RTEs contribute to aging or age-associated disorders, and hence are potential targets for therapeutic interventions."

"9298650","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Successful treatment of pancreatic cancer remains a challenge due to the presence of pronounced desmoplastic tumor microenvironment and emergence of chemoresistance resulting in recurrence and metastatic spread. Gemcitabine shows only limited efficacy due to its inefficient delivery to tumor because of its hydrophilicity and rapid metabolism and also due to the activity of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are regulated by miRNAs. In our preliminary studies, gemcitabine was conjugated to poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylene carbonate) (PEG- PCC) and formulated into micelles which significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to free drug when injected intravenously into pancreatic tumor bearing NSG mice. To achieve complete tumor regression, we identified miR-205 among a series of dysregulated miRNAs from the CSCs isolated from gemcitabine resistant MIA PaCa-2R cells and human pancreatic cancer tissues, to be significantly downregulated and playing a predominant role in regulating cell growth, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resistance. Transfection of MIA PaCa-2R cells with miR-205 mimic resulted in the restoration of chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. Then, we synthesized gemcitabine conjugated poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylene carbonate-graft- dodecanol-graft-tetraethylenepentamine) copolymer having cationic chains for polyplex formation with miR-205 mimic which showed improved stability in fetal bovine serum and efficiently transfected and reversed chemoresistance, invasion and metastasis in gemcitabine resistant cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that co-formulation of miR-205 mimic with gemcitabine may effectively treat pancreatic cancer by reversing the chemo-resistance of CSCs and simultaneously target bulk tumor cells as well. Major focus of the project is to: a) discover suitable miRNAs to target chemo-resistance and EMT (like miR205) in pancreatic cancer and b) co-deliver this miRNA with gemcitabine to the tumor using a actively targeted nanocarrier which can protect both these molecules from plasma degradation and ensure enhanced uptake. Our specific aims are to i) identify the aberrantly expressed miRNAs and validate their role in chemoresistance, invasion and metastasis; ii) co- formulate miRNA and gemcitabine in polymeric micelles and assess their synergistic effect on the inhibition of pancreatic cancer and, iii) assess the synergistic action of micelles carrying gemcitabine and miRNA on the regression of human pancreatic tumor bearing mice. Significance of the project is to develop nanomedicines of miRNA mimic and gemcitabine that effectively increase local drug concentrations within the fibrotic stroma of these tumors and bypass the chemo-resistant mechanisms that allow tumor growth and inhibit the efficacy of current standard chemotherapies."
"9276763","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant Loss of the quiescent endothelial phenotype is central to the pathogenesis and progression of a broad spectrum of severe diseases including diabetic complications, sepsis and cardiovascular disease. The current dearth of therapies available to treat vascular dysfunction in these diseases underscores the need to develop new approaches for treatment. We suggest that the Angiopoietin-Tie2/Tek vascular signaling pathway is a promising new target. For example, delivery of Angiopoietin1, prevents vascular leak and inflammation, while promoting endothelial survival in both cell culture and transgenic models. In patients with critical vascular diseases, alterations in circulating Angiopoietin (Angpt) levels ar closely linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, we hypothesized that activation of the Tie2 receptor would restore vascular quiescence and function in disease states such as diabetic nephropathy. To test this hypothesis and test the capacity of potent on-target therapies, we will combine studies using robust, genetic animal models, small molecule inhibitors and proteomic strategies for defining the role of the Angiopoietin-Tie2/Tek pathway in vascular diseases. Using these approaches, we will precisely characterize, for the first time, the function(s) and contributions of each of the major Angpt ligands in activation of the Tie2 receptor in the vasculature in vivo, and determine whether inhibition of the phosphatase, VE-PTP, can activate Tie2 in vivo and protect the endothelium from injury in a disease such as diabetes. We will also characterize the complete phosphoproteome of Tie2 and the related ligandless-receptor Tie1, to designate specified vascular functions and effectors for each individual phosphorylation site, ultimately paving the way to improved drug design for vascular dysfunction. Despite the current intense interest in the Angpt-Tie2 pathway by clinicians and pharma, large gaps exist in our knowledge surrounding fundamental aspects of its function(s) at the whole animal, tissue and molecular level. Our studies will provide critical new insights, which are necessary for providing the rationale for supporting clinical applications of this promising therapeutic target."
"9302401","DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant): High resolution images of molecular oxygenation have been shown to provide crucial guides to the delivery and monitoring of cancer therapy in model systems. Stroke and myocardial infarction therapies may similarly benefit. EPR imaging (EPRl) of oxygen (EPROI) provides a unique combination of spatial resolution, oxygen resolution, time resolution and uniform sensitivity with depth in tissue. This Center focuses on the optimization of  In Vivo EPR Oxygen Imaging anticipating human images. It is a consortium between the Universities of Chicago, Denver, Maryland, and the Novosibirsk Institute of Organic Chemistry, Russia. EPROI requires coordinated development of multidisciplinary technologies: instrumentation for spectroscopic imaging, spin probes to sample and report the tissue fluid environment and imaging strategies to optimally sample and analyze the image information obtained- The Center is built on this multidisciplinary effort from medical physicists, engineers, biologists, radiation oncologists, physical and organic chemists, statisticians and imaging mathematicians. In the past 5 years the Center: 1) implemented T1/R1 sensitive pulse sequences that free trityl based EPR oxygen images from confounding variations; 2) developed and made routine highly sensitive Electron Spin Echo pulse imaging as a Tl and T2 readout; 3) enhanced signal to noise ratio per unit time (SNR/t) of pulse imaging with novel technical methods; 4) developed methods for large object imaging; 5) applied novel nitroxide sensitive rapid scan imaging to animal systems; 6) made significant progress toward the development of unusually narrow line trityls; 7) synthesized novel very narrow line deuterated nitroxides for pH and thiol imaging. These achievements prepare the Center for the promise of its final funding cycle, work toward human application. Toward that end we propose the following Technology Research and Development Projects: 1) Higher SNR/t for enhanced spatial and p02 resolution EPROI; 2) Rapid EPROI acquisition - time resolved three dimensional oxygen image movies; 3) Enhanced registration of EPROI with multimodality imaging for better definition of tissue and tumor microenvironment; 4) Commercial small animal pulse oxygen and rapid scan imaging systems to accelerate pharmaceutical development and the development of a human imager prototype. The last aim fulfills the Center mission of commercial migration of the EPRl technology. We will work with Bruker BioSpin on a commercial small animal imaging system."
"9210586","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Objectives: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. There is a large and growing population of Veterans undergoing the lung cancer evaluation process, often as a result of detection of a pulmonary nodule. This growth is fueled by several factors. First, many Veterans are at substantial risk of developing lung cancer because of a smoking history and military and environmental exposures to carcinogens such as asbestos and Agent Orange. Second, the number of patients with incidentally-detected pulmonary nodules is sizable as a result of the burgeoning use of thoracic radiologic imaging. Third, and most importantly, lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has begun and it is estimated that 7 million US adults and 1 million Veterans may be eligible. A recent study of lung cancer screening using LDCT, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), showed lung cancer and overall mortality reductions of 20% and 7%, respectively. Based on this benefit, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and other organizations recommend consideration of annual CT screening for people who meet NLST eligibility criteria. Accordingly, the VA's National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP) initiated the Lung Cancer Screening Clinical Demonstration Project (LCSCDP). Pulmonary nodules are very commonly detected on chest imaging studies. The VA Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) has utilized a pulmonary nodule registry for several years. In 2013, 1020 of the 3256 Veterans with a chest CT were identified in the registry. Our ability to provide Veteran-centered lung cancer screening and pulmonary nodule care is hindered by several gaps in our understanding of the nodule evaluation process. First, there are limited studies regarding the risk that a nodule will be diagnosed as lung cancer. Increased understanding of patient and radiologic characteristics that are associated with a higher risk of lung cancer will guide shared decision-making. Second, there is currently no mechanism to use administrative data to identify patients with pulmonary nodules because of a lack of a well-accepted diagnostic code. This information gap substantially hinders the ability of researchers, clinicians, and administrators to efficiently evaluate future screening interventions. Plan: For this proposal, we will conduct a comprehensive review of patients from established pulmonary nodule registries at the VAPORHCS and VISN 23 in order to address these knowledge gaps. These registries are linked to other routinely-collected administrative data and are currently clinically used to track patients with nodules. Taking advantage of these registries will allow us to not only answer key questions in the care delivery of patients with pulmonary nodules, but also enable us to build and refine the building blocks that will serve as the foundation for lung cancer screening implementation. Our Aims were directly informed by VA's strategic goals with specific patient and partner questions in mind. Methods: Aim 1: Develop and validate a predictive model of lung cancer risk among a cohort of Veterans with incidentally-detected pulmonary nodules. Rationale: A prognostic model would enable clinicians and patients to improve counseling and access to knowledge by providing personalized, Veteran-centric care outside of specialty settings. Aim 2: Develop and validate an algorithm based on routinely collected clinical data to identify Veterans with a pulmonary nodule diagnosis. Rationale: There is no mechanism to identify patients with pulmonary nodules using routinely collected data. Developing a coding algorithm to identify these patients, using established nodule registries as criterion standards, will enable scientists to perform comparative effectiveness research and give clinicians and administrators access to higher quality data than currently available."

"9235278","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has been reported to be associated with glomerular injury and ultimate end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although hypertension or diabetes mellitus in obesity may contribute to the development of ESRD, the molecular mechanisms of obesity-induced renal injury, in particular, the early mechanisms mediating glomerular injury that occur prior to hypertension and diabetes are still poorly understood. In thi grant proposal, we attempt to elucidate an early intracellular molecular mechanism, namely, the Nalp3 inflammasome activation, which may switch on glomerular injury through its inflammatory or non-inflammatory pathway leading to glomerular dysfunction and ultimately sclerosis during obesity. Interestingly, our preliminary studies demonstrated that obesity-induces the Nalp3 inflammasome activation and contributes to the glomerular injury independent of elevated arterial blood pressure and have also shown that beyond inflammation, the activated inflammasomes have direct actions on the podocytes. This may represent a novel pathogenic mechanism of inflammasome activation beyond inflammation. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that obesity increases visfatin production and thereby activates Nalp3 inflammasomes in podocytes to produce IL-1ß stimulating inflammatory response in glomeruli and initiating direct podocyte damage, ultimately resulting in glomerular injury and sclerosis. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine whether obesity-induced Nalp3 inflammasome formation and activation contribute to glomerular injury in vivo prior to hypertension in experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity using Asc-/- mice with or without rescuing Asc gene and wild type mice with and without locally silencing Asc gene. We will then examine how Nalp3 inflammasomes are activated in podocytes with a focus on the role of adipokine visfatin in cultured podocytes and in vivo in mice and to elucidate its functional significance in inflammasome activation. Finally, we will explore the mechanisms by which activated Nalp3 inflammasomes lead to podocyte injury and glomerular dysfunction or sclerosis by studying the actions of inflammasome products such as IL-1ß, IL-18, pyroptosis and DAMPs in cultured podocytes and in mice with obesity induced by HFD. The findings from the proposed studies will provide new mechanistic insights for targeting inflammasomes to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treatment and prevention of ESRD in obese patients."
"9256485","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hereditary congenital defects that impair lysosomal degradation often affect the nervous system before other organs, suggesting an increased or specialized neuronal demand for lysosomal function. The objective of our work is to understand and manipulate lysosomal degradation in order to improve neuronal function by utilizing a Drosophila model for Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B (CMT 2B) disease. CMT 2B is an autosomal dominant sensory neuropathy caused by mutations in the late endosomal GTPase rab7. In a systematic characterization of all rab GTPases, we discovered that rab7 is expressed in neurons at elevated levels prior to other cell types. We have generated the first null mutants in rab7 in Drosophila; to our knowledge rab7 knock-outs in mouse or zebrafish have not been characterized. Loss of rab7 in Drosophila causes late developmental defects in neurons and postnatal progressive degeneration of sensory nerve terminals that can be rescued by neuron-specific rab7 cDNA expression. In further similarity to the human disease, rab7 mutant nerve terminals are characterized by endolysosomal degradation and protein accumulation defects. Overexpression of classical dominant negative (GDP-bound) or constitutively active (GTP-bound) Rab7 does not mimic the null mutant and disease phenotypes in vivo. Nonetheless, human CMT 2B mutations have been proposed to represent dominant gain-of-function alleles. In contrast, based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the human disease mutations are partial loss-of-function alleles that may cause a dominant phenotype through haploinsufficiency in heterozygous patients. We will genetically and mechanistically test this hypothesis in Drosophila. We will further elucidate the precise degradation defects associated with loss of rab7 in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types by analyzing the null mutant and known human disease mutations in Drosophila. We will thereby establish the first animal model for CMT 2B disease. In addition, we will utilize this model as a genetic inroad to study the cell biological mechanisms underlying the increased neuronal sensitivity to endolysosomal defects. Finally, we seek to establish methods to manipulate the degradative capacity of neurons affected by endolysosomal dysfunction."

"9304192","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders (1:400-1000) and an important cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD). In the US in 2012, ~30,000 patients had PKD associated ESRD; 1/3500 individuals aged 65-69y. The disease is generally late in onset, but considerable variability exists, from in utero onset and perinatal death, early onset (EO) disease, to adequate renal function into old age. Extrarenal manifestations, particularly a higher incidence of intracranial aneurysms (ICA) and severe polycystic liver disease (sPLD) are associated with morbidity and mortality. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the extent to which genetic factors at the two known genes, PKD1 (16p13.3) and PKD2 (4q21) and elsewhere in the genome, determine the severity of renal disease and the occurrence of clinically significant extrarenal complications. These studies are based upon our findings, and those of others that genic, allelic and genetic background effects significantly influence the phenotype. Next generation sequencing (NGS) will be employed for mutation screening of the ADPKD genes, including the duplicated PKD1, necessitating enrichment by locus specific long-range PCR (LR-PCR). Mutations and variants elsewhere in the genome will be identified employing custom-made panels of candidate genes (HaloPlex methodology) and whole exome sequencing (WES). Aim 1 will screen the ADPKD genes to identify atypical mutations in the 7-10% of patients that are presently unresolved, and assess the role of allelic combinations as pathogenic events, especially causing EO disease. Aim 2 will analyze a large, typical ADPKD population and ones with the vascular and sPLD phenotype to determine the full role that ADPKD genic and allelic effects play in accounting for phenotypic variability. Aim 3 will screen loci beyond the ADPKD genes, including the whole exome, for novel causative genes resulting in an ADPKD-like phenotype. Aim 4 will analyze the whole exome for modifying factors that cause EO disease and clinically significant vascular and hepatic complications. The final aim will test the significance of putative pathogenic ADPKD alleles in vivo, analyzing the mechanisms of pathogenesis and optimizing mouse models for preclinical testing. Overall these studies will better explain the genetic causes of ADPKD, provide insights into the pathogenesis, possibly revealing novel therapeutic targets, optimize models for preclinical testing, be of diagnostic and prognostic value, and identify populations suitable for clinical trials and that will gain most fro disease-specific therapeutics which will be available soon."
"9509894","Abstract  The proposed study will examine the therapeutic effects of intranasally-administered insulin in adults with  amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or mild Alzheimer¿s disease (AD). The study rationale is derived  from evidence that insulin carries out multiple functions in the brain, and that insulin dysregulation contributes  to AD pathogenesis. For example, insulin protects against the synaptotoxic effects of &#946;-amyloid and facilitates  memory, as well as influencing tau phosphorylation. Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) insulin and reduced brain  insulin signaling have been described in persons with AD, suggesting that therapies aimed at correcting these  deficiencies may be beneficial. One such strategy is normalizing brain insulin levels through intranasal insulin  administration (INI). Intranasally-administered insulin travels via bulk flow through extracellular pathways to the  brain, bypassing the periphery and leaving peripheral glucose levels unchanged. In a pilot study, INI safely  improved delayed memory in persons with AD and aMCI and prevented progressive hypometabolism in the  cuneus region as demonstrated with positron emission tomography. Based on these promising results we  propose a Phase IIB multi-site, randomized, double-blind trial comparing the effects of INI (20 IU bid) and  placebo for 12 months, followed by a 6 month open label period in which all participants will receive active  treatment. Intranasal insulin will be administered with the use of an innovative electronic atomizer designed to  maximize nose-to-brain transport. Two-hundred and forty participants with aMCI (Petersen criteria, Clinical  Dementia Rating/CDR 0.5) or mild AD (NINDS-ADRDA criteria, CDR 0.5-1.0, Mini-mental State Exam&#61619;20) will  be enrolled. The primary outcome measure will consist of the AD Assessment Scale for Cognition, 12-item  version. Secondary measures will include a memory composite, CDR Sum of Boxes, and Functional Activities  Questionnaire. Cognitive/functional assessment will occur at 6 month intervals. Hippocampal and entorhinal  cortex volume will be measured at baseline and 12 months with magnetic resonance imaging. CSF biomarkers  will also be measured then for a subset of participants. For the intent-to-treat efficacy analyses for the primary  (ADAS-Cog12) and secondary (memory composite, CDR SB, FAQ) measures, longitudinal scores will be  analyzed using random effects models to assess the differences in the rate of change across treatment  groups. The 6-month open label period will provide exploratory longer-term safety data and efficacy data, as  well as serving as a significant recruitment and retention incentive.The trial will be conducted in collaboration  with the AD Cooperative Study Consortium (Paul Aisen, MD, Director) and thus benefit from its wellestablished  infrastructure and expertise. We will use the ADCS¿s comprehensive coordination services as well  as its member sites which have extensive AD clinical trial experience. Our results will provide a strong rationale  and useful data for the design of a future Phase III trial and generate critical evidence for the efficacy, safety,  and mechanistic underpinnings of this novel therapeutic approach."
"9282796","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The metabolic and cardiovascular sequelae of obesity constitute a major financial and public health burden. Increased cardiovascular risk in obesity is directly related to metabolic dysregulation, key features of which include abnormalities in energy homeostasis and insulin resistance. The effectiveness of weight loss efforts to reduce cardiometabolic risk in obesity is limited due to high weight gain recidivism. Therefore, interventions that directly target metabolic fitness in obesity represent an important area of investigation. Evidence in experimental models and our preliminary data in humans suggest that the cyclic guanylate monophosphate pathway (cGMP) is a critical mediator of insulin resistance and energy homeostasis. Increased cGMP signaling raises resting energy expenditure and provides resistance to obesity and diabetes. Cyclic GMP also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as tadalafil prevent the degradation of cGMP. These medications are well-tolerated and improve glucose metabolism, but have not been comprehensively tested as a target for obesity-related cardiometabolic dysfunction in humans. We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled study to examine the cardiometabolic effects of PDE5 inhibition in obese prediabetic individuals. Participants will receive tadalafil 20 mg per day or placebo for 12 weeks. Aim 1 will examine the effect of chronic PDE5 inhibition on resting and exercise energy expenditure using a metabolic chamber. In Aim 2, we will test the effect of PDE5 inhibition on insulin sensitivity and secretion. We will also assess body composition, quality of life, and sexua function. A Secondary Aim will examine the effect of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP sensitivity and circulating mediators of diabetes risk. The proposed study will be the first large comprehensive evaluation of PDE5 inhibition in a population at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Our endpoints were selected to provide highly relevant clinical outcomes and mechanistic insight into the cardiometabolic effects of cGMP action. Therapy that improves metabolic fitness independent of weight loss would represent an important advance in the effort to reduce cardiovascular risk in obesity."
"9201694","ABSTRACT Tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the leading cause of mortality due to infections today with more than 2 million deaths worldwide. BCG vaccine derived from Mycobacterium bovis is the only approved human vaccine although, it has a partial efficacy against childhood and adult tuberculosis. Since BCG lacks certain genes of wild type M. tuberculosis many recombinant BCG vaccine strains have been prepared and evaluated in animal models. Based on the observation that human neonates respond better to vaccine antigens when stimulated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) adjuvants, we constructed a novel recombinant BCG vaccine that expresses a peptide stimulating TLR-2 (TLR-BCG). This vaccine protected mice better than wild type BCG vaccine. We also developed a novel neonatal monkey model to evaluate vaccine effects against tuberculosis. This project will verify the hypothesis that, TLR-BCG vaccine will be more efficient than wild type BCG vaccine in generating stronger and longer lasting immune responses against tuberculosis in NHPs. Specific Aim-1A: We will evaluate TH1 immune responses induced by wild type BCG and recombinant TLR-BCG in the neonatal monkey model. We will determine if TLR-BCG induces qualitatively different primary T cell immune responses in NHPs compared with a natural infection with M. tuberculosis and correlate vaccine-induced protection against aerosol induced tuberculosis in NHPs. Specific Aim -2: We will evaluate long-term efficacy of TLR-BCG vaccines using a prime boost strategy with the neonatal monkey model. These studies are likely to lead to generate a better primary vaccine against tuberculosis, and a more efficient better booster vaccine for children already vaccinated with wt-BCG.   "
"9278079","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         With a prevalence of 30-50% and clear association with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD), Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is emerging as a major public health problem. MetS is characterized by elevated markers of inflammation, hypertriglyceridemia, and low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL). This proposal aims to understand how HDL metabolism and function are altered in MetS. In MetS, increases in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) in combination with increased activity of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) leads to TG enrichment of HDL. Although there is evidence that TG enrichment per se may destabilize the particle to promote release of apoA-I, it is likely that HDL remodeling factors in the circulation act on TG-enriched HDL to amplify apoA-I release and catabolism. Based on our preliminary data, we propose that circulating phospholipases (endothelial lipase, Group IIA secretory phospholipase A2) contribute significantly to HDL remodeling in MetS by liberating lipid-poor apoA-I from TG-enriched HDL. Once released from remodeled HDL, lipid-poor apoA-I has three potential fates: it may serve as an acceptor for cellular cholesterol efflux, associate with circulating HDL, or be cleared from the circulation due to a failure to undergo re-lipidation. Emerging evidence indicates that not all lipid-poor apoA-I species are capable of acquiring additional lipid and are thus susceptible to rapid catabolism. We propose that HDL lowering in MetS is due not only to enhanced HDL remodeling to amplify the release of lipid-poor apoA-I, but is also due to the increased production of dysfunctional lipid-poor species that are inherently susceptible to catabolism. The HDL receptor SR-BI plays a key role in HDL metabolism by mediating the selective uptake of CE from the core of HDL particles into cells. We have shown that SR-BI processing of HDL from healthy subjects generates at least 3 distinct lipid-depleted HDL remnants that differ in composition and subsequent metabolism. We propose that as SR-BI depletes the core of TG-enriched MetS HDL, the propensity of such particles to remodel leads to enhanced released of lipid-poor apoA-I. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TG enrichment of HDL in MetS predisposes the particle to remodeling by intravascular factors and alters its processing by SR-BI, leading to the generation of lipid-poor species that are susceptible to catabolism. Specific Objective 1: Test the hypothesis that enhanced remodeling of HDL in hypertriglyceridemic MetS subjects leads to generation of lipid-poor apoA-I. The goal is to identify specific features of MetS HDL and/or MetS plasma that predict susceptibility to remodeling. We will also determine whether fibrate-induced TG lowering in MetS subjects leads to altered HDL remodeling. Specific Objective 2: Test the hypothesis that enhanced remodeling of TG-enriched HDL leads to alterations in subsequent HDL metabolism. Specific Objective 3: Test the hypothesis that TG enrichment alters SR-BI metabolism of HDL. Results from this project will provide new insights into mechanisms underlying reduced HDL in MetS, a prevalent condition in the Veteran population that significantly increases the risk of developing CVD. Findings from this project have the potential to define novel biological correlates of accelerated apoA-I catabolism in MetS and to identify MetS subjects most likely to benefit from TG lowering/HDL raising interventions."

"9272399","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal grant is a request to support further analysis of age-related changes in membranes of human eye lens fiber-cells in order to elucidate major differences occurring in transparent and cataractous lenses. This proposal seeks to improve the methodology of membrane studies to the single lens level, which will allow us to consider donor health history information provided by the Eye Bank. The long-range goal is to understand the role of eye lens membranes in maintaining lens transparency. The lens membranes have unique lipid compositions and structures thought to maintain low oxygen concentration in the lens interior, and thus, protect against cataract formation. Our research will provide a basis to develop alternative strategies to prevent the onset or slow the progression of lens opacification. The emphasis will be on the role of the lipid bilayer portion of fiber-cell membranes in maintaining fiber-cell and lens homeostasis. Important progress in the previous grant period includes the identification of the role of cholesterol and the crucial role of cholesterol bilayer domains (CBDs) in particular. The presence of the CBD ensures that the surrounding phospholipid bilayer is saturated with cholesterol. The saturating cholesterol content in fiber-cell membranes keeps the bulk physical properties of lens-lipid membranes consistent and independent of changes in phospholipid composition. Thus, the CBD helps to maintain lens-membrane homeostasis while the membrane phospholipid composition changes significantly with age. We will (i) continue to adapt, refine, and improve our recently developed methods for the quantification of lipid domains in intact fiber-cell membranes to membranes derived from a single lens, and (ii) based on single lens measurements, examine changes in fiber-cell membranes occurring with age and cataract formation. Special attention will be paid to determine major differences in the organization of lipids in lens membranes of people with cataracts and age-matched clear lenses, as well as to the structure of lens membranes of people who retain clear lenses into their eighth and ninth decades. Finally (iii), we will test the hypothesis that an increase in oxygen tension in the lens (one of the causes of cataract formation) initiates lipid peroxidation and drastically changes the organization of lipids in fiber cell membranes, including the formation of CBDs and cholesterol crystals. Our studies will be based on the use of state-of-the-art EPR techniques and methods available and developed at the National Biomedical EPR Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin. EPR spin-labeling methods permit identification of membrane domains, give information about structure and molecular dynamics as a function of the membrane depth in coexisting domains, and allow quantification of lipids in these domains. They also are capable of measuring oxygen transport within and across membrane domains."
"9313017","The overall goal of the Southwest Hub for American Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Research (Southwest Hub) is to establish a collaborative network of tribal leaders, investigators, interventionists, service providers and service users in the Southwest region that will be managed by trusted scientific partner--Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health (CAIH)--to pool intellectual resources, cultural assets and experience to overcome American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) youth suicide disparity. Primary goals are to: 1) develop and test preventive strategies that can sustainably reduce the burden of youth suicide and promote resilience in Native communities; 2) conduct outreach and dissemination to promote additional tribal community engagement in research activities; and, 3) enable tribal leaders, providers and policy makers to used science-based information to formulate mental health policies and programs to reduce suicide. Specific aims are: Aim 1) Develop an Administrative Core to support communication, coordination of activities and capacity building to facilitate, produce and share evidence to prevent youth suicide and promote resilience, and apply relevant findings in Hub partners? settings (White Mountain Apache, Navajo, San Carlos Apache, Hualapai and Cherokee Nations), and in additional interested tribal communities through collaboration with other regional Hubs and national allies. Aim 2) Undertake a rigorous Suicide Prevention Study to test a sequence of novel preventive strategies that can be used by tribes to sustainably reduce the burden of AI youth suicide and promote resilience. A key priority will be to demonstrate the effectiveness of task-shifting intervention administration to culturally embedded paraprofessional community mental health workers (CMHWs). In the White Mountain Apache setting, the primary research site for this Hub, we will build on a line of youth suicide prevention research that the Tribe and CAIH have undertaken since 1994. It includes a robust tribally-mandated suicide surveillance and follow-up system run by Apache CMHWs that is in early stages of replication by Navajo Nation, the secondary research site for this Hub. The tribal-specific surveillance systems will aid the research teams in monitoring trends and patterns in self-harm prior to, during and after the grant period; offer a unique means to recruit community-based samples of suicidal Native youth; and provide a platform for testing strategies to prevent youth suicide and promote resilience. For collaborators in the three satellite sites (San Carlos Apache, Hualapai, and Cherokee Nations), the development of parallel surveillance systems, research skills and prevention interventions will be determined based on local policy and service priorities. Aim 3) Conduct outreach and disseminate science-based information for tribal leaders and allied partners, including other Hubs, to formulate mental health policies and programs to reduce youth suicide across diverse tribal settings. The Southwest Hub builds on a 30+-year track record of public health research between Johns Hopkins CAIH, the White Mountain Apache Tribe and Navajo Nation. These partners are poised to extend trusted research relationships to new tribal partners, produce novel evidence, exercise tribal sovereignty to improve public health, and tap extensive national networks to share methods to reduce youth suicide disparity and promote new understanding of youth resilience."
"9208072","Project Summary Proteomics is dependent on the collection of tandem mass spectra of peptides and proteins to make identifications in database searches. Large-scale proteome analyses have become more comprehensive as instrument scan speeds have increased and ion dissociation methods have improved. Additionally, protein quantitation benefits from the creation of internal standards and data collection methods to acquire sufficient data for accurate quantification. The YRC invented small window data independent acquisition (DIA) for proteomics more than a decade ago and we have innovated and improved these methods. To improve the comprehensiveness and reproducibility of peptide identification and quantitation, DIA methods will be advanced for bottom-up proteomics. Reagents will be developed for general enrichment of peptides for targeted quantitation of peptides. To determine proteoforms of proteins in complexes, strategies employing capillary electrophoresis to separate intact proteins for top down analysis using new DIA data collection strategies coupled to emerging ion dissociation methods for intact proteins will be developed. To advance multiplexed quantitation of peptides in bottom up proteomics and to multiplex ?molecular painting? new reagents will be developed."
"9297326","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammation is a multifaceted process required to heal injuries and fight infections. However, chronic inflammation underlies various debilitating diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and heart disease. Glucocorticoids (GCs), which activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), are the most powerful anti- inflammatory drugs available and are unsurpassed in their ability to counter both acute and chronic inflammation. Despite their efficacy, continued GC use causes debilitating side effects including weight gain, diabetes, and Cushing's disease. In fact, rheumatoid arthritis patients are generally pulled off GC treatment after 3-6 months to avoid side effect development, despite GCs ability to slow disease progression dramatically in early stages. These side effects are the result of stimulating the transcriptional activity of GR, which controls the expression of both metabolic and inflammatory genes via distinct mechanisms. To activate transcription, GR directly binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) to drive the transcription of metabolic and stress response genes. Conversely, GRs ability to repress genes is less well understood. Current theories include DNA-dependent and DNA-independent mechanisms. The first mechanism involves direct binding of GR to the newly discovered negative glucocorticoid response elements (nGREs). The DNA-independent mechanism involves GRs interaction with another well-characterized transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1), which up-regulates the expression of inflammatory genes. To repress AP-1 activity, GR is proposed to bind to AP-1 through protein-protein interactions only and not through a direct DNA interaction. This mechanism, known as tethering, is the prevailing model for GR-mediated repression at inflammatory genes. However, recent discoveries regarding DNA-dependent GR-mediated transrepression reveal that the mutations used to develop the tethering hypothesis are inadequate. We show that these mutations prevent GR binding to nGREs and do not formally rule out direct DNA interaction as a major mechanism behind GR's ability to counter AP-1 signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that GR-mediated repression of inflammatory genes occurs through an alternative mechanism involving direct DNA binding similar to nGREs. In Specific Aim 1, we will test for direct DNA interaction by GR at AP-1 binding sites within inflammatory gene promoters using a combination of biochemical techniques to determine the sequence specificity and the structural specificity of this interaction. In Specific Aim 2, we will test our proposed mechanism by which GR can repress inflammatory genes independent of AP-1 tethered interactions in cells. Resolving the mechanistic basis for direct GR-meditated transrepression at AP-1 sites will be critical to improve our understanding of GR's role in inflammatory diseases and could lay the foundation for new therapeutic development. Ideally, the best anti- inflammatory therapy would separate the metabolic effects, attributed to the side effects of GC use, from the desired anti-inflammatory effects. Our long-term goal is to determine if this type of glucocorticoid is possible."
"9294059","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application from the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania to serve as the Scientific and Data Coordinating Center  (SDCC) for the Continuation of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.  Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) affects over 20 million Americans with particular burden among older adults.  The morbidity associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) derives from frequent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a disproportionate risk of cardiovascular events, and other morbidities associated with disability and high costs of care.  A set of etiological factors is being identified as potentially responsible for both progressive renal disease and morbidities in the setting of CKD, especially those operating early in the course of CKD when progression may be forestalled.  These factors include clinical, behavioral, and those associated with biomarkers.  Characterizing relationships between these risk factors and outcomes will permit development of instruments to predict poor outcomes in patients with CRI and enhance understanding of the etiological mechanisms leading to these outcomes.  Improved prediction will allow identification of high-risk subgroups with CRI, thus guiding enrollment into preventive treatment trials and application of preventive therapies.   The proposed third phase of CRIC will combine the study of these current CRIC participants along with 1,500 additional study participants to address overarching goals of understanding the relationship between kidney disease and the risks of cardiovascular and other types of morbidity.  In particular, during Phase III, CRIC's SDCC will continue to provide scientific, data analytical, and logistical support to the CRIC Research Network as it continues to address a diverse set of high-impact areas of investigation with expanded emphasis on CKD in older adults, patients with moderate levels of CKD, and the burden of morbidity in patients with CKD. The CRIC Study cohort is an unparalleled resource that will also expand our ability to conduct science related to CKD through additional collaborations throughout the renal research community and interactions with other epidemiologic studies worldwide."
"9281753","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which intercellular adhesion complexes form and remodel in response to mechanical load. Recent evidence demonstrates that mechanically initiated signaling at cell-cell junctions is a fundamental aspect of cell and developmental biology. Aberrant assembly and remodeling of intercellular junctions has likewise emerged as a defining feature of diseases including metastatic cancers, cardiomyopathies, and skin barrier defects. However, at present very little is known about how the complex protein assemblies present at cell-cell contacts convert molecule-scale forces into biochemical signals, or how mechanical cues govern the complex junctional dynamics that typify multicellular tissues.  Previous work from our collaboration showed that a complex of E-cadherin, ?-catenin, and ?E-catenin forms a minimal force-sensing unit at adherens junctions (AJs). Separate work suggests that ?E-catenin additionally plays a central role in organizing epithelial tissues based on its interactions with vinculin, Epithelial Protein Lost in Neoplasm (EPLIN), Zonula Occludens (ZO)-1, and afadin, all of which bind actin and recruit other scaffolding and signaling proteins. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that force-sensitive, cooperative actin binding by ?E-catenin and vinculin leads to dramatic increases in actin affinity over a very small range in force. This idea, if correct, would explain how a four-protein system amplifies small changes in force into dramatic alterations in adhesion stability and downstream signal transduction. Further, we will perform the first detailed biochemical and biophysical characterization of the interaction of the cadherin-catenin complex with EPLIN, ZO-1, and afadin. These studies lay the foundation for a quantitative understanding for how the AJ functions as an integrated, multifunctional force-sensing assembly.  In Aim 2 we will examine force sensitivity in desmosomes. These junctions link desmosomal cadherins to the intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeleton, and are essential for tissue integrity. However, while cel biological data suggest a role of desmosomes in transmitting force between cells, there is currently no direct evidence for when, where, and even whether desmosomal cadherins transmit tension between neighboring cells in the absence of externally applied force. To address this gap, we will use genetically encoded molecular tension sensors to determine when and where desmosomal cadherins transduce force between neighboring cells. We will then critically evaluate the role of desmoplakin in transmitting force at desmosomes, analogous to the role established for ?E-catenin at AJs. Finally, we will use a single-molecule magnetic tweezers assay to test the innovative hypothesis that recruitment of plakoglobin, plakophilin, or both to desmoplakin is inherently force sensitive. These experiments will dramatically enhance our basic understanding of how desmosomes function as a mechanical linkage between cells."
"9305795","Project Summary / Abstract Clinical reference values are typically derived from Caucasians, with limited sample sizes and simplistic statistics. As a result, applying these reference values to racial/ethnic minorities often causes misdiagnosis. Our long-term goal is to develop innovative methodologies to produce and validate precision reference values. The reference values of bone mineral density (BMD) are proving increasingly inaccurate since a substantial number of patients who sustain fragility fractures have what the standard T-score method defines as a normal BMD value. The T-score method was originally proposed only for postmenopausal Caucasian women, and as a result there is no empirical method designed specifically to define BMD reference values for racial/ethnic minorities. Therefore, with life expectancy increasing, osteoporotic fractures in minorities including African- American women are becoming a major public health issue. The objective of this application is to develop a novel method to determine precision BMD reference values for African-American women, a group whose osteoporotic fractures have previously been under-recognized and undertreated. On the basis of preliminary data produced by the applicant, the central hypothesis is that for African-American women a new method based on ?the best statistical model? of normal BMD will be a significantly better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than the T-Score method. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) identifying the best statistical model of normal BMD; 2) determining the model-based precision threshold of BMD; and 3) validating the precision reference values for African-American women. For Aim 1, this project will leverage multiple existing NHANES databases to develop a highly accurate statistical model of normal BMD for African- American women. For Aim 2, a precision threshold that matches an individual's characteristics will be determined by utilizing the best BMD model and cohort data containing fracture outcome. Under Aim 3, Study of Osteoporosis Fracture data will be utilized to validate the model-based method by comparing its predictive accuracy for osteoporotic fracture with traditional methods. This innovative approach will replace the traditional ?one-size-fits-all? clinical reference value, fundamentally shifting current research and clinical practice paradigms from one static cutoff point for everyone to precision thresholds fitting individual characteristics. The new approach will overcome the limitations of the T-score method, thus increasing the prediction accuracy of the WHO's Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, and the accuracy of osteoporosis diagnoses in general. The approach developed herein can be extended to the development of many other types of precision reference values. In addition, this project will engage students in the research of precision medicine through the use of ?big data,? thus providing them with hands-on research experience and stimulating their research interest in health disparities."
"9346634","Today, for lack of appropriate technology there is scant information on how multiple brain areas coordinate their collective neural circuit dynamics. Hence, the recent NIH BRAIN Initiative report calls for new techniques that can provide ?multi-area population recording at cellular resolution?. To address this challenge, we built a large-scale two-photon fluorescence microscope with 16 laser beams that together scan a 4 mm2 area of brain tissue in an awake behaving rodent. This new instrument is the world's largest two-photon microscope and enables Ca2+ imaging studies of the simultaneous dynamics of thousands of individual neurons lying across ~3?7 cortical brain areas.  The goal of this High Impact Neuroscience Research Resource Grant is to make this groundbreaking new instrumentation a user-friendly and openly accessible resource for neuroscience researchers around the nation. To achieve this, we will first implement key upgrades to the large-scale microscope that will: improve the usability of the software interface; enable multi-color imaging, including simultaneous dual-color imaging for concurrent Ca2+ imaging of two distinct cell populations; and speed the laser-scanning system to 20 Hz imaging frame rates, to meet the needs of users whose research questions about large-scale neural Ca2+ dynamics require this temporal resolution. We will establish core infrastructure, including a data center dedicated to the computational analysis and bioinformatics needs of the Resource users, and a stock of the transgenic reporter mice and viral vectors that neuroscientists most commonly use to express genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators. We will also hire a full-time staff scientist, who will conduct regular tutorial workshops and directly support individual users regarding training and usage of the instrumentation, adaptation of users' animal behavioral assays for compatibility with large-scale two-photon brain imaging, and data analysis.  We plan a staged rollout of service, starting with 5 carefully chosen Phase 1 labs to serve as beta- testers, followed by a larger set of 16 Phase 2 labs, soon followed by opening the R24 Resource to all neuroscience research applicants. To oversee and benchmark progress against quantitative milestones, we have established a Steering Committee of senior scientists, from within and outside our home university, who have complementary areas of expertise ? including in the management of research imaging facilities and public databases of brain imaging data that are broadly shared across the scientific community. The Steering Committee will monitor Resource usage, evaluate user feedback, provide guidance toward superior usability, performance and data sharing, and track the research progress of each neuroscience lab that is using the R24 Resource toward publication of the biological results. The Resource personnel and Steering Committee will also coordinate with the Stanford Neuroscience Institute to provide broad, equitable, well-advertised, and flexible access to the Resource across the local and national NINDS and neuroscience research communities."
"9314675","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this proposal is to provide a pathway to independence as a clinical-translational investigator in the nutrition of premature and critically ill infants. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is one of the most common therapies provided in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, the safety of TPN is significantly limited by the risk for parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD). Plant sterols in the soy-based lipid component of TPN are believed to be a contributing factor to liver injury. My prior studies showed that plant sterols are markedly elevated in infants with PNALD and that age impacts sterol metabolism and expression of important hepatic sterol-regulating genes. Two critical gaps in knowledge exist in our understanding of PNALD: 1) the ability of infants to manage exogenous plant sterols during prolonged soy lipid exposure and 2) the mechanism that underlies the vulnerability of neonates to PNALD. My overarching career goal is to close the knowledge gap by becoming an expert in sterol metabolism and PNALD in order to develop and apply novel interventions to improve the safety of TPN in infants. My career development plan logically extends my prior training in neonatology and clinical research. I will attain knowledge and training in translational research, sterol-regulating pathways, iPSC-derived hepatocytes, and liver development. Experienced mentors and a scientific advisory committee at the Medical College of Wisconsin, University of Cincinnati, and the NIH with expertise in multi-center translational research, sterol metabolism, stem cell technologies, and liver development will guide me. I hypothesize that plant sterol concentrations associated with increased risk for PNALD are influenced by gestational age and failure to express key sterol-regulating genes. I will test this hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to determine the kinetics of serial plant sterol accumulation and their association with cholestasis in infants receiving prolonged soy lipids. This will be done using a prospective, multicenter clinical study to measure serial plant sterol and cholesterol levels in the blood of infants during soy lipid therapy of at least 2 weeks. Aim 2 seeks to identify gene expression and lipid accumulation in patient-derived hepatocytes exposed to plant sterols at different developmental stages. This will be assessed using immature and mature hepatocytes derived from the iPSC of matched study participants with and without PNALD. Results and expertise acquired during this award will position me to establish an independent, clinical-translational research program to ultimately improve the safety of nutrition in critically ill neonates."
"9205458","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Although there are effective psychotherapies for combat-related PTSD, symptoms persist for some veterans even after treatment. Identifying biological alterations associated with treatment response is essential to treatment development and can be accomplished through longitudinal evaluation. Longitudinal assessments permit a distinction between recovery, persistence, and resistance to the development of PTSD. This proposal aims to identify molecular and endocrine diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers associated with PTSD and recovery by comparing biological markers in 60 OIF/OEF/OND veterans with PTSD before and after treatment with cognitive processing therapy (CPT-C). The direct manipulation of PTSD symptoms over the course of 12 weeks of psychotherapy will result in a sample with a variable range of symptom improvement. At treatment end, the PTSD group will be subdivided into those no longer meeting DSM-V criteria for PTSD and those who still have PTSD. 30 veterans exposed to similar levels of combat, but who never developed PTSD will also be studied at two times, 12 weeks apart. It will therefore be possible to determine 1) whether, and in what way combat veterans who recover following psychotherapy differ biologically from those who fail to recover, and 2) whether, and in what manner those who recover are similar to those who never developed PTSD, at pre and/or post-treatment. We propose to measure specific candidate biomarkers, but also use genome-wide methods to screen for a broader array of relevant genes and biological pathways. The candidate biomarkers associate with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) responsiveness. Previous work has implicated GR functioning and cortisol signaling in association with PTSD risk, diagnosis and symptom severity. Genotype, methylation status and gene expression of two genes, NR3C1 (the GR gene) and FK506 Binding Protein 5 (FKBP5; a critical modulator of GR activity) will be measured, as well as more downstream functional indices of GR responsivity as reflected by the in vitro lymphocyte lysozyme test, basal urinary cortisol levels and plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY). Simultaneously, we will screen for other relevant CpG Islands and genes using, respectively, the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip Kit and the Psych Chip. The approach of examining genotype, cytosine methylation (epigenetics), gene expression and GR functional endocrine outcomes provides a comprehensive assessment of critical regulators at multiple levels, so as to promote a detailed understanding of mechanisms of psychopathology and recovery, and will permit hypotheses to be generated regarding molecular antecedents of PTSD associated biology. Cytosine methylation of the promoter regions of the GR and FKBP5 genes are thought to reflect relatively enduring processes that can also be influenced by environmental factors that result in functional (e.g., endocrine) alterations. The endocrine measures representing downstream effects of GR have been previously demonstrated to change in association with symptom change. Comparison with a group of similarly exposed veterans who did not develop PTSD allows an examination of normative temporal stability of the biological measures, which has not been established in the field for molecular markers. An objective biological test predicting or correlating with recovery would have great clinical utility and would also yield important insights  into PTSD pathophysiology. The association of variation in PTSD symptom severity with changes in epigenetic and gene expression measures relevant to PTSD is novel, and will facilitate the examination of biological and psychological variables associated with prognosis, diagnosis, and recovery, in the context of symptom change over time. This proposal represents a critical step the determination of whether the GR or its molecular scaffolding represent targets for PTSD prevention and treatment, and will further inform a model of PTSD etiology and chronicity in combat exposed veterans."
"9401992","PROJECT SUMMARY Morbidity and mortality of preterm and newborn infants remain significant public health concerns. Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) are a leading cause of bacterial infection associated preterm births, stillbirths and early onset sepsis. We recently showed that increased expression of the hyaluronidase can be associated with GBS invasive disease and induces fetal demise in pregnant mice. The objective of this proposal is to understand how the GBS hyaluronidase subverts the function of multiple host innate immune cells to induce fetal injury and systemic infection. Aim 1 will define mechanisms by which the GBS hyaluronidase subverts immune cell function and immune cell recruitment. Aim 2 will establish how expression of the GBS hyaluronidase promotes microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and fetal injury in the pregnant nonhuman primate model that closely emulates human pregnancy. These studies will provide novel insight into mechanisms of immune evasion during GBS infections. These results are essential and invaluable for development of novel therapeutic approaches to reduce the risk of GBS infection associated fetal injury, stillbirth, preterm births and neonatal infections."
"9331605","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the Weill Cornell Medical College and Mount Sinai is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (7/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1100 9- 10 year olds enriched for high-risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 1 hubs across the ABCD-USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the gateway interactions between use of different substances. This NYC site Research Project focuses on risk for and outcomes of substance use on adolescent brain and behavioral development. Our theoretically and empirically grounded aims build on the collective expertise at Weill Cornell, Mt. Sinai, Columbia University and Cornell Tech in adolescent brain development, addiction brain circuitry, and mobile technology for assessing substance use and health. The three aims are: 1) to examine how mismatches in development of prefrontal and subcortical regions relate to initiation and frequency of substance use based on the Imbalance Model of Adolescence; 2) to examine how substance abuse impacts prefrontal and subcortical development implicated in inhibitory control and motivational processes based on the Impaired Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA) Model of Addiction; and 3) to examine how genetic variation in endocannabinoid signaling impacts initiation and frequency of substance use and underlying circuit development in humans, based on a knock-in mouse model that shows vertical integration from gene to circuit to behavior, filling a translational gap from mouse to human of potential therapeutic relevance for prevention and treatment of substance use disorders."
"9307984","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, significant advances in understanding the molecular basis of bleeding disorders have been made, but a large portion of the variability in bleeding severity remains unexplained. In this project, the focus is on hemophilia and von Willebrand disease (VWD), where the observed variability in bleeding patterns cannot be assigned to a single measurable parameter. Clot formation is a complex, non-linear process seriously impaired in persons with these disorders. Because it involves the large biochemical pathway of coagulation coupled to platelet function and biophysical mechanisms including blood flow, it is well suited for study with a systems biology approach. The long-term goal of this research is to develop complementary computational and in vitro models that predict an individual's bleeding potential based on variables measured from their blood. The objective in this application is to identify biochemical and biophysical modifiers of bleeding in hemophilia and VWD. Potential modifiers include variables such as the composition of blood, platelet attributes, and the physical properties of clots. The central hypothesis is that our computational models that encompass the biochemical pathways of thrombus formation and platelet function coupled to the blood's fluid dynamics can identify the primary modifiers of bleeding patterns in these disorders. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories. The rationale for the proposed research is that the reductionist approach to predicting bleeding based on individual plasma components has failed. There is great detailed knowledge of the biochemical pathways that contribute to bleeding, but it is still not possible to reliably assign bleeding risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate computational models of bleeding; 2) Identify modifiers of bleeding in hemophilia and VWD by computational sensitivity analyses; and 3) Predict clinical bleeding in a cohort of bleeding disorder patients. Under the first aim, existing models of thrombosis will be modified to simulate the unique biophysical environment of bleeding, defined by the transport of plasma proteins and blood cells into a porous extravascular space. Computational models will be validated against a microfluidic-based bleeding assay. Under the second aim, the computational models will be used to screen the large parameter space of variables known to affect clot formation. Parameters that significantly alter bleeding in the models will be tested experimentally, and, in the third aim, correlated to clinical bleeding patterns. The models will also be used to predict th response to therapy in a cohort of hemophilia patients with inhibitors. The approach is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo, namely a focus on the biophysical mechanisms of bleeding. The proposed research is significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research expected to lead ultimately to improved diagnosis and therapeutic strategies to prevent bleeding across a wide range of pathologies."
"9398529","This purpose of this proposal is to seek support for the 50th Annual Meeting of the Society for Leukocyte Biology (SLB), to be held at The Westin Bayshore, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from October 5-7, 2017. The central theme of the 2017 meeting is ?Leukocyte Memory: Health and Disease?. SLB is the leading scientific society with a focus on facilitating research on leukocytes and their roles in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic diseases. As far as we are aware there are no other meetings or societies that specifically hone in on this important theme of the leukocyte and immunity. The annual meetings sponsored by SLB fill this void.

"9354277","OVERALL ? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Age related diseases causing dementia are an increasing global, social and economic catastrophe that mandates broad and aggressive research. Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects over 5 million people in the US alone. Vascular contributions to dementia and AD are increasingly recognized. However, the role of the cerebrovascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD, and the underlying neurovascular mechanisms remain, to date, largely unknown and under- researched, representing a critical barrier in the field. The overall goals of this program are to advance current knowledge on the vascular contributions to dementia and AD, and establish whether the neurovasculature plays a major role in cognitive decline, and therefore is a key new therapeutic target to treat dementia and AD. This is a program project application with multiple projects, cores, institutions and investigators. It represents an integrated whole far greater than the sum of its parts. Each project and core complements the others so that a synergistic relationship among them is achieved with a common focus on goals of the program, namely to test the neurovascular hypothesis of AD. This hypothesis holds that cerebrovascular dysfunction and disruption in the neurovascular integrity underlies and contributes to the onset and progression of cognitive decline. We have enlisted established clinical and translational research groups that collectively bring significant expertise in all aspects of the research plan and each have contributed productively over many years to the study of dementia and AD. To test the ?neurovascular hypothesis?, the participating investigators will apply cutting-edge molecular and imaging methods. We will perform parallel studies with analogous measures in humans and rats in two AD genetic risk groups with the major genetic risk factors for late-onset AD, i.e., apolipoprotein E-?4 (APOE4) gene and early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), i.e., presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations that both develop early vascular dysfunction and significant cerebrovascular pathology, and in the rat model of AD (line TgF344-AD) that faithfully recapitulates the rich clinico-pathological spectrum of human AD including the presence of early vascular dysfunction and cerebrovascular pathology. Central to our approach is our commitment to take a new research direction with the overarching goal to provide an answer to the broader question; ?what is the role of the vascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD?, and ?what is the prognostic and diagnostic value of neurovascular molecular and imaging biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline?. The relationship between neurovascular integrity, brain connectivity and cognitive function has not been explored. The collective expertise of the investigators, overall environment, preliminary results, and experimental design for each of the projects and supporting cores hold tremendous promise for the success of this program. We are confident that the proposed studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of pathogenesis, treatment, and early prevention of dementia and AD."
"9272854","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI3K-AKT pathway is hyperactivated in many human cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and several drugs to inhibit this pathway are currently tested in various pre-clinical or clinical trials. However, it has been shown that PIK or AKT inhibition results in the relief of feedback regulation and activation of other oncogenic signaling pathways, which likely will limit the clinical utilization of these inhibitors as a singl agent in cancer treatment. In addition, only a fraction of cancer patients will likely respond positively to PI3K or AKT inhibitors, and it is unclear which patients will benefit most. Our long-term goal is to understand the PI3K-AKT signaling in the context of drug response and to translate such discoveries into meaningful clinical applications. The objective of this application is to study the roles of FoxO-Rictor signaling axis we identified in renal cancer treatment by PI3K or AKT inhibition. Our extensive preliminary data support the central hypothesis of our proposal that activation of FoxO mediates PI3K or AKT inhibition-directed reactivation of AKT by upregulating Rictor expression and promoting AKT Ser473 phosphorylation, which eventually will limit the impact of the PI3K or AKT inhibitor in renal cancer treatment. In this proposal, we will employ multi-disciplinary approaches, including detailed biochemical mechanistic studies, sophisticated genetically engineered mouse models, and analysis of renal cancer patient samples, to study FoxO-Rictor signaling axis in renal cancer development and treatment. The rationale for the proposed research is that our proposed studies will advance our understanding of PI3K-AKT inhibition-mediated feedback, and will provide important insight for the development of novel therapeutic strategies or biomarkers targeting PI3K-AKT pathway in renal cancer treatment. Our proposal is highly innovative, because it focuses on a previously unexplored mechanism that fills in the current gap in renal cancer treatment. Our proposed studies will have significant impact on both understanding the fundamental mechanisms of feedback regulation and manipulating FoxO-Rictor pathway clinically in the stratification and treatment of cancer patients."
"9509624","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Training Program, Mechanisms of Hypertension and Cardiovascular Diseases, Suzanne Oparil, MD, PD/PI, offers multidisciplinary postdoctoral training in fundamental aspects of the pathophysiology of hypertension and related cardiovascular disease (CVD), in innovative approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions and in translating basic and clinical research findings to the population level. This Training Program advances the spectrum of available training in the following Thematic Focus Areas: Basic Science (fundamental training in mechanisms of inflammatory vascular injury and repair and oxidative stress/free radical injury; T0); Translational Science (translation-to-humans, early clinical trials, testing basic science discoveries for clinical applicability; T1-T2) Clinica Science (research to improve knowledge of new therapies, medical applications and clinical interventions; T2-T3), and Population Science (clinical trials to wide-spread evidence-based practice that improves the overall public health; T3-T4).  Faculty Mentors offer training in these rapidly evolving research areas: behavioral, epidemiologic and population/prevention research, state-of-the-art clinical trials, comparative effectiveness research, biostatistics/quantitative sciences, genomics, health disparities research, other-Omics, and regenerative and reparative medicine. Trainees will have a 2-3 year experience in laboratory, clinical/translational or population- based research under the mentorship of T32 Program Faculty Mentors. Trainees will spend at least 80% of time in investigation, coursework, and in career development activities. The goal of this Program is to prepare trainees for careers in fundamental, clinical, translational and population-based research in hypertension and CVD. The educational experiences available to our trainees will equip them with the technical skills and theoretical background needed to make them competitive for faculty positions in prestigious academic institutions, in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry or in health care delivery research.  An important goal of this Training Program is to build productive, efficient, and cutting edge interdisciplinary research and training programs. Thus, this Program and its Faculty Mentors partner with the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). The mission of the UAB CCTS is to transform UAB's environment by building interdisciplinary research teams through educational ingenuity, regulatory reorganization, resource coordination, and methodological innovation. The UAB CCTS is one of 62 nationwide CTSA Centers, and the ONLY CTSA Program in Alabama.  Relevance: There is a shortage of basic, translational, clinical and population scientists trained to use cutting edge approaches to problems related to hypertension and CVD, a leading cause of death and disability in the US. This is the only Training Program in Alabama that provides highly integrated bench to bedside postdoctoral training. The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the United States (US) is steadily increasing, in part due to the aging of the US population, increased prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and the metabolic syndrome and the emergence of high-risk populations, i.e., racial/ethnic minorities such as African-Americans and Hispanics, and persons infected with HIV/AIDS. These increasing health needs underscore the importance of training basic scientists, clinical scientists and population scientists in an environment conduciv to multidisciplinary team research in order to test more effective approaches to the prevention and treatment of hypertension and related vascular disease and other comorbidities. This Training Program addresses these goals, and is the only postdoctoral Training Program in the state of Alabama with a primary focus on hypertension and CVD. (End of Abstract)"
"9503156","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent suggests that in the U.S. prostate cancer is over-detected and over-treated resulting in significant morbidity and financial costs. These problems are the product of poor sensitivity and specificity serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as a screening tool, leading to many unnecessary biopsies that find small and predominantly indolent prostate tumors. While many prostate cancers should be managed with active surveillance, uncertainties surrounding available clinical tools of aggressiveness (such as PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage) will often drive patients and physicians to treatment. Attempts to improve prognostication using candidate biomarkers, mostly discovered from genomic analyses of large pieces of cancers, have had few successes, and available molecular tools provide only modest prediction at best. Clearly, a better understanding of the early molecular genetic events in prostate cancer is desperately needed. We hypothesize that early prostate cancer arises from definable molecular alterations in precursor lesions and progresses as a result of acquired lesions that confer aggressive features in a subpopulation of cells in precursor lesions and/or early tumors. In addition, we hypothesize that at each step, there are downstream molecular alterations that confer, in a probabilistic sense, the ability for some lesions to grow and spread and in others an indolent phenotype (dead end lesions). As such, defining the earliest genomic events, the evolutionary pathways to invasive carcinoma, the final constellation of genomic alterations, and the extent of genomic heterogeneity (the building blocks for evolution), should illuminate the key genomic features distinguishing good and bad outcome prostate cancer. In depth characterization of early lesions has been constrained by limitations of conventional histology tools (prostate cancer precursors can only be reliably identified in fixed tissues) and of available genomic and proteomic technologies (which do not work well on fixed tissues). To address the challenges we wil take advantage of technologies we have developed to analyze small samples in both fixed and frozen tissue to provide a complete picture of the early events in prostate carcinogenesis. We propose 1) to investigate the early genomic evolution of good and bad outcome prostate cancer in histologically defined prostate cancers and precursor lesions in fixed tissues; and 2) to define the genomic heterogeneity of good and bad outcome prostate cancer and the downstream consequences in transcript, protein and glycoprotein expression in frozen tissues. An integrated approach using fixed and frozen tissues will allow us to delineate the early genomic lesions in prostate cancer, define which are selected to evolve into more aggressive and which end up as non-aggressive (dead end) lesions, and characterize the downstream effects of these selected changes in cellular transcription, protein expression and protein glycosylation. A systematic study of the events in prostate cancer during its development and evolution will help address the issues of over- treatment by providing prognostic features and biomarkers that help select men for definitive treatment or observation."
"9335352","PROJECT SUMMARY Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined as involuntary loss of urine secondary to an increase in abdominal pressure during events such as sneezing, coughing or laughing in the absence of bladder contractions. This disorder is a significant gynecological/urological problem currently affecting approximately 25 million American women. These SUI patients exhibit the high incidence of intrinsic sphincter deficiency, characterized by a malfunction of the urethral sphincter mechanism resulting in the low-pressure urethra.  The etiology of SUI may include childbirth-associated injuries to muscles, connective tissues and nerves as well as aging and menopause (estrogen deficiency). However, there is little information as to pathology- specific mechanisms inducing changes in urethral closure function. Therefore, in this application, we will fully elucidate how the proposed risk factors for SUI such as estrogen deficiency, aging process and birth trauma contribute to the progression of the SUI condition, and to provide a proof of concept for novel gene therapy approaches for the treatment of SUI using herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector-mediated gene delivery of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in animal models of SUI.  The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) to evaluate functional and molecular changes of the urethral function leading to SUI using rat models of SUI induced by multiple simulated birth trauma (3 times vaginal distension, VD), estrogen deficiency (ovariectomy, OVX) and aging (14 months old), (2) to investigate the effect of IGF-1 gene therapy using replication-defective HSV vectors in 3 different SUI animal models, and (3) to investigate the effect of glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor GDNF gene therapy using replication- defective HSV vectors in 3 different SUI animal models. We anticipate that IGF-1 gene therapy is more suitable for the recovery of urethral tissue damage (striated & smooth muscle and extracellular matrix molecules) whereas GDNF gene therapy could be more effective for the nerve damage (somatic and autonomic) to exert the therapeutic effects on SUI.  By defining the detailed urethral pathology of SUI and the feasibility of HSV vector-mediated gene therapy approaches, we can provide the foundation for new therapies of SUI and offer the hope of prevention and reversal of this potentially devastating condition to greatly improve the women's health. This is recognized as a high priority in the urologic/gynecologic care of SUI women. 1"
"9324215","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a major threat to public health despite the advent of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting viral protease and RNA polymerase. Resistance development, as a natural outcome from attack by therapeutics, and the prohibitive cost of DAAs demand alternative and more powerful therapeutics. Our laboratory has been studying the mechanisms of HCV entry in the hopes of identifying novel cellular targets for antiviral development. Entry inhibitors targeting host functions will be particularly valuable in treating post-transplant hepatitis C, where one of the major unmet needs is the development of strategies to prevent re- infection of the liver graft after transplantation. During the previous funding period, we found that cell signaling proteins prohibitins 1 and 2 (PHB1/2) are essential pan-genomic HCV entry factors that function at a post- binding step. Although commonly known as mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, a fraction of endogenous PHB1 and 2 localize to the cell surface. Interestingly, plasma-membrane-associated PHBs are known for membrane targeting and activation of CRaf by Ras upon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Targeting PHBs by rocaglamide (Roc-A), a natural compound that binds both PHB1/2, reduced cell surface PHB1/2, disrupted PHB-CRaf interaction, and inhibited HCV entry at low nanomolar concentrations. A subsequent screen of a collection of synthetic Roc-A derivatives indicated that the (-) Roc-A enantiomer is a more potent entry inhibitor than the (+) Roc-A enantiomer. Strikingly, the chiral, racemic version of a Roc-A derivative displayed improved potency and therapeutic index against HCV infection in cell culture. These findings open an unprecedented opportunity to dissect the HCV entry process and to translate basic research into antiviral development. In this competing renewal, we propose to dissect the master signaling pathway that coordinates HCV entry and optimize our lead compound for treating HCV infection. Accomplishing the project will significantly advance our understanding of HCV entry, and lead to a new class of entry inhibitors."
"9278095","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         In the heart, increased Ang II activity from intracellular or interstitial formation is a cause of cardiac remodeling, arrhythmias, and fibrosis. In humans, Ang-(-12), an extended form of Ang I, accounts for nonrenin dependent synthesis of Ang II in cardiac myocytes. Further demonstration of substantial Ang-(1-12) expression in atrial myocytes obtained from patients undergoing cardiac surgery for control of atrial fibrillation (AF) and the associated discovery that cardiac chymase converted Ang-(1-12) into Ang II in both human atrial and left ventricular myocytes generates the hypothesis that stretch-related increased cardiac chymase expression and Ang- (1-12) conversion to Ang II promotes the occurrence of AF through activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and disruption of connexins (Cx), gap junctions proteins important in cell-cell communication and electrical stability. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that activation of chymase contributes to elevated Ang-(1-12)/Ang II/MMP-9 axis and gap junction remodeling in left atrial tissue from patients undergoing valve repair for mitral valve regurgitation (MR) vs. normal left atria from hearts rejected for transplantation; Aim 2 will show how atrial tissue expression and release of chymase Ang-(1-12)/Ang II/MMP-9 components, assessed in pericardial fluid obtained before cardiopulmonary bypass and at 4, 12, 24 and 48 hour time points, are related to a) atrial remodeling and function from cine-magnetic resonance imaging with 3-dimensional analysis performed before and after surgery and b) the occurrence of AF postsurgery. And in Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that stretch and/or hypoxia-reoxygenation of atrial myocytes increases chymase and Cx disruption and electrical instability in HL1 cells which reproduce human atrial myocytes. Achievement of these aims will provide impetus for a clinical trial testing the efficacy of chymase inhibition in the treatment/prevention of AF."
"9108879","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs as a consequence of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). CTE causes personality and behavioral changes, executive dysfunction and memory loss and is characterized by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein in the brain. The ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in a large cohort of OEF/OIF veterans with mTBI from blast exposure who may be at increased risk for CTE. Presently, CTE can only be diagnosed at autopsy and there are no known clinical biomarkers. The development of biomarkers to diagnose this disorder in living individuals would be a major scientific and clinical advance. We hypothesize that multiple combat blast-induced mTBIs cause altered tau metabolism indicative of preclinical CTE. We expect that increased tau biomarkers will be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in brain using advanced brain imaging techniques in veterans with a history of multiple blast mTBIs. In addition, recent data from our Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) show that veteran with significant blast exposure exhibit greater rates and more severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than veterans not exposed to blast neurotrauma. This suggests that the same individuals at risk for PTSD may also be at high risk for CTE.  This project will draw its sample from the TRACTS cohort, which presently consists of 200 OEF/OIF veterans and will increase to ~400 during the proposed study period. History of blast exposure and TBI are documented via a semi-structured interview using the Boston Assessment of TBI: Lifetime (BAT-L). PTSD and other psychiatric illnesses are diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. The proposed study will investigate the correlative relationship between mTBI metrics (number, severity, distance from blast) and neurocognitive measures of attention and executive function, phosphorylated tau pathology, axonal fiber tract damage, and structural brain changes. We will recruit two groups of 30 participants (total sample size of 60) from the TRACTS cohort that differ maximally in their history of combat TBI: (1) two or more blast mTBIs with associated cognitive symptoms (i.e., acute change in mental status, post-traumatic amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the blast) (mTBI); and (2) a matched control group without history of blast exposure or impact head injury (CON). All participants will have served in either OEF or OIF and have a diagnosis of PTSD based on DSM-IV criteria.  We will measure tau biomarkers (phosphorylated tau (ptau), total tau, exosome ptau, oligomeric tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by plate-based ELISA and conduct advanced brain imaging techniques using simultaneous PET/MRI. We will determine whether there is an association between CSF tau biomarkers, regional (dorsolateral frontal and orbital frontal) PET index metrics, mTBI metrics (number, severity, distance from blast), and neurocognitive measures of attention and executive function,  Blast associated mTBI, PTSD and CTE represent significant scientific challenges in terms of determining their biological origins, their differential diagnosis and respective treatments. If not addressed immediately, the VA will be faced with daunting costs and responsibilities associated with caring for these debilitating neurological and psychiatric disorders. The development of reliable biomarkers to detect CTE will enable the diagnosis and monitoring of this condition during life and assessing the efficacy of potential therapies as they are developed. !"
"9274977","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate macular pigment (MP) levels as a modifiable risk marker for the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and more generalized loss of neural retina and vision function with age. Some previous evidence suggests that MP, comprised of the dietary carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin, declines with age, and that preserving MP might help reduce risk for developing eye diseases and/or vision loss which become more common as we age. This has not been previously evaluated in large longitudinal studies. MP optical density (MPOD) can be simply and non-invasively measured. Therefore, MPOD assessment might be useful in screening to identify individuals, in middle-age, who are at higher risk for age-related vision los. Devices to assess MPOD are already adapted for clinical use, but evidence addressing longitudinal relationships of MPOD to AMD and vision loss is needed to make recommendations about their appropriate use. If MPOD predicts AMD and/or age- or disease-related vision loss, then early assessment would permit the targeting of individuals for testing a variety of preventive measures to lower risk, including those which would increase macular pigment.  Evidence to address the gap in longitudinal data can be obtained at low cost by conducting a prospective follow-up study in the Carotenoids in Age-Related Eye Disease Study (CAREDS) cohort. MPOD, fundus photographs to assess AMD, and visual acuity measures were previously obtained in 1,791 women in 2001-2004. Annual follow-up of this cohort, in the Women's Health Initiative, assures low loss to follow up, documents mortality and new chronic diseases (including common age-related eye diseases), and provides extensive nutritional, genetic, lifestyle, and health data.  Follow-up visits thirteen years later will be conducted to provide a second set of fundus photographs to document the relationships of MPOD to AMD incidence and/or progression. Second, MPOD at baseline will also be studied in relation to measures of structural and functional aging at follow-up. Structural measures include new measures of the thickness of the retina, across several layers and regions, using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Functional measures include the loss of visual acuity between baseline and follow-up, and additional secondary measures obtained at follow-up. Third, measures of MPOD levels at follow-up will be obtained to permit the first direct longitudinal estimate of MPOD declines with age, and to provide an opportunity to explore whether average age-related declines are lower in women with higher initial MPOD, and in women with higher intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin, between baseline and follow-up. The proposed research will constitute the largest and longest extant investigation of relationships of macular pigment to aging, age-related vision loss, and AMD, thereby advancing knowledge needed to understand the role of carotenoids in preserving vision with age and informing clinical guidelines."
"9282420","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive, inflammatory, sclerosing cholangiopathy that presents in infancy and leads to bile duct obstruction, biliary cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation in the majority of patients. The etiology of BA is not known; a proposed theory is that the bile duct injury is initiated by a viral infection, followd by a progressive, autoimmune-mediated response targeting bile duct epithelia. Our laboratory and others have established the contribution of T cell-mediated inflammation and autoimmunity to bile duct injury in the rotavirus-induced mouse model of BA and in limited human studies. Recent data from our laboratory reveals that B cell-deficient mice are protected from BA, suggesting that B cells are essential to the development of bile duct injury. Research in murine models and humans have demonstrated the significant contribution of B cells to the onset and progression of many different autoimmune diseases, despite the fact that the organ-specific injury in these diseases was traditionally thought to be solely due to T cell-mediated inflammation. The specific hypotheses to be tested in this proposal are two-fold: 1. B cells play a critical role in the development and progression of bile duct injury and obstruction in murine BA; and 2. BA patients have circulating serum autoantibodies that may provide clues to disease pathogenesis and serve as prognostic biomarkers of disease severity. Specific Aim 1: Establish the contribution of B cells to development of bile duct injury in murine BA through use of B cell knockout and transgenic mice. Investigations of knockout and transgenic mice will establish the B cell mechanism involved in bile duct injury, specifically B cell antigen presentation versus immunoglobulin production. Specific Aim 2: Determine the contribution of B cells to progression of bile duct injury in murine BA through administration of B cell-depleting agents. This aim has direct translational implications to potential new therapies for human BA. Specific Aim 3: Define serum autoantibodies in BA patients and determine correlation with disease severity. Serum autoantibodies will be identified from a protein autoantigen microarray. The utility of autoantibodies in BA as serum biomarkers of disease severity will also be assessed. Significance: These investigations will add a unique perspective and increase our understanding of how B cells function in the setting of virus-induced autoimmunity. Discovery of autoantibodies in BA would provide clues to autoimmune mechanisms of pathogenesis and function as useful biomarkers to gauge severity of disease or response to novel therapies. The potential benefit of B cell depleting agents in alleviating progression of disease could change the paradigm of how physicians care for BA patients."
"9262178","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States. Even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for, minority populations have higher overall incidence rates and worse outcomes than the overall population. Prostate cancer is one such disease with higher incidence and death rates in African American (AA) men than Caucasians. Although socioeconomic factors may be blamed to a certain extent, it is appreciated that the genetic composition makes AA men more susceptible to aggressive prostate cancer. Genetic and epigenetic changes are known as tumorigenic drivers because epigenetic editing precludes mounting of host antitumor response necessary for tumor cell clearance. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), is the best-characterized epigenetic modification in prostate cancer, and racial disparities in DNA methylation are associated with cancer prognosis and survival. Therefore, targeting of DNMT to reverse epigenetic alterations is an appealing therapeutic target, and vital to reduce the observed prostate cancer outcome gaps among AA men and Caucasians. The deoxycytidine analogue decitabine is unique in that it can be repositioned for non-cytotoxic depletion of DNMT. We characterized a low dose of decitabine with its increased absorption in the presence of tetrahydrouridine (THU). Combination of THU with decitabine changes its pharmacology, and facilitates non-cytotoxic DNMT1 depletion. We demonstrated that the THU-decitabine combination significantly inhibits the growth of TRAMP-C2 prostate tumors in immune competent mice, and the addition of CpG immunotherapy further enhanced antitumor immunity. Based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that THU-decitabine directed epigenetic therapy revitalize the host intrinsic immunity and augment vaccine-induced antitumor response. Since DNA methylation is prevalent and relates to greater risk in AAs, DNMT depletion will invigorate the immune response of tumor-bearing host, providing an opportunity to immunotherapy inducing robust antitumor immunity. We will test the combination of THU-decitabine directed DNMT depletion, immune modulation and therapeutic vaccine to determine 1) the effect of epigenetic editing on prostate cancer cell growth in murine models; and 2) the effector mechanism of THU-decitabine guided vaccine- induced antigen-specific antitumor immunity in complete regression of early and advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. This project is novel because the concept of a non-toxic THU-decitabine combination with immunotherapy has not been tested in any cancer type. This combinatorial approach will significantly attenuate the growth of aggressive prostate cancer as often presented in AA men, and may represent a novel treatment to reduce prostate cancer disparity."
"9367076","Project Summary/Abstract C. difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in the healthcare setting with about 453,000 cases and 29,000 deaths yearly in the U.S. as reported by CDC in 2015. A continual rise in severe CDI has been observed worldwide. Currently, standard treatment for CDI is the administration of antibiotics. While effective, these treatments do not prevent and may contribute to a disease recurrence rate of 15-35%. Prevention of recurrence is one of the most challenging aspects in the field. CDI symptoms range from diarrhea to intestinal inflammation/lesion and death. Symptoms are mainly caused by two exotoxins TcdA and TcdB. Both toxins share a very similar domain structure including the N-terminal catalytic glucosyltransferase domain (GT), the autolytic cysteine proteinase domain (CPD), the central translocation domain (TM), and the C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD). No vaccine against CDI is currently licensed. The objective of this project is to develop novel mucosal vaccines that target both C. difficile toxins and colonization/adhesion factors. We have previously demonstrated effective protection with an earlier immunogen mTcd138, which contains the GT and CPD domains of TcdB and the RBD of TcdA. We further enhanced mTcd138 by: 1) adding the RBD of TcdB to mTcd138, resulting in fusion protein mTcd169; 2) fusing mTcd169 with Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (sFliC), resulting in fusion protein Tcd169Fl; and 3) expressing mTcd138 in non-toxigenic C. difficile strains, designated as NTCD_Tcd138. Oral immunizations with NTCD_Tcd138 spores provided full protection in mice and significant protection in hamsters against challenge with hyper-virulent C. difficile strains. In addition, we expressed and purified C. difficile protein Cwp84, which is a cysteine protease and plays a critical role in maturation of surface-layer proteins. It was reported that Immunization with Cwp84 provides significant protection in hamsters by delaying C. difficile colonization. In this project, we will: 1) further express mTcd169 and Tcd169Fl in non-toxigenic C. difficile 85 (NTCD) to generate strains NTCD_Tcd169 and NTCD_Tcd169FL, respectively; 2) evaluate the following four immunogens as potential vaccine candidates in mice and hamster models of CDI: Tcd169Fl, a mixture of Tcd169Fl and Cwp84 (designated as Tcd169Fl/Cw), NTCD_Tcd169, and NTCD_Tcd169Fl."
"9375804","Project Summary / Abstract  Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive malignant primary bone cancer with a high propensity for lung metastasis. OS frequently originates in the long bones during periods of rapid bone growth. Consequently, OS represents the most prevalent bone cancers affecting children and adolescent and young adults (AYA), with ~400-600 cases a year and accounts roughly half of all new cases of OS diagnosed in the United States. Despite aggressive combination chemotherapy and surgery, the outcome for metastatic OS remains dismal, and the overall survival in children and AYA patients with metastatic OS has not improved significantly over the past 3 decades. A high proportion of OS patients develop pulmonary metastasis (pOS) either at the time of diagnosis (20%) or after initiation of multimodal therapy including combination chemotherapy and surgery. Unfortunately, almost all of the patients who develop surgically un-resectable pOS invariably succumb to this devastating disease. Therefore, pOS represent a disease with unmet needs. As OS contains extremely complex genetic alterations, molecular targeted precision therapy has proven challenging. Recent exciting scientific development implicates the immune system as a potential important new armamentarium as a novel approach to control or reduce pOS. In the current proposal, we identified tumor-expressed Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (tVCAM-1) as playing a pivotal role in immune-mediated cancer metastasis by interacting with ?4?1 integrin on lung macrophages (MACs), thereby implicating the pulmonary macrophages as a major culprit in the pathophysiology of metastatic OS. Compared to non-metastatic parental tumor (K7), metastatic murine OS cells (K7M2) express high surface VCAM-1, and absence of either tVCAM-1 or MACs prevents the development and ameliorates a large proportion of established pOS. Therefore, we wish to further examine our proposal that a targetable cellular and molecular mechanism, VCAM-1/ ?4?1, is a primary driver of OS-MAC interaction, providing the suitable lung tissue niche for pOS in vivo. Our hypothesis is that interfering VCAM- 1/?4?1 signaling between pOS and MACs by down-regulating VCAM-1, depleting MACs or disrupting VCAM- 1-?4?1 signaling will reduce pulmonary metastasis and improve survival. Specific Aim 1: We will characterize functional outcomes of MACS and other immune cells following VCAM-1/?4?4 signaling engagement with pOS. We will compare VCAM-1lo and VCAM-1hi pOS cells for in vivo growth and associated immune responses in the lungs, and expand our observation to include testing lung metastatic potential of other human and mouse pOS cell lines and PDXs available through our own PDX repository and that of our collaborator at Texas Children's Hospital. We will characterize phenotypic and functional outcomes of various myeloid and other immune cellular compartment in the lung tissue of VCAM-1lo and VCAM-1hi pOS cells using cellular, molecular and imaging approaches. Specific Aim 2: We will test the efficacy of functional blockade of VCAM- 1/?4?1 interaction by depleting MACs with intranasal liposomal clodronate treatment or by inhibiting molecular interactions using VCAM-1 specific inhibitory peptide (iVCAM-1p) or intranasal / intratracheal administration of anti-a4 blocking antibody. In the latter scenario involving anti-?4 blocking antibody, we set a goal to obtain foundational pre-clinical, IND-enabling data for monitoring systemic and local toxicities and refining optimal dosing in order to rapidly translate findings from this current grant into Phase I studies using the FDA-approved anti-?4 antibody, Natalizumab, via the intratracheal and inhalation routes for the treatment of patients with late- stage pOS, for whom no other treatment options with demonstrable therapeutic benefits are available. Success in this high priority effort could have a profound effect in improving the outcome and quality of life for children and AYA patients afflicted with this devastating disease."

"9397184","ABSTRACT Application of real-time RNA-based sensors to study concentrations of metabolites and other physiological events by fluorescence is hindered by inadequate expression of RNA by mammalian cells. We have previously developed RNA-based sensors by combining the dye- activating fluorogenic RNA aptamer, Spinach, with metabolite-binding RNA riboswitch elements and implemented them in E. coli. When expressed in mammalian cells, such RNA-based sensors are not as abundant as in E. coli and lack any fluorescence signal. Recent findings have indicated that metazoan tRNA introns generate stable circular RNAs (circRNA) in vivo that can be detected by fluorescence microscopy when incorporating a Spinach-like aptamer sequence. CircRNAs exhibit longer half-lives than their corresponding linear RNAs, possibly due to their resistance to degradation by endogenous exoribonucleases; however in vivo expression of circRNAs is low. Preliminarily, we have devised a new approach to generating circRNAs endogenously that demonstrates 20-fold higher expression levels than the tRNA-intron-based approach. This technology presents an opportunity to express circRNA-based sensors in mammalian culture for the first time and for a range of applications when combined with existing RNA biotechnology. On this basis, I propose to optimize this circRNA expressing technology for increased concentration to improve the fluorescence signal of circRNA-based sensors and expand overall usefulness. Furthermore, I intend to adapt our approach to linear RNA-based sensors to a circRNA context, considering the associated structural and sequence constraints. Finally, I will design the first circRNA-based sensor in mammalian cells by incorporating previously identified RNA aptamers against the truncated polymerase of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). We will also improve on previous approaches to sensor design by optimizing critical transducer sequences of the sensor in a high-throughput manner using next-generation sequencing. Such an optimized sensor will be the basis for a novel HBV infection reporter that does not require engineering of the HBV genome in ways that alter its normal life cycle, as has been done for 25 years. An HBV reporter system that does not intrinsically change the virus?s replication and infection behavior will allow fundamental discoveries as to the mechanism of HBV pathogenesis."
"9257379","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 25 million American adults. Kidney failure leads to the retention of metabolic waste products that functionally disrupt multiple tissues, including skeletal muscle. CKD patients have markedly reduced skeletal muscle mass and strength, which adversely impacts ambulation, functional independence, and quality of life. Previous evidence and our preliminary data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may be a central mechanism of skeletal muscle impairment in CKD. However, previous studies lack comprehensive assessments of key functional mitochondrial characteristics, may be confounded by other conditions inherent to CKD, and lack correlation with real-world physical performance measures. The goal of this application is to directly measure functional muscle mitochondrial properties in a broad cohort of CKD patients. We will utilize non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging and optimal spectroscopy tools to quantify muscle mitochondrial characteristics and will evaluate their associations with clinically relevant physical performance measures. We will then conduct a pilot trial to determine whether an aerobic and resistance training program plus coenzyme Q10 can modify mitochondrial functional properties in CKD. 1"
"9271993","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Outcome dependent and auxiliary variable dependent sampling designs are highly efficient when compared to standard random sampling. In an era where budgets are tightening and electronic health and large-scale cohort study data are becoming increasingly available for research, study designs that use existing resources and data to advise sampling schemes are able to concentrate resources on the most informative subjects and/or times. These targeted sampling study designs (e.g., case-control and case-cohort) are ubiquitous in many areas of medical and public health research; however there has been relatively little research on designs involving longitudinal data. Longitudinal studies can address important research questions involving within- and among-individual changes in exposures and outcomes over time. The broad goal of this application is to develop a framework for conducting cost-efficient research for longitudinal data. It will include several classes of designs that are discerned by the aims, semi-parametric and likelihood based methods for analysis, and software that will permit preemptive sample size and power calculations and analyses of ascertained data. Aim 1 extends our earlier work on outcome dependent sampling (ODS) designs, to designs that sample based on multiple longitudinal outcomes. Such multiple ODS (MODS) designs enable low cost retrospective studies of pleiotropic effects of one or more expensive to ascertain exposure variables. In contrast to Aims 1, Aim 2 designs are prospective. They are conducted with outcome history and auxiliary variable dependent sampling (OHADS) schemes that alter within-subject sampling probabilities dynamically based data that have been accumulated. A primary feature of these designs is to allow researchers to weigh exposure and outcome ascertainment costs against the anticipated information gained with ascertainment at each time point. Aim 3 proposes adaptive ODS (AODS) designs that retrospectively sample subjects in waves. After each wave of subjects is collected and the data summarized, the designs are modified based on the goals of the study and will often consider estimation efficiency and robustness to modeling assumptions. In contrast to all other aims that only considered two-level data (subject and time), Aim 4 considers multi-stage outcome dependent and auxiliary variable dependent sampling (mSODS and mSADS) of hierarchical and hierarchical longitudinal data. In these designs sampling occurs are multiple levels of the hierarchical data."
"9328402","ABSTRACT  This application is for a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (F31) for Kendall J. Lough to study the role that the nectin-afadin cell adhesion pathway plays in regulating mammalian palatogenesis. Mr. Lough has demonstrated that loss of afadin results in highly penetrant cleft palate in mouse models. This award will allow Mr. Lough to further develop an expertise in cell and developmental biology while expanding his understanding in craniofacial morphogenesis and oral biology. This proposal will expand the understanding of mammalian palatogenesis by describing a novel cleft palate model while developing an additional model of an uncharacterized human cleft lip and cleft palate (CL/P) syndrome. Mr. Lough will take full advantage of the opportunities presented with this award to further develop skills essential to his career including 1) scientific communication through writing and oral presentation, 2) statistics and computational biology, 3) physiology in cell and developmental biology, 4) additional techniques relevant to biomedical research, and 5) significant mentoring experience. Mr. Lough has assembled a strong environment and research mentoring team to ensure the success of this proposal and his career goals. This award will prepare Mr. Lough to continue in his pursuit of a career as an independent academic researcher studying the genetics and cell biology of the oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract and associated pathologies.  Human CL/P is the most common birth defect in America and results in thousands of deaths globally each year, particularly in developing nations. While modern sequencing studies have identified numerous candidate loci associated with human CL/P, very few of these have been functionally characterized. One such disorder is CLPED1, which is associated with homozygous nonsense mutations in the extracellular domain of the nectin-1 encoding gene, PVRL1. Nectin-1 is part of the larger nectin family of transmembrane cell adhesion molecules, which bind to the cytoplasmic adapter protein afadin. Current mouse models lacking these genes are either embryonic lethal or fail to develop CL/P. Utilizing a novel genetic technique to inactivate gene expression via lentiviral delivery to early mouse embryos, Mr. Lough has demonstrated that loss of afadin results in CL/P, providing the first functional data linking this pathway to mammalian palatogenesis. This technique allows Mr. Lough to generate additional genetic mouse models at an unprecedented rate ? 6 weeks as opposed to 6 months for standard techniques. This proposal outlines experiments to further characterize the mechanism of CL/P presentation in afadin null embryos through a combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques to evaluate changes in cell-cell adhesion. This application also proposes to generate an elegant genetic model expressing the human CL/P ? associated Pvrl1W185X mutation in mice. This proposal will provide the scientific community with novel genetic tools and models for studying orofacial clefting candidates in an epithelial-specific manner."
"9268460","?    DESCRIPTION:     Recent studies suggest that presence of vascular disease risk factors (VDRF) such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease and heart disease can significantly increase the risk of disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). There appears to be a dose-response relationship between VDRF and MS disability with the presence of a single VDRF increasing the risk of early gait disability by 51% and the presence of 2 of these conditions increasing the risk to 228%. Among Veterans, VDRF are highly prevalent. In the last two years, among the 19,282 Veterans with MS who received care within the VA system, ~9300 had hyperlipidemia, ~9200 suffered from hypertension and ~3500 had diabetes mellitus. Approximately 5900 MS Veterans had both hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Increasingly, evidence indicates mitochondrial dysfunction and resultant deficiencies in ATP and other high energy phosphorus metabolites contribute to neurodegeneration in MS. Our collaborator Dr. William Rooney at the Oregon Health & Science University Advanced Imaging Research Center has developed techniques to measure high energy phosphorus (HEP) metabolites and cerebral blood flow using a 7 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instrument and demonstrated that people with MS have gray matter deficiencies in HEP metabolites as well as cerebral blood flow abnormalities.  The purpose of this research is to determine if VDRF are associated with increased abnormalities in cerebral blood flow and metabolism in people with MS as assessed with high-field brain MRI and if these abnormalities contribute to brain atrophy and clinical disease progression in MS. The overriding hypothesis of this project is that vascular risk factors in MS increase the rate of disease progression and do so by decreasing gray matter metabolism and blood flow and worsening brain atrophy. To address this hypothesis the following aims will be achieved:  Specific Aim 1: Using matched cohorts, determine whether Veterans with MS with VDRF in comparison with those without VDRF have decreased cerebral blood flow and volume detected by MRI and high energy phosphate metabolites in cerebral gray matter assessed by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI).  Specific Aim 2: Determine if brain atrophy progresses faster in Veterans with MS and VDRF than those without VDRF and whether 31P MRSI and cerebral blood flow deficits are associated with an increased rate of brain atrophy.  Specific Aim 3: Determine if clinical impairment, disability and quality of life deteriorates faster in Veterans with MS and VDRF than those without VDRF and whether 31P MRSI and cerebral blood flow deficits are associated with an increased rate of disease progression.  Research Design and Methods: We propose a longitudinal, quantitative MRI study using 31P MRSI assessing mitochondrial function and perfusion measurements to quantify blood volume and flow to investigate whether MS Veterans with VDRF in comparison with those without VDRF have reduced cerebral blood flow and volume, reduced high energy phosphorus metabolites, and accelerated brain atrophy, clinical impairment and disability. This will be a 3-year long controlled study with a single-site, mixed design (cross sectional and longitudinal) with two arms. MRI data will be collected at baseline, 12, 24 and 36 months. We will enroll a total of 60 MS subjects with goal to have 30 subjects in each arm: 1) MS subjects with VDRF; 2) MS subjects without VDRF. MS Subjects aged 40-65 years will be included and may or may not be on disease modifying therapy. The results of these studies will provide the basis for designing a clinical trial to study if interventions aimed at improving VDRF can reduce the risk of disease progression among MS Veterans."
"9385153","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem. African Americans have a higher prevalence of late stage CKD than Whites and progress from early stage to late stage at a much more rapid rate. Biomedical explanations for African Americans' faster CKD progression prevail, with virtually no research attention paid to the role of social factors. Stress related to discrimination is a particularly compelling area of study in light of strong evidence demonstrating its linkages to CKD risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The proposed proof of concept study will recruit 100 African American patients (both with and without diagnosed CKD) to determine whether discriminatory stressors are an important risk factor for CKD-related physiological processes and kidney functioning. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand the impact of and pathways through which discriminatory stress contributes to CKD progression. The overall objective of this R21 application, which is the first step towards attainment of this long-term goal, is to obtain effect sizes for a larger prospective R01 and explore two hypothesized pathways (i.e., blood pressure reactivity and pathophysiological mechanisms) using a multi-method research design. This study will carry out the following specific aims: 1. To examine associations between chronic stressors (i.e., discriminatory versus general),  pathophysiological mechanisms (i.e., elevated inflammation and nocturnal blood pressure),  and poor kidney functioning among 100 African American patients.  a. Based on a cross-sectional research design, we hypothesize that chronic discriminatory  stressors will be associated with poor kidney functioning independent of other chronic  stressors as mediated by CKD-related inflammatory biomarkers and autonomic arousal. 2. To examine the impact of acute stressors (i.e., discriminatory versus general) on short-term  changes in CKD-related physiological processes (i.e., increases in inflammatory markers  and blood pressure reactivity) in patients from aim 1.  a. Based on an experimental research design, we hypothesize that discriminatory stressors  will be more physiologically impactful than general stressors. Outcomes include several  critical CKD-related inflammatory biomarkers and blood pressure reactivity assessed at  three time points during the experimental manipulation. Collectively, these outcomes are expected to support the advancement of science-based information about CKD that can be disseminated in order to improve health and quality of life."
"9315150","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a Clinical Center, UCSF will continue to recruit subjects into the newly prioritized and approved studies, as well as the currently ongoing ChiLDREN studies, and will conduct the procedures for these clinical trials and longitudinal follow-up studies, as described in their respective study protocols, without any deviations. The UCSF Clinical Center will participate in a cooperative and interactive manner with other Clinical Centers, with the Data Coordinating Center, and with the NIDDK in all aspects of the ChiLDREN activities. We plan to continue to carry out the protocols of the ChiLDREN, be open to the concept of a centralized Institutional Review Board at our institution, and agree to be governed by the policies and procedures of the ChiLDREN and its steering committee. We understand that not all Clinical Centers will necessarily participate in all of the approved ChiLDREN protocols. The UCSF Clinical Center is one of the ten original sites in the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium (BARC) which continued, expanded and merged with CLiC to form ChiLDREN. Neonatal hepatitis refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders that result in similar morphologic changes in the livers of infants less than 3 months of age in response to various insults. The term neonatal hepatitis has been used at times to include all causes of cholestasis in infancy in which extra-hepatic biliary obstruction is excluded. Although in many of the cases an etiology cannot be found, specific infectious and metabolic causes have been identified that may present as neonatal hepatitis. Hepatitis in a neonate caused by a known etiologic agent that may be amenable to therapy needs to be differentiated from idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH), in which etiologic agents are unknown and probably multiple. At UCSF, we specifically plan to utilize new genetic diagnostic tools and apply them to the rich samples available in the ChiLDREN repository, to elucidate further genetic disorders and factors that contribute to the diagnosis of INH. Application of state- of-the-art genetic technologies and approaches to study of DNA samples from these patients will allow us to explore the genetic etiologies underlying INH and related diagnoses to a much greater breadth and depth than has previously been done, or even been considered possible. Variants that we identify as being associated with INH will also be strong candidates for evaluation in adult liver disorders, such as drug- induced cholestasis. Further, in collaboration with Dr. Ron Sokol at the University of Colorado and Dr. Richard Thompson at King's College Hospital in London, UK we propose to further develop a Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) Genotyping Program for diagnostic screening for PFIC and Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC) subjects in the ChiLDREN LOGIC study. We propose to shift to more cost-effective and comprehensive experimental approaches making use of current state-of-the art technologies."
"9275349","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Zoonotic viral infections are responsible for a large portion of emerging infectious diseases in humans. However, for many viruses the molecular basis that determines host range, virulence and the potential for cross-species transmission is poorly understood. The long-term goal is to delineate key factors that contribute to viral host range and virulence by analyzing the interaction of viruses with the host innate immune system. A major focus are model poxviruses, which display extreme differences in host range and virulence and include major human and animal pathogens. The objective of this application is to determine the contribution of species-specific interactions of the host antiviral protein kinase R (PKR) with virus inhibitors for virus replication, virulence and host range. The central hypothesis is that both viral host range and virus replication are directly influenced by the interaction of PR and its viral inhibitors. The rationale of this project is that an improved understanding of the mechanisms that determine virus host range can ultimately result in a better prediction of host switches and changes in virulence and also might lead to new alternative strategies for disease control. Based on strong preliminary data, the main hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Characterize host-specific PKR inhibition by poxvirus inhibitors; 2) Elucidate the molecular basis for PKR sensitivity to viral inhibitors; and 3) Evaluate the effects and functional consequences of naturally occurring variants of rabbit PKR and myxoma virus inhibitors. Under the first aim, the interactions between PKR proteins from different host species with PKR inhibitors from prototypic poxviruses will be studied and their functional relevance in cell line infection assays tested. In the second aim, the molecular basis for species-specific PKR-inhibitor interactions will be determined by combining mutagenesis, binding and infection assays and the potential of PKR to resist PKR inhibitors from other viruses will be tested. Under the third aim, naturally evolved variants of PKR from rabbits and from myxoma virus PKR inhibitors, as well as mutants that were generated in artificial evolution experiments, will be analyzed for effects in interaction and infection assays to test the PKR-inhibitor interactions in  textbook example for host-virus coevolution. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to the better understanding of the molecular basis for poxvirus host range, yield novel insights into the mechanisms of resistance to viruses and how they evolve, and might lead to a better prediction of which viruses have a strong potential for cross-species transmission. This project is innovative because it introduces new strategies and novel tools to elucidate the importance of host-virus interactions for virus replication and host range and explores the novel concept that the outcome of cross- species virus transmission is strongly influenced by chance, but might be predicted by experimental analyses. Ultimately, the knowledge gained during this project will lead to the better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind virus host range and resistance and is expected to propel the field forward."
"9284466","ABSTRACT The CF Cell & Tissue Bioassays Core (Core D) is an important component of the UCSF CF Research and Translation Core Center. The major objective of the Core is to test the efficacy of CF-targeted small molecules discovered by high-throughput screening (HTS; performed by Core A) in physiologically relevant pre-clinical assays. This objective is accomplished by performing electrophysiological and optical assays that probe ion channel and epithelial cell function in CF-relevant cell and tissue models. Assays use immortalized cell culture models, primary cell cultures derived from human sources, three-dimensional models including organoids, and tissue samples such as airway fragments from non-CF and CF subjects (provided by Core B, Cell & Tissue Models). The most heavily used resource in the Core are Ussing chambers for analysis of short-circuit current which is performed to validate hits identified by HTS, determine hit efficacy, provide structure-activity relationship data during hit-to-lead optimization, and assess lead efficacy in human airway tissue samples from CF and non-CF subjects. Other major Core D resources include optical assays of CF-relevant airway properties, including measurement of airway surface liquid and submucosal gland secretions in human cell cultures and airway tissues from CF and non-CF subjects. Many of the optical assays provided by Core D were developed to investigate CF lung disease mechanisms and are uniquely available at UCSF. Core D also carries out electrophysiological and optical assays to support basic and translational research on CF pathophysiology and assay development for screening. Of the 25 projects in the research base, 20 will use Core D resources."
"9354273","OVERALL ? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Age related diseases causing dementia are an increasing global, social and economic catastrophe that mandates broad and aggressive research. Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects over 5 million people in the US alone. Vascular contributions to dementia and AD are increasingly recognized. However, the role of the cerebrovascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD, and the underlying neurovascular mechanisms remain, to date, largely unknown and under- researched, representing a critical barrier in the field. The overall goals of this program are to advance current knowledge on the vascular contributions to dementia and AD, and establish whether the neurovasculature plays a major role in cognitive decline, and therefore is a key new therapeutic target to treat dementia and AD. This is a program project application with multiple projects, cores, institutions and investigators. It represents an integrated whole far greater than the sum of its parts. Each project and core complements the others so that a synergistic relationship among them is achieved with a common focus on goals of the program, namely to test the neurovascular hypothesis of AD. This hypothesis holds that cerebrovascular dysfunction and disruption in the neurovascular integrity underlies and contributes to the onset and progression of cognitive decline. We have enlisted established clinical and translational research groups that collectively bring significant expertise in all aspects of the research plan and each have contributed productively over many years to the study of dementia and AD. To test the ?neurovascular hypothesis?, the participating investigators will apply cutting-edge molecular and imaging methods. We will perform parallel studies with analogous measures in humans and rats in two AD genetic risk groups with the major genetic risk factors for late-onset AD, i.e., apolipoprotein E-?4 (APOE4) gene and early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), i.e., presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations that both develop early vascular dysfunction and significant cerebrovascular pathology, and in the rat model of AD (line TgF344-AD) that faithfully recapitulates the rich clinico-pathological spectrum of human AD including the presence of early vascular dysfunction and cerebrovascular pathology. Central to our approach is our commitment to take a new research direction with the overarching goal to provide an answer to the broader question; ?what is the role of the vascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD?, and ?what is the prognostic and diagnostic value of neurovascular molecular and imaging biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline?. The relationship between neurovascular integrity, brain connectivity and cognitive function has not been explored. The collective expertise of the investigators, overall environment, preliminary results, and experimental design for each of the projects and supporting cores hold tremendous promise for the success of this program. We are confident that the proposed studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of pathogenesis, treatment, and early prevention of dementia and AD."
"9245577","Project Summary Extensive epidemiological data has documented an association between sexual violence and HIV acquisition through direct and indirect pathways. However, the underlying biological mechanism to explain this association is less understood. Sexual violence may contribute to HIV acquisition by disrupting the cervicovaginal epithelium and magnifying local inflammation and immune activation. Sexual violence may also alter the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis resulting in changes to the innate and adaptive immune system in the female genital tract (FGT) and alterations to cervicovaginal epithelial health. When compared to adult women, adolescent girls may be at heightened biological risk due to differences in the genital mucosa such as cervical ectopy and high baseline inflammation rendering girls more vulnerable to adverse effects of stress. Our preliminary data indicate both recent and chronic cases of sexual violence cause dysregulation of critical FGT immune mediators that have the potential to affect HIV susceptibility. Establishing a better understanding of the correlation between immunity in the FGT and the dysregulated HPA axis, as well as the differences between adolescent girls and adult women is critical for the development of strategies to counter the adverse effects of sexual trauma resulting from mucosal injury in efforts to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. To that end, we will: 1) assess the impact of sexual trauma on FGT immunity; 2) assess the impact of sexual trauma on the central and peripheral HPA axis; 3) determine the extent to which the dysregulated HPA axis affects FGT immunity following sexual trauma; and 4) examine whether risk factors linked to sexual violence (i.e., sexual risk behaviors, substance use, mental health) are associated with HPA axis dysregulation and FGT immunity in adolescent girls and adult women post-sexual trauma. We will further determine how these associations change over time following the traumatic event. Our multi-disciplinary team will conduct a case- control study with follow-up among adolescent girls aged 14-19 n=30; 15 cases and 15 controls) and adult women aged 20 and older (n=30; 15 cases and 15 controls). All participants will complete a quantitative survey and clinical assessment at baseline, 1- and 3-month follow-up visits. The proposed research will advance the FY2016 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-related Research by ?examining the relationship of the female genital tract immune function, including genital injury due to sexual violence, to HIV risk? and is highly responsive to RFA- AI-15-058 by ?conducting research that addresses the gaps in our understanding of how reproductive maturation impacts HIV susceptibility.? Findings from this research will facilitate future hypothesis-driven longitudinal research and development of safe and efficacious biomedical prevention strategies."
"9372530","Project Summary Prostate cancer (CaP) is the commonest internal malignancy in U.S. men. More than 180,000 new cases and 26,000 deaths are expected during 2016, making it the 2nd most common cause of cancer death in men. Focal therapy, a new alternative for men with intermediate risk CaP ? a group estimated by NCI to comprise as many as 60,000 new cases every year ? has become a subject of keen interest. Of the various energies for focal therapy, laser ablation (FLA) is compelling because of its precision and because it offers the potential of an outpatient treatment without need for general anesthesia or an operating room. Ordinarily performed under direct MRI guidance, FLA is capable of producing a well-defined zone of coagulation necrosis via hyperthermia within the prostate without damage to adjacent tissue and without causing incontinence or erectile dysfunction. The linchpin of CaP focal therapy is targeted biopsy, a procedure that we started in 2009 and developed under a previous Academic-Industrial R01 grant. In targeted biopsy, multi-parametric MRI is used for imaging and the Artemis device is used for fusing stored MR images with real-time ultrasound. Biopsy in the clinic can then be directed at suspicious regions seen on MRI. Approximately 2500 such procedures have been performed at UCLA, among the largest experience extant, and thus our team has gained considerable expertise placing biopsy needles into localized prostate cancers. Using knowledge from the biopsy program, we performed FLA on 8 men in-bore, i.e., inside an MRI tube, using direct MRI guidance for localization and MR thermometry for monitoring. The in-bore treatments proved safe and feasible, but lengthy, expensive, and resource-intensive, lacking the potential for widespread adoption. Therefore, we brought the procedure into the clinic, using MR/US fusion for guidance and direct thermal probes for temperature monitoring. The clinic procedures (N=10), performed under an IDE from FDA, yielded results like the in-bore procedures, but were much simpler, quicker, and potentially less expensive. We propose to build upon a substantial preliminary experience to create and test a technology that would allow widespread adoption of FLA for CaP. Translation of the idea into clinical practice depends upon (a) MRI/US fusion for guidance, with which we already have expertise, (b) thermal probes for intra-prostatic temperature monitoring, to be fabricated by partner LumaSense, and (c) a novel ultrasound probe to allow visualization of both laser and thermal probe, to be fabricated by partner MDMedtech. While not official partners, Medtronic has endorsed this project by donating the Visualase system and Hitachi by donating the ultrasound machine. Work would begin with creation and testing of each system component, followed by a multi-institution validation study (UCLA/Stanford/Cornell) in men with intermediate-risk CaP, employing before and follow-up targeted biopsy to prove efficacy. Successful completion of the project would lead to a safe, effective, economical system for clinic-based treatment of prostate cancer applicable to tens of thousands of men every year."

"9338107","Delirium is one of the six leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in hospitalized elderly patients. Individuals with advanced age and Alzheimer's disease are at greatest risk of developing delirium. A substantial proportion of patients who survive delirium are likely to experience long-term cognitive impairment similar to mild Alzheimer's disease, and require institutional care. This suggests that delirium and Alzheimer's disease share pathophysiological features that arise in the context of normal aging. Conditions associated with delirium are characterized by activation of the inflammatory cascade with acute release of inflammatory mediators into the bloodstream. A putative mechanism is the high interleukin-6 level that has been associated with delirium in both laboratory animals and humans. Normal aging is associated with a morphological shift of glia to an activated state. Following a systemic challenge such as critical illness, these activated glia result in an exaggerated neuroinflammatory state associated with delirium. Neuroinflammation is further exacerbated by sleep disturbances. Thus, sleep deprivation may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of delirium. However, pharmacological treatment with no current medication (benzodiazepines, antipsychotics) induces natural sleep or reliably reduces the incidence of delirium. We have found that biomimetic sleep, defined here as pharmacological induction of rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and non-REM I-III sleep states using dexmedetomidine, can now be achieved in humans. Our Specific Aims seek to: (1) investigate the benefits of preemptive biomimetic sleep for reducing the risk of developing delirium in a randomize; (2) investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of delirium using combined Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance imaging and serum metabolic profiling; and (3) investigate predictors of delirium from perioperative electroencephalogram recordings. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have expanded our knowledge of the pathophysiology of delirium, evaluated a new preemptive therapeutic strategy for delirium, suggest neurophysiologically based monitoring strategies to reduce significantly the amount of anesthetic administered to elderly patients ? and possibly delirium ? while being certain the patient is sufficiently unconscious for surgery (individualized anesthesia care), and enable continued investigation into the pathophysiology of this clinically important disorder."
"9304303","Project Summary/Abstract The Electrophysiology Core will provide centralized services for electrophysiological studies, including preparation of in vitro brain slices, patch-clamp recordings, immunohistochemistry, and the associated data analysis. Project 1 (Saper), Project 2 (Scammell) and Project 4 (Chamberlin) will use this Core facility. We will use patch- clamp recordings and channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2)-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) to determine, for Project 1, functional synaptic connectivity between CGRP expressing neurons of the external lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBel) and neurons of the basal forebrain (BF), lateral hypothalamus (LH), supramammillary nucleus (SUM) and central amygdala (CeA). For Project 2 we will determine functional synaptic connectivity between cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons of the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT/PPT) and neurons of the BF, midline thalamus and SUM, and for Project 4 between glutamatergic premotorneurons of the parahypoglossal zone and hypoglossal motoneurons. In these experiments we will define the neurotransmitters and postsynaptic receptors involved in these inputs. In addition, the Core will be continuing the validation and optimization of the stimulation paradigms for the opto-genetic and pharmaco-genetic tools (ChR2 and ArchT excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs) used by these Projects. The Projects will benefit from the expertise and shared resources of the Core."
"9304308","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Approximately half of all obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients cannot tolerate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Therefore, new treatment options are badly needed. One potential treatment target is the respiratory arousal threshold. Recent evidence suggests that premature arousals to respiratory stimuli (wake up easily to CO2) can prevent important neuromuscular compensatory mechanisms from stabilizing the upper airway. However, effective sedatives for raising the arousal threshold without also reducing pharyngeal muscle tone (a limitation of traditional benzodiazepines), are lacking. Therefore, a major objective of this grant is to find sedatives that will raise the arousal threshold without compromising pharyngeal muscle tone. Another potential treatment target for OSA is the pharyngeal muscles themselves. New animal data suggests that the pharyngeal muscles become hypotonic during sleep primarily because of progressive withdrawal of noradren- ergic tone at the hypoglossal nucleus, as well as muscarinic inhibition during REM sleep. However, due to the relatively recent awareness of these mechanisms, drugs with these neurotransmitter profiles have not been adequately tested in humans. Thus, another major objective of this grant is to identify noradrenergic and anti- muscarinic drugs that can stimulate the pharyngeal muscles during sleep in humans. Lastly, it is hypothesized that treating both traits simultaneously, i.e. combination therapy, may achieve more success than single drug therapy. The rationale for doing this is that non-CPAP therapies (oral appliances, surgery, positional therapy) generally tend to have small effect sizes, and it is realistic to think that these drugs will also. Therefore, com- bining them could maximize their effectiveness and enhance neuromuscular compensation of the pharyngeal muscles. Specifically, Aim 1 will test how well the following drugs stimulate the pharyngeal muscles in sleeping humans: 1) desipramine (a tricyclic antidepresseant with dual noradrenergic and antimuscarinic effects); and 2) atomoxetine (a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) in combination with oxybutynin (an antimuscarnic drug). Aim 2 will test the effectiveness of eszopiclone or tiagabine at raising the respiratory arousal threshold. Eszopiclone is a non-benzodiazepine sedative that produces less pharyngeal hypotonia than older sedatives, and tiagabine is and anticonvulsant that induces slow wave sleep. Slow wave sleep is relatively protected from OSA, pre- sumably because it is associated with a higher arousal threshold and more active pharyngeal muscles. Finally, Aim 3 will combine a pharyngeal stimulating drug from Aim 1 with a sedative from Aim 2 to treat OSA in pa- tients with a low arousal threshold and non-severe anatomical compromise (approximately 1/3 of OSA pa- tients). The long term goal is to improve compliance, quality of life, and health outcomes in patients with OSA. This grant is a major first step in achieving this goal and could potentially change the way OSA is managed for many patients."
"9311212","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects approximately 26 million people in the United States. It is estimated that 16%-56% of these people have bronchiectasis (pathologic dilation of the airways). The presence of bronchiectasis in COPD has been linked to longer hospital stays, prolonged recovery from exacerbations, and increased mortality. The visual assessment of bronchiectasis on high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans is the standard diagnostic method. In this investigation the visual assessment will be used to further develop, validate, refine, and apply an automated imaging tool to objectively assess the burden of bronchiectasis in smokers using baseline and follow-up chest CT scans from the COPDGene Study (a large cohort of smokers with and without COPD). In Aim 1, we will perform a visual scoring and marking of bronchiectasis on a subset of baseline and 5-yr follow- up CT scans. We will then assess the associations between baseline bronchiectasis and acute respiratory disease episodes, health-related quality of life, and death. In aim 2, we will perform point-based (at a single slice) objective measurements of bronchial dilation and airway morphology in bronchiectatic and non- bronchiectatic airway sections labeled for Aim 1 to identify CT features that distinguish bronchiectasis. We will build receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves to determine the predictive ability of these objective measurements to detect bronchiectasis. Finally, in Aim 3 we will fully develop, validate, and refine an automated imaging tool with the features found to be discriminatory to detect bronchiectasis in Aims 1 and 2. We will then determine the burden of bronchiectasis using this tool on all baseline and follow-up CT scans (estimated N= 16,300) and assess its association with clinically relevant disease outcomes including acute respiratory disease episodes, quality of life, and mortality. We will also use ROC analysis as well as the integrated discrimination index (IDI) and net reclassification index (NRI) measures to assess the contribution of our imaging tool to predict those outcomes."
"9359991","Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are potentially important and modifiable social determinants of adolescent HIV risk. While the relationship between ACE and sexual health has been documented in the US other high-income contexts with concentrated epidemics, evidence from lower-income high-HIV prevalence contexts is largely missing. Moreover, no study has considered how adversities cluster and compound across the life course, interact across ecological levels, and contribute to a common causal chain culminating in HIV infection. The proposed project will create an adolescent cohort that has been traced since birth by building on exceptional existing data provided by parents in the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH; established in 1998). We propose collecting two new rounds of prospective data directly from the MLSFH children as they reach adolescence; in doing so, we will establish a cohort that is currently entering a critical age-range for HIV risk as they transition to adulthood. The aims are: Aim 1. To describe the prevalence, co-occurrence and re-occurrence of Adverse Childhood Experiences among adolescents in a HIV-endemic low-income country. We will construct indicators of ACE covering the period from infancy to adolescence by linking 1) rich data captured through parental reporting in prior MLSFH waves and 2) new data collected from adolescents (at age 11-15 and at 14-18) using the Adverse Childhood Experiences ? International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) recently developed by the WHO. Aim 2. To estimate the causal impact of ACE on the emergence of differentiated HIV risk trajectories during adolescence. By applying sophisticated statistical methods, we will be able to examine the causal role of early and ongoing adversities on the emergence of HIV risk, including 1) poor transitions to adulthood 2) behavioral risk and 3) HIV and HSV2 incidence. Aim 3. To highlight potential intervention points by identifying causal mediators between ACE and HIV risk. We focus on social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that may result from frequent or chronic activation of the stress response and may also contribute to social or behavioral HIV risk. Aim 4: To identify protective factors that moderate the impact of ACE on HIV risk. We will test potential multi-level sources of resilience (e.g., family resources, peer support, government programs) that may determine how children cope could be enhanced through intervention. A rigorous evaluation of the consequences, mediators, and moderators of childhood adversity on adolescent HIV risk will greatly enhance current HIV prevention strategies in low income countries by explaining why some adolescents engage in high risk behaviors and contract HIV while others do not, and by identifying modifiable targets for intervention. By integrating the project into an ongoing longitudinal study, we rapidly create a birth cohort, facilitate causal inference, ensure timely findings, and add value to an existing, widely-used resource for research on HIV and health in sub-Saharan Africa."
"9293288","Abstract Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder affecting thousands in the United States and worldwide. Loss of function mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride ion channel, results in abnormal maintenance of airway surface liquid and loss of mucociliary clearance. CF patients suffer from chronic bacterial infection in the lung with limited therapeutic recourse. Staphylococcus aureus is an important Gram-positive organism in the context of CF. With the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), this bacterium will likely play a greater role in CF pathogenesis in the near future. MRSA colonization is associated with greater declines in lung function in CF and may influenza polymicrobial infections often found in this disease. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated an important role for Type 17 immunity in regulating S. aureus host defense. Type 17 cytokines, IL-17 and IL-22, stimulate antimicrobial peptide production by epithelial cells that are critical to S. aureus clearance. At this time, it is unclear if Type 17 or related antimicrobial responses are aberrant in the context of CF. Further, preceding viral infection increases susceptibility to S. aureus infection by suppressing anti-bacterial Type 17 immunity. Viral exacerbation in CF is associated with acquisition of bacterial infection. For these reasons we propose that CFTR deficient epithelial cells display attenuated responses to Type 17 cytokines resulting in worsened S. aureus infection and that influenza co-infection exacerbates S. aureus carriage. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims. First, we will investigate S. aureus biofilm growth on human airway epithelial cells from CF and control patients and the impact of Type 17 cytokines on colonization. Second, we will characterize the Type 17 immune response during nasal S. aureus infection in a murine nasal epithelial model of CF and examine how influenza affects S. aureus carriage. The proposed studies will examine the Type 17 immune response during S. aureus infection and how influenza co-infection affects S. aureus growth in CF. These studies will help clarify host-pathogen interactions in CF and characterize the relationship between two important respiratory pathogens that contribute to a decline in lung function in CF patients."
"9502001","Gonadal aging plays a distinct role in mediating some of the biological changes ascribed to the aging  process. An example of this is the accelerated bone loss due to ovarian failure at the time of the menopause,  which can be effectively mitigated with restoration of estrogens until other non-gonadal aging factors trigger  a decline. Because it is difficult to isolate the consequences of gonadal aging from chronologic aging, it is not  clear to what extent the loss of gonadal function increases risk for age-related diseases other than  osteoporosis. There is compelling evidence from studies of female and male animals that the loss of gonadal  function causes a dramatic decline of 30% to 80% in spontaneous physical activity. In females, but not  males, this leads to accelerated weight gain, a marked increase in abdominal fat, and metabolic dysfunction.  One prospective study of women followed through the menopausal transition suggests that physical activity  and the maintenance of energy balance are also regulated by gonadal function in humans. In this context,  the primary goal of the UCAMC SCOR clinical project is to use a controlled intervention approach to  determine whether the suppression of ovarian function in women approaching the menopause causes a  marked decline in physical activity. Additional goals are to assess changes in other components of energy  expenditure, determine whether the disruption of energy balance is associated with changes in biomarkers of  disease risk, and determine whether programmed exercise can prevent these changes. To achieve these  aims, 66 women aged 45 to 50 years with normal menstrual cycle function will be randomized to receive 6  months of placebo, gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHAc), or GnRHAG+exercise intervention.  The primary outcome will be physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), calculated from total daily energy  expediture (TEE; by doubly-labeled water) with adjustment for the thermic effect of food and resting EE  (REE; by indirect calorimetry). The global hypothesis is that the suppression of ovarian function with GnRHAG  in women will cause a decrease in TEE due to decreased PAEE and, possibly, a decrease in REE."
"9313019","PROJECT ABSTRACT The research component of the Southwest Hub will identify effective, feasible and sustainable interventions to prevent suicide and promote resilience among American Indian (AI) youth building on 20+ years of partnership between the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health (CAIH), the White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) and Navajo Nation (NN). The foundation of these partnerships is tribally-mandated surveillance for early identification, and follow-up and case management to connect at-risk youth to treatment after a recent suicide attempt, ideation or binge substance use episode. In addition, we have been designing and piloting brief interventions informed by local tribal data. Two such interventions were selected to be evaluated in sequence by our Suicide Prevention Study. Both employ Native paraprofessionals as a means of task-shifting much-needed psychoeducation and promoting continuity of care in under-resourced communities. The first intervention, New Hope (NH), is an evidence-based first-stage strategy delivered by paraprofessional community mental health workers (CMHWs) focused on reducing immediate suicide risk through safety planning, emotion regulation skills, and facilitated care connections. The second, the Elder?s Resilience (ER) intervention, is a longer-term strategy delivered by Elders with support from CMHWs to promote resilience by increasing youth?s connectedness, self-esteem and cultural identity and values. Our Primary Aim is: to use a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design to evaluate which of four sequences of New Hope (NH), Elders Resilience (ER) and Case Management (CM) has the greater effect on immediate and longer-term suicidal ideation (primary outcome) and resilience (secondary outcome) among AI adolescents ages 10-24 identified at risk for suicide. We hypothesize that: a) New Hope vs. Case Management alone will significantly reduce participant suicidal ideation; b) Elders Resilience vs. Case Management alone will significantly improve participant resilience; c) New Hope followed by Elders Resilience will have the strongest effects on suicidal ideation and resilience; and d) Case Management alone will have the weakest effects of all combinations. Our Secondary Aims are: 1) to examine mediators and moderators of treatment effectiveness and sequencing in order to determine which types and sequence of interventions is best suited for which youth; and 2) to assess the acceptability, feasibility and capacity for sustainability of the Hub?s key intervention components with core and satellite partners, the Navajo, San Carlos Apache, Hualapai, and Cherokee nations. Due to heterogeneity of suicide risk factors generally and among AIAN youth, not all youth require the same type of interventions. Generating evidence for what works, when it works and for whom is even more paramount to AI suicide prevention efforts, where rates are currently high and resources are limited."
"9354274","OVERALL ? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Age related diseases causing dementia are an increasing global, social and economic catastrophe that mandates broad and aggressive research. Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects over 5 million people in the US alone. Vascular contributions to dementia and AD are increasingly recognized. However, the role of the cerebrovascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD, and the underlying neurovascular mechanisms remain, to date, largely unknown and under- researched, representing a critical barrier in the field. The overall goals of this program are to advance current knowledge on the vascular contributions to dementia and AD, and establish whether the neurovasculature plays a major role in cognitive decline, and therefore is a key new therapeutic target to treat dementia and AD. This is a program project application with multiple projects, cores, institutions and investigators. It represents an integrated whole far greater than the sum of its parts. Each project and core complements the others so that a synergistic relationship among them is achieved with a common focus on goals of the program, namely to test the neurovascular hypothesis of AD. This hypothesis holds that cerebrovascular dysfunction and disruption in the neurovascular integrity underlies and contributes to the onset and progression of cognitive decline. We have enlisted established clinical and translational research groups that collectively bring significant expertise in all aspects of the research plan and each have contributed productively over many years to the study of dementia and AD. To test the ?neurovascular hypothesis?, the participating investigators will apply cutting-edge molecular and imaging methods. We will perform parallel studies with analogous measures in humans and rats in two AD genetic risk groups with the major genetic risk factors for late-onset AD, i.e., apolipoprotein E-?4 (APOE4) gene and early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), i.e., presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations that both develop early vascular dysfunction and significant cerebrovascular pathology, and in the rat model of AD (line TgF344-AD) that faithfully recapitulates the rich clinico-pathological spectrum of human AD including the presence of early vascular dysfunction and cerebrovascular pathology. Central to our approach is our commitment to take a new research direction with the overarching goal to provide an answer to the broader question; ?what is the role of the vascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD?, and ?what is the prognostic and diagnostic value of neurovascular molecular and imaging biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline?. The relationship between neurovascular integrity, brain connectivity and cognitive function has not been explored. The collective expertise of the investigators, overall environment, preliminary results, and experimental design for each of the projects and supporting cores hold tremendous promise for the success of this program. We are confident that the proposed studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of pathogenesis, treatment, and early prevention of dementia and AD."
"9315187","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary nephrotic syndrome is the dominant cause of acquired kidney disease in children, with significant morbidity and mortality from the disease and its treatment, and a substantial risk of kidney failure. Yet, there is limited information on te natural history of primary glomerular disease in children, risk factors for poor outcomes and differential response to therapy. There is clearly a need for better therapies given the side effects and limited response to current therapies. Our long-term goal is to define specific molecular pathways that mediate cell injury in order to develop more targeted, effective, and less toxic therapies for glomerular disease. The overall objective of this proposal is to successfully recruit 600 children with four glomerular diseases (Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome [MCD], Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis [FSGS], IgA Nephropathy [IgAN], and Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy[IMN]) into a longitudinal cohort study that will include integrated proteomic and metabolic analyses of highly phenotyped biological samples to identify predictive biomarkers for pediatric glomerular disease. Our central hypothesis is that integrated proteomic and metabolic analyses from clinically phenotyped sequential biological samples will identify novel biomarkers that can predict both clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses for pediatric glomelular disease, and identify molecular targets for future therapies. Thus, the rationale for this proposal is that recruitment and clinical phenotyping of a very large cohort of children with glomerular disease, combined with innovative pilot studies integrating proteomic and metabolomic analyses from sequential biological samples, will identify novel biomarkers that can predict both clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses, as well as identify molecular targets for future therapies. To test our central hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To successfully recruit 600 children with MCNS, FSGS, IgAN, and IMN into a longitudinal cohort study that includes sequential detailed clinical phenotyping, combined with standardized collection, processing, and storage of serum, plasma and urine samples. 2) To define protocols that integrate proteomic and metabolic analyses of highly phenotyped biological samples in order to identify biomarkers able to predict clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses for pediatric glomerular disease. Metabolomics and proteomics will identify biomarkers that provide information on disease prognosis and predicted response to therapy, which will support the design and implementation of clinical trials. Biomarker identification will guide the development of more targeted, effective, and less toxic therapies for one of the most common kidney diseases in the US."
"9257446","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This indicated prevention intervention trial employs a randomized controlled design to examine the efficacy of a 15-session, culturally tailored, cognitive-behavioral group prevention intervention for urban, low income African American adolescents. The PI successfully adapted the Coping with Stress Course (Clarke et al., 1995) to be culturally sensitive and appropriate for use with urban, low-income African American adolescents. This culturally-adapted intervention (i.e., the Adapted-Coping with Stress Course [Robinson & Case, 2003]) will be significantly revised to enhance individual competencies believed to mitigate the risk for self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and inter-personal aggression. n addition, the proposed study aims to examine how neighborhood and family ecological characteristics moderate the effects of a culturally-adapted, cognitive-behavioral coping with stress prevention intervention on African American adolescents' self-directed (i.e., suicidality) and interpersonal aggression.  This study is expected to have broad public health implications toward the reduction of African American youth health disparities and inform practice and policy on the development of effective violence prevention interventions for African American youth. It is expected that this study will inform a future large scale effectiveness study that will embed an evidence-based, culturally sensitive violence prevention intervention within a large urban school system."

Core B will also manage bacterial clones for in situ hybridization and viral vectors, and produce new/modified DNA construct as technology evolves. Core B is designed to optimize efficacy, accuracy and expertise. The Core will manage large, shared mouse colonies to ensure a reliable and efficient supply of accurately genotyped mice for each Project. The Core also will centralize the performance of complex molecular techniques such as in situ hybridization histochemistry and bacterial culture so researchers in the Projects can focus on the science instead of debugging techniques. Our years of experience with these methods maximizes the likelihood that the complicated molecular techniques proposed in this PPG will succeed."
"9355627","Abstract In this application we are proposing to examine the mechanistic basis of how the non-pathogenic bacteria, Oxalobacter formigenes (Oxf), promotes intestinal elimination of oxalate leading to the beneficial effect of normalizing both plasma and urinary oxalate in an otherwise hyperoxalemic and hyperoxaluric animal model of the human genetic disease of Primary Hyperoxaluria, type 1 (PH1). In the genetic disease of PH1, an increased endogenous production of oxalate, due to a deficiency of the liver enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), results in hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate kidney stone formation in addition to tissue deposition of oxalate (oxalosis), renal failure and death unless early aggressive clinical management is instigated. Unfortunately, the only known cure for PH1 is a liver or liver-kidney transplant. Thus, the potential impact of this probiotic/therapeutic approach may be highly clinically significant and could also extend to a much larger population of idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers who comprise ~12% of Americans, individuals with Enteric Hyperoxaluria, and an emerging population of hyperoxaluric patients who have undergone bariatric surgery and develop kidney stone disease. Numerous key pieces of information that emerged from our studies of intestinal oxalate transport in rats and mice have provided the direction for the studies proposed here. First, we have consistently shown that both a wild rat and a human strain of Oxf can colonize the entire mouse intestine for varying periods of time where it induces segment-specific oxalate secretion/excretion in both the small and large intestine. Second, results from our earlier studies in rats indicate that Oxf potentially elaborates a soluble compound/secretagogue that promotes enteric oxalate elimination correlating with a reduced renal excretion of oxalate. Third, our studies examining the role of the two major apical oxalate transporters in the Slc26a gene family appear to indicate that neither one of these is required for Oxf-induced enteric oxalate elimination. These unexpected latter results suggest we should now focus on the major basolateral pathway which is the first rate-limiting step in moving oxalate from the blood across the intestinal wall and into the lumen. In this regard, we will focus on SAT1 (Sulfate Anion Transporter 1, Slc26a1) in addition to a prominent basolateral sodium/potassium/2 chloride transporter, NKCC1. Recently, we acquired compelling new evidence that NKCC1 may be either directly or indirectly involved with translocation of oxalate across the basolateral membrane. Thus, in Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that the Oxf-induced enteric elimination of oxalate necessarily requires the functional presence of SAT1 and/or NKCC1 in the setting of PH1 as well as in healthy control mice. We will directly measure bi-directional oxalate movements across various intestinal segments removed from mice that are colonized compared to non-colonized mice. In parallel with these studies on the native living tissues, we will directly determine whether oxalate is a substrate for NKCC1 by expressing NKCC1 in Xenopus oocytes and measuring oxalate transport rates. Aim #2 is focused on identifying the compound/secretagogue produced by Oxf that promotes enteric elimination of oxalate by using the emerging metabolomics technologies. The plan will include an analysis of the mucosal metabolome in order to reveal segment-specific tissue responses to colonization by Oxf. Combined with the metabolomics studies of Oxf, tissue-specific metabolomics should reveal novel mechanistic information about the bacteria?host physiological interaction and possible bi- directional signaling pathways between Oxf and specific intestinal segments. The results from these studies should reveal a novel direction leading to the development of a probiotic system based upon bacteria/bacterial products/supplements that promote both enteric oxalate excretion and intestinal oxalate degradation thereby normalizing urinary oxalate excretion in potentially numerous patient populations."
"9376465","ABSTRACT  A central mandate to realize effective gene therapy is the ability to accomplish cell specific delivery. Capitalizing on the in vivo delivery efficacy of adenoviral vectors (Ad), recent studies have highlighted the capacity of targeted Ad to accomplish cell selectivity in this stringent delivery context. Systemic employment of Ad for gene delivery, however, is currently limited by vector particle sequestration in the liver. Recent work in several laboratories, however, has identified the biologic dictates of vector hepatotropism. Based on this understanding, it has now been possible to un-target the liver thereby facilitating strategies designed to achieve cell specific gene delivery in the context of systemic vector administration. Of note, we have recently shown that such liver un-targeting strategies can synergize with described vector targeting methods such as those based upon restricting delivered transgene expression to target cells with a tissue/tumor selective promoter (transcriptional targeting). The dramatic synergistic specificity gains noted with combination of these two approaches logically suggests that further gains may accrue additional targeting methods exploited in combination. In this regard, strategies have been proposed to target Ad based upon re-directing vector binding to target cell specific cell surface markers. Such transductional targeting methods would offer potential synergies with the targeting methods we note above. Such an endeavor has been limited to this point by the inability of current vector engineering to achieve capsid incorporation of antibody targeting species. Herein we seek to address this key limit. First, we have developed a method to replace the native adenovirus fiber with a substitute chimera devoid of the native fiber's knob binding domain. This maneuver eliminates native tropism and allows for the incorporation of a wider range of large/complex candidate targeting ligands. Second, we have demonstrated that the single domain antibody species derived from camelids (sdAb) possess the unique attributes allowing biologic compatibility with adenovirus capsid synthesis and assembly. In the aggregate, these two technologies now allow for the functional incorporation of antibody targeting species into the Ad capsid for the achievement of cell-specific targeting. This additional level of targeting provides for potential synergies with the defined liver un-targeting and transcriptional vector targeting methods we have explored."
"9355243","Cognitive impairment and dementia are common and disabling problems in patients with neurodegenerations characterized by intraneuronal ?-synuclein (?-Syn) aggregates. These patients are classified clinically as either Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD) or as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). This labeling distinction is based on the order of presentation of parkinsonism versus dementia ? in PDD, the movement disorder occurs first, while in DLB, the cognitive impairment occurs first or within 1-year of parkinsonism onset. PDD and DLB exhibit virtually identical pathological findings at autopsy. Abnormalities found include pathological depositions of ?-Syn, A?-amyloid, and tau proteins, the latter as intraneuronal paired helical filaments or ?neurofibrillary tangles? (NFT). In individual brains, ?-Syn alone may be present in cell bodies (Lewy bodies) or in synaptic terminals (Lewy neurites). In other brains, ?-Syn deposits are present together with A?-amyloid plaques. In still other brains, ?-Syn, A?-amyloid and tau NFT pathologies are all present, often diagnosed neuropathologically as Alzheimer disease (AD) with PD. The neuropathologic findings do not, however, correlate substantially with subject clinical classification as PDD versus DLB. The future development of effective therapy for dementia in ?-synucleinopathy will likely require targeting of the pathologic pathways involved, and this in turn, necessitates ability to determine the type(s) of pathology present in individual patients and assessment of which pathologies most strongly drive progression of cognitive impairments. To be effective in disease modification, therapies will require testing and application in patients with only mild symptoms. In the present proposal, we will determine endophenotypes of mild dementia in patients with ?-synucleinopathy, employing multi-tracer molecular brain imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). We will determine the presence of ?- Syn neuropathology on the basis of [11C]dihydroteterabenazine (DTBZ) PET imaging of nigrostriatal projection integrity. We will identify the presence of A?-amyloid plaque deposition with [11C]Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET imaging, and the presence of tau NFT pathology with [18F]AV1451 (formerly designated T807) PET imaging. Together, these imaging results will permit classification of each subject as: ?pure? synucleinopathy, or synucleinopathy with A?-amyloid, or as synucleinopathy with both A?-amyloid and tau. We will test the hypothesis that the progression of cognitive decline will be more rapid in the synucleinopathy with both A?-amyloid and tau endophenotype, and that the progression of cognitive impairment in subjects with this endophenotype will correlate with the progression of NFT pathology as determined in follow-up [18F]AV1451-PET. The development of reliable trait biomarkers of neurodegenerative pathologies in PDD and DLB will enable progress in the development and assessment of new therapeutic interventions desperately needed in these syndromes."
"9282813","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Inherited retinal degenerations (IRD) are the leading cause of irreversible blindness in young adults in the United States. The genetic basis of recessive IRD is known only in about 50% of cases. Furthermore, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying these diseases. Cures are currently unavailable for these diseases. However, gene therapy clinical trials for Leber's congenital amaurosis have been reported to be successful and gene-based pre-clinical studies of IRD treatments were found to be effective. Nevertheless, the lack of information on the underlying cause of IRD in the remaining half of cases and the paucity of knowledge on the pathways leading to these diseases impedes the development of therapies to treat these conditions. Until recently, the search for the genetic cause of IRD was limited to the coding region comprising 3% of the genome leaving the remaining 97% unexplored. In addition, prioritization and interpretation of candidate variants has been challenging due to the lack of efficient methodologies. In this proposal we aim to identify the genetic cause of disease in the remaining 50% of cases and understand the pathways involved in causing IRD. To achieve our goals, we will build on the opportunity we have to sequence the whole genomes (WGS) of 500 individuals from IRD pedigrees and the exome sequences (WES) generated on 54 pedigrees in the previous grant cycle, representing 230 unrelated pedigrees/patients. We propose to analyze the WGS and WES to identify the novel genes and associated pathways leading to IRD pathology by: (1) identifying putative candidate variants in both coding and non-coding regions, (2) using computational analysis that integrates existing data; publicly available genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes and other large data sets relevant to IRD; and experimental data including the molecular expression profiles of relevant retinal cells differentiated from patient induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and (3) performing molecular and biochemical analyses of putative causal variants using patient iPSC based disease-in-dish models and CRISPR-Cas9 system based genome edited mouse models. These studies will provide a molecular profile of the IRD genome, identify novel genes involved in causing IRD, enhance our understanding of the biological pathways leading to retinal degeneration, and establish a molecular-network based approach for finding causal variants in patients with IRD.

"9321421","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The North Texas Hepatitis B Consortium (NTHBC) comprises two medical institutions, and three distinct practice locations in the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex. NTHBC has participated fully in the first 7-year grant cycle, with the third highest enrollment among the 13 participating sites, good retention and ongoing participation in the Immune Active and Immune Tolerant clinical therapy trials. Drs. Perrillo and Lee have served on a variety of committees and proposed a number of ancillary studies, some of which are already under way. One of the goals of HBRN is to better define the varied immunologic presentations of chronic infection. Along these lines, the NTHBC proposes an ancillary study of a currently poorly explored sub-phenotype, that of concurrent hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HBs. Herein, we review what is currently known about this anomalous group of patients, and seek to compare this group with others such as patients in a parallel network, the Acute Liver Failure Study Group, that is overseen by Dr. Lee. Prior studies in hepatitis B related acute liver failure (HBVALF) suggest that more than 50% of ALF patients are concurrently HBsAg and anti-HBs positive. Data from HBRN suggest that at least 6% of chronic hepatitis B subjects display this dual serologic status but appear to lack very active liver disease. One explanation might be that concurrent positivity results from infection with different subtypes but this is not substantiated y data suggesting common epitopes across all HBsAg genotypes and serotypes. The current study aims to explore the phenotype further, correlating it with clinical disease features, length of infection and time to subsequent HBsAg clearance and disease evolution over time. Understanding this phenotype better will lay the groundwork for molecular sequencing studies to better understand the mutation profile of the concurrently positive patients as compared to those with HBV ALF (typically more frequent mutations) and those with chronic hepatitis B without concurrence. These analyses are likely to offer new and important insights into HBV-specific immunological paralysis that leads to chronic infection, yielding new strategies for viral clearance."
"9348653","Abstract Despite advances in surgery, chemo- and radiation-therapy, patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have a grim prognosis with less than 10% of patients surviving more than 5 years. Recent studies have shown potential of T and B-cell responses against GBM. However, existing technologies fail to elicit robust levels of anti-GBM immune responses with therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, there is a critical need for an alternative and effective strategy that can achieve strong T and B-cell responses against GBM. Our long-term research goal is to characterize the structure/function relationship governing immune activation with biomaterials. Our objective in this application is to understand how physicochemical properties of biomaterial-based vaccine platforms impact materials interactions with lymphoid tissues, with particular emphasis on (i) in vivo antigen (Ag) accumulation in lymph nodes, (ii) Ag presentation by antigen-presenting cells, and (iii) induction of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) and antibody (Ab) responses against GBM. To that end, we have developed a novel lipid-based system, called interbilayer-crosslinked multilamellar vesicles (ICMVs). We show that ICMVs (1) efficiently transport Ag to local draining lymph nodes, (2) promote Ag presentation by antigen-presenting cells, (3) generate stronger CTL responses than other conventional adjuvants, including CpG in water-in-oil adjuvant, Montanide (arguably one of the strongest CTL adjuvant systems in clinical trials), and (4) exert potent therapeutic efficacy in murine tumor models, including intracranial GBM. Here, we will synthesize a series of new ICMVs with varying materials properties and determine the effects of biomaterials on immune activation and induction of CTL and Ab responses. We will evaluate their therapeutic efficacy in murine models of transplantable GBM as well as genetically induced GBM. We will also assess our strategy in combination with therapies designed to stimulate immune functions within GBM. Overall, these studies will improve our understanding of the biology-materials interfaces and may lead to new design principles for biomaterials engineered to elicit robust levels of immune responses, delay tumor growth, and prevent relapse. More broadly, the work proposed will address current technical limitations in vaccine technologies and potentially lead to a new treatment option for GBM patients."
"9279268","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in three older adults may experience insomnia. Older adults are the most frequent users of hypnotic medications. Although safer, use of even the latest sleeping pills can lead to cognitive impairment and risk of falls. Thus, it isnot surprising that non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia have been pursued as alternatives to medications, with some suggesting they should be the first line of therapy. We propose a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the relative efficacy and effectiveness of specific components of CBT-I: sleep restriction (SR) and cognitive therapy (CT) in comparison to combined SR and CT (SR+CT). We hypothesize that because the proposed mechanisms of action of CT versus SR substantially differ, their combination may have additive effects. Even though the mechanisms of action of SR and CT may differ, no data exists to document that the addition of one to the other provides more overall clinical benefit than either intervention alone. Finally, to better understand how and in whom SR and CT work, we plan to formally evaluate selected mediators and moderators of the clinical effect including cognitive and physiological measures of anxiety and arousal. Three treatments (SR, CT, and SR+CT) will be compared in a randomized clinical trial with a parallel groups design. Efficacy and effectiveness data will be collected prior to the beginning of treatment, after six weeks of treatment, and at the end of a six-month follow-up. This five-year application will ultimately include 150 subjects (three groups of 50 each) who are at least 60 years of age. Data will include a sleep log, polysomnography, mediator and moderator measures, and quality of life measures on all subjects in each group. These efforts follow the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan Strategy 3.1 to develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies, in this case, to promote a new intervention trial that focuses on the mediators and moderators of treatment response."

"9395464","Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders."
"9317546","The role of mTORC2 in cancer cell metabolism PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. Mutations in growth factor receptor signaling pathways promote tumor growth by altering the uptake and utilization of nutrients. De novo synthesis of lipids is a critical aspect of this process, providing necessary lipids for membrane biogenesis and signal transduction. Currently, there is a major gap in our knowledge about how oncogenic signaling regulates the synthesis of specific lipids to cause tumor growth, and by what mechanisms. this RO1 grant (NS 73831), we have demonstrated that Through studies supported by the first five years of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC2), a critical mediator of growth factor receptor signaling, reprograms tumor cellular metabolism, potently stimulating the growth of the highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) and causing resistance to almost all current treatments. Specifically, our preliminary studies indicate that mTORC2 drives nutrient flux into lipogenic pathways and boosts the synthesis of specific lipids to drive tumor growth by regulating the levels and/or activities of key rate limiting enzymes. These data reveal a landscape of new, potentially druggable targets. However, before these mechanisms can be applied to inform the development of new therapies, a number of urgent questions must be answered. How does mTORC2 regulate GBM nutrient uptake and utilization and shift it towards the synthesis of specific lipids in cancer? What are the signaling, biochemical and transcriptional mechanisms and how do they drive tumor growth and drug resistance? Are they druggable? This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that mTORC2 promotes GBM growth and drug resistance by driving lipogenesis and remodeling the composition of specific signaling lipids. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms most critical for breaking down a major barrier to developing more effective treatments. In aim 1, we propose a set of experiments that will extend our metabolic analyses into patient-derived GBMs in vivo, to determine how mTORC2 controls the synthesis of specific phospholipids and sphingolipids to drive GBM growth and drug resistance, and to identify the signaling, biochemical and transcriptional mechanisms by which mTORC2 controls the key enzymes that regulate this process. In aim 2, we will determine how mTORC2 controls the uptake and utilization of nutrients towards the synthesis of these specific lipids. In aim 3, we will identify and develop CNS-penetrant small molecules that target mTORC2-dependent metabolic reprogramming and evaluate their therapeutic potential. The proposed studies will generate a deeper understanding of the role of mTORC2 in cancer cell metabolism and will generate a landscape of previously unappreciated metabolic vulnerabilities that can be targeted by brain penetrant compounds, potentially leading to better GBM treatments"

In addition, the program supports highly innovative research of more established investigators who are not currently working in the GI field but are interested in applying their expertise to GI studies (Type 2), and to established GI investigators who aim to develop new areas of GI research (Type 3). The P/F awards provide one year of support for projects that aim to generate additional preliminary data necessary for full-size grant applications, usually to the NIH (the R01 mechanism) as well as other funding agencies. Applications from new and established investigators that test novel concepts, utilize innovative experimental systems or propose to carry the GI research at the interface of different disciplines are also supported, especially if the work is relevant to the larger Core Center Research Base. In addition to financial assistance, the P/F program offers mentoring and guidance to recently appointed young investigators, as well as opportunity to showcase their research and test their ideas. Identification of P/F projects for funding follows a 5-step process including advertising, internal review for eligibility, evaluation of scientific merit by an independent External Scientific Advisory Committee, final selection, and feedback to all applicants. The plans include regular evaluations of research progress and dissemination of the P/F results. The success of the P/F program is measured by research productivity, presentation of data at local and national meetings, publications, submission of applications for funding and ability to aquire such funds for further research. In the three years since our Core Center was funded, 11 completed P/F projects have led to 15 publications, 13 extramural grant applications, 4 grants funded as PI and 3 as co-investigator producing a return of investment of 8.7X (investment $275,000; funded grants $2,400,000)."
"9407079","It is estimated that >50% of HIV-infected Kenyans are unaware of their status and men are significantly less likely to test and link to care than women. Unless more attention is focused on men, Kenya and other sub- Saharan African countries with high HIV prevalence will not achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals by 2020. This proposal addresses low uptake of HIV testing and poor linkage to care and treatment services among men in sub-Saharan Africa. The overarching goal is to demonstrate using implementation science methods that assisted partner services (aPS) is a safe and effective strategy to increase the proportion of men living with HIV who know their serostatus and that aPS will improve male engagement in HIV treatment programs. The study will be based in two counties in Kenya with the highest HIV prevalence in the nation: Homa Bay (27% prevalence) and Kisumu (18.7% prevalence) and be conducted by an experienced and collaborative team with an exceptionally strong track record in HIV partner testing research and implementation science in Kenya. Principal Investigator Carey Farquhar (University of Washington [UW]) will work closely with a multidisciplinary group of investigators and consultants from UW, PATH, Kenya's Ministry of Health, and the National AIDS and STI Control Program (NASCOP), and build on a successful randomized clinical trial of assisted partner services (aPS) conducted by UW and NASCOP from 2012-2015. The proposed research also leverages PATH's vast experience providing HIV testing and treatment in government facilities through the APHIAplus program, as well as PATH's recent mapping of >21,000 adolescent girls and young women for services as part of the DREAMS initiative in western Kenya. The specific aims are as follows: ? AIM 1: Determine aPS effectiveness by demonstrating that aPS improves HIV testing, identifies new HIV  infections, and promotes linkage, treatment and viral suppression among male partners when implemented  among women and adolescent girls in government facilities in Kenya. ? AIM 2: Evaluate fidelity, feasibility, and cost/cost-effectiveness when implementing aPS at 38 APHIAplus  facilities and 9 ?safe spaces? established by the DREAMS initiative in western Kenya. Using a mixed  methods approach in this real-world setting, we will obtain data critical to national and regional scale-up. For Aim 1, we will offer aPS to more than 8,000 HIV-infected adolescent girls and women and all of their male partners; if a male partner is HIV-infected aPS will also be offered to his female partners. For Aim 2, we will use quantitative and qualitative methods to collect and evaluate data from a subset of facilities that are high and low performers, determine ?necessary? elements of aPS at the level of implementation, and conduct a feasibility study, including analyses of acceptability, integration, demand, technical efficiency and cost data. In this way, the UW/PATH/MOH team will work towards building capacity in Kenya to effectively implement and sustain a model aPS program that could be replicated across sub-Saharan Africa.    "
"9380043","PROJECT SUMMARY Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) affect young and old males and females and are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Findings over recent years suggest that an aberrant activity of or signaling through transforming growth factor-beta (TGF?) plays important roles in TAAs, yet controversy remains regarding the precise mechanisms. This lack of understanding continues to hinder the identification of improved therapeutic approaches as revealed by the recent failure of a highly anticipated clinical trial of losartan, an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist. We and others recently hypothesized that the collection of predisposing genetic mutations suggests that TAAs result from a compromised cellular mechanosensing and mechanoregulation of the extracellular matrix that endows the aortic wall with its structural integrity. Importantly, TGF? can be viewed, in part, as an important mechanotransducer ? its production and activation are mechanosensitive and its downstream gene products include the contractile proteins that are fundamental to sensing and regulating the extracellular matrix that is produced in response to its increased signaling. The goal of our work is to test novel hypotheses on interactions among the structural and instructional roles of altered TGF? signaling, smooth muscle cell mechanosensing of altered wall stresses (particularly those due to hypertension, a primary risk factor for TAAs), and the integrity of fibrillin-1, an essential glycoprotein that associates with elastin to form elastic fibers. Towards this end, we will use a combination of new genetically modified mouse models, in vivo models of induced hypertension, and clinical specimens of TAAs. Specifically, we will characterize responses of smooth muscle cells in the thoracic aorta to increased wall stresses and disrupted fibrillin-1 that depend on TGF? signaling and lead to maladaptive remodeling of the aortic wall. The results of our work will thereby provide the first mechanistic investigation of roles of TGF? signaling in cases of hypertension (a major risk factor for TAAs) and compromised extracellular matrix (fibrillin-1, the cause of the majority of syndromic TAAs) while testing, for the first time, the recently proposed hypothesis that dysfunctional smooth muscle mechanosensing and mechanoregulation of matrix underlies many different causes of TAAs. In particular, we suggest that smooth muscle cells will invoke an atrophic process if they sense stresses lower than homeostatic even in cases wherein the actual stress is normal or higher than normal, which will drive the wall toward aneurysmal development. The characterization of TGF?-dependent mechanoresponses by aortic smooth muscle cells may identify new molecular targets to treat TAAs, a lethal disease and without current pharmacotherapy."

"9315140","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic hepatitis B is a significant public health problem, affecting approximately 400 million people globally. It remains the 10th leading cause of mortality worldwide despite the availability of an effective vaccine. Many viral and host factor have been implicated in disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis, but most of the studies were based on retrospective analyses with limited longitudinal data. Currently, seven agents are FDA-approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Each of these agents was reported to have virological, biochemical and histological benefits for both HBeAg positive and negative disease. However, none of these agents, used as monotherapy, can effectively eradicate HBV. The Harvard Hepatitis B Consortium was selected as one of the Clinical Centers of the NIDDK-sponsored Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN) in North America. We have been working collaboratively with the other 11 clinical centers, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and the Immunology Center within the HBRN in the past 6 years. Over 1800 ethnically diverse patients are being monitored and characterized in the Cohort study. In addition, there are two clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with pegylated interferon and an antiviral agent for the immune tolerant and immune active adult patients. Both trials are actively enrolling patients. To date, the Harvard Hepatitis B Consortium contributed between 8% and 8.5% of the patients in the Cohort study and the Immune Active clinical trial respectively. Naturally occurring HBV variants such as basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) mutations are usually the dominant viral species in HBeAg negative disease. In a recent study based on the HBRN cohort, BCP and PC variants were identified as the dominant species in a surprisingly high prevalence of HBeAg positive patients. In this ancillary study, we propose to utilize the available clinical data and biospecimen repository from the enrolled patients to understand the roles of these HBV variants in the natural history and treatment responses of chronic hepatitis B. Collectively, the long term observation database, the rich biospecimen repository, the ancillary studies and the clinical trial results generated by the HBRN will undoubtedly yield valuable insights into the natural history, immunopathology, pathogenesis and optimal therapy for this important disease."
"9296126","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adipocytes are highly specialized cells that play a major role in energy homeostasis. Obesity affects >30% of the adult population in the United States and is a major risk factor for the development of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2D). Obesity and insulin resistance can be linked to a breakdown in the cellular signaling and gene expression in adipocytes. Significant advances towards understanding metabolic disease states have been made by studying the function of signaling proteins and transcription factors that regulate adipocyte development and the modulation of gene expression in adipose tissue. Our research has focused on STATs (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription), a family of transcription factors whose activity is largely controlled by hormone-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. STAT5A promotes lipid deposition in preadipocytes, yet we have evidence to suggest the role of STAT5 proteins in mature adipocytes is to reduce lipid accumulation and insulin sensitivity. STATs can have cell-specific functions, and we hypothesize that STAT5 proteins in adipocytes contribute to systemic glucose and lipid metabolism and whole body energy expenditure by regulating fat cell glucose and lipid metabolism and adipokine production. Studies from the last funding cycle of this proposal have led us in new directions. We have data to demonstrate that STAT5A can physically associate with several proteins that comprise the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Collectively, our long term objective is to assess the functions of STAT5 proteins in mature adipocytes using in vitro and in vivo approaches and determine the functional relevance of the nuclear association of STAT5A and PDC. The first aim will be to perform metabolic analyses on a novel transgenic mouse with both STAT5 genes deleted specifically in adiponectin-expressing cells to assess the contribution of adipocyte STAT5 proteins to glucose and lipid metabolism. The second aim will be to determine the domains/residues of STAT5A that are required for its association with PDC-E2, and the impact of the STAT5/PDC interaction on modulation of STAT5-target gene expression. We propose that adipocyte STAT5 proteins are important in lipolysis and in the regulation of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. We predict that loss of adipocyte STAT5 will have prominent metabolic effects in vivo including alterations in adipocyte lipolysis and systemic changes in insulin sensitivity."

"9282557","The aging process can be naturally accelerated and decelerated during evolution leading to significant diversity in lifespan among related species. Rodents represent a particularly convenient system to examine this diversity at the molecular level, because these animals are characterized by a ten-fold difference in lifespan and their tissues and cultured cells are readily available. Unbiased characterization of genes and processes that are associated with natural changes in lifespan within rodents may lead to the development of approaches that target the aging process and possibly delay it. We hypothesize that the lifespan of rodents is adjusted through a combination of order-wide and lineage-specific processes and provide preliminary data in support of this possibility. Project 4 will carry out gene expression and ribosome profiling analyses across rodent tissues and fibroblasts to identify and characterize these processes, focusing on DNA repair and metabolic processes known to regulate lifespan or occur in long-lived rodents. This project will further directly examine the functions of several unique protein forms we identified by sequencing the genome and transcriptome of the longest-lived rodent, the naked mole rat. Project 4 will test if these forms result in reduced mutagenesis in mouse cells and test the hypothesis that the naked mole rat telomeres have a high capacity to protect chromosome ends from genome instability. Finally, we will uncover and analyze gene expression and protein synthesis programs that are coordinately regulated in order to adjust rodent lifespan. This information will be integrated to develop a model featuring key processes which are altered globally and in an organ-specific manner as organisms change their lifespan. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Characterization of genes and processes that are associated with natural changes in lifespan may lead to the development of approaches that target the aging process and possibly delay it. Project 4 will carry out gene expression analyses to uncover these processes, focusing on DNA repair and forms occurring in long- lived rodents.

"9402258","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause severe liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are approximately 350 million people in the world that are chronically infected by this virus, resulting in 0.5-1 million deaths every year. Most chronic HBV carriers acquired the virus early in life from their infected mothers through vertical transmission. In contrast, patients who acquired HBV from other adults through horizontal transmission will usually develop self-limited acute infection. Why vertical transmission leads to chronic infection whereas horizontal transmission leads to self-limited acute infection is unclear. HBV has a very narrow host range, which has greatly hampered its research. We have recently developed a mouse model to study the maternal effect on HBV persistence in the offspring. By crossing female hemizygous HBV transgenic mice to male naïve mice, we obtained non-transgenic mouse pups. When these non-transgenic mouse pups were injected with the HBV genomic DNA by hydrodynamic injection, the HBV replication persisted in the mouse liver for up to seven months. This is in contrast to control mice born to non-transgenic mothers, which cleared HBV after 3-4 weeks of HBV DNA injection. Our further studies indicated that the maternal HBV e antigen (HBeAg) could condition the Kupffer cells of the offspring, which would undergo M2 polarization to support HBV persistence upon re-stimulation by HBeAg. The goal of this application is to continue these previous studies to further investigate how HBeAg interacts with Kupffer cells. Specifically, we will determine how HBeAg stimulates Kupffer cells and to identify the putative HBeAg receptor in these cells. We will also determine whether HBeAg by itself is sufficient to condition Kupffer cells of the offspring to support HBV persistence and whether Kupffer cells by themselves are sufficient to support HBV persistence. We will also test the hypothesis that HBeAg conditions Kupffer cells in utero to suppress the immune response to HBV in the offspring. Finally, we will study the HBV basal core promoter mutant, which has reduced expression of HBeAg and is associated with chronic hepatitis and an increased risk for HCC, to test whether this reduction of HBeAg expression leads to the partial loss of immune tolerance. The proposed studies will provide important information for us to understand the mechanism of HBV persistence after vertical transmission and to improve the treatments for chronic HBV patients."

"9322270","This is a comprehensive application to support training in malaria surveillance, epidemiology and implementation science research to strengthen malaria policy and control in Uganda. Although Uganda has dramatically scaled up available malaria control interventions, the burden of malaria is still very high and the optimal strategies to control malaria in this high transmission setting are still unclear. New interventions or new delivery approaches are needed to have sustained impacts on reducing disease burden. Expertise in malaria research remains limited in Uganda, necessitating the need for additional training. In 1998, a collaborative malaria research project was established between Makerere U and the University of California, San Francisco. In 2010, our research program was awarded the East African International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) award whose goal is to perform comprehensive surveillance studies aimed at improving understanding of the disease and measuring the impact of population-level control interventions. This program has increased our already outstanding set of opportunities for research training. To date, our training programs have largely focused on training at master?s level, with few trainees at the doctoral level or in a position to influence policy. Thus, our previous trainings have created a large pool of candidates that are suitable for training at the doctoral level and to lead a new generation of scientists translating research into policy. For Ugandan expertise in malaria control to grow and diversify, we propose to establish a comprehensive research training program at Makerere University School of Medicine focused on strengthening malaria control and policy in Uganda. Our objectives will be to: 1) substantially increase the scientific leadership and expertise needed for independent malaria epidemiology, surveillance and implementation science research, 2) strengthen the capabilities and career development of junior faculty of Makerere U to lead, manage and train students in malaria research by providing post-doctoral mentored research training, 3) strengthen the sustainability of malaria research at Makerere U by strengthening the Makerere U malaria research center, and 4) promote collaborations between the National Malaria Control Program and malaria research programs in Uganda to foster evidence-based decision making. The collaborators on the ICEMR and other research grants provide a pool of faculty that will ensure high-quality supervision and mentoring of trainees. Degree trainees will be registered at Makerere U or London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and non-degree long and short-term training will occur in Uganda and at UCSF. With changing malaria epidemiology in Uganda and potential for sustainable malaria research to policy activities in the country, we are perfectly poised to strengthen the capacity for malaria research and control in Uganda. We anticipate training 4 PhD candidates, 5 candidates in master?s degree programs, 9 candidates in long-term non-degree training and over 100 candidates in short-term non-degree programs."
"9308704","PROJECT SUMMARY Early life perturbations, such as stress, are associated with long-term consequences on the developing brain, increasing subsequent risk of neuropsychiatric disorders that exhibit a sex bias in presentation, including schizophrenia, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. Despite advances in understanding the mechanistic roles of the maternal milieu in normal and pathological brain development, many question remain about how stress during pregnancy result in the development of offspring stress dysregulation, a pervasive symptom in neuropsychiatric disease. Recent studies indicate that maternal gut microbial communities are dynamically remodeled during pregnancy to maintain a continuous supply of nutrients to the developing fetus and prepare the mothers for the energetic demands of lactation. In our established mouse model of early prenatal stress (EPS), our preliminary studies show that newborns exposed to EPS exhibit sex-specific alterations in metabolic profiles related to energy balance and homeostasis, and, based on recent studies, may suggest that maternal changes in microbial-mediated nutrient availability may account for altered metabolite profiles in exposed offspring. Taken together, these results have led us to the hypothesis that brain development is altered by the impact of stress during pregnancy on the maternal gut microbiome and nutrient availability. Using cutting-edge `omics technologies, we aim to identify novel connections between maternal stress, the maternal gut microbiome and metabolism, and sex-specific brain development. The first aim of study will examine whether stress during pregnancy disrupts maternal gut microbiota and nutrient profiles critical for fetal brain development. This aim will utilize time-series profiling of the maternal gut microbiota, maternal peripheral metabolite and nutrient availability, and fetal brain metabolite profiles using combined metagenomics and metabolomics assessment, in addition to computational tools that integrate these datasets. As the effect of prenatal stress reprogramming on the developing brain may not emerge until later in development, the second aim will examine the lasting effect of stress on the maternal gut microbiota composition and nutrient availability on the brain development during the postnatal period. This aim will utilize time-series profiling of maternal gut microbiota, and metabolite profiles of the offspring hypothalamus using combined metagenomics and metabolomics assessment, in addition to computational tools that integrate these datasets. The final aim will determine causality of the maternal gut microbiome on brain development. Following colonization with probiotics during the window of stress exposure, then examine the impact on rescuing maternal gut microbiota composition, maternal nutrient availability, and sex-specific brain metabolite composition. Together, these studies will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which brain development is altered through the effect of stress on the maternal gut microbiome and nutrient availability necessary for normal neurodevelopment."
"9282582","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary cilia dysfunction has been linked to numerous human diseases and genetic disorders, which present with a wide range of clinical features. Primary cilia have been found on the macula densa cells, but its role in the regulation of kidney function is unclear. The macula densa mediates tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) by detecting the increases in NaCl concentration and promoting the release of adenosine or ATP that constricts the afferent arteriole. However, little is known about the role of cilia in the macla densa in the regulation of renal hemodynamics, salt and water excretion. Our preliminary data indicate that elevations in tubular flow in the isolated perfused juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) preparations increase macula densa intracellular calcium concentration, activates nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) and attenuates TGF response. However, the role of the cilia on the macula densa as the flow sensor initiating this response remains to be determined. Normally increases in sodium delivery to the macula densa induce TGF response and constrict the afferent arteriole. However, following volume expansion in response to salt loading, sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule is inhibited resulting in sustained elevations in flow to the macula densa. Under these conditions we propose that the primary cilia are stimulated, raise intracellular calcium and enhance the formation of nitric oxide that inhibits and resets TGF response. The resetting of TGF is an essential modulatory mechanism to allow for the rapid excretion of a salt load by preventing a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We further propose that deletion of the cilia or NOS1 of the macula densa prevents flow modulation of TGF responsiveness and impairs the excretion of a salt load by preventing the rise in GFR following volume expansion, hence promotes the development of salt-sensitive hypertension."
"9332400","Variability in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) clinical manifestation is primarily determined by modifier genes, which are poorly understood. Discovering of the genetic basis of differential vulnerability is critical in predictive and personalized care for patients with HCM and will enabling more comprehensive genetic and genomic screening with an aim to intervene as early as possible and eliminate risk of sudden death. The discovery of modifier genes that contribute to variation and incomplete penetrance of HCM has proven difficult in human cohorts. Large murine genetic reference populations (GRPs) now finally provide a effective solution. The BXD family of strains?currently the largest and best characterized mouse GRP?is made up of 160 highly diverse lines that descend from crosses between C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) parental strains. The BXDs have been bred specifically for systems genetics studies using both classic forward genetic methods and for reverse genetic studies. We have shown that the D2?father of the BXD cross?is an excellent murine HCM model. D2 contains mutations of Mybpc3 and Myh7, the major causal genes of HCM and the key features of human HCM. In contrast, the B6 (mother of the BXDs) has wild type alleles and normal hearts. The objective of our proposal is to identify modifier genes that affect the severity of HCM phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that interactions of modifier and causal genes govern HCM severity and related phenotypes. The research here involves multi-scale genetic, transcriptomic, molecular and cellular profiling of B6, D2, and up to 100 BXDs. This work will be transformative and lead to the identification of strong candidate genes and networks underlying individual differences in HCM phenotypes. Aim 1: Systematically quantify HCM-associated traits and their variability and heritability across 100 BXD genotypes of isogenic mice. The purpose of Aim 1 is to determine the clinical, laboratory and molecular HCM phenotypes in 100 BXD strains, setting the stage for us to explore genetic variation, cofactors, and mechanisms of HCM in Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2: Define genes that modulate the severity of HCM. Building upon the phenotype data generated in Aim 1, as well as the already acquired sequence and transcriptome data for B6 and D2, and BXDs, we will identify strong gene variants that modulate variability of HCM phenotypes using state-of-the-art system genetic strategies and conventional molecular and cellular assays. Aim 3: Test the translational validity of mouse HCM modifier gene candidates. We will justify candidate genes identified in Aim 2 with established HCM human GWAS data. In reciprocal reverse translation, we will evaluate candidate HCM genes from human cohorts and determine whether these variants are associated with HCM-associated traits in BXDs. Combining the top priority gene candidates from both mouse and human HCM studies, we will generate molecular and statistical models of susceptible candidate genes, linked phenotypes, and relevant mechanisms. We will finally validate genes modulating HCM phenotype severity using loss-off function strategy."
"9338330","Summary Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is clinical measure of cerebrovascular function influenced by micro- and macrovascular effects including delay in blood arrival time, delay in tissue reponse, and chronic vasodilation. Individually and simultaneously determing blood flow delay, CVR magnitude and CVR delay using time delay analysis methods we have developed will yield much richer and more specific information about underlying vascular pathology than is currently available. In healthy tissue, vasodilation adjusts vessels' resistance to flow, and modulates cerebral perfusion in response to changing demands for oxygen and nutrients; this ability is reduced or absent in many forms of cerebrovascular pathology. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), and the related quantity cerebrovascular reserve, are measures of brain blood vessels' capacity for vasodilation, which may offer useful clinical information in patients at risk for cerebral ischemia associated with chronic stenosis or occlusion of cerebral blood vessels. Traditional methods of CVR analysis, which correlate a modified schedule of CO2 changes in inhaled gases voxelwise with BOLD fMRI signal, lead to systematic underestimation of CVR magnitude in regions where the response is delayed with respect to the gas administration schedule. We have validated a method to detect and quantify local delays in blood flow arrival, and to derive corrected CVR magnitude maps. Even after the true magnitude of the CVR is known, questions remain regarding whether the delay in CVR is due to delayed arrival of blood in the tissue of interest (upstream pathology), or delayed vasodilation in impaired tissue (local pathology), or a combination of both. Therefore, we propose to use both vasodilatory and nonvasodilatory gas manipulations in combination with near-infrared spectroscopy during fMRI imaging to evaluate each source of delay separately. This proposal capitalizes on the technical resources available at McLean Hospital / Harvard and the unique clinical resources available at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center to develop, implement, and evaluate a clinical protocol for the noninvasive assessment of not only true CVR magnitude, but also the individual contributors to CVR and blood circulation times as they relate to underlying circulatory physiology. We will first study 70 healthy control subjects between 20 and 70 years old with the calibrated CVR method to separately determine CVR magnitude and delay time (Aim 1), and separately evaluate two components of CVR delay: blood arrival time, and tissue reactivity time (Aim 2). We will then perform the same measures in a population of 30 patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, and 15 age-matched controls, to test the hypothesis that blood arrival time delay is increased and CVR magnitude is decreased in areas affected by stenosis (Aim 3). Previous work strongly suggests that the relative contribution of these two factors will help differentiate different types of pathology with different etiologies."
"9405256","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults report gains in domains including well-being and life satisfaction, despite experiencing declines in socio-emotional perception, a skill that likely underlies performance in these domains. The primary goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of older adults' everyday socio-emotional perception skills using an approach that identifies the socio-emotional judgments older adults make in their everyday lives as a means to create ecologically valid stimuli for use in laboratory settings. Specifically, the proposed research will investigate older adults' perception of social and emotional states and traits that are hidden or expressed through a series of studies that will collectively assess: 1) older adults' everyday socio-emotional perception skills, and 2) age differences in the perception of social and emotional states and traits on laboratory tasks that approximate everyday skills. In Study 1, an online survey design will be employed to catalogue the types of social and emotional state and trait judgments older and younger adults report making in real life. Participants will also report whether such judgments are important to their social functioning, and whether they perceive their judgments as successful. Study 2 will use these findings to design stimuli for a laboratory task that assess the perception of emotional states that are hidden or expressed. This task will then be administered to a sample of younger and older adults in Study 3 to determine whether older adults demonstrate advantages in accurately perceiving emotional states and in determining whether these states are hidden or expressed as compared to younger adults on a task that is ecologically valid and representative of everyday skill. Study 4 will again draw on findings from Study 1 to design ecologically valid stimuli for a laboratory task that assesses the perception of social traits, including the trait of competence; stimuli will thus include cases where a target's competence is expressed or hidden from the perceiver. This task will subsequently be administered in Study 5 to a sample of younger and older adults to test for age differences in the perception of competence and the discrimination between images displaying expressed competence versus hidden competence. Together, results from these studies will inform our understanding of older adults' skills in perceiving others' emotional states and social traits. It is likely that patterns of age-related decline in soio-emotional perception often observed in the literature exist at least in part as a function of laboratory methods that do not adequately reflect older adults' true skills in daily life. Thus, th proposed research may present a more accurate and also more positive view of emotion and aging. Specifically, the proposed research may demonstrate that older adults experience gains in socio-emotional perception skills compared to younger adults, as these skills are integral to functioning in other domains in which older adults have demonstrated gains. Further, the proposed research contributes to the field by proposing an ecologically valid approach to examine age differences in socio-emotional perception in the laboratory that may be adopted by other researchers."
"9208805","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most lethal human cancers, but despite decades of extensive effort, median survivals remain one year, or less. Because invasion and stemness are inter-connected properties that drive much of glioma malignancy, genes that co-regulate these phenotypes are robust therapeutic targets. One such candidate is TWIST1 (TW), a bHLH transcription factor (TF) central to epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and stemness and metastasis in carcinomas and normal development. In gliomas TW is upregulated in higher grade tumors and promotes GBM cell invasion and stemness in vitro and viability and growth of glioma stem cells (GSCs) in vivo. These findings strongly support its potential as a therapeutic target for GBM but identifying drug inhibitors of TFs has proven difficult by traditional means. The purpose of this proposal then is t develop indirect methods for targeting TW in GSCs through downstream genes essential to its malignant activity. TW must form a homo or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins to regulate gene transcription and the specific dimer motif defines unique phenotypes and gene expression sub-networks. The activation of unique gene expression patterns, or sub-networks, specific TW dimer partners which also map to specific malignant phenotypes will be leveraged to identify targets critical for TW activation of GSC invasion and survival. Further, phosphorylation of TW regulates dimer partner affinities and invasive behavior of GBM cells. Based on these observations this proposal will test the hypothesis that TW dimer specific pathways (sub-networks) can identify therapeutic targets to inhibit TW-regulated malignancy. AIM 1 employs proteomics to profile TW bHLH family binding partners associated with increased or decreased invasion and stemness. To facilitate this screen differential invasion and dimer affinity will be introduced through expression of pro- invasive wild-type and an anti-invasive TW phospho-mutant. In AIM2 candidate dimers validated to regulate TW binding and invasive or stem-like phenotypes will be tested to establish their impact on tumorigenicity and malignant phenotypes (invasion, proliferation, survival and angiogenesis) in vivo. In AIM3 gene expression arrays and ChIP-seq will define TW dimer specific sub-networks and identify direct and indirectly regulated TW targets. Candidate targets rank-ordered by comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of GO functional categories, pathways and expression in public GBM databases will then be tested in vitro and in vivo to validate equivalency with TW inhibition in selected GSC lines. This innovative approach is expected to identify TW dimer specific gene expression sub-networks and targets that functionally phenocopy the effects of TW inhibition on invasion, GSC tumorigenicity and glioma malignancy. This strategy is expected to have therapeutic relevance that translates to other TFs currently considered undruggable. Of significance, these studies will provide new mechanistic insight with broad implications for understanding the role of TW in development, EMT and the many other cancers in which TW promotes malignancy."
"9290957","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Few interventions to improve asthma management have targeted low-income minority adults and even fewer have focused on the real-world practice where care is provided for these patients. We adapted a patient navigator, here called a Patient Advocate (PA), a term preferred by patients, as a means of facilitating and maintaining access to chronic care for adults with moderate or severe asthma and prevalent chronic morbidities recruited from clinics serving low-income urban neighborhoods. The intervention, informed by focus groups of patients and providers, activates and empowers both groups, integrating activities with proven efficacy. Its feasibility and acceptability were demonstrated in RC1 HL099612 this project, implemented in a variety of practices, tests its comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness. Our PA coaches, models, and assists with preparations for a visit with the asthma doctor attends the visit with permission of participant and provider and confirms understanding. The PA facilitates scheduling, obtaining insurance coverage, overcoming patients' unique social and administrative barriers to carrying out medical advice, and transfer of information between providers and patients. PA activities are individualized, multimodal, take account of  comorbidities, and are generalizable to other chronic diseases. The PAs, highly valued by patients in RC1HL099612, are recent college graduates interested in health-related or education careers, research experience, working with patients, and generally having the same race/ethnicity distribution as potential  subjects.   We will enroll 300 adults wit moderate-severe asthma into a randomized clinical trial testing whether the  PA intervention, compared to usual care, is associated with better and sustained asthma control (Specific Aim  1) and other asthma outcomes (prednisone bursts, ED visits, hospitalizations, quality of life, FEV1) (Specific  Aim 2) relative to baseline. Secondary aims will assess mediators and moderators of the PA-asthma outcome relationship. Specific Aim 3 evaluates the intervention's cost-effectiveness. We will explore intervention's impact on providers in post-study focus groups. This proposal is innovative and significant because it 1) compares the effectiveness of  the PA to usual  care, 2) focuses on inner-city low-income predominantly minority adults who experience high asthma morbidity,  3) uses a real-world behavioral intervention tested for sustainability in an RCT design, 4) tests a multi-faceted  individualized intervention which considers comorbidities as it provides a model of chronic asthma  management and is thus generalizable to patients with other chronic diseases and comorbidities, 5) examines  patient-provider communication, 6) uses a unique PA, 7) considers both English- and Spanish-speaking  patients, and 8) assesses the cost-effectiveness of the intervention relative to UC."
"9273270","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant Adolescent girls in South Africa remain disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic, despite the availability of several behavioural interventions to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV. Strategies to reduce HIV transmission in this key population would benefit greatly from a better understanding of the sexual networks that drive HIV transmission in adolescent girls. Furthermore, if HIV infection rates in adolescent girls can be reduced, this could break critical chains of transmission and decrease the spread of HIV in the general population. We hypothesise that complex sexual networks, including mixing between adolescents and community members, drive high HIV incidence in adolescent girls in rural South Africa. To test our hypothesis we will utilize an innovative approach to identify networks of HIV transmission that combine extensive epidemiologic sampling with phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequence data and traditional sexual networking methods. Phylogenetic analysis has recently emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to use viral diversity to examine the underlying dynamics of HIV-1 transmission in affected populations. However, these methods have often failed to find linkages in endemic settings; this is likely due to underrepresentation because of sparse sampling of transmission pairs in large populations of HIV infected individuals. One of the major innovations of this proposal is identifying HIV-1 clusters and viral linkages in adolescents and link these to community sequences by extensively sampling HIV infected individuals from a defined geographic area (part of the sub-district of Vulindlela in KwaZulu-Natal), using several epidemiologic approaches to achieve a 'saturating' rate of population coverage. This area is uniquely suited for this research as the study area is rural and geographically well defined; it is one of the highest HIV burden districts in South Afric and CAPRISA has collected detailed data on the structural, behavioural and biological determinants of risks of HIV infection in this community over the last decade. Building on our expertise in HIV surveillance in this area we will i) enhance the representativeness of the phylogenetic analyses by combining novel recruitment strategies including clinic- and school-based recruitment, and respondent-driven sampling for hard-to-reach populations; ii) use high- throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics to identify HIV-1 transmission networks through HIV-1 viral linkages; and iii) include behavioural and biological information and other risk factors. This approach will allow us to characterize HIV transmission clusters and viral linkages in this hyper endemic region, analyze the contribution of HIV clusters to the new infections occurring among adolescent girls, and use this data to improve HIV prevention efforts in this key population for HIV control."
"9316602","PROJECT SUMMARY Copper (Cu) is an essential transition metal regulated by a complex set of transporters and chaperones. Mammals rely on two related p-type ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B, to regulate intracellular Cu levels and coordinate its intestinal absorption and biliary excretion. Depending on Cu availability, ATP7A and ATP7B are actively trafficked from trans-Golgi network (TGN) to cytosolic vesicles to mediate extracellular Cu excretion. At the organismal level, ATP7A plays a required role in intestinal Cu absorption while of ATP7B is required for biliary excretion. COMMD1, the founding member of a highly conserved family that includes 9 additional members, has been long known to play a role in mammalian Cu metabolism. R ecent work from our laboratories has uncovered that COMMD1 regulates the endosomal sorting of ATP7A. This is mediated through the formation of a complex containing CCDC22 and its homologous protein, CCDC93, termed the COMMD/CCDC22/ CCDC93 or CCC complex. The CCC complex can exist in alternative configurations depending on the recruitment of specific COMMD proteins. COMMD1-CCC binds to the WASH complex, a critical regulator of receptor trafficking within the endo-lysosomal system. WASH activates the Arp2/3 complex, leading to branched F-actin deposition on endosomes, a required step for the generation of transport vesicles containing recycling cargo proteins such as ATP7A. In contrast, we recently reported that COMMD9-CCC plays an essential role in the endosomal recycling of other proteins, such as Notch. Emerging data indicates that COMMD9 also participates in ATP7A trafficking. However, it remains unclear how the CCC complex regulates endosomal sorting and in which way do different COMMD-containing CCC complexes collaborate in this process. The overall goal of this project is to provide a deep mechanistic understanding for the role of COMMD proteins in endosomal sorting and their impact in Cu homeostasis. Our hypothesis is that the primary function of the CCC complex is to regulate WASH activity. Furthermore, we hypothesize that different COMMD proteins function to localize the CCC complex to different endosomal sub-compartments to mediate cargo-specific effects and/or to regulate WASH activity along a continuum of sorting steps. The following specific aims will be pursued: (1) To uncover the mechanism by which the CCC complex regulates WASH activity. Here we will examine how CCC regulates F-Actin deposition on endosomes. (2) To understand the contribution of the COMMD9-CCC complex in endosomal trafficking. Here we will examine mechanistically how COMMD9 adds to the sorting process. (3) To assess the role of COMMD9 in cu homeostasis at the organismal level. Here we will use tissue specific Commd9 knockout mice to study the role of this gene in Cu metabolism in vivo. Altogether, the proposed studies will uncover critical aspects of vesicular sorting that have wide ranging implications in biology and human disease, as well as examine these pathways and their impact on Cu homeostasis."
"9261515","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project focuses on the regulation of the N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) gene and its enzyme product which catalyzes the formation of N-acetylglutamate (NAG). While carbamyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) is often referred to as the first and rate-limiting enzyme of ureagenesis, it requires NAG as an essential allosteric activator. Therefore, the levels of NAG in the mitochondrial matrix of liver and small intestinal epithelial cells play an important role in regulating urea production. This NAGS/NAG system is an emerging target for new treatment of hyperammonemia. New tools that were developed during the previous funding periods will allow us to address many important questions about this system, its clinical relevance, and how it can be exploited to develop new approaches for managing and treating hyperammonemia. The specific aims of this project are to: Aim 1 - Characterize the transcriptional regulation of NAGS and its role in human disease. In this aim we will elucidate the functional importance of two conserved non-coding sequences of the NAGS gene in the regulation of its transcription. This will be accomplished by studying liver and intestine derived cells and by using bioinformatics, reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA-pull-down assays. Aim 2 - Determine the structural basis and physiological role of mammalian NAGS activation by L-arginine. This aim will explore (a) structural and mechanistic correlates of the positive regulatory effect of L-arginine on NAGS activity at the protein level by using x-ray crystallography of mammalian NAGS with and without bound substrates and (b) in vivo effect on ureagenesis and other metabolic parameters of arginine activation of NAGS in koNAGS mouse by transfection with arginine-insensitive and sensitive NAGS transgenes. Aim 3 - Characterize the structural and functional interactions between the N-terminus of NAGS and CPS1. This aim will use X-ray crystallography to determine the structural basis of NAGS-CPS1 interaction, and the koNAGS mouse transfected with various NAGS mutants will be studied to identify alterations in nitrogen metabolism that will reveal the functional importance of this interaction. Aim 4 - Determine the mechanism of N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) delivery to hepatocyte and intestinal cell mitochondria. This aim will use affinity labeling and siRNA knock down methods to identify transporters that are involved in delivery of NCG to liver and intestinal cell mitochondria. Overall, the project uses new tools of research to gain new insights into a system that can be exploited for better diagnosis and treatment of NAGS deficiency and other conditions associated with hyperammonemia."
"9232974","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Among U.S. Veterans, RA is associated with substantial morbidity, accelerated mortality, and rapidly rising treatment costs. Fortunately, there have been substantial recent gains in our understanding of RA pathogenesis including insight into the role of antigen-specific autoantibodies in disease propagation. Preliminary evidence from our group and others suggest that select autoantibodies may serve as robust biomarkers for disease progression and indeed may actually directly mediate the joint damage that characterizes RA. Moreover, our preliminary data suggests that antigen-specific autoantibody responses in RA may be 'shaped' by environmental factors including cigarette smoking and periodontitis (PD), modifiable factors that could be targeted in future strategies of disease treatment and/or prevention. Supported now by substantial preliminary data, our overarching hypothesis is that environmental factors directly impact the formation of specific autoantigens and tolerance loss in RA, leading to adaptive immune responses that in turn have profound implications in RA. We plan to test our central hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish the objectives of this application by pursuing the following three specific aims: Aim 1 will examine the associations of antigen-specific autoantibody responses in RA with radiographic disease progression. Studies will initially be conducted using data and serum samples already available for patients enrolled in the recently completed multinational VA Cooperative Study Program (CSP) 551 Study. Analyses will be replicated in an additional RA cohort to mitigate false positive findings. This aim will include preliminary studies exploring whether select autoantibodies stimulate osteoclast function and bone resorption, pathologic features of bony erosion in RA. Aim 2 will examine associations of subgingival microbiome composition (altered in the context of PD) with RA risk. These analyses will leverage data and biosamples available (including subgingival bacterial plaque samples) as part of the largest case-control study ever conducted examining the association of PD with RA risk led by the PI. Aim 3 will then examine to what extent environmental factors (both smoking and PD) shape autoantibody responses in RA. Studies in this aim will include initial explorations of whether select subgingival bacteria influence antigen-specific responses of circulating T-cells, thus promoting systemic autoimmunity in RA. The questions proposed in this study are highly significant; addressing scientific questions and current gaps in our understanding that have a high probability of altering the way the RA is approached in clinical management in addition to shaping a future research agenda."
"9278092","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The high number of OEF/OIF/OND veterans with comorbid PTSD and mTBI seeking care at VA has brought to light a gap in the evidence base of treatment strategies for these conditions. Treating veterans with these two disorders is challenging because the symptoms overlap (e.g., insomnia, irritability, trouble concentrating). Additionally, veterans may present for treatment in Mental Health Clinics or in Polytrauma Clinics where they may undergo different diagnostic procedures and receive treatments that may address only one disorder. Even worse, a treatment designed for one disorder may worsen the symptoms of the other. Coordinated care of mTBI and PTSD is essential in order to ensure `the compatibility of medications and other treatments for both disorders. This can best be done by determining similarities and differences between biological profiles in PTSD and mTBI separately and when they co-occur. To date, very little is known about the underlying pathophysiologies for each disorder separately and for their co-occurrence. Interestingly, however, hormonal dysfunction has been independently identified in both conditions. The project described in this application will examine glucocorticoid (GC) functioning in PTSD and mTBI in order to determine whether people with both conditions show a neuroendocrine profile (i.e., GC sensitivity) that resembles that observed in people with PTSD. One hundred and forty OEF/OIF/OND veterans will participate in the project and will include veterans with no history of mTBI and no current PTSD (mTBI-/PTSD-); veterans with a history of mTBI but no PTSD (mTBI+/PTSD-); veterans with no history of mTBI but a current PTSD diagnosis (mTBI-/PTSD+); veterans with a history of mTBI and a current PTSD diagnosis (mTBI+/PTSD+). The primary study outcomes will include an assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning (i.e.,24 hour urinary cortisol, cortisol (CORT) and adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) response to dexamethasone (DEX), lysozyme IC50-DEX) and the CORT and ACTH response to glucocorticoid ingestion [i.e., glucocorticoid challenge test (GCT)]. Secondary measures include cognitive testing following the GCT; Exploratory analyses will be conducted to examine group differences in baseline neuropsychological tests and self-report measures (e.g., symptoms) and anterior pituitary hormones associated with post-traumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP). The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of the unique biological signal associated with comorbid mTBI and PTSD, which will enhance coordination of diagnosis and treatment of combat veterans who receive care at VA."

The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics."
"9278084","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the United States has risen 6-fold over the last 4 decades. Barrett's esophagus is a change in the lining of the esophagus that is a precursor to the cancer. Major factors associated with both Barrett's Esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma are heartburn and regurgitation, which are symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Roughly 20% of Americans have GERD symptoms on a weekly basis, and over 2 million upper endoscopies are performed annually in the U.S. in adults with GERD symptoms. Nonetheless, fewer than 15% of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma have had an upper endoscopy prior to their diagnosis of the cancer. Patients with GERD symptoms are more likely to be referred to upper endoscopy if their symptoms have responded inadequately to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Approximately 50% of such patients do not have abnormal amounts of gastroesophageal reflux accounting for their symptoms, and often have psychological distress characterized by features of somatization, anxiety and depression. Clearly, there is a need for improved selection of patients for endoscopic screening. A quick, personalized clinical tool for identifying men at risk for Barrett's esophagus has been developed, the Michigan Barrett's Esophagus pREdiction Tool (M-BERET). The proposed study aims to validate that tool in a clinical population, extend it to women, and to determine if inclusion of specific circulating biomarkers and/or features of psychological distress can improve its accuracy. The study will enroll consecutive patients undergoing their first endoscopy and compare the accuracy of the tool to GERD symptoms alone for predicting the presence of Barrett's esophagus. Patients referred for their first endoscopic treatment of Barrett's esophagus with high grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer will also be enrolled, and the accuracy of the tool will be assessed for discriminating these patients from patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and no Barrett's esophagus. The study will also compare the accuracy of the tool to GERD symptoms for predicting the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in a large retrospective longitudinal cohort. If the personalized tool is validated in the proposed study and widely used, it is expected to improve the allocation of endoscopy, decreasing over-utilization in low-risk patients, and increasing utilization in high-risk patients, ultimately decreasing the burden of esophageal adenocarcinoma in an efficient manner."
"9284465","ABSTRACT   The primary objective of the Cell & Tissue Models Core (Core B) is supporting the CF drug discovery efforts of participating investigators by providing state-of-the-art, CF-relevant cell and tissue models. More than 20 projects described in this renewal will utilize Core B for cell and/or tissue models. These models are used in high throughput screening assays, testing of lead compounds, therapeutically relevant preclinical bioassays, and translational science investigations of CF and airway pathophysiology. The Cell & Tissues Core achieves its objective via an infrastructure for the collection of CF-relevant tissues; instrumentation and expertise for cell isolation, culture, storage and quality control; adaptation and development of novel cell culture methods; and convenient distribution of cell models and tissues to CF investigators. Highly differentiated planar cell models of respiratory tract surface epithelial cells and submucosal gland cells that replicate native ion transport, airway surface liquid formation and mucin secretion remain the major cell model provided by the Core. In addition to our long-established strength in providing these models, the core has developed expertise in three-dimensional organotypic models (organoids), rotary wall vessel bioreactor cultures and conditionally reprogrammed cells. Organoids and rotary wall vessel bioreactor cultures provide a tissue-like environment that encourages cellular differentiation. Both methods increase the number of culture units available per tissue sample potentially generating more efficient, disease-relevant models for drug discovery. Conditionally reprogrammed cells allow expansion of CF cells through serial passaging allowing increased production of CF cell models and development of more efficient assays for evaluating small molecules. Using conditional reprogramming for producing more cell models from limited numbers of cells exhibiting rare CF genotypes will aid the development of ?personalized? therapies."
"9279106","Translational Research Enhancement Core D: Project Summary  The DDBTRCC Translational Research Enhancement Core (GI-TREC Core D) has as its goal to make translating basic research findings made by the Core Center Research Base investigators easier and more efficient to achieve. The GI-TREC was established with the understanding that the uniform and standardized harvest of biospecimens with associated, comprehensive clinical, epidemiological and research data would greatly facilitate and improve the study of gastrointestinal physiology and diseases. The two main components of this repository are the Translational/Clinical Research Unit (GI-TREC-T/CRU) to record clinical data and the Tissue Bank (GI-TREC-TxB), which collects, manages, and annotates patient specimens with both research and clinical data. These patient biospecimens include blood, serum, plasma, peripheral blood monocytes, DNA, RNA, urine, stool, and tissue specimens. Combined, these two integrated units provide a cost-effective, efficient centralized tissue banking system to provide high quality, data-associated specimens to multiple users for individual research projects and for fostering collaborations among multiple users. Core D provides the infrastructure for the cost-effective tissue and data collection that meets Best Practices (BPs) through the establishment of uniform Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to promote scientific advances by and scientific interactions among Core users, collaborative investigators and young investigators, without each investigator having to invest in the equipment/resources or individually work out specific SOPs. The TREC is aware with bioinformatics resources for translational research being developed and made available by the JHU CTSA and helps instruct our Research Base in its use. The TREC currently holds >40,000 specimens and has been used by 24 current Members, 10 Associate Members and a total of 45 Core Center investigators since the Core Center was funded, and has contributed to 65 publications."
"9295917","Insufficient sleep has been linked to adverse metabolic changes and increased risk of chronic disease including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and early mortality. With age, most Americans increase visceral adiposity and become more likely to develop diabetes. Chronic insufficient sleep associated with 'normal aging' may be one of the factors involved in contributing to metabolic aging'. Physiological changes in metabolism due to sleep loss for 1-2 weeks in young and middle-aged adults include reduced insulin sensitivity and hormonal changes that would increase the likelihood of obesity and diabetes in the long term. Our current data demonstrate that metabolic dysfunction occurs in young and older adults exposed to the combination of chronic sleep loss and recurrent circadian disruption for 3 weeks. Yet sleep loss experiments lengthen photoperiod, introducing a potential confounding effect on circadian rhythmicity, and circadian disruption itself has been shown to lead to adverse metabolic changes. Thus, the effects of sleep loss (with minimal circadian disruption) on glucose metabolism in older adults are not known. In Project 2, we will examine the metabolic responses to 3 weeks of sleep loss in a protocol with minimal circadian disruption to test the hypothesis that older adults will exhibit progressive decrements in total body and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. We will determine the extent of the changes (glycemic responses to standardized meals, insulin sensitivity via euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps), the mechanisms of changes (via adipose tissue biopsy, sympathetic activation, and glucocorticoid activation) and the dynamics of changes (distinguishing effects over a few days and chronic effects over 3 weeks). Moreover, we hypothesize older adults will exhibit recovery of metabolic function with 1 week of sleep recovery. This Project will contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which sleep loss impairs metabolism in older adults, contributing to future research to reduce the risk of diabetes, improve existing therapies, and enhance the health and quality of life of older Americans whose sleep is insufficient."
"9325565","ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is major and growing public health problem especially in older women. Despite advances in the treatment of established HF, prognosis remains poor in the elderly, therefore preventive efforts are needed. Lack of physical activity (PA) is a potent prospective risk factor for HF; while increased levels of PA are associated with reduced risk of HF in observational studies, the evidence that maintaining high levels of physical activity or increasing PA in sedentary individuals reduces the risk of heart failure is not presently available. A novel PA pragmatic trial embedded within the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) entitled WHI Strong and Healthy trial (WHISH) has been recently funded and will evaluate whether increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary behavior and increasing muscle strength through resistance training will reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but not the important outcome of HF. WHISH-2-Prevent Heart Failure will evaluate the effect of this RCT on incident HF and HF burden (all heart failure hospitalizations and CVD death in those with antecedent HF) as well as perform dose-finding analyses. WHISH-2-Prevent Heart Failure will be the first, largest, and longest primary prevention exercise trial ever performed in the highest risk group for HF-elderly women. An imbedded accelerometer study will allow for a dose-finding analysis regardless of the RCT results using newly developed MET-equivalent indices for elderly women.   "
"9407357","The specific aim of this project is to develop an insert earphone with integrated in-ear sound level calibration capabilities. Insert earphones provide great advantages for hearing testing with a convenient and comfortable way to deliver a stimulus with high noise and intra-aural attenuation. They not surprisingly have become a standard clinical transducer. However, their exact calibration over a wide range of ages from neonates to older adults is questionable due to differences in ear canal volumes ranging from 0.2 to 2 cc. The current use of the same calibration values on such a wide range of populations, significantly limits the effectiveness of calibration, resulting in a wide range of sensation levels for a given ?calibrated? stimulus.  A simple and easy way to provide routine in-ear calibration of signals being delivered using insert earphones is necessary in order to standardize clinical testing across populations and clinics. In order to develop the proposed system, the following work will be conducted during Phase I: 1) Develop insert earphone that incorporates a miniature microphone preamplifier and equalizer circuitry in the transducer assembly. 2) Develop a full range of insert earphone disposable tips with a built-in microphone probe tube that can be used for pediatric and adult testing. 3) Develop a stand-alone dual channel microphone amplifier with a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) based hardware and software component usable with any audiometric test system, providing on screen calibration values during testing. 4) Perform a comprehensive bench-mark and validation testing of the system on a wide range of test cavities and stimulus frequencies.  The newly developed inserts will be fully compatible with our recently developed USB Jr Duet hardware platform which provides dual built-in microphone amplifiers, allowing immediate integration of the proposed system to current IHS users. A proposed stand-alone dual microphone amplifier component will allow integration with 3rd party audiometric testing devices that use insert earphones, but that do not have the built-in microphone amplifier capabilities. The stand-alone module will provide on-screen calibration measurements concurrently to any other testing application running on the user?s computer. The proposed system will provide an easy to use and integrated approach to in-ear calibration for insert earphones. The device will result in a direct benefit to patients by providing in vivo calibration information that will in turn provide more accurate diagnostic and normative information and result in better patient management with better outcomes.  During Phase II, a comprehensive clinical trial is envisioned on a wide range of subjects ranging from neonates to adults, comparing Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) recordings, Middle Ear Muscle Reflexes (MEMR) and audiometry threshold results, using standard and the proposed in-ear calibration techniques."

"9293294","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which EYA1 controls nephron progenitor cell development in the mammalian kidney. In mammals, kidney development involves the specification of the metanephric mesenchyme (MM), the outgrowth of the ureteric bud (UB), and reciprocal interactions between the UB and the MM to generate large numbers of nephrons as well as the renal collecting system in the mature kidney. Mutations in genes that disrupt these processes cause renal agenesis and hypoplasia. We and others identified EYA1 and its cofactor SIX family proteins as critical mesenchymal factors for kidney development. Defects in these genes in humans cause Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) syndrome, a congenital birth defect characterized by a combination of branchial, otic and renal anomalies. To understand the basis of kidney defects that occur in BOR syndrome, we analyzed EYA1 and SIX1/5 mutations identified from patients and generated knockout mice. Our results show that these genes interact and are essential for MM cell development and UB branching. Since the MM is not formed in Eya1-/- mice, we have recently generated Eya1flox and Eya1CreERT2 alleles. We found that deletion of Eya1 after UB outgrowth results in depletion of the MM progenitors due to premature epithelialization and that EYA1 directly interacts with SIX2 and Myc family proteins, which are known to be important for the maintenance of the MM progenitors. Our analyses indicate that EYA1 dephosphorylates Myc at Thr58 to prevent the Myc protein from degradation in vitro and that deletion of Eya1 in the MM cells leads to increased levels of phosphor-T58-Myc but decreased levels of Myc. Currently, however, we do not understand how these key factors are functionally linked to regulate the proliferation and maintenance of the nephron progenitors. In this renewal application, we propose to take a combination of molecular, biochemical, genetic and genomic approaches to test the hypothesis that EYA1, Myc and SIX2 interact to regulate the expansion of the nephron progenitor pool and identify the target genes that are controlled by EYA1 and its cofactors. This study should advance the field by revealing novel mechanisms of how EYA1 interacts with its cofactors to regulate self-renewal of the nephron progenitors."
"9296149","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this proposal is to increase the sensitivity of DNA concentration measurements by 1000X over the state of the art. In addition, the microfluidic platform we will develop to accomplish this will also enable, for the fist time, the targeted recovery of genome-size DNA fragments out of a heterogeneous sample. Nucleic acid analysis through technologies like microarrays and next-generation sequencing are transforming the way that many biological questions are addressed. The power of these approaches stems from their ability to obtain system-wide information with single molecule detail. However, a major technical barrier that often prevents their effective application is that many biological systems are too complex to be straightforwardly sequenced: Even with bioinformatic algorithms, the billions of short, sequence dreads are often too complex to piece together into useful information. To address this challenge, we will develop a technology that allows nucleic acids to be quantitated and sorted in a heterogeneous sample. Importantly, this method will utilize specific multiplexedTaqMan PCR assays performed in giant-unilamellarvesicles (GUVs); this will make it much more specific and targetable than methods that sort DNA based on size or staining properties. Moreover, by assaying individual molecules or cells in GUVs, we will be able to perform billions of PCR assays in parallel, enabling massive, heterogeneous samples to be screened to identify and recover extremely rare targets. This basic technology will be broadly useful throughout biological research and has immediate human health impacts, including for detecting and sequencing cancer DNA in the blood early in the disease, analyzing genetic heterogeneity in tumor cells, and identifying immune cells latently infected with HIV. The aims are:  ? Specific Aim 1: Demonstrate microfluidic generation and FACS sorting of thermostable femtoliterGiant-Unilamellar Vesicles. We will develop the microfluidic hardware and processes for generating billions of monodisperse femtoliter GUVs. We will also optimize processes to FACS GUVs, both into positive and negative pools and, individually, into wells on a microliter plate.  ? Specific Aim 2: Optimize and characterize GUV-PCR and benchmark against aqueous droplets.  We will explore different PCR reagents to optimize the GUV-PCRs and benchmark the efficiency of  these reactions against ones performed in aqueous-in-oil droplets generated with our own microfluidics  and with the Bio-rad QX100 digital PCR machine. We will measure efficiency using endpoint fluorescence, fraction of positive reactors, and yield of DNA recovered out of the reactors. We will also optimize protocols for rupturing GUVs to access their contents.  ? Specific Aim 3: Demonstrate 1000X greater sensitivity than competing platforms by performing over 1 billion digital GUV-PCRs, and recovery of positive molecules with FACS. We will demonstrate the superiority of GUVs for digital PCR by performing 1000X more reactions than is possible with existing droplet technologies. We will also demonstrate the ability to recover rare DNA molecules by FACS sorting the positive GUVs."
"9344515","Objective: The main goal of this application is to study the mechanism whereby the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) modulates the permeability of the BBB under physiological conditions and after an ischemic stroke. Methods In Aim I we will test the hypothesis that under non-ischemic conditions astrocytic LRP1 preserves the integrity of the basement membrane-astrocyte (BM-A) interface by promoting the recruitment of integrins to the membrane of perivascular astrocytic end- feet processes and their binding to its ligands in the basement membrane (BM). In Aim II we propose that this function is lost under ischemic conditions when the cleavage of the extracellular domain of LRP1 from perivascular astrocytes activates a cell-signaling pathway that increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In Aim III we will study in an animal model of ischemic stroke whether inhibition of LRP1 cleavage from perivascular astrocytes with the receptor-associated protein (RAP) prevents the harmful effects of endogenous tPA and/or rtPA on the permeability of the BBB. Research Plan In the first Aim of this application we will use astrocytic cell cultures and a cell adhesion assay. In the second Aim we will use astrocytic cultures, an in vitro model of the blood- brain barrier, real-time PCR, confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays. In the third Aim we will use a nanocarrier that we engineered to selectively deliver its content to the BBB in the ischemic tissue and an animal model of cerebral ischemia.  "
"9267081","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  CLINICAL CORE  There is now abundant evidence that the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (collectively  referred to as AD) begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. This prodromal, preclinical period, while  appearing cognitively and functionally silent is in fact associated with robust changes that may be detected by  biomarkers and presents an ideal opportunity for early detection and intervention. To do this, we have taken the  lead in developing and validating novel and innovative clinical-cognitive-behavioral measurements to identify  individuals at-risk and combine these findings with state-of-art biomarker studies. The NYU ADC current research  focus is on individuals with NIA-AA Stages 1 to 3 (particular focus on subjective memory complaints, CSF and  imaging biomarkers, and physical functionality): preclinical disease, MCI, and mild AD compared with healthy  aging (NIA-AA preclinical stage 0). The overall goal of the Clinical Core is to provide accurate research  diagnoses for a cohort of longitudinally followed older adults to autopsy to provide appropriate subjects and  subject-derived materials for research projects conducted by ADC investigators and collaborating scientists. This  focus directly serves the primary research theme of the NYU ADC: the characterization of preclinical AD and its  transition to MCI and early AD. We propose 8 Specific Aims: (1) Maintain and characterize an active UDS cohort  of ~400 individuals (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0 50% of cohort), MCI (CDR 0.5 30% of cohort), or mild  AD (CDR 0.5 or 1 20% of cohort); (2) Recruit, assess, and retain new participants (~45) from diverse  backgrounds to replenish the cohort in proportion to attritional losses; (3) Provide culturally-sensitive recruitment  strategies and longitudinal research assessments; (4) Collect, store, and distribute CSF, blood, and DNA  biospecimens; (5) Obtain consent for brain donations; (6) Provide appropriate subjects, data, and biospecimens  for research studies; (7) Integrate data collection and quality control procedures; and (8) provide infrastructure,  resources, and coordinate contribution to NACC and other national and international collaborations. By providing  a wealth of standardized longitudinal clinical, cognitive, biomarker, and neuroimaging data to investigators, the  NYU ADC Clinical Core is poised to play a significant role in providing the infrastructure and resources necessary  to advance our understanding of preclinical AD and its transition to the symptomatic stages of MCI and mild AD."

"9315139","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching aims of this Center are to help advance the clinical, research, and educational goals of the ChiLDREN grant with a particular emphasis on engaging cutting-edge genome studies as a basis for discovery, innovation, and improvements in outcomes and care. As such, the aims of this application are not only to provide comprehensive research opportunities for all children who fit enrollment criteria for ChiLDREN throughout the Southeastern US. We are also planning to embark upon 3 genomically-centered Research Aims: Aim 1: Explore the genetic determinants of outcomes in biliary atresia (BA). We hypothesize that by detailed, broad-based, unbiased exploration of individual patient genomic determinants (e.g., whole exome sequencing), we will be able to assign genetic categorization of children into those able to adapt well post-Hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE), and those who do not. Intial findings have identified variants in a pathophysiologically-relevant gene that associate with poor outcome after HPE. Aim 2: Determine causes of BA with Laterality Defects. This will proceed by identifying carefully-phenotyped individuals with biliary atresia with laterality defects. To date, 20 trios have been exome sequenced, and analyses are ongoing, with expectations to validate such findings in the larger, BA cohort in ChiLDREN. Aim 3: Explore GGT as a marker for development and progression of portal hypertension in BA subjects with native livers over the age of 2. Preliminary data support the concept that an elevated GGT at age 2 predicts the development of portal hypertension indices and we will utilize the ChiLDREN database to validate and fine- tune these findings, with the goal being to develop GGT as a biomarker of disease progression in BA. The latter will have relevance for a planned study of a novel FXR agonist in these older BA patients in this consortium. The final proposal is to make a single-site exome sequencing and bioinformatics locale within the Emory Genetics Lab under the guidance of Dr. Madhuri Hegde, with close interweaving of longitudinal information from the DCC to develop models, stratify patients, and predict outcomes. Taken together, the focus upon exome sequencing in this population of diseases that manifest early in life and can be stratified into readily-identifible outcome groups, are arguably the ideal group of patients ever collected to deliver etiologic and therapeutic discoveries in cholestasis. For these serious pediatric liver diseases, none with effective medical therapies, studies like these will not only benefit this population, but are likey to provide a deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying liver disease progression in patients of all ages."
"9489331","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes (T2D) genetics has realized extraordinary advances, including identification of at least 100 genetic loci at genome-wide significance. However, to convert these loci into targets for new therapies, several gaps in knowledge need to be addressed. Evidence from GWAS and exome sequencing studies strongly suggest that non-coding regulatory variants play a major role in T2D risk, although at most T2D loci, the functional variants, their target genes, the relevant tissues, and the direction of their effect to increase or decrease gene function remain unknown. Allelic heterogeneity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) can make the number of underlying signals and their identities ambiguous. In addition, functional T2D variants may lead to disease through altered insulin secretion, insulin resistance, or other aspects of metabolic risk that may involve several tissues, and the impact of altered gene expression needs to be defined. The overall goal of our proposal is to identify the functional variants, target genes and regulatory mechanisms responsible for noncoding T2D association signals. This proposal builds on our substantial experience with both T2D genetics and functional analyses, including the impressive resources of the METSIM and FUSION studies, the gene regulatory elements we defined in pancreatic islets using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq), DNase hypersensitivity (DNase-seq), and formaldehyde-assisted identification of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq), and our experimental studies that implicate specific variants, tissues, and directions of effect at the TCF7L2, JAZF1, ARAP1, and CAMK1D T2D loci. We will define the physiological characteristics and multiple signals at T2D loci by testing for association with detailed quantitative traits (QTs) in METSIM and with islet, adipose, and muscle transcript levels and isoforms. Step-wise conditional analysis with simultaneous modeling of multiple loci will be used to define additional association signals, which will be compared with existing trans-ancestry fine-mapping data. We will identify regulatory variants and target genes using signals and allelic imbalances in transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data from T2D-relevant tissues and cells. We will apply an allele-aware pipeline to align sequence data, intersect variants with regulatory elements, and use transcription factor and chromatin allelic imbalances to distinguish likely functional variants from other candidate variants located in regulatory elements. We will identify causal relationships between variants and genes by expression QTs and allelic imbalance, integrated with QT data, and correlation of regulatory elements with expression level across cell types. Finally, we will use experimental studies to identify functional regulatory variants and the molecular mechanisms by which they influence gene and protein activity. Successful completion of these aims will translate T2D association signals into biological insights and therapeutic targets. Pathogenic variants, the mechanisms by which variants affect gene function, and their physiological consequences will be determined, guiding studies that evaluate novel therapies."

Similarly, correlate the spatial distribution of tauopathy to test the hypothesis: the spread of tauopathy from the transentorhinal region to the neocortex predicts the transition from preclinical to symptomatic AD. 2. Correlate cross-sectional and longitudinal T807 imaging: a. With amyloid PET imaging (Project 4) to test the hypothesis that cerebral amyloidosis and tauopathy each are necessary to predict the transition to symptomatic AD. b. With CSF concentrations of tau, p-tau181, VILIP-1, SNAP-25, and Neurogranin (Biomarker Core, Project 2), as markers of synaptic and neural injury, and with CSF A?42 and YKL-40. c.

"9353209","Motivational Interviewing (MI) is the only behavioral intervention to date shown to be effective to improve self- management for youth living with HIV. Implementation science is the scientific study of methods to promote the uptake of research findings and evidence-based practice (EBP) to improve the quality and effectiveness of behavior change approaches such as MI in health care settings. A primary challenge of scaling up EBPs is to balance flexibility (adaptation to context) and fidelity (provider adherence and competence). The goal of this proposal is to test a multi-faceted Tailored MI Implementation intervention (?TMI?) based on the dynamic adaptation process to scale up an EBP in multidisciplinary adolescent HIV care settings while balancing flexibility and fidelity. The dynamic adaptation process guides tailoring of MI implementation through a series of phases: exploration, preparation, implementation, and sustainment. The proposed project is a hybrid implementation-effectiveness (Type 3) trial. We will test the effect of TMI on fidelity to the EBP, and secondarily on HIV care cascade-related outcomes, using a dynamic wait-listed design with 165 providers nested within 10 ATN4 HIV sites. With this design, the clinics will be randomly assigned in 5 clusters to receive TMI. For each randomization, 2 clinics receive TMI and the others remain in the wait-list condition. This will continue until the 5th cluster has been randomized to TMI. After one year of TMI?s external facilitation, a second randomization will compare internal facilitator monitoring and coaching plus the encouragement of Communities of Practice versus Communities of Practice alone. Fidelity will be assessed on a quarterly basis through the 24 months of intervention and an additional 6 months of follow-up. We will nest our qualitative method (in-depth interviews) within the quantitative study to provide a deeper understanding of the implementation context and understand why or why not MI is integrated with fidelity across the 150 providers. Providers and key stakeholders will complete qualitative interviews and brief assessments at baseline, after one year of TMI (first randomization), and after 1 year of follow-up (second randomization). We hypothesize that MI competency ratings will be higher among providers during the TMI phase compared to the treatment as usual phase. We also expect that successful implementation will be associated with improved cascade-related outcomes, namely undetectable viral load and greater number of clinic visits among youth living with HIV as well as increased numbers of youth tested and linked to care."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glycosphingolipids are essential for many cellular processes, are enriched in membranes, and undergo catabolism in endosomes and lysosomes through the action of acid hydrolases. GBA encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is responsible for the hydrolysis of the glycosphingolipid substrates glucosylceramide (GluCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GluSph). GBA gene mutations are the highest known genetic risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease (PD) and related ?-synucleinopathies. Our preliminary data shows that levels of GluSph are increased in the human brain in sporadic PD. Moreover, we show that GCase activity is reduced, and glycosphingolipid levels are increased in the brain in normal aging. The consequences of increased glycosphingolipid levels on neuronal health in aging and in sporadic PD are not known. In this R01 application I have designed experiments to test the relevance of elevated glycosphingolipids in neural cells in aging and PD. In Specific Aim 1 we hypothesize that altered levels of glycosphingolipids induce neuronal dysfunction and susceptibility to degeneration. We will modulate levels of GluSph in mouse and human neurons in vitro to determine whether neuronal vulnerability to PD-stressors, including increased ?-synuclein loads, is altered. We will also establish whether reduced GCase and increased GluSph levels are detected in human PD patient fibroblasts and neurons as such alterations may represent novel bio- and pharmacodynamic- markers for PD. In Specific Aim 2 we hypothesize that reducing the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in aging and PD can prevent the aggregation and toxicity of ?-synuclein. We will determine how the homeostasis of glycosphingolipid pathways are altered in two rodent models of ?-synucleinopathy, and we will measure the effect of manipulating glycosphingolipid pathways by increasing neuronal GCase levels, in these same in vivo models. These experiments will provide critical analysis of the role of glycosphingolipid pathways in PD and related ?-synucleinopathies, and should provide new targets for the development of novel therapeutics to improve glycosphingolipid metabolism and prevent neurodegeneration."
"9281866","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After two decades of emphasis on valve replacement, cardiac surgeons have been gradually turning to mitral valve repair. MV repair, rather than replacement, maintains better ventricular mechanics and fewer complications, such as endocarditis, thromboembolism, and anticoagulant-related hemorrhage. Unfortunately, recent long term studies using more rigorous definitions of failure have identified less optimistic result for repair durability; bringing into question such aggressive surgical practice and suggesting that repair techniques though mature can be improved upon. In most cases, failures were a result of disruption at the leaflet, chordal, or annular suture lines. These failure modes suggest excessive tissue stress and the resulting strain induced tissue damage as an etiologic factor. Thus, there has been growing interest in developing more robust repair strategies for patients with IMR. Promising concepts include leaflet augmentation to restore leaflet mobility, and saddle shaped annuloplasty to restore normal annular shape. If designed correctly, leaflet augmentation techniques can alleviate chordal-leaflet tethering and reduce leaflet stress by promoting leaflet curvature and coaptation. Leaflet augmentation will also allow the placement of larger annuloplasty rings that should reduce annular-annuloplasty ring separation forces. We thus hypothesize that IMR repair techniques that reinstate normal annular geometry (size and shape) and restore mobile leaflet tissue will result in reduced annular and chordal force distribution compared with undersized flat annuloplasty alone. This in turn will lead to restoration of homeostatic normal tissue stress levels and MVIC biosynthetic responses, ultimately leading to improved repair durability."
"9382822","The continued rise in annual pancreatic cancer mortalities demands urgent efforts to better understand molecular mechanisms critical to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Our group and others identified the RON tyrosine kinase receptor as an overexpressed protein and potential novel therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer. The working hypothesis of our laboratory is that RON receptor signaling is a potent promoter of invasive growth and survival in human pancreatic cancer cells which uniquely also helps to shape the tumor microenvironment via its effects on myeloid cell function. Our recent studies demonstrate that RON signaling accelerates pancreatic duct neoplasia initiated by KRAS and that RON signaling in pancreatic cancer cells initiates a positive feedback loop driving expression of both RON itself and its cognate ligand, macrophage stimulating protein. We believe that RON signaling thereby serves to modify both epithelial and immune cell phenotypes to promote tumor growth, metastasis and therapeutic resistance. The goals of this application are; 1) to understand how autocrine/paracrine RON signaling influences primary pancreatic cancer growth, 2) determine the mechanisms by which RON signaling modifies the primary and metastatic niche to promote tumor dissemination and metastatic outgrowth, and 3) to test RON inhibition as an immunomodulatory strategy in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. The findings from these studies will enhance our understanding of RON biology and thereby serve to inform the development and further testing of RON- directed therapies in pancreatic cancer."

"9300706","Project Summary/Abstract Vestibular disorders affect more than 90 million individuals in the United States, leading to challenges with ac- tivities of daily living and impaired overall quality of life. Although vestibular rehabilitation may help alleviate patients? symptoms, there are currently no biological treatments to reverse vestibular dysfunction. Whereas non-mammalian species such as chickens and zebrafish robustly regenerate the mechanosensory hair cells required for function after damage, the mammalian utricle (gravity-sensing organ) is only capable of limited re- generation. Atoh1, the transcription factor required for hair cell development, has previously been used to in- duce hair cell formation. However, the molecular features and functionality of the regenerated hair cells in the spontaneously and Atoh1-overexpressed regenerating utricles have not been clearly defined. Together, these gaps in knowledge create a critical bottleneck in our attempt to better understand the mechanisms of mature mammalian hair cell regeneration. The overall objective of this proposal is to examine the molecular features and function of the hair cell- synaptic complex in the spontaneously and Atoh1-enhanced regenerating adult mouse utricle. The hypothe- sis is that maturation of the hair cell-synaptic complex correlates with improvement of vestibular function, and that this regeneration can be driven further by Atoh1 overexpression. Completion of the following specific aims should test the central hypothesis and, thereby, attain the objective of this application. Specific Aim 1: Exam- ine molecular features of the spontaneously recovering hair cell-synaptic complex. Specific Aim 2: Restore vestibular function via spatiotemporal genetic manipulation of Atoh1. We will use a Cre-LoxP based transgenic approach to fate-map supporting cells after hair cell damage in mature mice. We will serially evaluate mice for vestibular function and examine utricles histologically up to six months after damage. We will then correlate improved histology with recovery of vestibular function. Successful execution of the work described in this proposal will result in a greater understanding of the mo- lecular features of the hair cell-synaptic complex in the mammalian inner ear. This contribution will be signifi- cant in two ways: first, it will establish an important but poorly understood relationship between hair cell regen- eration and functional recovery. Secondly, it will extend our understanding of the efficacy and limitation of using Atoh1 overexpression to stimulate hair cell regeneration. Such knowledge on inner ear hair cell regeneration in preclinical models will help construct the fundamental building blocks of future therapeutics to restore vestibu- lar function in humans."
"9469450","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychosis is ranked as one of the most disabling conditions worldwide. Functional deterioration occurs at the fastest rate during the early phase of psychosis, which is both a critical period of neuronal and psychosocial plasticity and a window of opportunity during which treatment may confer disproportionately favorable outcomes. There is a large variability in the recovery trajectory and outcome of first episode of psychosis [FEP] patients. However, current algorithms do not allow differences in biological background or specific neurobiological profile to guide individualized treatments. Many neurobiological alterations, including neurocognitive deficits, subtle structural brain changes, electroencephalographic (EEG) measures, and clinical variables, collectively contribute to variance in functioning in FEP. We have used K-means multivariate classification analyses and identified three distinct Bio-classes of psychosis independent of diagnosis. Within each class, patients shared a similar neurobiological profile that uniquely distinguished among the groups. These data present a diagnosis-free approach to integrate information across biomarkers, yielding neurobiologically distinct subgroups and provide strong evidence supporting the superiority of neurobiological vs. clinical classification in differentiating psychotic disorders. Building on our prior work, the goal of this project is to stratify FEP patients into homogeneous subgroups based on patients' unique neurobiological profiles and relate these profiles to later functional outcome. This project will address four questions: 1) Are bio-classes characterized in the FEP similar to those observed in chronic psychosis patients? [Aim 1a]; 2) Are there structural neuroanatomical features associated with distinct bio-classes [Aim 1b]; 3) are bio-classes characterized at baseline predictive of later functional outcomes two years later, controlling for baseline severity and other confounding factors? [Aim 2a]; and 4) are bio-classes superior to DSM diagnoses in predicting functional outcomes? [Aim 2b]. This project will recruit a total of one hundred (n=120) FEP patients at two FEP clinics and 100 demographic matched controls. We will follow up FEP patients every 6 months for two years and collect an expanded biomarker panel as well as symptomatic and functional outcome measures at each time point. Patients will be bio-classified into one of the three bio-classes at baseline using a constellation of cognitive and EEG biomarkers. A comprehensive battery of clinical, premorbid, treatment, biomarker, and functional variables will be obtained at each time point. Brain structural measures, not used in forming the bio-classes, will be used to validate the distinctness of the bio-classes. We will examine the relationships between bio-classes and functional outcome and between DSM diagnoses and functional outcome at each time point. We will compare the two models and determine which one better explains variance in functioning after controlling potential confounding factors, such as baseline symptom severity, premorbid functioning, and duration of untreated illness."
"9295006","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Deregulated mitochondrial metabolism is associated with a variety of hematopoietic disorders, including hematological malignancies. However, it remains poorly defined how mitochondrial metabolism coordinates hematopoietic cell development. Lack of such knowledge impedes understanding of and development of therapeutics for these diseases. In the previous funding period we demonstrated that PTPMT1, a Pten-like mitochondrial phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatase, plays a unique and crucial role in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Deletion of PTPMT1 resulted in hematopoietic failure due to changes in the cell cycle and a complete block in the differentiation of HSCs. Strikingly, the absolute number of HSCs was increased by ~25-fold in the knockout mice. Moreover, although depletion of PTPMT1 from the entire hematopoietic system (including HSCs) caused hematopoietic failure and postnatal lethality, myeloid, T lymphoid, or B lymphoid lineage-specific knockout mice did not show any phenotypes, strongly suggesting that PTPMT1 is specifically important for stem cells, but not differentiated lineage progenitors. Mitochondrial aerobic metabolism of PTPMT1-depleted stem/progenitor (LSK) cells and lineage progenitors was decreased while cytosolic glycolysis was enhanced. Nevertheless, the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms by which PTPMT1 deficiency alters cellular metabolism and profoundly deregulates stem cell activities remain to be determined. The objective of this renewal application is to further understand the metabolic regulation of HSCs by defining the role and acting mechanisms of PTPMT1. The central hypothesis is that PTPMT1 coordinates HSC activities (self-renewal, differentiation, and transformation) by controlling the balance between mitochondrial metabolism and cytosolic glycolysis. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our work in the last funding cycle and recent preliminary studies. We plan to test our hypothesis and accomplish the objectives of this proposal by pursuing the following three aims. 1). To define the cellular mechanisms of the crucial role of PTPMT1 in hematopoiesis. 2). To determine the molecular mechanisms by which PTPMT1 deficiency reprograms cellular metabolism. 3). To investigate the role of PTPMT1 in leukemic transformation of stem cells and progenitors. The studies proposed in this application will greatly advance our understanding of how coordinated mitochondrial metabolism/bioenergetics, glycolysis, and glutaminolysis orchestrate HSC biology. These data will contribute to a much deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of blood disorders associated with deregulated mitochondrial function, which will help identify molecular targets for novel therapeutic interventions for these diseases."
"9377719","PROJECT SUMMARY  Mast cells play pivotal roles in the development of allergic inflammation via signaling- dependent secretion of various pro-inflammatory compounds (e.g., histamine and cytokines) that are stored in secretory granules. However, how are distinct populations of secretory granules differentially regulated to release their specific contents (called degranulation) is poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to delineate signaling-triggered regulation of mast cell secretion, revealing unique components or pathways that are amendable to biological or small molecule interventions. The overall objective of this application is to distinguish the different membrane fusion apparatuses used by mast cells to release key mediators. Based on findings from cell-based secretion assays, localization studies and reconstitution, including preliminary data from our own lab, we propose in our central hypothesis that mast cells secrete histamine, serotonin and TNF? by exploiting distinct but overlapping combinations of SNARE/SM proteins, in a fashion that is regulated via Munc18 phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we will exploit a multifaceted strategy that includes genetics, biochemistry and quantitative proteomics to pursue the following two specific aims. Aim 1 will define the respective SNARE/SM fusion apparatuses for histamine, serotonin and TNF? release. Aim 2 will assess the regulation of mast cell exocytosis via Munc18 phosphorylation. We expect the study to set the stage for uncovering signal transducers that connect signaling cascades directly to the release of specific mediators."
"9292370","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular (CV) events are the most common cause of death in adults with type 2 diabetes. While the benefits and safety of commonly used blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol medications are well established, much less is known about the CV benefits and CV risks of commonly used glucose-control strategies involving treatment with multiple glucose-lowering agents. To address this important clinical and public health concern, this project examines detailed clinical data from 1.3 million adults with treated type 2 diabetes over a 13-year period to quantify the impact of specific combinations of glucose-lowering agents on myocardial infarction, stroke, CV mortality, total mortality, and congestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalizations. We test four comparative effectiveness hypotheses to determine whether major CV events are differentially related to: (a) use of specific two-agent combinations of metformin with sulfonylurea (SU), thiazolidinedione (TZD), DPP-4 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptor agonists; (b) use of specific two-agent combinations of metformin with SU, TZD, DPP-4 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptors agonists when basal insulin is added; (c) addition of prandial insulin in subjects already using basal insulin; and (d) treatment with human insulin versus analog insulin. Analysis employs modern comparative effectiveness statistical approaches, including new user designs and marginal structural modeling (MSM) with inverse probability weighting (IPW) and targeted minimal loss-based estimation (TMLE) which, under certain conditions, allow proper adjustment for time-dependent confounders on the causal pathway between early exposures and clinical outcomes, as well as proper adjustment for selection bias due to informative censoring. The study results have the potential to substantially improve CV outcomes in millions of Americans with type 2 diabetes by identifying which commonly used glucose-lowering regimens maximize CV benefits and minimize CV risks."
"9380727","PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the highest mortality rate of all cancers, is rapidly becoming the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., and is estimated to cost the health care system $2.4 billion each year. Patients with PDAC have a 5-year survival rate of 7% and that number drops to 2% for individuals with metastatic disease. Unfortunately, there has been little progress in shifting patient outcome over the past 40 years, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to define the molecular pathways that influence PDAC development. PDAC can be initiated in exocrine epithelial cells that acquire an activating mutation in the KRAS protooncogene, causing the cells to transition to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions that can progress into PDAC. A key transcriptional response to KRAS activity is increased expression of the physiological activator of the coagulation system, Tissue Factor (TF). TF mediates conversion of prothrombin to the active protease thrombin that in turn promotes extensive fibrin deposits within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and activates G-protein coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs) on target cells, including PDAC tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The scientific premise is based on a known relationship between pancreatic cancer and high-level blood coagulation system activity, but is unique in that it will define newly discovered mechanisms of crosstalk by which specific coagulation factors in the TME promote PDAC pathogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that thrombin drives early PanIN development as well as advanced PDAC tumor growth and metastasis by mechanisms linked to both fibrin matrix deposition in the TME and PAR-1 signaling on tumor and TME cells promoting a feed forward pathway of PDAC disease. This hypothesis will be tested by utilizing a combination of unique genetically engineered mouse models, cutting-edge pharmaceutical reagents, and patient-derived PDAC tumor cells to pursue three Specific Aims - (1) determine how the thrombin-fibrin axis contributes to early PanIN development and late stage PDAC tumor growth and metastasis; (2) determine the individual mechanisms by which thrombin receptor PAR-1 signaling on tumor cells, TAMs and CAFs exacerbates distinct aspects of PDAC pathogenesis; and (3) determine the efficacy of pharmacological fibrin and PAR-1 inhibition in halting the progression of established mouse PDAC and human patient-derived xenograft tumors. These studies are significant because they will (i) be the first to define the impact of thrombin throughout PDAC disease; (ii) identify specific mechanisms of thrombin-dependent PDAC disease progression; and (iii) provide novel opportunities to target PDAC tumors using specific state-of-the-art inhibitors of fibrin matrix and PAR-1 signaling pathways. The discoveries made will greatly advance the understanding of mechanisms underlying PDAC disease and are expected to highlight novel therapeutic opportunities for developing improved treatment options - a long-term goal with the greatest benefit to patient outcome."
"9263980","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translation of mRNAs normally terminates at the first in-frame stop codon encountered by the ribosome; however, in some circumstances, translation can continue beyond the stop codon to a downstream stop codon, generating a novel protein with a C-terminal polypeptide extension. Such translational readthrough (TR) events are best understood in viruses, and evidence for TR of vertebrate mRNAs has been accumulating in the last two years. However, essentially nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate TR in vertebrate mRNAs. We have recently reported that protein-driven, programmed TR of human VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor-A) mRNA in endothelial cells (EC) generates a novel isoform of VEGF-A, a secreted angiogenic mitogen that regulates blood vessel formation. Readthrough generates a protein termed VEGF-Ax (x for extended) containing a 22-amino acid C-terminus extension. Remarkably, the RNA sequence that encodes the 22-amino acid extension also functions as a recoding cis-acting element (Ax element) essential for efficient TR. Readthrough is stimulated by interaction of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2B1 with the Ax element. Recent preliminary studies show an ensemble of proteins, including hnRNP L, DDX5, and HuR, also bind the Ax element. VEGF-Ax expression is down-regulated during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, but is remarkably efficient in human platelets. Based on these initial studies, we propose the following specific hypothesis: Assembly of a multiprotein complex on the structured VEGFA mRNA Ax element interacts with the ribosome or release factors to recode the canonical stop codon, regulating cell- and context-dependent TR and VEGF-Ax generation. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Identify Ax element-binding trans-acting factors (AxE-TAF) and their role in TR of VEGFA mRNA in EC. We will identify and validate AxE-TAFs, and determine their interactions with each other, their affinities for the Ax element, and their influence on TR efficiency. We will also investigate the role of post-translational modifications (PTM) of these factors on their interactions and cell localization. Aim 2. Investigate determinants of cell- and context-dependent TR efficiency of VEGFA mRNA. We will investigate the mechanisms underlying suppressed VEGF-Ax production during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, and extraordinarily efficient VEGF-Ax expression in human platelets. We will determine the influence of localization, expression, and PTM of regulatory trans-acting factors on assembly of the readthrough complex, binding to the Ax element, and readthrough efficiency. Aim 3. Determine molecular mechanisms regulating translational readthrough of VEGFA mRNA. We will determine the folding structure of the Ax RNA element and its functional regions and residues. We will test the hypothesis that readthrough is promoted by the interaction of AxE-TAFs with ribosomes or ribosomal release factors, and identify the tRNA responsible for Ser insertion. TR has recently emerged as a mechanism of expansion of the human proteome. Successful completion of the proposed studies will not only elucidate mechanisms of readthrough of VEGFA mRNA, but also will provide a foundation for investigation of mechanisms regulating TR of other mRNAs and systems."
"9278074","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The goal of this project is to characterize sex differences in mechanisms of fear extinction learning and retention that may account for differences in vulnerability for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in women versus men. A mechanism proposed to account for recovery from traumatic stress is variability in the extinction of conditioned fear. While several studies have examined sex differences in fear conditioning and extinction in healthy individuals, it is notable that few studies have systematically examined sex differences in these measures in individuals with PTSD, which may represent a more vulnerable group. Our pilot data of individuals with PTSD suggest that women have increased fear conditioning and decreased extinction learning and recall, which may provide a mechanism that could explain the epidemiological findings. Another promising discovery that may explain differential vulnerability in some women is related to the peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), which is a regulator of the stress response. Higher levels of PACAP have been associated with greater fear conditioning and PTSD presence and severity in women, but not men. Furthermore, estrogen modulates PACAP and has also been associated with enhanced extinction retention. However, PACAP has not been studied for potential effects on extinction. We propose to conduct a laboratory study of fear conditioning in male and female veterans with and without PTSD to establish whether there are sex differences in fear extinction learning and retention in PTSD. This study will also examine the role of PACAP in explaining PTSD group and sex differences in extinction ability. We will recruit medically healthy trauma-exposed PTSD+ and PTSD- male and pre-menopausal female veterans for participation in this study (n=108). Four age-matched groups (n=27 per group) will consist of: 1) PTSD+ female veterans; 2) PTSD- female veterans; 3) PTSD+ male veterans; 4) PTSD- male veterans. Participants will be trained in a 10-day fear conditioning task. On Day 1, they will be presented with computer- generated neutral images that are paired (CS+) or unpaired (CS-) with a mild electrical shock (US) and skin conductance responses will be assessed throughout. On Day 4, participants will undergo extinction training, in which they will be shown the images but will not receive shock. Participants will return on Day 11 for an evaluation of the durability of extinction. Blood samples will be drawn prior to each session to assess for levels of PACAP and estrogen. We predict that PTSD participants will have decreased fear extinction learning and retention compared to participants without PTSD. We also predict that men will have greater fear extinction learning and retention compared to women. Women with PTSD will have decreased extinction learning and retention compared to women without PTSD and men. We also predict that PACAP will be associated with decreased extinction learning and retention in women, but not in men. Among women, PACAP levels will be higher in PTSD+ participants compared to PTSD- participants. We will also explore whether lower PACAP accompanied by higher estrogen will be associated with greater extinction learning and retention. The ultimate goal of this research is to characterize sex differences in fear extinction processes in order to advance the identification of the pathophysiology of PTSD that may vary by sex and may be influenced by PACAP and sex hormones."
"9379006","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NSAIDs significantly reduce the incidence and risk of death from colorectal cancer, but their long-term use for chemoprevention is not recommended because of potentially fatal side-effects resulting from cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and the suppression of physiological prostaglandins. Some investigators have concluded that the mechanism for the anticancer activity of NSAIDs may not require COX inhibition, but involves selective apoptosis induction of neoplastic cells and suggest that safer and more efficacious non-COX inhibitory derivatives can be developed by targeting the underlying pathway leading to apoptosis. We have extensively studied the mechanism by which the NSAID sulindac induces apoptosis and reported that this activity is closely associated with its ability to inhibit cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE), which activates cGMP/protein kinase G signaling to suppress oncogenic ¿-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcriptional activity and the synthesis of key cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin D1 and survivin. We recently discovered that PDE10 is a critically important target of sulindac, which is elevated in colon tumors and essential for tumor cell growth. Using the indene scaffold of sulindac, we synthesized a series of non-COX inhibitory derivatives that selectively inhibit PDE10 and tumor cell growth. A prototype inhibitor, MCI-020 was identified with strong antitumor activity and the potential to inhibit metastasis. Further chemical optimization of MCI-020 and studies to better define the role of PDE10 in colorectal tumorigenesis are, however, necessary to develop this approach for chemoprevention. The following aims are proposed: 1) design and synthesize novel sulindac derivatives with selectivity to inhibit PDE10, 2) evaluate PDE10 selectivity and in vitro anticancer activity of sulindac derivatives, 3) determine in vivo anticancer activity of promising sulindac derivatives in mouse models of colon tumor growth and metastasis, and 4) measure PDE10 expression during colon tumorigenesis in whole animals and human clinical samples. The goal is to identify a lead compound with safety and efficacy attributes that will merit consideration for clinical trials. Elucidation of the role of PDE10 in colorectal tumorigeness may also provide insight to biomarkers and imaging methods for the early detection of cancer using radiopharmaceuticals."
"9438581","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injuries of mature central nervous system (CNS) axons result in loss of vital functions due to the failure of CNS axons regeneration. Neutralizing extracellular inhibitory molecules yields only limited regeneration or functional recovery in vivo, suggesting a critical role for neuron-intrinsic factors. As it has become apparent that the PTEN/mTOR pathway is critical for CNS axon regeneration, understanding the regrowth control of this pathway represents the first step toward developing novel therapeutic approaches to neural injury. Unfortunately, mTOR over-activity can result in tumor formation, metabolic diseases, and neurological disorders. It is therefore critically important to identify the specific downstream effectors by which PTEN/mTOR promotes axon regeneration, and to isolate them from other targets that mediate mTOR's deleterious effects. Using the anatomical and technical advantages of retinal ganglion cell and optic nerve as a CNS injury model, we have identified crucial regulators of axon growth, and are now ideally positioned to elucidate the downstream mechanisms by which PTEN/mTOR stimulates regeneration in mature CNS axons and identify translational targets of PTEN/mTOR govern adult CNS axon regeneration. These effectors are ideal therapeutic targets to promote regeneration in CNS injury and diseases, which can be selectively activated without activating other, potentially harmful pathways, thus to assist in safely translating our findings into novel neural repair treatments to preserve vital functions in patients with CNS injuries."

Mechanisms are in place for the Administrative Core to catalyze interactions among the diverse Research Base and to attract new members to CF related research through pilot grants and interactive research and seminar series. This multidisciplinary, interactive approach is necessary for a productive P30 Center, especially one that connects basic findings to therapeutic modalities. It is the task of the Administrative Core to provide the matrix for these interactions. Therefore, the Administrative Core must succeed in coordinating and integrating the Center's functions and maintaining lines of communication between the Research Base, the Research Cores and P/F projects. Individuals identified as CF investigators come from 10 academic departments across the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), a testament to the breadth and diversity of our Research Base. Thus, the aims of the Administrative Core are to work with the Center Steering Committee (Drs. Frizzell, Pilewski and Kolls) to integrate and coordinate the Center's programs and its scientific interactions across the University and with outside collaborators. It administers the selection and execution of the pilot/feasibility projects and supports interactions of P/F PIs with the Research Base and the Cores. It organizes the enrichment activities, including internal and external seminars, journal clubs and joint lab meetings, and it operates a yearly outside review of the Center by experts in the CF field, some of whom are Center Directors. The Core maintains the Center's website to inform the community of Center events, news, funding opportunities, publications, key people, links and contact information. Overall, the Administrative Core enhances the Center by identifying new directions and new investigators to engage in multi-disciplinary, innovative basic, translational, and clinical CF research for the Center's goal of identifying and applying novel therapeutic strategies to improve the quality of life and life expectancy for CF patients."
"9278068","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         ABSTRACT:  Breathing instability during sleep, which is a hallmark of sleep apnea, is characterized by recurring cycles of apnea followed by hyperpnea. These recurring cycles lead to intermittent hypoxia (IH) and excessive arousal from sleep, which may result in a number of pathophysiological conditions including daytime sleepiness and hypertension. In recent years, the role of an endogenous circadian rhythm in modulating the severity of many disorders has become evident. Accordingly, the severity of sleep apnea may be modulated in part by a circadian timing system, principally through the modification of mechanisms that impact on breathing stability. These modifications might include alterations in chemoreflex properties (i.e. sensitivity or threshold of response) or control of upper airway muscle activity. Thus, the overlying objective of this proposal is to determine if an endogenous circadian rhythm modulates mechanisms, directly or indirectly via the expression of respiratory plasticity (long-term facilitation of minute ventilation and upper airway muscle), which ultimately improves breathing stability during sleep at specific points within a 24 hour day/night cycle.  Aim 1 of our proposal will establish if breathing instability is reduced during daytime compared to nighttime sleep. This aim will also test the hypothesis that increased stability is associated with reduced chemoreflex sensitivity to carbon dioxide, an increased carbon dioxide reserve and enhanced neuromuscular control of upper airway muscles (i.e. mechanisms that impact on breathing stability) during sleep in the daytime compared to the nighttime. Aim 2 of our proposal will establish if forms of respiratory plasticity that promote breathing stability (i.e. ventilatory lon-term facilitation and long-term facilitation of upper airway muscle activity) are enhanced in the day compared to the night. Likewise, this aim will establish if enhancement of these forms of plasticity leads to an improvement in breathing stability that exceeds measures obtained before exposure to intermittent hypoxia. Aim 3 is designed to determine whether or not the therapeutic pressure required for the elimination of breathing events in individuals with sleep apnea will be less in the afternoon or evening compared to the early morning in accordance with circadian modulation of mechanisms that impact breathing stability. Likewise, this aim will determine if the therapeutic pressure required to eliminate apnea at a given time of day is less after the initiatio of respiratory plasticity following exposure to IH or sustained mild hypercapnia.  If mechanisms and forms of respiratory plasticity that impact on breathing stability are modulated by a circadian rhythm this will ultimately impact on the treatment of sleep apnea. Patients could derive benefit from scheduling naps at times when breathing is most stable. Likewise, therapeutic pressures required to treat apnea would be less under conditions of increased breathing stability which could improve treatment compliance. Moreover, novel adjunct therapies such as intermittent hypoxia administered in combination with continuous positive airway pressure (i.e. a well-established treatment for sleep apnea) could result in reduced therapeutic pressures particularly if treatment was administered at times when the magnitude of respiratory plasticity and breathing stability were at their peak."
"9243537","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT I am applying to renew my Mid-career Investigator Award in Patient Oriented Research (K24) in order to support my research and mentoring efforts. I am fully committed to patient oriented research and to training the next generation of researchers in nephrology research. I have developed a research program studying physical functioning in patients on dialysis, characterizing their limitations, studying the pathophysiology, and evaluating interventions to improve functioning. While my previous and currently funded work aims to assess frailty and its evolution among patients on dialysis, I am convinced that physical function and frailty could add important information to inform clinical care at other points along the spectrum of CKD. In particular, I plan to expand my focus to the transitions of care from non-dialysis requiring CKD to ESRD and from dialysis to transplantation. Aims are to examine associations of functional status during CKD with outcomes during ESRD in a national cohort of veterans and to measure physical performance in a cohort of kidney transplant candidates to determine the extent to which post-transplant outcomes are related to physical performance and frailty during pre-transplant evaluation. I have a strong track record of mentoring, and I work within a rich, supportive, and collegial environment at UCSF and in the Division of Nephrology. Continued K24 funding will permit me to continue to focus more of my time on research and mentoring and less on clinical and administrative work."
"9403383","Project Summary  One third of the world's population carries the infectious agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that causes tuberculosis (TB). Current treatments for TB disease are not straightforward. Drug resistance to TB drugs results from insufficient treatments that select for resistance, as well as from inherently resistant popula- tions. Because of the arduous and difficult to follow regimen for TB treatment, there were approximately 480,000 cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and 100,000 cases of rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) in 2015. Treatment of MDR-TB has a 52% success rate, and about 15% of cases develop into extensively-drug resistant TB (XDR-TB), which has been found in 117 countries.  Multi-drug resistant TB requires treatment for two years with a cocktail of at least 5 drugs. New drug with mechanisms of action that eradicate persistence and drug tolerant populations will reduce treatment times and the spread of virulent drug resistant strains. We propose that Mtb cholesterol metabolism contributes to persis- tence in the host and presents a target for therapeutics with new mechanisms of action. Our studies will pro- vide much needed information about mechanism of oxidative stress resistance in Mtb and how these mecha- nisms are tied to cholesterol metabolism. Upon completion, (1) we will identify the molecular target of a TB drug potentiator that has the capacity to shorten TB treatment times. (2) We will characterize the biochemical function of a regulon that is only encoded in mycobacterial pathogens, and which our preliminary data suggest contains the target of our potentiators. (3) We will model control of metabolite flow between cholesterol catabo- lism and ROS resistance pathways. Taken together, these studies will identify vulnerable targets for drug dis- covery that eliminates Mtb persistence and drug tolerance."
"9313255","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Corneal ectasia is a major cause of impaired vision-related quality of life in the United States and a leading indication for corneal transplantation.  The lack of clinical tools for resolving biomechanical properties throughout the cornea is a critical barrier to understanding mechanisms of corneal instability and applying potentially transformative bioengineering approaches to risk screening and treatment optimization.  The goal of this research program is to develop a robust OCT-based simulation platform for quantifying ectasia risk and predicting individual responses to a broad range of corneal treatments.  The objective, which is aided by the sensitive link between corneal shape and visual function, is to identify the key structural predictors of ectatic disease and develop rationl approaches to customized crosslinking therapy through integrated patient- specific biomechanical measurement and modeling.  The central hypothesis is that the magnitude and distribution of biomechanical properties in the cornea are key drivers of corneal shape.  This hypothesis and the methods for testing it have been developed in part through the applicants' preliminary work in corneal optical coherence elastography (OCE) and in patient-specific finite element (FE) analysis studies that suggest important dependencies between material properties and shape.  The hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims:  1) Characterize the magnitude and distribution of corneal biomechanical properties across normal, surgically altered and pathologic states, 2) determine the accuracy of elastography-driven FE models for predicting outcomes of corneal interventions in donor eyes and patients, and 3) identify the key biomechanical drivers of keratoconus progression, post-refractive surgery ectasia, and crosslinking response using patient-specific simulations.  Under Aim 1, OCE will be used in donor eye and clinical studies to test the hypothesis that the human cornea has intrinsic regional differences in biomechanical properties that are altered in characteristic ways by LASIK, keratoconus and collagen crosslinking.  After generating FE models using subject-specific geometry for all pre-intervention eyes in Aim 1, Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that models populated with subject-specific OCE property data better predict outcomes than those with idealized bulk property estimates.  Finally, in large-scale, multifactorial FE simulations using al normal and keratoconic patients as modeling substrates, Aim 3 will determine how elastic properties, initial corneal geometry and procedure variables interact to influence ectasia risk and crosslinking responses.  Expected outcomes include clinical translation of OCT-based capabilities for mapping corneal biomechanical properties and generating patient-specific computational models capable of predicting treatment responses.  Simulation-based optimizations will support novel, customizable calculators for ectasia risk and new algorithms for enhancing the effects of collagen crosslinking in individual eyes.  These outcomes directly address gaps identified by the NEI and will enable new simulation-based treatment strategies for existing and emerging corneal procedures."
"9502000","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching objective of the University Of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Specialized Center Of Research on Sex Differences (UCAMC SCOR) is to develop an interdisciplinary and translational research program to advance the understanding of the Bioenergetic and Metabolic Consequences of the Loss of Gonadal Function. There is compelling evidence from studies of laboratory animals that gonadectomy causes a dramatic decrease of 30-80% in spontaneous physical activity in males and females. Even more intriguing is the observation that this results in excess weight gain, a marked increase in visceral fat, and metabolic dysfunction in female animals but not males. If such findings are relevant to humans, the age related decline in gonadal function may be an important independent determinant of disease risk. Moreover, this would be expected to have a greater adverse effect on the health of women than men, because the loss of gonadal function occurs at an earlier age in women. There will be three SCOR Research Projects to advance novel research in this area: 1) Project I (clinical): Bioenergetic and Metabolic Consequences of the Loss of Ovarian Function in Women (PI: W Kohrt); 2) Project II (preclinical): Effects of Pre-existing Obesity on Consequences of the Loss of Ovarian Function (PI: P MacLean); and 3) Project III (basic): Sex Hormones Differentially Regulate Production of Distinct Adipocyte Populations (PI: D Klemm). The Administrative Core will contribute to the success of the SCOR by: 1) providing scientific leadership for a focused translational and transdisciplinary research program on the consequences of the loss of gonadal function; 2) monitoring the productivity of SCOR Research Projects; 3) expanding the scope of the SCOR through an Ancillary Projects program; 4) expanding the cadre of investigators conducting research on the gonadal regulation of energy balance and metabolism through the Ancillary Projects program; 5) integrating activities of the SCOR with closely partnered programs at UCAMC, including the Center on Aging, the BIRCWH, the Center for Women's Health Research, the Nutrition and Obesity Research Center, the Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development program, and the Colorado Clinical and Translational Science Institute; 6) providing biostatistical and data  management support for the SCOR research projects; and 7) providing administrative support for financial oversight, regulatory oversight, and scheduling and general management of SCOR activities."

"9246689","The structural elements of the cell are never randomly distributed. Both the cytoplasm and nucleus are organized into different functional regions. The mechanisms of regionalization are important for understanding normal cellular physiology as well as disease states such as cancer or neurological diseases. Viruses take advantage of the regional organization within their host cells, resulting in enhanced virus replication and pathogenicity. The question of regionalization of the cytoplasm is a particularly important one for the nucleoprotein core (nucleocapsid) of negative strand RNA viruses because of the diversity of roles nucleocapsids play in the virus replication cycle. In particular, their roles as templates for viral RNA synthesis occur in regions of the cytoplasm that are distinct from the sites at which they are incorporated into progeny virions by budding from the host plasma membrane. Nucleocapsids are too large to diffuse freely in the cytoplasm, so there must be specific transport mechanisms to ensure their proper distribution. The proposed experiments address these mechanisms for the prototype negative strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus. We have developed two new cellular imaging approaches to quantify the movement of cellular elements to address these hypotheses. The first approach, which we call the border-to-border distribution method, quantifies the steady state distribution. The second involves improvement of live cell imaging approaches to determine the kinetics of particle movement that are particularly well suited to analyze actin-dependent motion. Using these approaches, our data show that nucleocapsids are transported toward the cell periphery by both actin filaments and microtubules. However, our data indicate that actin filaments are more important than microtubules in reaching the ultimate sites of virus assembly. Furthermore, the distribution of nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm appears to be coupled to membranes of the secretory pathway. These new analytical tools will be used in Aim 1 to determine the role of different myosin motors in establishing the distribution of nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm and incorporation into virions. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the dependence of nucleocapsid distribution on cellular membranes of the secretory pathway. These experiments will focus on GTP-binding proteins involved in membrane sorting and transport, and host membrane proteins associated with membrane-bound nucleocapsids identified by a series of new proteomics experiments. In Aim 3 the mechanisms of nucleocapsid distribution in polarized epithelial cells and neurons will be determined, since these represent the cell types involved in the natural infection by VSV. The proposed experiments challenge and seek to shift the current thinking on the mechanisms of interaction of viral capsids with the host cytoskeleton and membranes. They are also based on novel concepts and analytical methods that should be of general applicability in cell biology."
"9463221","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a well-validated drug target for the development of therapeutics for the treatment of obesity and disease cachexia. More recent studies suggest potential applications for MC4R compounds in diabetes and aspects of metabolic syndrome, depression related anorexia and anhedonia, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Clinical trials for treatment of common obesity using potent orthosteric agonists of the MC4R have failed, however, due to unacceptable target-mediated pressor activity. Two independent studies, however, have identified peptide MSH analogues that produce significant weight loss without a pressor response. Therefore, we hypothesize that the weight loss and pressor actions of MC4R can be discriminated pharmacologically, given a more thorough understanding of the mode(s) and site(s) of action of MC4R signaling in weight loss and cardiovascular regulation. During the previous funding period, we conducted a high throughput screen for positive allosteric modulators of the MC4R that identified a collection of 165 receptor-specific compounds in multiple mechanistic classes, and have demonstrated in vivo activity for several of these. Allosteric modulators of the MC4R should be applicable to treatment of syndromic obesity through restoration of normal levels of receptor activity in melanocortin receptor haploinsufficiency, a syndrome responsible for up to 5% of early onset obesity, and indeed a subset of our compounds are currently in the drug development pipeline at GSK. However, allosteric modulators of GPCRs, known to often exhibit excellent receptor subtype, ligand, and signaling mode specificity, are also outstanding tools for probing receptor function. We have also made significant progress in the identification of differentiated modes of MC4R signaling in vivo. During the previous funding period, we identified two novel signaling modalities of the receptor, melanocortin receptor associated protein 2 (MRAP2) mediated receptor-sensitization, and coupling of the receptor to an inwardly-rectifying K channel, Kir7.1 that is essential for depolarization of hypothalamic MC4R neurons by ?-MSH. In this application, we propose to use the unique pharmacological tools described above, and a set of tissue-specific knockout mice that delete G?s, Kir7.1, MRAP2, and ?-arrestin1 signaling in MC4R neurons to test the hypothesis that MC4R PAMS can correct melanocortin haploinsufficiency, and to identify the mode(s) and site(s) of action of MC4R in mediating its well-characterized weight loss, pressor, and cardioacceleratory effects. The results of this research program should 1) advance our understanding of the unique pharmacological properties of the MC4R, 2) enhance our understanding of the central control of energy homeostasis, 3) provide a unique set of pharmacological and genetic tools for the research community, and 4) provide the basic knowledge necessary to effectively utilize the MC4R as a drug target."
"9278085","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background: Cognitive decline is a major threat to the elderly, which can be expected to accelerate as life expectancy increases. Extensive evidence indicates cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) are also associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline. This evidence, however, comes from samples predominantly under age 75. Findings from our group and others suggest that relationships between high levels of CVRFs with poor cognitive outcomes may be diminished or reversed in older samples. Thus, such risk factors might be useful as indicators for successful cognitive aging - maintaining intact cognition into old age despite a high risk of cognitive decline. For example, in cross-sectional analyses, our group has found provocative associations of greater levels of the C-reactive protein (CRP) - a marker for inflammation associated with cognitive decline in the younger elderly - with better, not worse, memory in very old (75+ years) subjects, and also with lower risk for dementia in their family members. The e4 allele of the APOE gene is conclusively associated with increased risk for cognitive decline and AD, but this association diminishes with increasing age. This interaction of APOE-e4 and age may also be interpreted as a stronger association of age with cognitive decline for those without the APOE-e4 allele. Similar provocative interactions with age have been observed with several other CVRFs - total cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, and ejection fraction, a direct measure of heart function. Methods: We will study very old, cognitively intact, community-dwelling, male Veterans recruited from the James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Some of the subjects have already been consented, assessed for CVRFs and cognition at baseline, and followed cognitively at least once. We will continue to follow these subjects cognitively, and supplement them by recruiting additional very old Group 1 scores Veterans. We will focus on five baseline CVRFs as predictors of longitudinal cognitive change. Objectives: Aim 1 assesses total cholesterol, CRP, hemoglobin A1c, ejection fraction, systolic blood pressure as predictors of the rate of longitudinal cognitive decline. We hypothesize that putatively high risk baseline levels of CVRFs will be associated with a lower rate of decline of memory function. Aim 2 compares these associations for subjects over age 85 at entry (oldest-old) with those between age 75-84 (moderately-old). We hypothesize that baseline CVRF levels associated with greater cardiovascular risk in the young elderly will be associated with lower rates of decline of memory function in the oldest old than the moderately old. Aim 3 compares these associations by the presence or absence of the apoliprotein E4 allele. We hypothesize that baseline CVRF levels associated with greater cardiovascular risk in the young elderly will be associated with lower rates of decline of memory function in subjects without an APOE-e4 allele than in those with it. Public Health Implications: Since there are few studies focusing on very old males, this study will have major public health implications for elderly veterans, and the general population. Identifying subgroups with particularly high risk associated with CVRFs has the potential for targeting preventions against or treatments of cognitive decline. The innovation of this study is seeking predictors of cognitive success in very old male veterans who are high risk for impairment, which may lead to identification of protective or preventive factors."
"9354275","OVERALL ? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Age related diseases causing dementia are an increasing global, social and economic catastrophe that mandates broad and aggressive research. Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects over 5 million people in the US alone. Vascular contributions to dementia and AD are increasingly recognized. However, the role of the cerebrovascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD, and the underlying neurovascular mechanisms remain, to date, largely unknown and under- researched, representing a critical barrier in the field. The overall goals of this program are to advance current knowledge on the vascular contributions to dementia and AD, and establish whether the neurovasculature plays a major role in cognitive decline, and therefore is a key new therapeutic target to treat dementia and AD. This is a program project application with multiple projects, cores, institutions and investigators. It represents an integrated whole far greater than the sum of its parts. Each project and core complements the others so that a synergistic relationship among them is achieved with a common focus on goals of the program, namely to test the neurovascular hypothesis of AD. This hypothesis holds that cerebrovascular dysfunction and disruption in the neurovascular integrity underlies and contributes to the onset and progression of cognitive decline. We have enlisted established clinical and translational research groups that collectively bring significant expertise in all aspects of the research plan and each have contributed productively over many years to the study of dementia and AD. To test the ?neurovascular hypothesis?, the participating investigators will apply cutting-edge molecular and imaging methods. We will perform parallel studies with analogous measures in humans and rats in two AD genetic risk groups with the major genetic risk factors for late-onset AD, i.e., apolipoprotein E-?4 (APOE4) gene and early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), i.e., presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations that both develop early vascular dysfunction and significant cerebrovascular pathology, and in the rat model of AD (line TgF344-AD) that faithfully recapitulates the rich clinico-pathological spectrum of human AD including the presence of early vascular dysfunction and cerebrovascular pathology. Central to our approach is our commitment to take a new research direction with the overarching goal to provide an answer to the broader question; ?what is the role of the vascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD?, and ?what is the prognostic and diagnostic value of neurovascular molecular and imaging biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline?. The relationship between neurovascular integrity, brain connectivity and cognitive function has not been explored. The collective expertise of the investigators, overall environment, preliminary results, and experimental design for each of the projects and supporting cores hold tremendous promise for the success of this program. We are confident that the proposed studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of pathogenesis, treatment, and early prevention of dementia and AD."
"9304306","ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by frequent arousals from sleep due to closure of the upper airway, producing hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide levels) and hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels). The consequences of OSA include excessive daytime sleepiness, cognitive deficits, as well as respiratory, metabolic, and cardiovascular disorders. Despite its importance in OSA-induced arousals and sleep fragmentation, very little is known about the neural mechanisms that mediate arousals during OSA. Recent work indicates that the brainstem glutamatergic neurons of the parabrachial complex (PB), which receive visceral and respiratory input, are important for hypercapnic arousal. We hypothesize that the PB projections to the basal forebrain (BF), a region containing cortically projecting & wakefulness promoting neurons, mediate the cortical arousal response to the hypercapnia. Sleep apnea will be modeled in mice by exposure to hypercapnia during sleep, termed repetitive carbon dioxide-mediated arousals (RCA). Optogenetic techniques will be used to investigate the roles of three neurotransmitter-defined subpopulations of cortically-projecting BF neurons in apnea-induced arousals: GABAergic parvalbumin positive (PV), cholinergic, and glutamatergic neurons. For each identified BF neurotransmitter phenotype we will address the criteria of: 1) sufficiency for arousal by optogenetic excitation using Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2); 2) necessity for arousal by optogenetic inhibition of RCA using Archaerhodopsin (ArchT); and 3) relevance of our optogenetic findings to natural physiological conditions by recording the electrical activity of RCA -related BF neurons whose neurotransmitter phenotype has been defined by short latency excitation by ChR2. Each neuronal BF population will be evaluated as mice are exposed to RCA or acoustic stimuli; we predict both stimuli will arouse, as our data point to the BF as a final common pathway leading to cortical arousal from both visceral and external sensory stimuli. Our preliminary data point to PV GABergic neurons as the most important for RCA and acoustic arousals: 1) ChR2 excitation of BF PV neurons causes arousal and EEG activation including high frequency oscillations; 2) PV ArchT inhibition markedly prolongs the latency to RCA arousal; and 3) PV unit recordings show activation in concert with cortical activation. In contrast, ChR2 stimulation of BF cholinergic neurons shows more modulatory, less powerful and less immediate effects on cortical activation than PV neurons. We predict that glutamatergic BF neurons will play a role in promoting arousal, but not high frequency oscillations. If successful, these experiments would suggest that blocking BF activation, especially that from GABAergic PV neurons, would increase the cortical arousal threshold, and thus would treat the sleep fragmentation evident in apnea and responsible for many of the symptoms of OSA. Improved understanding of the neural mechanisms controlling cortical arousals in OSA will guide therapeutic treatment aiming to decrease cortical arousals while maintaining airway patency."

"9282554","The long-term goal of Project 1 is to identify mechanisms responsible for more efficient DNA repair in long-lived  species. Accumulation of somatic mutations and genomic rearrangements is believed to be a  contributing cause of aging. Genomic rearrangements, arising from errors during repair of DNA breaks are a  characteristic feature of aged tissues. DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are repaired by two pathways  homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Our preliminary data indicate that the efficiency  of both NHEJ and HR pathways strongly correlates with maximum lifespan. We have also demonstrated that  SIRT6 protein is an upstream regulator of both NHEJ and HR pathways and is the only factor capable of  stimulating both pathways of repair, and of rescuing the declining NHEJ and HR in senescent human cells.  We hypothesize that variations in SIRT6 function contribute to the differences in DSB repair across species.  Our objectives are to characterize the differences in SIRT6 function between short- and long-species, as well  as to identify novel factors responsible for more efficient DSB repair in long-lived species. We propose to: (1)  perform detailed biochemical analysis of SIRT6 from 18 rodent species and identify the properties that  distinguish SIRT6 in long-lived species; test, in collaboration with Project 3, whether more efficient SIRT6  function in long-lived species leads to lower mutation loads; (2) Identify the differences in upstream  regulation of SIRT6 and its downstream targets between the short- and long-lived rodents; (3) Characterize,  in collaboration with Project 4, novel DSB repair genes that contribute to more efficient DSB repair in long-lived  species. Gore B will provide access to primary cell collections and Core C will assist with statistical  analysis and sequence analysis of newly cloned genes. The results of Project 1 will determine the  mechanisms responsible for more efficient DNA DSB repair in long-lived species.

"9278075","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an extreme and sustained maladaptive response to traumatic events. PTSD is a major cause of mental health morbidity and loss of function in affected individuals. Two symptom clusters - re-experiencing symptoms, which include intrusive memories and thoughts, sometimes triggered by environmental cues, and hyperarousal symptoms, characterized by a tonic state of concern and active monitoring of the environment for threat - are particularly debilitating for maintaining effective occupational and social functioning. Individuals with PTSD are prone to re-experience the trauma in a variety of settings and in response to a variety of cues that often differ from the initial traumatic event. Fear generalization and contextualization paradigms provide models to test hypothesized alterations in functional brain regions and connectivity in PTSD that is biased to interpreting cues in the environment as trauma relevant, thus maintaining re-experiencing symptoms. Hyperarousal symptoms are characterized by constant threat monitoring. A predator stress model, which examines vigilance and active coping responses to imminent threats, is useful to test changes in systems that manage multiple, competing demands created by a threatening environment. We propose to test a neural circuit model that forms the basis of re-experiencing and hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD. The functional components of the network model include a threat-alerting system that consists of the amygdala, extended amygdala/ventral striatum, insula, and ventromedial PFC, and a threat-assessing system that consists of hippocampus, anterior cingulate, dorsal striatum, dorsomedial PFC, precuneus, and ventrolateral PFC. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of the re-experiencing and hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD, we have developed a series of interactive paradigms of fear learning and threat-based arousal for the fMRI setting that contain features of computer gaming and virtual reality to identify the relevant dysfunction in connectivity patterns within the proposed brain network. These tasks will be conducted in Veterans with PTSD returning from post-9/11 operations in the Middle East and combat-exposed controls, and brain network relationships will be correlated with current PTSD symptoms. The insights gained into the pathogenesis of PTSD will lay the groundwork for developing future therapeutic interventions that are targeted to symptoms."

"9404773","Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed. Findings will provide fresh guidance for public health interventions targeting early HIV testing and linkage to and retention in HIV medical care for SC HIV-infected individuals."

"9261732","Proposal Summary/Abstract  American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN) are disproportionately impacted by adverse outcomes associated with risky sexual behavior and substance use. Literature suggests these health harming behaviors begin in early adolescence, before the age of 13. Therefore, early intervention that focuses on precursors to risky behaviors is essential to preventing early sexual experience, substance use, and the associated negative health outcomes. Unfortunately, there is limited research that focuses on the development of risk resistive skills, such as self-efficacy, on reducing risky health behaviors among AIAN early adolescents. This study proposes to address this gap by examining the development of self-efficacy and the factors that shape the identified trajectories in order to effectively intervene. Because AIAN youth experience higher rates of exposure to adverse social and physical environment, which is hypothesized to alter the development of risk resistive skills, this study looks at the interplay between adversity and the development of substance use and sexual risk restive skills.  The proposed study is a secondary data analysis that provides the opportunity to develop advanced training in latent variable methodologies and their application to an underserved AIAN adolescent community. Specific statistical skills in the training plan include 1) mediated structural equation modeling to assess the cross- sectional relationships among adversity, substance use, and sex resistive self-efficacy; 2) latent growth curve modeling and growth mixture modeling to analyze complex longitudinal relationships among variables; and 3) assessment of the function of time varying covariates when analyzing youth development trajectories.  In addition to developing research design and statistical analyses techniques, the proposed study will allow for the development of professional skills in manuscript and proposal planning, writing, submission, and revision; and development of a professional research network to generate collaboration and innovation in the field. Further, findings from this research have the potential to inform policies and interventions that address AIAN health disparities by targeting precursors of early adolescence to prevent multiple risk behaviors in later years."
"9302396","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian intestinal mucosa undergoes a process of continual renewal characterized by active proliferation of stem cells localized near the base of the crypts; progression of these cells up the crypt-villus axis with cessation of proliferation; and subsequent differentiation into one of the four primary cell types (i.e., enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells). An imbalance in this highly-regimented and orderly process within the crypts is associated with a number of common intestinal pathologies (e.g., colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]) which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Delineating the molecular factors regulating intestinal proliferation and differentiation is crucial to our understanding of not only normal gut development and adaptation, but also aberrant gut growth. With the support of this grant, we have shown the importance of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in the regulation of intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, we have shown the differential effects of various NFAT isoforms, which integrate and cooperate with the PI3K/mTOR pathway to maintain intestinal homeostasis. As an extension to our published results, our recent findings have demonstrated a novel metabolomic profile associated with intestinal cell differentiation and found that the ketogenic enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) and its product ß-hydroxybutyrate (ßHB), an endogenous inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), are increased with differentiation. In addition, inhibition of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) increases HMGCS2 expression in vitro and in vivo and, moreover, ßHB induces intestinal cell differentiation. Finally, we have shown that ßHB increases the expression of the sirtuin proteins that contribute to intestinal cell differentiation; mTOR interacts with and regulates the expressio and deacetylase activity of the sirtuin proteins. Based on our recently published and preliminary findings, we have further refined our central hypothesis to state that intestinal cell proliferatio and differentiation are regulated by PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway acting on critical downstream proteins (e.g., HMGCS2 and sirtuin proteins); a novel interaction between these pathways may exist that further adds to the intricate, but highly regimented, regulation of intestinal homeostasis. To examine our central hypothesis, we have planned experiments with the following Specific Aims: 1) to delineate mTOR-mediated metabolic reprogramming in intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation; 2) to define the role of HMGCS2/ßHB in mediatin the effects of mTOR in the intestine; 3) to determine whether sirtuin proteins act cooperatively with HMGCS2/ßHB to maintain intestinal homeostasis. The studies in the current proposal represent direct extensions of our previous findings, and are designed to define, in a systematic fashion, the molecular mechanisms and signaling events regulating the processes of intestinal proliferation, differentiation, and adaptation."
"9350300","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Membrane receptor trafficking is important in cellular homeostasis. Alterations in sorting mechanisms have been linked to various neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In this regard, we recently found that COMMD1 is involved in regulating endosomal trafficking mechanisms. COMMD1 belongs to a class of proteins that are involved in various physiological functions such as copper homeostasis, inflammation and electrolyte transport. In elucidating the mechanism underlying copper regulation by COMMD1, we found that it regulates trafficking of copper transporter ATP7A by forming a novel complex with two coiled-coil domain containing proteins, CCDC22 and CCDC93. This COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 or CCC complex regulates the endosomal trafficking of a number of other cargos. We find that this mediated by regulating the action of retromer, a complex involved in transport of cargos from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network or to plasma membrane. Among CCC interacting partners, we also identified an uncharacterized factor C16orf62, which has homology to the retromer subunit VPS35. Interestingly, recurrent mutations in C16orf62 have been noted in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and preliminary evidence indicates that C16orf62 expression is repressed in a proportion of HCCs. Similar to these findings, previous studies from our laboratory found that COMMD1 expression is frequently repressed in various tumors and this repression promotes tumor invasion. Thus, the central hypothesis of my studies is that the CCC complex regulates the trafficking of important surface receptors that affect the oncogenic process in HCC. Furthermore, I speculate that C16orf62 mutations and repressed expression in HCC likely results in altered surface expression of receptor that have important effects on cancer cells. The project's overall goal is to define the role of C16orf62 in the development of HCC and to address this goal I propose the following specific aims: (1) Define the composition and molecular organization of C16orf62 containing complexes. (2) Identify CCC-regulated protein cargos and define factors that are missorted in HCC. The proposed studies combine molecular and biochemical approaches, and state-of-the-art technologies and includes human liver cancer derived samples for molecular analysis. Altogether, this work will establish a fundamental understanding of the function of the CCC complex and its role in liver cancer."
"9278307","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genetic Regulation and Disease Function of the Frontotemporal Dementia Protein TMEM106B Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second-most common cause of presenile dementia, characterized clinically by deterioration in language, behavioral control, or both. There are no effective treatments, and progressive neurodegeneration causes death within an average of 6-7 years. FTD is comprised of several neuropathological subgroups, likely representing different underlying pathophysiologies. The largest subgroup (~50% of FTD cases) is characterized by pathological inclusions of the HIV TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kD (TDP-43) and accordingly named frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions, or FTLD-TDP. FTLD-TDP can be either sporadic or familial, with a substantial proportion of cases (~10%) attributable to mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN). Inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, GRN mutations appear to cause FTLD-TDP through haploinsufficiency of progranulin, a secreted protein with trophic effects on neurons. Recently, we performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) in FTLD-TDP, identifying a 7p21 locus containing only the uncharacterized gene TMEM106B that confers increased risk of FTLD-TDP in both non-Mendelian and GRN mutation-associated FTLD-TDP. Carriers of risk-associated genetic variants and diseased individuals independently showed increased mRNA expression of TMEM106B, strongly implicating this gene as the cause of the GWAS signal. Beyond the fact that TMEM106B is the only risk factor for non- Mendelian cases of FTLD-TDP described to date, little is known about it. Preliminary data suggest, however, that TMEM106B expression is increased in FTLD-TDP~ that TMEM106B is regulated by the microRNAs miR- 132 and miR-212, which are both decreased in FTLD-TDP~ that increased TMEM106B expression leads to endosomal-lysosomal dysfunction~ and that increased TMEM106B expression leads to abnormalities in progranulin trafficking. These data lead to a working model in which genetic variants at TMEM106B confer increased risk of FTLD-TDP by increasing TMEM106B expression. Increased TMEM106B expression, in turn, alters endosomal-lysosomal function, which influences the proper sorting, internalization, or secretion of progranulin. The Specific Aims of the project, which will test the working model, are: AIM 1: Confirm the association of TMEM106B over-expression with disease states and with TMEM106B risk genotypes~ AIM 2: Investigate the precise cis-acting mechanism(s) by which TMEM106B gene expression is regulated~ AIM 3: Elucidate the normal and pathophysiological function of TMEM106B in endosomal-lysosomal pathways as well as in progranulin trafficking. The over-arching goal of this proposal is to move from a statistical association obtained by GWAS between TMEM106B and FTLD-TDP, to a mechanistic understanding of both the genetic regulation of TMEM106B and the normal and pathophysiological function of this protein. In the process, we will identify many potential avenues for therapy not otherwise in the landscape of research and drug discovery efforts for this currently untreatable disease."

This will be accomplished by identifying and removing barriers that currently complicate clinical translation. Completion of this goal will allow the research team to test the hypotheses that: 1) A mature visual system (having experienced good retinal image quality during the formative years) that is now habitually experiencing poor retinal image quality due to elevated higher order aberrations will, with time, adapt back to normal levels of visual performance (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity as a function of letter size and stereo-acuity); and 2) normal or better than normal retinal image quality provided by wavefront guided corrections improves quality of life in patients with highly aberrated eyes compared to clinically available non-wavefront guided corrections."
"9477928","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AHR is a cytoplasmic receptor that has affinity for numerous xenobiotic ligands, which include halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), one of the most potent AHR activators, and AHR signaling mediates the detrimental effects of environmental contaminants on body tissues and organs. Ligand binding induces nuclear translocation of AHR and interaction with the AHR binding partner, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), allowing recognition of specific DNA enhancer sequences. More recently endogenous and natural AHR ligands, such as tryptophan metabolites and dietary compounds, have been identified. These ligands induce AHR-mediated immunomodulatory effects such as controlling normal T cell differentiation and immune tolerance. However, little is known about the role of ARNT in AHR immune signaling. Initial studies by our laboratory, and others, into the regulatory role of ARNT in AHR-mediated immunomodulation have suggested that ARNT is an integral cofactor in different immune signaling pathways, including AHR and NF-?B signaling. ARNT is often described in AHR signaling as a constitutively expressed, non-regulated, nuclear binding partner for AHR. However, our data challenge this assumption and show that the actual regulatory paradigm is more intricate. For instance, ARNT is expressed as two isoforms, isoform 1 and 3, which differ in only 15 amino acids present in isoform 1. Despite their sequence similarity, we have found that the ARNT isoforms appear to have opposing functions in AHR signaling. Intriguingly, the extra 15 amino acids in isoform 1 include a unique phosphorylation site, where we have observed TCDD-induced phosphorylation. Furthermore, we find that the phosphorylation of ARNT isoform 1 is crucial for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and transactivation of AHR/ARNT target genes. We predict that ARNT activity is a function of both unique phosphorylation of isoform 1 and the given isoform ratio within a particular cell type, which in turn is likely important for regulating the magnitude/outcome of the AHR response. To investigate our hypothesis we propose to 1) Define a comprehensive molecular framework for AHR regulation by the ARNT isoforms, 2) Examine the role of AHR activity, as governed by the ARNT isoforms, in lymphoma cell growth, and 3) Characterize the regulation of AHR signaling by ARNT isoforms in vivo. Ultimately, these studies will lay the groundwork for ARNT-based therapies such as splice modulation as a means of manipulating the ARNT isoforms to control AHR signaling in autoimmune diseases and cancer."
"9278091","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Osteoporosis is under-reported in men and may be present in up to 31% of male VA patients. Further, it is among the most debilitating disorders for women - who make up an increasingly larger share of our Veteran population. Hip and vertebral fractures, major risks with osteoporosis, lead to loss of independence, pain, even potentially serious cardiac and brain morbidities, as well as increased mortality. Our main hypothesis is that the cytokine stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1, aka CXCL12) is increased in the peripheral circulation with age and contributes to age-associated bone loss. In the peripheral blood SDF-1 is rapidly converted to an N-terminal endopeptidase-cleaved form by the circulating dipetidlylpeptidase CD26 (dipetidlylpeptidase 4, DPP4). The cleaved form of SDF-1 binds to and blocks the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4, but does not activate it. It becomes in effect an inhibitor. Because of the quick alteration of SDF-1 by DPP4, but its slower total breakdown and removal, our research suggests the majority of the SDF-1 in the blood and bone marrow is of the inactive/inhibitory form. Part of our hypothesis is that if the level of the inactive form rises slowly, and stays up wth aging, then CXCR4 signaling is reduced long-term and this will have a negative impact on bone, reducing the number of BMSCs and reducing bone formation. There is increasing evidence that CXCR4 signaling is needed for BM mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to maintain a progenitor cell population and to initiate and support osteogenesis. Importantly, preclinical murine studies from our laboratory have shown that circulating levels of total SDF-1, including the DPP4-cleaved form, increase with age in mice and that experimentally increasing the plasma level of DPP4-cleaved SDF-1 in young mice reduces bone formation serum markers and significantly decreases trabecular bone volume and bone density. This led to a funded NIH PO1 grant to determine the role of SDF-1 isoforms in the regulation of murine bone formation with age. The research studies proposed here are to see if our hypotheses and observations in mice are true in humans: We propose to test the novel hypothesis that in humans increased DPP4-cleaved SDF-1 isoforms are important factors in age-and disease-associated bone loss. We propose to assess the levels of circulating, and bone marrow, SDF-1 (DPP4-cleaved and non-cleaved) levels, DPP4 activity, and the effects of these isoforms on human BMSC's osteogenic activity in vitro and bone formation and quality/density in vivo. We will measure SDF-1 isoforms along with DPP4 in the serum and bone marrow of patients of different ages, and correlate this with their bone density and volume, as well as serum markers of bone formation or breakdown. We will also determine if there are changes in these SDF-1 and DPP4 parameters in patients with osteoporosis relative to age-matched controls. We further propose to determine the effects on bone formation of FDA-approved drugs in use for diabetic therapy, which act by regulating DPP4 activity (e.g. sitaglitin). We will determine if diabetic patients receiving treatment with these DPP4 inhibitors show improved bone formation compared to controls. Finally, we will use isolated human patient BMSCs to determine if DPP4 cleaved SDF-1 reduces BMSC cell survival, proliferation, and osteogenic potential. Additionally, these human BMSCs will be assessed to determine if there are age-associated changes in miRNAs targeting the SDF-1 axis and osteogenic genes. We will determine experimentally if such miRNAs affect BMSC cell fate. This work could rapidly lead to clinical trials of already FDA approved DPP4 inhibitors as a novel pro-bone remodeling treatment for osteoporosis as a replacement, or enhancement, of current problematic anti-remodeling therapies. In follow up studies, acute inhibition of DPP4 may also have value in increasing bone repair rates via increasing the active form of SDF-1 to increase stem cell homing and osteogenic induction following fracture, or other traumatic injury to bone, a critical need for the VA and DoD. Longer-term this work opens the potential to use regulation of specific miRNAs to regulate the osteogenic environment for BMSCs with age and to prevent osteoporosis."
"9267083","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT AND EDUCATION CORE  Alzheimer s disease (AD) affects 5.6 million Americans regardless of race or ethnicity. Today, more than 38  million Americans are age 65 or older; this number is expected to double in the next 25 years. The oldest old  people age 85+ constitute the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. Currently about four million  people, this population could top 19 million by 2050. The racial and ethnic makeup of the older population is  also expected to become significantly more diverse. In 2006, 81% of adults age 65+ were Caucasian; by 2050  this is estimated to decrease to 61%40 with approximately 14 million Hispanics, 8.6 million African Americans,  and 5.8 million older adults from other racial and ethnic groups. Inequities in income, education, health services  availability, and a lack of understanding of specific cultural differences in knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes may  contribute to significant disparities in health outcomes and quality of life. This includes not only differences in  symptom presentation, but perceptions of disease and care. If we are to truly understand preclinical AD and its  myriad to presentations, risk factors, and potential treatment options, then our cohorts that participate in  observational studies, clinical trials, biomarker studies, and psychosocial research has to reflect the growing  changes in the US population. The overall goal of Outreach, Recruitment, and Education Core (OREC) of the  NYU ADC is to provide conduits through community engagement; collaborative efforts with other NYU Centers,  ADCs, and the scientific community; and novel approaches to increase the recruitment and retention of  culturally diverse research population engaged in annual longitudinal assessments, biomarker research, and  autopsy studies. We propose 4 Specific Aims: (1) Facilitate recruitment and retention of participants in ADC  longitudinal studies and clinical trials with special emphasis on underrepresented minority groups (URG); (2)  Perform outreach activities to inform and raise awareness of lay individuals, with an emphasis on URG  concerning brain aging; memory loss; early detection; biomarkers; diagnostic, treatment and care options; and  promote favorable attitudes towards research participation; (3) Maintain and grow educational initiatives and  training opportunities; (4) Evaluate the effectiveness of our recruitment, outreach, training and educational  activities. The Core coordinates educational offerings for all ADC stakeholders, from our research participants  and their family members, to medical students, residents and fellows rotating through the ADC, to faculty and  staff of the University, to the general public and healthcare professionals in our community and beyond, as well  as an increasing number of visiting foreign scholars."
"9353207","Project Summary Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) remain a critical population in need of empirically supported approaches to improve self-management to promote reduced HIV sexual risk behaviors and substance use. The Young Men?s Health Project (YMHP), a structured and manualized 4-session intervention utilizing motivational interviewing, personalized feedback, and problem-solving skills building approaches for HIV- negative or untested youth was found to be efficacious in significantly reducing substance use and condomless anal sex (CAS) among YMSM ages 18-29. To date, this is the first and only RCT of any published trial or CDC DEBI with YMSM to show significant reductions in both substance use and sexual risk. The CDC recently rated YMHP as ?Best Evidence? and placed it on the compendium of Evidence Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. YMHP was tested through an efficacy trial in a research center environment with numerous inclusion and exclusion criteria, and thus, a real-world-based replication is the crucial next step in studying the intervention?s effectiveness in the real world when delivered by front-line staff to their clients. We will conduct a comparative effectiveness trial (CET) with two modalities of YMHP delivery ? clinic-based and telephone-based ? at three HIV clinic sites in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Miami. The Specific Aims are to: 1) adapt the YMHP intervention for clinic and phone delivery in HIV clinics by community health workers (CHWs); 2) compare the effectiveness of clinic-based versus phone-based delivery of YMHP in the context of health care access, assessing the cost effectiveness of both modalities and the five components of the self- management model; and 3) test a sustainable model of YMHP implementation in real-world adolescent HIV clinics. The proposed study will be implemented over two phases. In Phase 1 we will conduct qualitative research with staff at our collaborating clinics (to understand implementation issues) and YMSM ages 15-17 (to adapt the efficacious YMHP intervention to be developmentally appropriate). In Phase 2 we will randomize 270 YMSM ages 15-24, to receive YMHP by phone or in person at the clinic. Assessments will include behavioral self-report measures, urine testing for substance use, and STI testing for sexual health outcomes. Working together with our clinic collaborators will help to address practical problems at the frontline of service provision to pave the way for a comprehensive program to reduce HIV infection among YMSM. If effective, our program has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for YMSM."

The Core aims to gain enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, develop better biomarkers and discovery novel effective, therapeutic approaches. The protocols used by the NP core will be state of the art and consistent with 21st century brain banking procedures, which is essential to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of the AD research community. Emphasis will be placed on delineating the presence of overlapping neurodegenerative syndromes such as vascular dementia, Lewy Body Disease, frontotemporal degeneration and prion disease, in addition to AD related pathology. In the current period of funding we performed over 130 autopsies, published over 65 peer reviewed manuscripts and provided tissue to over 50 investigators. In this renewal we will place emphasis on the center theme of this ADCC, which is elucidating the clinic-pathological substrates that underlie the transitions from normal aging to preclinical AD, preclinical AD to MCI, and MCI to the earliest stages of dementia. The overall objectives of the NP core of the NYU ADCC are to provide staff, technical resources, laboratory facilities and expertise for the investigation of structural and molecular properties of the brains of patients with AD and related dementia, as well as of normal controls. The aims of the NP core are: Aim 1: To perform rapid autopsies and obtain brains from ADC participants, using a standardized, state of the art protocol. Aim 2: Performed standardized state of the art neuropathological analysis and diagnosis of cases from the ADCC clinical core and affiliated cases, with a careful analysis of concomitant pathology. Aim 3: To maintain a state of the art brain tissue repository of unfixed frozen and fixed tissue from Aim 4: To conduct morphometric studies to establish better clinical neuropathological correlations for transitions of normal aging to preclinical AD, preclinical AD to MCI and MCI to early dementia. Aim 5: To foster training of investigators and residents on the utilization of neuropathological techniques, train neuropathologists and enhancing the use of Core tissue/resources for the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases."
"9267085","The NYU-ADC has pioneered in the development of comprehensive counseling for family caregivers of people with AD, and has established a national reputation in this field. The Psychosocial Core will provide resources, including data and participants, for the design and evaluation of new psychosocial interventions for all older adults who participate in the NYU-ADC, including those with early signs of cognitive impairment, and continue to support its nationally known caregiver intervention research program. The affiliated Psychosocial Research Program has developed several innovative projects to reduce the emotional consequences of cognitive decline, including an innovative chorus for people with dementia with their family members and expanded research related to the original evidence-based NYU Caregiver Intervention. The Psychosocial Core will continue to provide counseling and support to participants in the ADC and to the family members of participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia, which enhances the ability of the ADC to retain participants and study partners for longitudinal follow-up. The counselors will maintain contact with family caregivers of participants with moderate to severe AD, after they are no longer receiving in-person annual assessments, to increase the likelihood of autopsy of these participants. The activities of the Core enhance the ability of the ADC to retain its clinical population through autopsy by providing counseling and resource information to all participants. The Psychosocial Core interacts closely with the other Cores and provides valuable support to the research projects, clinical trials and pilot studies associated with the ADC and with collaborating investigators. The Psychosocial Core conducts a Psychosocial Assessment of all participants with normal cognitive function and MCI, and of study partners of those with MCI and caregivers of participants in the early stage of dementia. The assessment now includes measures to enable research about the psychosocial impact of cognitive changes associated with aging and incipient dementia, and investigate causes for the disparity between impairment in function and results of cognitive tests and brain imaging evaluations. The Psychosocial Core data, together with the other data in the ADC database, will provide a uniquely comprehensive dataset to inform the design of innovative psychosocial interventions for older adults with age-associated cognitive changes and MCI. Psychosocial data on individuals with normal cognitive function and MCI, and on the family members of people with MCI and AD can be integrated with information from the Clinical, Neuroimaging and Neuropathology Core evaluations and become the basis for new studies in the affiliated Psychosocial Research Program. The breadth of research on psychosocial interventions is a defining attribute of the NYU-ADC, and the Psychosocial Core will continue to provide resources for research to understand and mitigate the psychosocial impact of memory loss associated with both normal aging and disease."
"9353199","Abstract  Despite the substantial declines in HIV transmission and increases in lifespan among those living with HIV achieved over the past decade, full benefits that should be possible based on the tools and interventions currently available have yet to be realized in youth, in large part because efficacious interventions for this age group have not been brought to scale. To be effective, youth must be fully engaged in interventions at every stage of the HIV care (treatment and prevention) cascades: HIV testing, linkage to care, timely initiation of care, persistence and adherence to antiretroviral care. At-risk HIV-negative youth need to be consistently engaged in prevention strategies such as PEP and/or PrEP as indicated, consistent safer sex practices and repeat HIV testing. Our U19 project - Scale It Up - specifically focuses on the process of improving self- management among youth including: 1) the identification of interventions that are efficacious and effective for improving self-management in YLH and at risk youth; 2) the multi-site implementation of an intervention shown to be efficacious in improving self-management; and 3) the assessment of the Five Components of Self- Management Model and how these vary over time, are directly improved by interventions, and mediate intervention effects. Our team has also been at the leading edge of implementation Science research related to HIV prevention and care. We are actively committed to aggressively moving beyond simple efficacy and effectiveness RCTs. The four Research Projects proposed in Scale It Up, all addressing self-management, will continue to develop the field of Implementation Science by employing three types of effectiveness- implementation hybrid designs. The studies further synergize by utilizing Aaron?s Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) model to guide the proposed Implementation Science efforts. Our proposed Implementation Science Core, coupled with the cost effectiveness expertise of our Analytic Core, will be focused on the central notion of ?Scale It Up? ? taking efficacious self-management interventions and expeditiously moving them into practice while sustaining effectiveness. Scale It Up has assembled research teams who will develop, test, and bring to practice self-management interventions that positively impact the youth HIV prevention and care cascades. We will achieve these goals by: 1) Designing, conducting and evaluating self-management interventions grounded in the 5-component Self-Management Model and expeditiously moving effective programs into practice; 2) Developing, deploying and disseminating new methods for implementation and implementation analysis with a strong theoretical foundation; and 3) Engaging with the other funded U19s to identify additional opportunities to advance the implementation science and self- management science."
"9353208","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the United States, it is estimated that one-third of all new HIV diagnoses are among people less than 25 years of age. There is strong evidence that adherence to ART is a primary determinant of virological suppression, disease progression, and mortality. However, a recent review and meta- analysis of research on youth with HIV found an average ART adherence rate of 53% in North America, the lowest adherence rate globally. Intensive and/or in-person adherence intervention models have been problematic for youth with HIV. Interventions requiring multiple visits, even with brief, in-person sessions, have been difficult for youth to complete. These models have largely failed to promote long-term, sustained medication adherence (and sustained viral load below detection), and are commonly cost prohibitive for use in real world settings regardless of efficacy. Given these issues, one possibility for sustainable, yet individualized intervention delivery is through mobile health/technology-based approaches. This proposal directly addresses the urgent need for culturally acceptable, youth-friendly ART adherence interventions that can be rapidly implemented in clinical settings. We plan to conduct a clinical trial comparing two promising youth-friendly intervention strategies: weekday cell phone support (CPS) and daily text messaging (SMS). In pilot studies, both have demonstrated significant improvements in medication adherence. Participants who received CPS showed significant reductions in HIV viral load during the 24 week intervention; moreover, effects persisted for 24 weeks post intervention. The proposed research moves beyond a traditional clinical trial by utilizing a ?SMART? (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) design as a cost-effective and methodologically rigorous way to explore additional questions to optimize the interventions and maximize clinical utility and real-world implementation. This SMART design will allow us to identify the most effective and cost efficient sequence of SMS and/or CPS, utilizing incentives strategically, and tapering to sustain the impact of the intervention. We hypothesize that youth randomized to CPS will have significantly greater viral load suppression (primary outcome) and self-reported medication adherence (secondary outcome) than those in the SMS group. The proposed research brings together a team of skilled HIV clinical and behavioral researchers with decades of experience with clinical care and adherence research with youth, including numerous collaborations within the NIH-funded Adolescent Trials Network. This research will be conducted at five clinical sites with decades of experience conducting trials and that have a track record of excellence in recruiting, retaining, and collecting data from youth living with HIV."

"9295918","Chronic sleep loss and circadian disruption can impair metabolic functions in humans, and both sleep and circadian rhythmicity are disrupted with aging. Furthermore, sleep loss itself often leads to disruptions of circadian rhythmicity, and disrupted circadian rhythmicity can induce sleep loss. In Project 3, we will use mouse models to dissociate these two influences so as to better understand their independent impacts on metabolism and to study the physiological and molecular mechanisms mediating those metabolic effects. Aim 1 will study the changes in feeding, body weight, plasma levels of various metabolic markers and glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (whole body and fat tissue) in young and older mice experiencing chronic sleep loss following genetic lesions of galaninergic (GAL) neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO). We will also assess corticosteroid secretion and sympathovagal balance in these mice in order to study the physiological mechanisms contributing to the changes in insulin sensitivity. Finally, in Aim 1, we will trace the specific projections of GAL and non-GAL neurons in the VLPO to determine which of these neurons have connections with sites involved in energy metabolism, corticosteroid section and sympathovagal balance. In Aim 2, we will study the same metabolic outcomes as in Aim 1 of recurrent circadian disruption (RCD) achieved by exposing C57 mice (young and older) to a 10:10 LD cycle for 12 weeks and investigating the effects of feeding periods synchronized with either body temperature (Tb) or locomotor activity (LMA) rhythms) in attenuating the adverse metabolic effects. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes, in Aim 3, we will study changes in the phase and amplitude of central and peripheral clocks and the downstream changes in gene expression (by histone deacetylase 3 ChlP-seq) they drive in the peripheral tissues when the transgenic PER2::LUC mice (both young and older) are maintained on a 10:10 LD cycle and on each of the 3 different feeding regimens as in Aim 2 (unrestricted access to food or feeding synchronized with their LD or Tb cycle)."
"9485718","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application for funds to support pre- and postdoctoral training in visual neuroscience at New York University in the Center for Neural Science (CNS) and the Cognition and Perception Program in the Department of Psychology (CP). We seek to renew training support for 6 pre-doctoral and 2 postdoctoral fellows. This level of support is justified by the need for the training program to provide for the training of a diverse yet coherent group of trainees. With the help of previous NEI support, the Visual Neuroscience Training Program has become a leading center for research training and has launched and shaped the careers of many who have made important contributions to the field. The 17 faculty of the training program seek to understand the visual system from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, but all share a consistent focus on understanding visual function. The quality, experience, breadth, and productivity of the training faculty have in the past and wil in the future provide a fertile intellectual environment in which young scientists can thrive. Thre newly recruited faculties have invigorated the program and made it even better. There is ample instruction through courses and especially through mentoring in the research labs of CNS and CP that helps bring trainees to the frontiers of vision research. Many active researchers supported by NEI and other agencies provide direction, leadership, and support for students once they emerge as more independent senior scholars. Extensive shared facilities, including MRI scanners, an MEG and a TMS facility operated solely for research the two participating departments; facilitate collaborations among faculty and trainees. The students who join the CNS and CP doctoral programs are of outstanding quality and a very high proportion have historically gone on to successful and in some cases stellar careers in visual neuroscience."

"9362525","The Filoviridae family contains multiple highly pathogenic viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever in humans. Outbreaks of Ebola, Sudan, Bundibugyo, and Marburg viruses are unpredictable, can spread rapidly, and occur with 40-90% human lethality. Vaccination efforts for the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) show tremendous promise. The candidate vaccines, however, provides no protection against the other filoviruses with equivalent outbreak potential. We and others have recently identified two epitopes on Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) that elicit antibodies that cross- react with, neutralize, and protect against other all ebolaviruses in animal models. These epitopes are not shared with the much more abundant, secreted soluble GP (sGP), which may serve as an antibody decoy during infection. Here, we propose to use structure-guided design to engineer immunogens that preferentially display these unique GP-specific (i.e. non-sGP), critical, and highly conserved structures and elicit high levels of such broadly-neutralizing and broadly protective antibodies against these epitopes. This three-PI program combines the expertise of (1) a pioneer in the field of structure-based and epitope-focused vaccine design, (2) the structural biologist who has determined most filovirus GP-antibody structures and handles the majority of the world?s filovirus antibodies, and (3) a leading expert in filovirus vaccines and immunology. In this highly collaborative program, iterative stages of innovative design and functional evaluation will lead to novel immunogens that could be used alone or in a prime-boost regimen with single-virus vaccines currently in clinical trials. Milestones along the way demonstrate progress in provision of novel structures, design of stable and immunogenic features, and elicitation of broadly-reactive and broadly- protective immune responses against the array of filovirus threats. The proposed program is designed to deliver a vaccine with demonstrated efficacy against Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, and Bundibugyo ebolavirus infections in guinea pig and ferret models as well as efficacy in NHP models of Sudan and Ebola virus infections."
"9514334","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain structure and function deteriorate with age, steadily driving cognitive impairments and susceptibility to degenerative disorders in adults. It has been recently demonstrated in the Wyss-Coray lab that brain function - specifically neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons) and cognitive function in the hippocampus, a key center for learning and memory- is inhibited in young mice exposed to an aged systemic environment. Additionally, the lab discovered that aged brain function can be enhanced through systemic circulation of young blood in aged animals. While the identity of systemic inhibitory and rejuvenating factors from aged and young plasma are beginning to be elucidated, the question of how and if these factors cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and act directly on brain tissue to inhibit or promote neurogenesis and cognitive function remained unanswered. Additionally, whether the effects are mediated through peripheral interactions via the vasculature remains to be elucidated. Considering systemic circulating factors are in direct contact with brain endothelial cells (BECs) of the vasculature, it is possible that hippocampal deterioration or rejuvenation is mediated in part by changes in endothelial cell signaling. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that an aged, inflammatory systemic environment induces endothelial cell activation and upregulation of adhesion molecules that are responsible, in part, for the communication between the systemic environment and the brain leading to functional and cognitive impairments with age.  This proposal specifically focuses on vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), whose soluble form was found to increase significantly in the blood plasma during human aging and following inhibition of brain function by aged systemic circulation in young animals. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms underlying upregulation and shedding of VCAM1 by plasma factors, by treating isolated BECs with young and aged plasma and looking into signaling pathways that regulate VCAM1 transcriptionally and post-translationally, as well as direct transcriptional analysis of BECs from young mice exposed to the aged systemic environment through aged plasma injections or heterochronic parabiosis, in which the blood circulation of young and aged animals are conjoined. Aim 2 will determine whether VCAM1 is required for the detrimental effects of aged plasma on young hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition. VCAM1 function will be inhibited systemically via neutralizing monoclonal antibody, transgenic deletion specifically in BECs, or viral delivery-mediated Adam17 overexpression (enzyme responsible for cleavage and downregulation of VCAM1 function) following aged plasma injections into young mice, and hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive functions carefully assessed. These studies will provide a better understanding of how the systemic environment negatively or positively regulates brain function.  This project combines basic neuroscience, immunology, and molecular biology with translational research, paving the way for potential therapies that target the brain vasculature as a way to ameliorate cognitive decline and vascular degeneration associated with both healthy aging and multiple neurodegenerative diseases."
"9348406","Summary: Administrative Core The Administrative Core provides Center leadership and oversees the efficient and cost-effective management of Center resources while reducing the administrative burden faced by researchers. It works closely with all other cores, a collaboration facilitated by interlocking memberships between the Administrative Core and other cores and guided by the ?research project life cycle? (Figure A.1.) concept that provides an integrative view of services and the use of resources. The Administrative Core has five units: the Director's Office, Proposal Services, Human Resources, Finance, and General Services. The Director's Office (with core members being the Center Director, S. Philip Morgan; the Deputy Director for Research Services, Nancy Dole; and the Deputy Director for Finance and Administrative Services, Tom Heath) oversees CPC's entire research infrastructure and all of its research and training activities according to policies established by the Fellows Assembly (a yearly meeting of all Fellows) and with the input of the Director's Advisory Council (consisting of five Fellows appointed for staggered five-year terms). The Director's Office is responsible for maintaining and furthering a collaborative, multidisciplinary, and intellectually stimulating environment that encourages excellence and innovation. It is also the communications conduit through which: i) Fellows are made aware of research opportunities, policy and regulatory changes, and implementation of these changes, ii) the provost, deans and department chairs of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill learn about the interests and concerns of CPC, and iii) entities external to the University (e.g., other population centers, program officers) interact with CPC about the success of, and threats to, population science. Beginning in 2015, the Director's Office will include an Evaluation Coordinator. This position will function across all cores to monitor and evaluate CPC's ongoing activities relative to its goals and stated aims. The Proposal Services Unit provides administrative support for developing and submitting grant applications and for meeting the reporting requirements of funded projects. The Human Resources Unit is responsible for the increasingly complex process of managing personnel changes. The Finance Unit oversees the use of research funds and manages financial operations with a focus on helping researchers meet their scientific goals. General Services is responsible for Center-wide operations, including office renovation, meeting set-up, photocopier maintenance, purchase of office supplies, recycling, and mail delivery. An overarching core aim is to reduce administrative burden on researchers through education of researchers and the implementation of strategies to comply with regulations in an efficient manner. The core also aims to reduce the administrative burden through engagement with policy makers and administrators so that the goals of regulation can be met in the least burdensome way."
"9408828","Abstract The hypothesis for the proposed project is that inhibition of the classical complement pathway with Peptide Inhibitor of complement C1 (PIC1) will be neuroprotective in a rat model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE is an ischemia-reperfusion injury of the brain that occurs around the time of birth, with up to 60% mortality and 25% of survivors left with a significant disability. The complement system, the most potent inflammatory cascade in humans, and a critical mediator of inflammation , phagocytic cell recruitment and direct cell lysis, has been shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of HIE in animal models and human studies. Therapeutic hypothermia, the only accepted treatment for neonatal HIE, slightly improves short-term survival and neurodevelopment in HIE, but does not significantly improve long-term outcomes. To date, none of the tested pharmacological adjuvants to therapeutic hypothermia have demonstrated clinical improvement. Deficiency of C1q, the initiator molecule of the classical complement pathway, has been shown to be neuroprotective in an animal model of neonatal HIE. Our current lead compound of PIC1 (PA-CPEG), is the product of years of rational drug design yielding a 15 amino acid peptide conjugated with PEG. Our compound binds to C1q, efficiently blocking complement activation at the first step in the cascade. Pilot experiments in the well-established Vannucci rat model of neonatal HIE have shown that PIC1 significantly reduces brain infarct volumes, and reduces neuronal injury. The proposed studies will refine dosing and frequency of PIC1 in the Vannucci model, and conduct fully powered studies to evaluate the efficacy of PIC1 in reducing brain injury in neonatal HIE. The success of the proposed studies will provide critical proof-of-concept that PIC1 can prevent complement- mediated pathogenesis in an animal model of human disease. This will provide the necessary evidence to propel the future pre-clinical development of PIC1 through pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies via SBIR Phase 2. Third-party market analysis shows the potential for healthy sales volumes for PIC1 in HIE. Third-party regulatory analysis suggests the potential for a stream-lined regulatory approach by seeking Orphan Drug and Breakthrough designations."
"9291466","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases remain America's primary killer by a large margin, claiming the lives of more Americans than the next two main causes of death combined (cancer and pulmonary complications). In particular, coronary artery disease (CAD) is by far the most lethal, causing 17% of all (cardiac-related or not) deaths every year. One of the main reasons for this high death toll is the severe lack of effective and accessible imaging tools upon anomaly detected on the electrocardiogram (ECG), especially at the early stages when CAD can be stabilized with appropriate pharmacological regimen. The long-term goal of our studies is to establish the potential of a low-cost, portable, noninvasive and reliable strain imaging technique of Myocardial Elastography pioneered by our group for early detection and localization of myocardial ischemia. In this renewal study, we propose to overcome all limitations identified during the past funding period and ensure clinical translation for detection of ischemia and differentiation from infarction. Our group was the first to demonstrate that cardiac strain imaging using parallel beamforming is feasible 1) at extremely high frame rates (up to 2000 fps) ensuring 2) high precision and 3) angle-independent 2D strain estimates, 3) 3D capability, 4) imaging of transient cardiac events (~1-10 ms electromechanical strains) and 5) real-time implementation 6) without ECG gating or breath holds. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that parallel- beamforming Myocardial Elastography (PBME) will have increased sensitivity for 1) detection of early onset of ischemia that current modalities may miss and 2) differentiation of early onset from advanced ischemia or infarction based on the resulting altered mechanical and electromechanical cardiac function. The specific aims are as follows: 1) characterize fundamental performance of PBME in simulations and phantoms; 2) validate PBME detection of early disease onset in canines in vivo; and 3) validate PBME findings against CT angiography and nuclear perfusion. High reliability of PBME for detection and characterization of early ischemic onset would entail its readily translation and seamless integration in the clinical echocardiography routine."
"9382250","Background: Postpartum breast cancers, defined as breast cancers diagnosed within 5-­10 years of last  childbirth, are more than twice as likely to become metastatic and result in death. This devastating diagnosis  affects thousands of young women annually. Our previous research revealed that non-­invasive breast tumor  cells become invasive and metastatic in postpartum mice compared to controls in nulliparous mice. We also  revealed a novel feedback loop involving collagen mediated upregulation of COX-­2, which mediates invasion  and metastasis in postpartum mice. Subsequent gene expression analysis revealed a significant and specific  upregulation of SEMA7A mRNA in postpartum breast tumor cells. The SEMA7A gene encodes for semaphorin  7a (Sema7a), a signaling molecule that drives neural development, immunity, and tissue remodeling in the  lung. Our preliminary data demonstrate that silencing of SEMA7A cell line derived postpartum breast cancer  xenografts delays growth, progression to invasive cancer, and reduces lymphangiogenesis in the tumor  microenvironment. In addition, we have analyzed our young women?s breast cancer cohort to reveal that  SEMA7A protein is significantly increased in postpartum patient tumors and in nulliparous patient tumors that  subsequently recurred. Thus, we postulate that SEMA7A is also a general mediator of breast tumor  progression. In support of this, our gene expression analysis of multiple human breast cancer datasets reveals  that SEMA7A mRNA expression is associated with early recurrence, metastasis, and death. Cumulatively,  these data support the hypothesis that SEMA7A promotes tumor progression in breast cancer patients and  may be an important therapeutic target. Objective/Hypothesis: A collagen-­mediated COX-­2/SEMA7A  signaling axis is key for invasion, stromal remodeling, and induction of vascular remodeling in the  tumor microenvironment, all of which ultimately drive metastasis. Specific Aims: (1) Determine how  collagen leads to upregulation of COX-­2 and SEMA7A and whether targeting COX-­2 in combination with  silencing of SEMA7A will block tumor cell invasion. (2) Define the mechanisms by which SEMA7A promotes  vascular remodeling and metastasis, determine whether targeting or co-­targeting of SEMA7A and COX-­2 will  block metastasis, and define the relationship between SEMA7A and COX-­2 in postpartum breast tumors.   Cancer relevance: To establish clinical relevance, we will examine the relationship between SEMA7A and  COX-­2 protein expression, along with collagen and the vasculature, using multi-­color immunostaining and  correlate with invasion and recurrence in our postpartum breast cancer patient tissues. The expected  outcomes are identification of mechanisms by which COX-­2 and SEMA7A support breast tumor progression.  Such results could positively impact thousands of breast cancer patients by defining new therapies targeted at  the SEMA7A pathway. Given that SEMA7A expression is generally low in adult tissues direct targeting of  SEMA7A could have low toxicity.   "
"9292039","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Voltage-gated Cav1.4 Ca2+ channels are highly localized in the synaptic terminals of rod and cone photoreceptors. Ca2+ influx through these channels triggers the release of glutamate, which initiates the transmission of visual information through the retinal circuitry and into the brain. Mutations in Cav1.4 cause several visual impairments including congenital stationary night blindness type 2 (CSNB2), cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), and X-linked retinal disorder. These channelopathies illustrate the importance of Cav1.4 for normal vision, as well as the need to understand how Cav1.4 channels are regulated. In contrast to our knowledge of other Cav1 channels, little is known about the factors that influence Cav1.4 function. Therefore, it is important to understand how altered Cav1.4 function causes visual impairments.  In this proposal, I will address the importance of an alternatively spliced exon (exon 47) in the Cav1.4 distal C-terminal regulatory domain (DCRD); that is known to regulate channel activation and inactivation, by interacting with regions in the proximal C-terminal regulatory domain (PCRD). This will be accomplished by determining the functional and structural significance of exon 47 on Cav1.4 activation and inactivation in HEK 293T cells, using electrophysiological and biochemical methods (aim 1), and by characterizing the expression of the Cav1.4 splice variant in human retina, using quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization (aim 2)."
"9291434","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of smoking among cervical cancer survivors is strikingly high and smoking has been strongly linked to cervical cancer. Estimates of smoking prevalence among cervical cancer survivors have been reported in the literature as ranging from 44% to 48%. Continuing to smoke after a cancer diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of cancer recurrence, second primary cancers, and other smoking-related morbidities. This study will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a theoretically- and empirically- based Motivation And Problem-Solving (MAPS) approach for promoting and facilitating smoking cessation among cervical cancer survivors in a large, safety net public healthcare system. MAPS is a comprehensive, dynamic, and holistic intervention that incorporates empirically supported cognitive behavioral and social cognitive theory-based treatment strategies within an overarching motivational framework. MAPS was designed to be appropriate for all smokers regardless of their motivation to change, and views motivation as dynamically fluctuating from moment to moment throughout the behavior change process. Because MAPS comprehensively addresses multiple issues important to the individual and relevant to change through the creation of a Wellness Program (e.g., stressors, anxiety, depression, family conflicts, finances, fear of cancer recurrence), we believe it is particularly appropriate for treating this population. Participants will be current smokers who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer (N=300) recruited through the Harris Health System. Participants will be followed for a period of 18 months, and will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) Standard Treatment [ST] or 2) MAPS. ST will consist of a mailed packet of materials including a letter referring smokers to the Texas Quitline, free nicotine replacement therapy when they are ready to quit, and standard self-help materials. ST will be mailed a total of 3 times (at Baseline, 6 and 12 months). MAPS will consist of ST plus 6 proactive telephone counseling sessions delivered over a 12-month period. All assessments will be administered via telephone and occur at baseline and 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after baseline. The primary outcome is abstinence from tobacco at 18 months and the secondary outcomes are abstinence from tobacco at other assessments, as well as quit attempts, cigarettes per day, use of the Texas Quitline across all post-baseline assessments, and cost-effectiveness. The specific aims are to: 1) Compare the efficacy of a MAPS approach to promoting and facilitating smoking cessation to ST among cervical cancer survivors; 2) Assess the effects MAPS on hypothesized treatment mechanisms (motivation, agency, and stress/negative affect) and the role of those mechanisms in mediating MAPS effects on abstinence from smoking; and 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of MAPS and ST."
"9265808","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the US. At the time of diagnosis, less than 10% of women are presented with a metastatic disease. However, when relapse occurs after definitive therapy, the majority of patients end up with disseminated metastases rather than an isolated local recurrence. Taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) have remarkable anticancer efficacy for the treatment of breast, ovarian, prostate and lung cancers. However, they have poor selectivity and high toxicity which are the most important factors for discontinuation of cancer chemotherapy. Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy is often used as first line therapy for metastatic HER-2 positive breast cancers. Patients develop acquired resistance within months to years; while other patients demonstrate intrinsic resistance (de novo resistance). Inhibition of HSP90 has the potential to shut down multiple oncogenic signaling pathways simultaneously. With the recent discovery of feedback loops that counteract the efficacy of molecularly targeted agents, one solution to combat feedback loops is to attack cancers with a multimodal inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits multiple signaling nodes using HSP90 inhibitors which can also combat the emergence of resistance mutations. The therapeutic potential of HSP90 inhibition is being evaluated extensively in a number of clinical trials, including 17-AAG (now in phase III clinical trials). Simultaneous combination therapy is critical in circumventing drug resistance for the treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancers. However, the ability to safely and specifically deliver multiple drugs with non-overlapping mechanisms of action has been challenging. To overcome these issues, we plan to develop multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles to test the hypothesis that tri-modal combination nanoparticles will prove more effective with less toxicity than current standard of care therapies for HER-2 positive breast cancers. These multi-functional polymeric nanoparticles will incorporate paclitaxel (Taxol) and 17-AAG within the core, but will also be decorated on the surface with trastuzumab as a targeting moiety to specifically target HER-2 receptors as well as function as a molecular targeted therapeutic agent. We hypothesize that these targeted nanoparticles will be active in vitro against HER-2 positive breast cancer cell lines as well as HER-2 positive trastuzumab and/or lapatinib resistant breast cancer cell lines, and that they will show in vivo efficacy in mouse xenograft models of HER-2 positive drug resistant tumors. Aim 1: We will synthesize stealth hydrolysable crosslinked trastuzumab surface-targged- P (LLA-HEMA) nanoparticles. Aim 2: We will fabricate and characterize drug (paclitaxel and 17-AAG)- loaded and rhodamine-123-loaded stealth hydrolysable crosslinked trastuzumab surface-tagged- P(LLA-HEMA) nanoparticles and carry out internalization and cytotoxicity studies. Aim 3: We will carry out biodistribution studies on Bodipy(R)-labeled stealth hydrolysable crosslinked trastuzumab surface-tagged- P(LLA-HEMA) nanoparticles and efficacy studies on drug (paclitaxel and 17-AAG)- loaded stealth hydrolysable crosslinked trastuzumab surface-tagged- P(LLA-HEMA) nanoparticles and internalization and cytotoxicity studies. This work will, when successfully completed, bring to bear the combined power of a chemotherapeutic agent, molecular targeted therapy and HSP90 inhibitor, to overcome HER-2 resistance with minimal toxicity."
"9338240","SUMMARY Optical imaging, which offers sufficient spatial resolution, specificity, sensitivity, and temporal resolution, has provided substantial insights into important biological processes at the cellular and molecular levels. Although high quality optical images can be obtained from in vitro cell cultures and/or thin tissue sections, intravital cell imaging in a complex, three-dimensional living tissue environment remains quite challenging. Because biological tissue naturally does not favor the propagation of light, and because of the inevitable presence of strong ambient light in the environment, special challenges arise in virtually every in vivo biomedical optical imaging, namely weak light signals and strong light backgrounds (including the multiply-scattered light in the tissue and the environment light). These challenges have significantly limited the full application of optical imaging in in vivo pre-clinical and clinical investigations. Currently, the detection of weak light signals for optical imaging relies heavily on the use of highly sensitive electronic detectors and electronic amplifiers. Although high-end electronic photo receivers are often very sensitive, the high sensitivity leads to the imaging systems being extremely prone to random photon noise, such environmental background (room) light, which is problematic for practical applications (e.g. in vivo studies and clinical practice). Furthermore, electronic detectors are incapable of distinguishing image-bearing ballistic photons from the multiply-scattered light background, which as a predominant source of noise in optical imaging of biological samples, can be overwhelming and significantly degrade resolution when imaging microstructure deep in tissue. In this proposed project, we will develop a multimodal microscope that utilizes a novel high speed optical parametric amplifier (OPA) to optically amplify weak back-scattered light signals, and demonstrate its capabilities by investigating in vivo cellular apoptosis events in murine skin. As shown by our preliminary data, the OPA will not only provide a high level of signal gain to improve detection sensitivity, but also provide an inherent nonlinear optical gate to both extract imaging-bearing signals and reject the noise sources from environmental photons and multiply-scattered background light. We will systematically explore the benefits afforded by this OPA for multimodal imaging that will include label-free reflectance confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography. Improvement in resolution, contrast, imaging depth, and reduced photo-damage, will be investigated. The successful completion of this project will demonstrate a high-speed, robust, optical intravital microscope that combines multiple modalities with enhanced performance and new fascinating imaging functions uniquely enabled by the OPA. This intravital microscope will not only enable new biological and clinical studies, but also promote the development of new optical imaging technologies based on optical amplifiers."

"9269193","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this proposal is to advance the physiological and potentially therapeutic understanding of angiotensin type 2 receptors (AT2R) in kidney function and blood pressure regulation, particularly in obesity. During the previous funding period, we clearly demonstrated that renal AT2R are transcriptionally up-regulated in obese rats. The activation of these receptors promotes natriuresis mainly via proximal tubule mechanism, and protects against blood pressure increase, especially in high Na-fed obese rats. Interestingly, however, we observed that AT2R has positive functional interaction with Ang(1-7)/MasR, which is considered as protective arm of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Specifically, we for the first time observed that pharmacological activation of AT2R in obese rats by specific agonists caused a marked increase in the kidney levels of Ang(1-7), a peptide hormone known to promote natriuresis by acting on MasR. This positive regulatory association between AT2R and Ang(1-7) was further supported by AT2R knockout mice. Further, the activity of neprilysin (NEP), a peptidase which generates Ang(1-7) from Ang I, was proportionally increased in the kidney cortex of AT2R agonist-treated obese rats. Moreover, NEP activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser6 of NEP by the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway, which is potentially inhibited by AT2R. Preliminary studies revealed that AT2R-mediated natriuresis in obese rats was dependent on MasR activation and vice-versa, suggesting a functional inter-dependence of these receptors. This notion is further supported by additional preliminary studies on co-immunoprecipitation and FRET between AT2R and MasR. Collectively, we hypothesize that the AT2R and MasR create a functional dimer to mediate cell signaling and promote natriuresis. This natriuretic function is intensified by an AT2R-mediated increase in Ang(1-7) levels generated by increased NEP activity. The increase in NEP results from inhibition of MEK/ERK1/2 by the AT2R. Two specific aims are developed. Aim 1 will determine that AT2R and MasR functionally interact to stimulate cell signaling and promote natriuresis. Aim 2 will determine that AT2R increases Ang(1-7) levels by inhibiting MAP kinase pathway, thereby enhancing NEP activity. We will employ physiological, biochemical and molecular approach for accomplishing these aims. Studies in kidney specific knockdown (KD) animals (AT2R KD, MasR KD, ACE2 KD, NEP KD) will be complemented by pharmacological manipulation of these target molecules. The proposed studies will significantly impact our understanding of the increasingly complex regulation of renal physiology by RAS. Specifically, our studies will lead to a greater appreciation of the role the Ang(1-7)/NEP(ACE2)/MasR axis plays in modulating natriuretic response to AT2R activation. We anticipate that this understanding will reveal AT2R, by virtue of its positive regulation of the protective arm of RAS, as a novel therapeutic target to reverse kidney dysfunction and treat hypertension, especially in obesity."
"9337381","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in AMD is a leading cause of vision loss. Oxidative stress and inflammation in the retina and RPE are believed to play important pathogenic roles in CNV. The canonical Wnt pathway is known to mediate inflammation, angiogenesis and fibrosis. Our previous studies have shown that very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) knockout (KO) results in Wnt pathway over-activation, retinal inflammation and sub-retinal neovascularization (NV). Our recent study demonstrated that the Wnt pathway is also over-activated in the laser-induced CNV model, and blockade of Wnt signaling attenuated NV in Vldlr-/- mice and the laser-induced CNV. This project will extend our ongoing studies and use Wnt signaling reporter mice to further verify the activation of Wnt signaling in the retina and RPE of Vldlr-/- mice and laser-induced CNV model. We will also knockout ß-catenin, an essential effector of Wnt signaling, in the RPE to determine if interruption of Wnt signaling attenuates NV in these models. These studies will establish the pathogenic role of aberrant regulation of Wnt signaling in CNV and reveal a novel therapeutic target. There are two major alternative splicing variants of VLDLR, VLDLR1 and VLDLR2. Our preliminary data showed that the retina expresses exclusively VLDLR2 which has higher ectodomain shedding into the extracellular space than VLDLR1. VLDLR2 is known to have lower affinity to VLDL, and its function in the retina is unclear. We will test the hypothesis that soluble VLDLR ectodomain (sVLDLRN) shed into the extracellular space and circulation may function as a soluble inhibitor of Wnt signaling and modulates Wnt signaling through dimerization with LRP6, an essential co-receptor in the Wnt pathway. The inhibitory effects of sVLDLRN and its deletion peptide fragments on Wnt signaling and on CNV will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo. This project will investigate if VLDLR2 has more potent inhibition of Wnt signaling, compared to VLDLR1, due to its higher ectodomain shedding. These studies will reveal a new function of VLDLR2 in the retina. This project will establish the receptor ectodomain shedding and receptor:receptor dimerization as a new mechanism for modulation of the Wnt pathway. The proposed studies will also explore a novel pathogenic mechanism for CNV in AMD models and reveal a new therapeutic target. Identification of the peptide fragment of VLDLR with anti-angiogenic activity in this project has potential to develop a therapeutic drug for CNV."
"9278147","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 2002-2006, the prospective Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study enrolled 3939 adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to address overarching goals of identifying predictors of rapid progression of kidney disease and clarifying the relationship between kidney dysfunction and the risks of subclinical and clinical cardiovascular events, death, and resource utilization. The proposed Phase III of CRIC, which extends follow-up through 2018, offers a unique opportunity to leverage the existing effort and success of CRIC to establish a cohort of participants with CKD who have long-term prospective follow-up on progression of kidney disease and a variety of different outcomes. This unparalleled resource will also expand the science related to CKD natural history as well as the impact on cardiovascular disease and other adverse events. This application is submitted in response to RFA-DK-12-508, Limited Competition: Continuation of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study (U01), on behalf of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Clinical Center. During the first two phases of the CRIC Study, the UIC Clinical Center research team has been successful in terms of recruitment, retention, protocol implementation, data quality, and scientific productivity. Noteworthy achievements at UIC have included a strong focus on heath disparities in CKD, a significant number of UIC investigator-led publications, and the promotion of new physician-scientists. In addition, the UIC investigators have successfully leveraged the CRIC infrastructure to secure a number of funded ancillary studies including the Hispanic CRIC Study (R01DK072231, Lash), Sleep as a Novel Risk Factor in CKD (R01DK071696, Van Cauter), a Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24, DK092290, Lash), a K23 Career Development Award (K23DK091313, Lora), a Diversity Supplement (Ricardo), and a Fogarty International Research Collaboration Award (R03TW009441, Lash)."
"9278146","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become an important public health challenge in the United States. CKD is a major risk factor for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death. Understanding novel risk factors for the progression of CKD, CVD, and other related comorbidities may help to develop effective approaches for early intervention in order to reduce the adverse disease burden.  The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study is a NIDDK-sponsored multi-center prospective cohort study designed to investigate novel risk factors for the progression of CKD and development of CVD among patients with CKD. The CRIC study enrolled 3,939 patients aged 21-74 years with CKD at 7 Clinical Centers from May 2003 to March 2007, and followed-up this cohort to June 2008 during phase 1. The CRIC study extended the follow-up of study participants through April 2013 in phase 2. The CRIC Tulane Clinical Center recruited 405 study participants and achieved the highest follow-up rate among all clinical centers despite the devastation caused by hurricane Katrina in the New Orleans area.  In phase 3 of the CRIC study, we propose to expand the study's scope to examine the relationship between reduced kidney function and outcomes in the elderly; to study the relationship of CKD severity and progression with a comprehensive set of outcomes beyond CVD and ESRD events; and to study the progression of kidney function decline and other clinical outcomes among patients with mild/moderate CKD. Specific aims to be addressed in phase 3 by the Tulane Clinical Center are: 1. to re-enroll a high percentage of phase 1 and 2 study participants into phase 3 of CRIC; 2. to enroll an additional 214 participants into phase 3 of CRIC; 3. to collect exposure and outcome data per the CRIC phase 3 protocol; 4. to maintain high levels of retention in the study; 5. to investigate self-reported clinical events and obtain supporting medical records and documentation; 6. to enter data and process/ship biological specimens; 7. to implement local quality assurance and quality control procedures as a means to obtain standardized, high quality measurements; 8. to monitor data collection, data entry, and follow-up rates; 9. to participate in governance and oversight of CRIC through study-wide subcommittees and activities; 10. to publish and present findings from the CRIC study; and 11. to promote and support the conduct of ancillary studies in CRIC, including collaboration with the broader nephrology research community.  The proposed research has important public health and clinical implications. The study findings may reveal novel and reversible underlying etiologic factors for the progression of CKD, CVD, and other related comorbid outcomes. This information will be useful to develop further intervention studies aimed at reducing total morbidity and mortality burdens among patients with CKD."
"9347244","ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. In 2015, an estimated 221,200 adults will be diagnosed with lung cancer and 158,040 will die from the disease in the United States. The rate of recurrence after initial treatment ranges between 30% to 63%, depending on the stage at initial diagnosis. The death rate is very high within one year after recurrence, approximately 48% to 80% depending on stage. It is generally acknowledged that earlier detection of recurrence before it is detectable by imaging may help improve the effectiveness of salvage therapy. The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to evaluate a non-invasive biomarker in the blood of cancer patients for early detection of lung cancer recurrence. The standard of care to monitor for recurrence is CT, or PET/CT imaging. There are two drawbacks to imaging: 1) lack of specificity, which may not accurately identify tumor recurrence (for example, inflammation mimics tumor regrowth), and 2) insufficient sensitivity, requiring tumors to be large enough for visual identification. Typically, tumors must show growth over serial imaging analyses and be larger than 5 mm to become suspicious. We propose that the newly characterized cancer-associate macrophage-like cell (CAML), which is found circulating in the blood of patients with cancer, may be a candidate for aiding earlier detection of lung cancer recurrence. Preliminary clinical data has shown that CAMLs are found in >85% of stage I, and >90% of stages II-IV, in numerous cancer types (breast, prostate, lung and pancreatic cancers), but not found in people without cancer. CAMLs have been shown to be more sensitive in detecting cancer than circulating tumor cells, or circulating tumor DNA, and are specifically present in progressing malignancies. In this Phase I SBIR, blood will be collected from 30 stage II and III unresectable patients treated by chemoradiation at three time intervals: at last treatment and at the time of imaging 3 months and 6 months after treatment. The specific aims are to show that the presence of CAMLs is correlative with early recurrence in lung cancer and further that CAMLs can detect disease recurrence earlier than standard surveillance imaging methods."
"9316641","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to develop a new technology for non-invasive optical monitoring of activity of individual retinal neurons and their light-driven inputs at cellular resolution, in the living human retina. If successful, this technology will provide an entirely new and objective approach to understand and monitor treatment of retinal disease, thereby transforming scientific studies of the eye and vision. This project directly addresses the priorities outlined in the RFA-EY-14-001, the first RFA within the NEI Audacious Goal Initiative.  The proposed work relies on combining and validating two new approaches. First, interferometry (including phase-resolved OCT; Park Lab at UC Riverside) can, in principle, be used to measure nanometer-scale distortions in the membranes of cells that occur during membrane depolarization and ion influx. With depth resolution, these measurements will enable us to measure neural activity non-invasively, throughout the layers of the retina, at cellular resolution. Second, adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Roorda Lab at UC Berkeley) and image-based eye tracking can be used to position stimulating and measurement beams on the retina with cellular precision in the living eye, by overcoming optical aberrations and eye jitter. This technology will allow us to activate individual photoreceptors and groups of photoreceptors with visible light while imaging the resulting electrical activity of individual downstream cells, in vivo.  To advance and combine these approaches requires a stepwise aggregation of technology. In a unique collaboration, we will build on simpler wide-field interferometric measurements of electrical activity in isolated retina (Palanker Lab at Stanford University), combined with large-scale multi-electrode physiological measurements in primate retina (Chichilnisky Lab at Stanford University) to validate and tune the optical measurements.  Ultimately, the innovation at each step forms a powerful tool, independently or with a combination of other approaches, and finds applicability to optical imaging, retinal physiology, psychophysics and clinical ophthalmology. The specific aims are: Aim 1. Wide-field interferometry for measuring patterns of neural activity in primate retina Depolarization during neural signaling produces nanometer-scale deformations in cells that are detectable with interferometry. The simplest approach is wide-field interferometric microscopy with transmission geometry in isolated retina. We will measure depth-resolved optical phase changes produced by neural activity in primate retina, and use them for physiological characterizations of many retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and other retinal neurons simultaneously. Aim 2. Phase-resolved OCT for reflectance measurements of patterns of retinal activity. The next step toward human application is phase-resolved OCT; essentially, low-coherence interferometry and a well-established tool for in vivo imaging. We will record optical path length changes associated with neural activity in reflection geometry using point-scanning, near-IR (1060 nm), phase-resolved OCT on isolated primate retina. Aim 3. Adaptive optics, eye tracking and phase-resolved OCT for measuring human retinal function. Deployment in humans requires compensating for optical aberrations in the eye as well as eye movements. We will develop a system that uses AOSLO to image the retina for eye tracking, targeted delivery of stimulation light, and positioning of the OCT probe. We will test this system in humans and demonstrate its potential application in clinical settings."
"9322282","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal for our K12 program, Application of Omics in Lung Disease, is to provide multidisciplinary career development that will equip MD, PhD or MD/PhD scholars with the knowledge and skills to apply pan- omics and integrative approaches to elucidating the genomic and molecular bases of lung diseases. Our Lung Omics Program will provide opportunities for two highly qualified scholars per year, who are in year 1 or 2 of their faculty positions, to understand and apply omics technologies to cutting edge questions in their developing research programs focused on the pathobiology of lung diseases and personalized medicine. The rationale is based upon the clear need for training in the use of omics. The design of our Program addresses this need by providing opportunities in forefront omics, bioinformatics and clinical research. Our Program consists of four omics, leading expertise in bioinformatics, integrative systems analysis of complex biological systems, and clinical research, as well as opportunities to use cohorts in large databases, biobanks and electronic medical record. Our omics include genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome. Genomics offers opportunities in COPD, pneumonia, acute lung injury, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and environmental lung disease, using microarrays, RNA sequencing, GWAS to asses modifier genes, biomarkers and transcriptomes to study the DNA and RNA genomes. Proteomics focuses on the blood and airway proteomes, both the mucus proteome and the exosome proteome, and pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells. Metabolomics includes the metabolome of the airway, both epithelial cells and macrophages, in CF and COPD, as well as the effect of hypoxia. Microbiomics pursues the airway microbiome in COPD, CF, PCD, environmental lung disease and pneumonia. This Lung Omics Career Development Program offers robust and cutting edge bioinformatics and longstanding programs in systems biology and integrative analyses of omics data. Clinical research programs are numerous and focused in these same areas of lung disease, offering our scholars opportunities and expertise in many lung diseases on which to base their omic studies. In addition to the 15 faculty mentors leading these omics and associated areas, 12 additional faculty who utilize multiple omics within their research programs also serve as mentors. Scholars will be selected through a rigorous application process. Mentorship is a critical component of our program; each scholar will have a primary and secondary mentor, as well as additional mentors as appropriate for their career development. Each scholar will have a scholarly oversight committee who meet regularly and provide guidance in career development. Each scholar will be supported for 2-3 years and will apply for individual K or R awards as appropriate. Our Program will thus facilitate the career development of our scholars and prepare them for successful careers as independent investigators using omics, bioinformatics and integrative systems analyses to pursue important questions in lung diseases."

The applicant proposes to supplement his significant training and research experience in physics and engineering with a mentored career development program in multimodal neuroimaging of the neurobiological and pharmacological aspects of substance abuse. The applicant's short-term goal is to apply the techniques he has developed with NIRS and fMRI to substance abuse studies, and during this process deepen his knowledge of the neurobiology of substance abuse. The applicant's long-term goal is to establish expertise in the field of substance abuse imaging, to be able to identify pressing problems in the field, and develop corresponding effective imaging techniques to study them. The K25 will help the applicant achieve the short-term goal and serve as a stepping-stone for the long-term goal. The training plan includes one-on-one training sessions with proposed mentors, hands-on research, course work, laboratory visits, attendance at national and international scientific meetings, and training in responsible conduct of research. During the early years of the grant, the applicant will take courses in neuroanatomy, neurobiology and substance abuse. The research component of this proposal is structured to allow the applicant to develop imaging biomarkers of acute smoking effects on the cognitive functions using multiple imaging modalities, including near-infrared spectroscopy and functional MRI. The three experiments outlined in this proposal will target three smoking-related markers: brain activation in prefrontal areas known to be involved with executive function and decision-making; the resting state networks thought to be involved with self-monitoring; and the patterns of brain activation associated with tobacco craving and its reduction through smoking. Studying continuous interactions between these markers and tobacco smoking before, during and after smoking will aid in developing and objectively evaluating new treatments. The new techniques developed by the applicant address confounding signals that have severely curtailed the application of BOLD fMRI to a number of substance abuse studies. They allow uninterrupted smoking to be monitored by NIRS and fMRI. Through these experiments, the applicant will acquire skills in all aspects of clinic research studies and give him experience in the practical issues of human substance abuse studies. The experiments will be performed at the McLean Hospital Brain Imaging Center, which has excellent facilities and staff for performing sophisticated NIRS and fMRI experiments in substance abuse. The integrated training and research plans will equip the applicant to shift his research from technology development to biological and pharmaceutical applications. The proposed mentored training plan will assist the applicant to become an independent investigator developing and applying new imaging techniques and analytical tools to study substance abuse."
"9275460","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed implementation research addresses a longstanding and vexing problem in behavioral health care: Access to integrated services for persons with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders. Despite decades of awareness of this problem, at present, less than 10% of treated patients with co-occurring disorders receive evidence-based integrated services. Implementation science holds to key to addressing this persistent gap. The present study unifies and operationalizes three major implementation research heuristics: the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, the Stages of Implementation Completion, and the Proctor et al (2011) taxonomy of implementation outcomes. Developed by industrial engineers, a multi-faceted implementation strategy, NIATx, has proven to be effective in implementing and sustaining simple interventions in behavioral health care services. The overarching goal of this project is to test whether NIATx strategies are effective in implementing a complex evidence-based intervention: Integrated services for persons with co-occurring disorders. Promising pilot data suggest that NIATx actually can integrate services, but a more rigorous study is needed. We now take this step and herein propose a cluster randomized wait-list control group design, in which a cohort of 23 agencies receive the active NIATx approach while the other cohort of 23 agencies are waitlisted. In the second phase, the wait-list group of 23 agencies participates in NIATx and the initial group enters a sustainment phase. Hypothesized to install and sustain integrated services, NIATx is examined for effectiveness on two core implementation outcomes: fidelity and penetration, as well as patient care outcomes (psychiatric and substance use symptom reduction). Variation in the extent of and fidelity to which NIATx strategies are delivered are evaluated using the NIATx Fidelity Scale, which embeds the Stages of Implementation Completion measure. Primary outcomes are assessed at pre- implementation, post-implementation and at sustainment follow-up periods. Qualitative and economic analyses augment the quantitative data, and add to the interpretation of organizational and social dynamics, as well as resource costs. We assemble a multi-disciplinary research team with considerable and complementary expertise and experience. Capitalizing on a technically sophisticated clinical management information capacity across a state system of care (Washington), the study engages representative outpatient programs across 20 counties. Consistent with US data, the participating agencies and their key stakeholders are highly motivated to improve services for patients with co-occurring disorders. Practical implementation strategies, including their associated costs, and the measurable impact on services and patient outcomes, will be definitive research products. Findings from this robust study are immediately applicable to improve clinical services, to advance implementation research, and ultimately, to guide future implementations with other behavioral health systems and settings."

He completed his PhD and his post-doctoral training in the Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy at the University of Southern California (USC). While at USC, he worked on several federally funded research grants, including 3 ethnographic studies and two randomized controlled trials. In his current position, he works with two NIDRR-funded research teams, the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Model System and the SCI Model System, both housed in the UW Department of Rehabilitation Medicine. Dr. Fogelberg's research experience includes multiple phases of the translational research process: collecting and analyzing qualitative, descriptive data; translating these data into structured clinical protocols suitable for testing; and preparing for and implementing an RCT. He has been actively involved in research concerning spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation since 2005. Dr. Fogelberg's main research interest is in sleep disturbance in the context of chronic neurological conditions. His long term career objectives are to examine the impact of sleep disturbance on rehabilitation outcomes; to translate this knowledge into novel evidence- based rehabilitation strategies; and to utilize rigorous clinical trials research to evaluate interventions for sleep disturbance in those with chronic neurological conditions. Currently, his research is focused on sleep disturbance in SCI, with a view to developing a better understanding of both the frequency of sleep problems in SCI and the relationship of sleep disturbances to co-morbid conditions that are common in SCI, and developing more effective means of detecting sleep disturbance in this population. Environment The University of Washington School of Medicine consistently ranks among the top Medical Schools in the nation in the U.S. News and World Report for its excellence in research, clinical training programs, and patient care. The School of Medicine is an international leader in biomedical research, receiving over $500 million in research funding annually. The Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington has had a strong commitment to research since its inception. Research, both basic and clinical, is a major component of the departmental mission. The Department is consistently ranked in the top two in NIH funding and the top three in overall research funding for all rehabilitation departments. The department has six federally funded centers, including Model Systems grants for Spinal Cord Injuries, Traumatic Brain Injuries, and Burns; a Research and Training Center Grant for Multiple Sclerosis; a Program Project in Chronic Pain Management; and a Center for Outcomes Research in Rehabilitation. Research I will conduct two studies during the course of this award. From month 7 to month 30, I will complete a sleep study with two main components, each addressing one of my specific aims. The first component will be a structured cognitive interview with individuals living with SCI. Cognitive interviewing is a theory-based interview technique which focusses on the cognitive processes used by questionnaire respondents in generating their responses to survey or questionnaire items. The purpose of these interviews is to identify sources of response errors and improve questionnaire design. Working with the same subjects, I will then gather objective data on key sleep parameters using both actigraphy (ACT) and in-home polysomnography (PSG). After completing the sleep study, I will conduct the second study, a survey of adults with SCI. This survey will yield data on the psychometric properties of the screening instrument; the frequency of symptoms indicating insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD), and sleep related breathing disorders (SRBD) and the relationship of sleep disturbances to commonly co-occurring disorders."

By incorporating this bi-directional model in the creation of a robust translational science infrastructure, the OSU CCTS will foster both the traditional discovery to best practice paradigm as well as taking advantage of the insight garnered from our foundation of excellence in clinical care to stimulate basic discovery and clinical research inquiry. The vision and specific aims will be achieved through an integrated model of governance and partnership, home, and leadership for clinical and translational research spanning NCH and OSU; focused pilot funding initiatives for new team development within an innovation ecosystem; unique educational and training architecture which integrates acquisition of core competencies in research methodology, interpretation of results, implementation of findings, design thinking, team leadership skills and business acumen with rigorous discipline-specific laboratory (bench, clinical or community) training; and a clinical and translational science infrastructure that is cohesive, innovative.and adaptable and more effective than the services that currently exist in order to ensure provision of the full range of disease-agnostic scientific resources needed to traverse the continuum of research from T1-4. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The Center for Clinical and Translational Science will improve human health by bringing the benefits of science more quickly into patient care."
"9409773","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The recent acceleration in incidence and intensity of human disease caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has prompted an international outcry for safe and effective countermeasures. Currently protection against mosquito bites and vector control are the only measures available to prevent ZIKV infections. A vaccine is urgently needed. The studies proposed here build on previous work that demonstrates the protective efficacy of recombinant vaccines using the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) live viral vector. GeoVax has constructed two novel MVA vaccine candidates against ZIKV: one expressing the ZIKV NS1 protein, and a second expressing ZIKV prME. Both vaccine candidates show excellent immunogenicity and protective efficacy against ZIKV infection in a stringent intracerebral challenge mouse model. In this application, we propose to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these two vaccine candidates in rhesus macaques (RM). The project has three specific aims. Under the first aim, GeoVax will scale up vaccine production for a large study in RM and develop methods for quality control and standardization of methods for vaccine preparation. Under the second aim, RM will be immunized with the two vaccines following either a prime-only or a prime-boost vaccination regimen. Samples will be collected from the immunized animals at discrete intervals and tested for antigen-specific antibody by ELISA, for neutralizing antibody by PRNT50, and for antigen-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry of cells stained by intracellular cytokine staining for activation of CD4+ and CD8+ populations. The protective efficacy of these vaccines in RM will be tested by challenging the immunized animals with live ZIKV and assessing viral load in serum and other tissues compared to the sham immunized control group. Under the third aim we will investigate the role of antibody in protection using passive transfer experiments in mice. Purified IgG from sera of immunized RM will be passively transferred to mice that will then be challenged with appropriate ZIKV strains and assessed for temporal viremia following intravenous challenge. Additionally, we will test RM immune sera and controls for potential antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) using Dengue serotype 2 as a model, and for the presence of autoantibodies that react with self-antigens. The vaccine candidate yielding optimal protection with minimal detrimental effects will be chosen for further development. The long term objective of this project is clinical development and testing of vaccine candidates against ZIKV infection, in response to a 2016 NIAID call to the research community highlighting its interest in funding such research. Upon completion of this two-year project, GeoVax will submit a Phase II SBIR to request funding for further development of the selected vaccine candidate in preparation for human clinical testing."
"9274949","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This multidisciplinary translational research project has generated a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) with high affinity for cocaine (Kd = 4 nM) and specificity over cocaine's inactive metabolites. This unique new molecular entity (preclinical designation, h2E2) consists of a human gamma 1 (?1) heavy chain and humanized lamda (?) light chain with a human constant region and murine variable region. The h2E2 mAb has approximately 95% sequence identity with a human IgG1 isotype. This antibody is at an advanced stage of preclinical development for eventual use in the prevention of relapse in treatment-seeking cocaine abusers. The human sequence of this mAb should confer safety and long-term efficacy in clinical use. Anti-cocaine mAbs bind to and sequester cocaine in the peripheral circulation and we have shown that h2E2 dramatically lowers brain cocaine concentrations in mice and in rats. Furthermore, h2E2 antagonizes the effect of cocaine in a rat model of relapse. Our industry collaborator, Catalent Inc., has used their GPEx technology to produce a series of mammalian cell lines that have exceeded the established production milestone as demonstrated by an initial 10 liter production that run provided 5.7 grams of purified recombinant h2E2. This recombinant mAb has met the established go-no go criteria set by our comprehensive battery of in vitro and in vivo tests of efficacy and is our lead candidate. Work can now proceed to select the best producing cell line to serve as our production platform for commercialization of this immunotherapeutic agent. The establishment of a Master Cell Bank, a Working Cell Bank and a GMP-compliant production platform is proposed that will provide the required quantities of purified h2E2. The overall goal o the proposed studies is to provide the comprehensive in vitro human tissue cross-reactivity studies, the in vivo single-dose toxicology studies and the in vivo efficacy studies in animal models of cocaine relapse and addiction that are required for inclusion in an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA."
"9224458","Identifying risk factors to prevent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries remains a major objective of musculoskeletal research. Athletic participation in the United States among children and adolescents has increased over the last three decades, resulting in a greater prevalence of ACL injuries. The frequency of ACL injuries among individuals under 15 years of age has risen 924% since 1994 despite the incorporation of injury prevention programs in youth sports. Further, 70% of ACL injuries occur while performing non-contact maneuvers (e.g. single foot landings, pivots). Yet, it remains unclear whether these injuries result from a single overload event or a fatigue failure wherein a period of intervention is available. Injuries are likely multifactorial and influenced by an individual's natural anatomical variation. Fatigue failure of the ACL via repetitive loading, combined with the natural variation in anatomical structure between individuals, has largely been overlooked as an explanatory mechanism for unanticipated ACL failures. We showed previously that ACL cross-sectional area (CSA) is a significant predictor of peak relative strain. However, injury risk between individuals is not easily delineated because of the large degree of variation in this trait. We hypothesize that the natural variation in ACL CSA is accompanied by coordinated changes in tissue-level mechanical properties and/or other gross anatomical features that together allow the `ACL-complex' (i.e. the ligament and its entheses) to be mechanically functional under routine loading conditions. We further hypothesize that this coordination, although effective in establishing the strength of the ACL-complex, may result in changes in tissue-level mechanical properties that deleteriously affect the fatigue resistance of the ACL-complex for certain individuals. We will test our hypotheses using a mouse model that mirrors the natural variation in ACL-complex traits among humans. At the completion of this work we will have an established mouse model for generating new hypotheses, along with a better understanding of how the ACL-complex develops postnatally and functionally adapts to mechanical loads. These outcomes are expected to guide interventions aimed at maximizing ACL strength while minimizing ACL rupture among children and adolescents, and to have a broad positive impact in other anatomically unique locations where ligamentous and tendinous injuries routinely occur (e.g. rotator cuff, elbow, spine) and are likely influenced by a similar complex adaptive system wherein multiple traits are coordinated to establish organ-level strength and stiffness."

"9271992","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asthma and atopic diseases are major health burdens in the westernized world. The mechanism(s) responsible for the development and exacerbation of these diseases are not well understood. Respiratory viral infections have been implicated in development and exacerbation of atopic disease. We have utilized a mouse model of paramyxoviral infection where infection with Sendai virus (SeV) leads to a long-lasting post-viral atopic disease with airway hyperreactivity and mucous cell metaplasia. This pro-atopic paradigm depends upon recruitment of CD49d expressing neutrophils (PMN), which, through an unknown mechanism, drive expression of the high-affinity receptor for IgE on lung dendritic cells. Anti-SeV IgE is made which crosslinks this receptor, ultimately leading to recruitment of IL13 producing Th2 cells. Whether modulation of the PMN subsets can impact disease is not known, nor is it clear what role IgE plays during the antiviral immune response. We hypothesize that specific components of the pulmonary immune response to viruses (i.e., CD49d+ PMN and IgE) drive development of atopic disease, and can be modulated to reduce the atopic disease risk. To test this hypothesis we propose these specific aims: 1) Determine if manipulation of CD49d expressing PMN can prevent post-viral atopic disease. 2) Determine the mechanism through which CD49d expressing PMN induce cDC FceRI. 3) Determine the functional relevance of IgE during the antiviral immune response. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how CD49d+ PMN differ from CD49d- PMN, whether modulation of their recruitment affects the development of post-viral atopic disease, and whether similar cells exist in humans. The mechanism through which CD49d+ PMN drive dendritic cell expression of FceRI will be known, and we will have determined the functional relevance of IgE in the antiviral immune response. Together, these studies will help us refine and focus potential therapeutic interventions in the future to prevent the development and exacerbation of post-viral atopic disease."
"9347988","Rational antibody therapy for IPF ABSTRACT  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fatal lung disease with rapid, progressive loss of pulmonary function. Five year mortality rate (20-40%) for IPF is greater than many malignancies, including bladder cancer, colon cancer and multiple myeloma. A major need exists for effective therapeutics.  IPF is characterized by increased collagen deposition (fibrosis) by an excessive number of myofibroblasts in the lung interstitium. Inappropriate proliferation and function of fibroblasts, alveolar epithelial cells, and embedded mesenchymal stem cells play key roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. Wnt signaling appears to be necessary for fibrosis in a wide variety of fibrotic diseases including IPF. This is consistent with Wnt signaling playing a key regulatory role in normal wound healing, tissue repair and regeneration. Fibrotic disease is hypothesized to result from aberrant repair/regeneration in which alveolar type 2 (AT2) progenitor cells stop functioning midway through repair. Attenuation of Wnt signaling decreases pulmonary fibrosis in several mouse models of IPF. A unifying treatment hypothesis for fibrotic disease suggests attenuating pathologically high levels of Wnt signaling, yet preserving sufficient signaling to permit repair to resume.  We have developed a biologically active monoclonal Ab (mAb) that binds to the E1/E2 domains of Wnt co- receptor LRP6 to reduce Wnt signaling by direct competition. The mAb also down-regulates LRP6 expression through endocytosis, Our anti-LRP6 mAb likely works in part by competing with the pro-fibrotic Wnts that activate canonical Wnt signaling AND decreasing the ability of LRP6 to act as a co-receptor for PDGF-BB, CTGF and TGF-beta mediated signaling. This mAb demonstrates significant biological activity in mouse models of diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization and diabetic kidney disease.  In phase I we constructed humanized versions of this mAb (HuLRP6) that a) bind LRP6 to attenuate Wnt signaling and b) reduced fibrosis in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis. In Phase II these studies will be expanded to show that HuLRP6 can sufficiently antagonize Wnt signaling in pulmonary fibrosis to inhibit progression of fibrosis of IPF and restore the cellular and extracellular milieu to permit homeostatic repair. We will produce HuLRP6 at sufficient levels to conduct preclinical toxicology, pharmacokinetic and additional efficacy studies. HuLRP6 is expected to be a first-in-class rationally designed therapy to reduce fibrosis in IPF, capable of completely blocking progression and possibly reverting fibrosis and may be useful in other fibrotic diseases associated with aberrant Wnt signaling affecting the skin, liver, heart and kidney.

"9328415","Project Summary_________________________________________________________________________ Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects ~17 million Americans, contributing to more than 2.5 million deaths each year in the United States alone and costing the United States $249 billion annually. Excessive alcohol drinking by individuals with AUD contributes to alcohol-related injury and death, currently the 4th leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying an individual?s response to alcohol, and his/her propensity to develop AUD, are not entirely understood. It is known that alcohol alters neurotransmission in mesocorticolimbic circuitry, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and that chronic alcohol alters neurotransmission in the central amygdala (CeA), an area involved in escalated alcohol drinking. Recent research showed that there is considerable heterogeneity among VTA dopamine (DA) neurons, and that classification of these neurons based on projection targets reveals different responses of neuronal subsets to rewarding and aversive stimuli. Important for the work proposed here, there is a functional connection between the VTA and CeA, and although each of these regions is important for addictive behavior, the role of the connection between them in addictive behaviors is unknown. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that VTA DA neurons projecting to the CeA are critical for mediating alcohol dependence-induced escalation of alcohol drinking. To test this hypothesis, the proposal will utilize a combination of anatomical, cellular, and behavioral techniques. This proposal will provide a promising young scientist with vital research training and professional development opportunities facilitated by experiments that use an integrative approach to test the predictions that: 1) VTA DA neurons projecting to the CeA display increased activity following repeated cycles of alcohol exposure and withdrawal, and 2) VTA DA projections to CeA mediate escalation of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent animals. The results of these studies will open new avenues of neuroscientific investigation exploring the crosstalk between brain reward and brain stress systems in addiction. This work may also inform development of treatment strategies for reducing escalated alcohol drinking in individuals with AUD, leading to improvements in quality of life and health of affected individuals, decreasing morbidity associated with these disorders, and potentially saving the U.S. millions of dollars in health care costs."
"9320937","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects over 350 million worldwide and over 1.5 million Americans, placing them at risk for developing cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The natural history of HBV is variable but tends to follow 4 phases: immune tolerant (IT), immune active (IA), inactive, and clearance. These phases are dependent on age of exposure and both viral and host characteristics. Current guidelines recommend treatment only in those with immune active disease. Although viral suppression is achievable in most patients with oral anti-HBV therapy, cure is not possible because of persistent virus in hepatocytes in the form of covalently closed circular DNA and the integration of HBV DNA into the human genome. The Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN), established in 2008, is composed of 21 adult and 7 pediatric sites, a Virology/Serology Core, an Immunology Center, and a Data Coordinating Center. During the initial funding period, the Network established an Adult and Pediatric Cohort study, an Adult IA study, an Adult and Pediatric IT study, and several Ancillary studies that focus on specific aspects of various clinica scenarios. Over the initial funding cycle, the HBRN has enrolled 1869 adults and 368 children. The bio-specimen repository contains over 188,000 adult and 7300 pediatric plasma and serum samples, and over 1479 adult and 205 pediatric whole blood DNA specimens. The primary goals of the HBRN over the course of the next funding cycle are to perform clinical trials on chronic HBV in adults and children, prospectively quantify outcomes in the database cohort, and leverage these data and previously collected bio-specimens to better understand disease progression, and validate clinically meaningful biomarkers. The specific aims of these studies are as follows: 1. To successfully complete the studies which have been initiated during the initial funding period. 2. To successfully complete all Ancillary Studies already approved by the HBRN during the initial funding period. 3. To undertake new Ancillary Studies in Adults and Children based on the clinical material and samples collected during the previous funding period. During the initial funding period, several novel populations were enrolled, which will allow the HBRN to address several gaps in knowledge such as (a) characterize histologic, virologic, and immunologic features of those with indeterminate HBV (neither IA, IT, or inactive), (b) determine the clinical implications of stopping anti-viral therapy in those outside of the IT ad IA trials. (c) treatment for hepatitis delta virus, and (d) assess the long-term effects of tenofovr on bone health."
"9503867","Cardiovascular epidemiologic research historically has focused on men, because male sex is one of the major  risk factors for CVD. Consequently, numerous diagnostic and treatment strategies for CVD in women have  been extrapolated from results of studies conducted in men, and sex-specific factors largely have been ignored.  It became apparent in the 1980s that the decrease in cardiovascular mortality in men was not accompanied  by a similar decrease in women. One of the reasons for this difference might be sex-based disparities  in cardiovascular care; women have been both under evaluated for CVD and under treated for modifiable  risk factors for CVD. In addition, female-specific conditions, such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,  menopause, and hormone use, might affect the onset of CVD, its clinical course, the efficacy of therapy, and,  ultimately, prognosis.  This proposal responds to RFA-OD-11-003 by identifying complications of hypertensive pregnancy disorders  as a major biological sex difference that may influence the future cardiovascular and cognitive health of the  affected women. Results of the proposed research may open new venues for the prevention, diagnosis, and  treatment of CVD and cognitive impairment in women."

"9214232","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)          This is an application for a Career Development Award-2 (CDA-2) to Dr. Alexa A. Pragman, M.D., Ph.D., an Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota with a record of research and publications on the lung microbiota. She is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lung microbiota. She intends to join the staff at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MVAMC) in the Infectious Diseases Section. This CDA-2 will provide Dr. Pragman with the support and training necessary to achieve the following goals: 1) become an expert in clinical and translational research involving the lung microbiota; 2) apply advanced biostatistical analysis tools in clinical microbiota studies; 3) design clinical trials involving COPD and the lun microbiota; and 4) become an independent clinical investigator. To achieve these goals, Dr. Pragman has assembled a mentorship team consisting of Dr. James R. Johnson, a MVAMC researcher and infectious disease clinician who studies molecular epidemiology; Dr. Christine Wendt, the Pulmonary Section chief at MVAMC, with expertise in COPD clinical studies; Dr. Richard E. Isaacson, a senior researcher with expertise in microbiome studies; and Dr. Cavan S. Reilly, a biostatistician with expertise in statistical approaches to metagenomic data sets. They will monitor Dr. Pragman's career development as she takes 4 biostatistics courses, attends two national genomics workshops, participates in seminar series at MVAMC and the University of Minnesota, develops her grant-writing skills, presents at national conferences, and submits foundation grants and a Merit Award application. COPD has multiple disease phenotypes and the mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity are poorly understood. Inflammation in response to the COPD lung microbiota is one potential mechanism by which some patients suffer frequent exacerbations and others do not. In Aim 1, Dr. Pragman will identify patients undergoing clinically indicated lung lobectomy and sample their oral, nasal, sputum, and lung tissue microbiota in a manner that avoids upper airway contamination. This study will identify a method for accurate, non- invasive sampling of the lung microbiota. This work will define the microbiota of the COPD lung and the healthy lung without upper airway contamination and will establish a non-invasive technique for studying the lung microbiota. In Aim 2, Dr. Pragman will conduct a prospective study comparing the lung microbiota and lung inflammatory biomarkers of frequent exacerbators to infrequent exacerbators. She will identify specific co-varying microbiota and sputum inflammatory biomarkers that can identify exacerbation phenotype and also serve as targets for new COPD therapies. Both aims will utilize advanced biostatistical tools, which will allow Dr. Pragman to correlate specific features f the lung microbiota with lung inflammation. The overall objective in the proposed project is to determine key features that differentiate the upper airway and lung microbiota of COPD patients with a frequent exacerbator phenotype from those with the infrequent exacerbator phenotype. Dr. Pragman's long-term goal is to understand the role of the lung microbiota in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disorders. This work will form the basis for further clinical and  translational research to establish the mechanisms by which the lung microbiota contributes to COPD pathogenesis. These studies will be proposed in a Merit Award application before the end of the CDA-2 period."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Veterinarians are broadly trained health professionals who are uniquely qualified to participate in biomedical research, having an understanding of disease in the context of the whole organism. The One Science, One Health concept, integrating principles and discoveries in both human and veterinary medicine, has received increased attention with new zoonotic outbreaks as well as increasingly common chronic aging conditions.1,2 The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research is designed to open up new opportunities to tackle the multifactorial causes of diseases not yet understood, particularly those associated with a longer lived, aging population with multiple conditions such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus, autoimmunity, and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. There is a need to understand the impact of genotype/posttranslational events on these conditions. Increasingly, research progress requires multidisciplinary teams creating novel approaches to understanding disease mechanistically and translating findings into preventative measures and treatments. Veterinary researchers uniquely contribute to all areas of comparative biomedical research, particularly in animal model-based research, which has been expanding to an estimated half of all current NIH research projects. Significant matching funds from Texas A&M University will continue to increase the impact of this T32 program and help alleviate this national shortage.  The proposed research program is broadly interdisciplinary, with mentors having significant peer-reviewed funding. These outstanding mentors were chosen from 5 Texas A&M University colleges, and share in common their desire to train veterinarians in basic biomedical research. Research areas include infectious and metabolic diseases, toxicology, nutrition, developmental biology, cancer and neuroscience, giving mentees the broadest possible selection of biomedical research areas, as well as outstanding mentors.  In this competitive renewal proposal, we propose to continue providing outstanding mentors and an excellent environment for veterinarians to obtain significant biomedical research experience. The program has enrolled 6 DVMs since the beginning of the program in 2010 and 2 have finished their program, while 4 are still in training. The two trainees who have finished the program obtained PhDs and both are now employed as Assistant Professors at major universities. One has recently obtained a NIH KO8 award. Thus our trainees in this young program have attained an excellent track record to date."

Youth constitute a key target population for injectable PrEP, and careful examination of these factors will inform the design of future efficacy and effectiveness trials and ensure development of a product that will achieve high uptake and use. HIV PrEP trials and demonstration projects have suffered from suboptimal adherence. Biomarker assessments of product use in several recent PrEP trials in sub-Saharan Africa indicate that youth experience the greatest challenges with adherence to daily PrEP. Our team has just commenced development of a thin-film polymer device (TFPD) for PrEP delivery; however, it is critical to examine end-user and health delivery system issues that may impact adherence in the early stages of product development and clinical testing. Although an injectable method will simplify product delivery and overcome many of the barriers to use of existing methods, uptake of and adherence to an injectable PrEP method by youth is not a foregone conclusion. Youth have distinct risk profiles and experience social and structural barriers that shape risk perception and adoption of HIV prevention practices. The proposed study will take place in Cape Town, South Africa, and will focus on men and women aged 18-24, who constitute one of the populations most at risk for HIV acquisition globally. The research will be led by an early-stage Investigator with extensive experience evaluating factors contributing to the acceptability and adherence to novel HIV prevention methods in this setting, in partnership with Investigators at the Desmond Tutu HIV Research Foundation in Cape Town, South Africa. In the first phase of the study, we will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews (IDI) with 60 young women and men who have completed injectable, vaginal ring, and oral PrEP studies, and are PrEP-experienced. Using a socio-ecological framework, we will explore end- user factors at the individual, intrapersonal, and structural levels that influence uptake of and adherence to new health technologies (Aim 1). This formative data will then inform the design of a computerized, questionnaire-based, discrete-choice experiment (or choice-format conjoint analysis) that will be administered to 600 PrEP-naïve youth residing in a high-density township in Cape Town. We will determine the key product design and health delivery system attributes that are most preferable and salient to adherence for an injectable PrEP method for young people (Aim 2). Through dissemination meetings, research findings will be integrated into product development of our own team's TFPD development and clinical testing of existing and other novel sustained-release injectables."
"9384627","Project Summary Consistent with its functions in maintaining barrier integrity and preventing infection, the skin is home to a number of specialized T cell populations that not only combat infection but also work in concert to help maintain normal tissue homeostasis and promote wound repair. However, despite significant advances in understanding cutaneous immunity, the specific functions of different populations of cutaneous T cells, their roles in maintaining normal skin homeostasis, and contributions to inflammatory diseases of the skin remain poorly understood. In this respect, reliance on animal models can be problematic due to fundamental structural differences in the skin in humans vs. mice, and a lack of direct correspondence between cutaneous T cell populations in these species. Additionally, although skin-tropic T cells can be readily identified in peripheral blood based on their expression of the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), the developmental and functional relationship of these cells in the blood with the different populations of T cells in the skin is still poorly understood. We have identified a novel population of CLA+CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects that expresses the CD103 integrin and produces the novel cytokine combination of IL-22, GM-CSF and IL-13 upon activation (CD103+CLAhi cells). Interestingly, this cytokine combination is also produced by phenotypically similar epidermal CD103 CLA CD69 TRM in the skin itself. Based on the ability of IL-22 to promote  + hi + keratinocyte proliferation, migration and production of antimicrobial peptides, and GM-CSF and IL-13 to act on fibroblasts, and to mediate the differentiation of monocytes and macrophages into `alternatively activated' cells that promote tissue repair, we hypothesize CD103+CLAhi T cells in the blood represent a recirculating fraction of CD103+CLAhi TRM, and that these cells help coordinate the host-protective and wound healing responses following tissue damage in the skin. As such, these cells have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically to promote sterile wound healing and to optimize the development and function of engineered tissue grafts.  In this proposal, we will use in vitro analyses and innovative humanized mouse models to test these hypotheses, assessing the developmental origins and trafficking behavior of CD103+CLAhi cells and determining their function during cutaneous tissue-repair responses."
"9208498","Project Summary  The focus of this program is to create high-performance, low-cost, passive prosthetic knees that can accurately replicate physiological gait in multiple mobility scenarios. The product of this work will be knee technology that drastically enhances the mobility and quality of life for lower leg amputees in the developing world, while also providing a cost effective option with enhanced performance to developed world users. The foundation of this research is our novel method for determining the knee torque profile required for a low-mass prosthesis to replicate a given gait behavior, calculated from able-bodied kinematic and kinetic data for the same behavior. We have shown that these adjusted prosthesis torque profiles can be produced using only simple, low-cost, passive mechanical elements such as linear springs and friction dampers.  This research program will entail measuring kinematic and kinetic data of able-bodied individuals performing activities of daily living. These data will be used to calculate the adjusted torque profiles required for a prosthetic knee to perform the same activities. We will then optimize a knee architecture that uses only simple, passive mechanical elements that can most accurately replicate all of the gait activities. An updated version of our knee design will be tested in a gait lab at Northwestern University, to correlate experiments with our theoretical model and refine its accuracy. Our knee will then be field tested in India with BMVSS Jaipur Foot. The project will culminate in a refined knee technology that is ready for larger-scale clinical testing and progression towards commercialization."
"9322348","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-congenital aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a progressive disease most commonly found in the elderly that results in death if left untreated. Transcather aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has now become a treatment option among these older individuals not considered surgical candidates, and with the aging of the population, more patients will likely be undergoing treatment. With the reduction in mortality after TAVR, the question is how normalization of blood flow across the aortic valve might also benefit the brain. There is converging evidence from our lab and others that high-grade carotid artery stenosis and late-stage congestive heart failure can compromise cerebral auto regulation, resulting in cognitive impairment, and that improving cerebral hemodynamics can improve cognition. To date, however, there has been no direct measurement of the impact of AS on intracerebral hemodynamics. With the increasing recognition that vascular factors play a crucial role in the development of dementia, we propose to assess the potential cerebral hemodynamic and cognitive impact of AS, and we hypothesize that if there is restoration of normal cerebral blood flow after TAVR, then there will be a significant improvement in cognition. The reversibility of impaired cognition would expand consideration of TAVR beyond its systemic benefit. In this pilot project, we propose to recruit 78 TAVR patients from Columbia's Center for Interventional Vascular Therapy and 40 in whom TAVR will be delayed. All subjects will undergo baseline transcranial Doppler using measures of mean cerebral blood flow velocity (mCBFV) and vasomotor reactivity (VMR). There will also be cognitive assessment with a 50-min battery to evaluate processing speed, memory, attention, executive function and memory demonstrated to be most sensitive to the effects of diffuse hypoperfusion. After thirty days, both patients after TAVR and controls will return for follow-up TCD and cognitive testing to ascertain the potential gains of intervention, with an exploratory assessment of quality of life at baseline, 30-days and 90 days. Successful elucidation of the relationship between aortic valve disease and cerebral hemodynamics, in conjunction with the impact on cognition, will provide the impetus to progress to a larger study to determine if we can develop a risk stratification model for TAVR based on neurological and neurocognitive status. With the strong likelihood that TAVR will be extended to intermediate risk patients, they may have an even greater potential for cerebral hemodynamic recovery and cognitive improvement, and prevention of cognitive decline.

"9333520","A key goal in the Affordable Care Act is building a national culture of prevention through workplace health and safety initiatives. To achieve this goal, methods for scaling up evidence-based programs from research to wide- scale dissemination are needed to help balance effectiveness and cost. In many cases, there are pressures to reduce scale-up costs but at the expense of lower program implementation and effectiveness. A scale-up method that sacrifices effectiveness but reduces costs and reaches a larger number of employers may be acceptable. We will model the effectiveness and cost trade-off, along with the extent and representativeness of reach, when scaling up our evidence-based occupational sun protection intervention, Sun Safe Workplaces (SSW), for national distribution. The intervention, which relies on personal contact with managers and in- person employee training (SSW-IP), created large improvements in comprehensive workplace sun safety (i.e., policy adoption and employee education) in a randomized controlled trial. We will compare the existing in- person program delivery methods (SSW-IP) to a lower-cost dissemination method that utilizes Internet technology (SSW-T), i.e., virtual meetings, social networking, online training, and program materials. The aims of the research are to: 1) estimate the program reach (number and representativeness) and implementation rates (i.e., adoption of policies and delivery of education on occupational sun protection) achieved by the SSW- IP and SSW-T in a model of national distribution to public safety and public works industries; 2) estimate the costs associated with the SSW-IP and SSW-T (i.e., intervention costs and induced employer costs) and compare the estimated program benefits (i.e., policy and education) to cost; and 3) estimate the effect and cost- effectiveness of SSW-IP and SSW-T in secondary outcomes of a) changes in workplace environments and procedures for sun safety and b) workers? sun safety practices. In a 5-year project, SSW-T will be created by redesigning our very effective SSW-IP methods to use the latest web conferencing, social networking, and online training technology for dissemination. The implementation rates (defined as policy adoption and education delivery) and costs associated with SSW-IP (n=50 employers) and SSW-T (n=150 employers) will be modeled in a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design, enrolling a national sample of 200 employers (i.e., firefighting departments and state departments of transportation). Unlike traditional randomized trials, the primary analysis will be of cost effectiveness to test the hypothesis that SSW-T can be delivered cost-effectively to an expanded group of worksites producing a lower implementation rate than SSW-IP but at substantially lower cost. Secondary analyses will compare the two scale-up strategies on implementation rate, differences in rate by employer groups (e.g., size and region), changes to workplace environment/procedures, and employee sun safety practices. The findings will have high impact by helping public health practitioners select the best strategy for scaling up evidence-based workplace health and safety programs to achieve this ACA goal."
"9368395","Project Summary/Abstract Innate immune signaling by macrophages is critical as the first response to pathogen exposure. Three Interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) are the critical regulators of the innate immune response (namely IRF3, ISGF3, and IRF7), and they respond to pathogen exposure coordinately and interdependently. How these IRFs function as a regulatory system, and what their specific roles are in regulating the extensive gene expression programs comprising hundreds of genes, has remained unclear, as previous assays lacked resolution to quantitate IRF dynamics at single cell resolution, and interdependencies between these factors could not be delineated by prevailing models. Thus the scientific premise of the proposed studies is that utilizing cutting-edge quantitative single cell and genome-wide measurements will allow us develop a quantitative mathematical model that delineates respective functions of IRF3, ISGF3, IRF7. We will address this goal with the following Aims: In Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanism that are able to produce the complex dynamic control of the primary response factor IRF3 that we reveal in our preliminary studies. In Aim 2, we will investigate the functional consequence of differential, pathogen-specific IRF3 dynamics on chromatin control and target gene expression. In Aim 3, we will develop a predictive signaling model of the dose response and dynamic control of ISGF3 activated via autocrine and paracrine type I interferon secretion, and characterize how it contributes to innate immune gene expression in both infected and in bystander cells. In Aim 4, we will examine the regulatory control of IRF7 and test the hypothesis that it plays a key role in determining innate immune responses in previously interferon-`warned' cells, thus mediating a form of innate immune memory."
"9234538","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Wayne State University (WSU) IMSD program is requesting continued support for its successful graduate and undergraduate programs at the current level of 20 undergraduate and 8 graduate students. The goal of the WSU program is to provide both graduate and undergraduate students a structured community along with career building and research opportunities that will enable each student to learn and develop the necessary skills for a successful career in biomedical sciences.  Graduate students will be selected in their first or second year of graduate study. The graduate component will continue to focus on enhancing career development skills as well as their skills in mentoring and teaching. Each IMSD graduate student along with their faculty mentor is expected to create a Career Development Plan (IDP). It is the expectation that the structured program with clear expectations and goals will increase success as reflected by increased graduation rates and time to degree. The engaged graduate students gain skills in presenting their research findings to the IMSD community and leading to effective presentation skills as well as developing teaching methodology. The undergraduate component of our IMSD program will continue to concentrate on students in their first and second years. Our premise is that effective exposure to mentoring and research at the undergraduate level requires an early individualized approach. The undergraduate program will continue its three basic integrated components: (1) academic enhancement; (2) mentored undergraduate student research; and (3) career development. The academic enhancement component is designed to facilitate freshman IMSD students in their ability to have an excellent academic beginning by focusing on mathematics competency and by personalizing the core science lectures and laboratories. The IMSD learning community provides the socially supportive environment that bends the cultural trajectory of underrepresented minority students toward academic careers in scientific research. Their college experience will be further enhanced by their participation in peer to peer mentoring and mentored research beginning in their first year will continue year round and be integrated into the entire undergraduate experience. Following two years of active support all previously supported IMSD students are expected to continue in the IMSD Learning community until graduation. The faculty research mentors are selected from a wide array of faculty with active research programs. These academic and research experiences along with professional development activities should lead to enhanced interest in careers in academic and scientific research."
"9210548","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Current treatments used for Gulf War illness (GWI) are directed at the symptoms associated with the disease and do not target the underlying disease process. Investigators from the Miami VA and Nova Southeastern University developed a data set consisting of potential mediators of GWI persistence and relapse after an exercise challenge using gene expression as well as measures of immune, autonomic, and neuroendocrine function. This rich and complex data set was examined with a systems biology analytic approach, which revealed a markedly abnormal balance within and between major regulatory systems. Our work has identified 5 targets for in vitro validation: (a) modulation of inflammatory cytokines, (b) changes in IL-23/Th17/IL-17 axis, (c) the recovery of NK cell function, and (d) the suppression of excessive NF-kB activity. The objectives of the proposed study are to determine if intervening at these therapeutic targets selected via computational modeling will act as predicted and normalize immune and neuroendocrine function in an in vitro system. The study will have 2 phases: an exploration/ screening phase and a validation phase. The screening phase will be conducted on 17 repurposed drugs. These will be assessed in vitro using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from 40 GWI patients and 40 matched controls. The most promising 5 drugs will be validated in PBMCs from a new cohort of 40 GWI patients and 40 matched controls. A desirable treatment will produce a significant treatment effect (p<0.05) in the majority of cell populations, cytokine expression, and NK cell functional markers that are abnormally expressed in GWI. A desirable treatment will also produce a co-expression pattern of cell subsets, cytokines, and NK cell functional markers in the cells from GWI subjects that is statistically indistinguishable (p = 0.05) from that of the matched healthy control counterpart. In the event of two or more drugs producing similarly positive results, we will pick the repurposed over the pipeline agent, a well-established safety record taking priority. Similarly choosing between two repurposed drugs, the drug with the lowest risk in terms of side effects will be used. A second consideration would be cost."
"9277455","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder pain syndrome (BPS)/interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic pain syndrome characterized by pain, pressure or discomfort perceived to be bladder related with at least one urinary symptom. The impact of BPS/IC on quality of life and economic burden are enormous. Over the life of this grant, we have hypothesized that pain associated with BPS/IC involves an alteration of visceral sensation/bladder sensory physiology. Changes in visceral sensation may be mediated, in part, by inflammatory changes in the urinary bladder including nerve growth factor (NGF). Monoclonal antibody treatment that specifically inhibits NGF in patients with BPS/IC demonstrates proof of concept; however, clinical trials have halted enrollment due to severe side effects. The need for additional targets beyond NGF is clear. With this competitive renewal application, we propose aims that will provide mechanistic insight into additional NGF-mediated pleiotropic changes that contribute to urinary bladder hyperreflexia and pelvic hypersensitivity in a novel transgenic mouse model of chronic NGF overexpression (NGF-OE) using the urothelium-specific uroplakin II promoter that was characterized during the last funding cycle. The working hypothesis is that increases in urinary frequency and altered sensation that accompany BPS/IC are due to an alteration in the expression, function and interactions of neurochemical mediators and the sensory transducer, transient receptor potential (TRPV) family member TRPV4, in the sensory limb of the urinary bladder reflex. These studies examine the contributions of and interactions between the neuropeptide, PACAP, and receptor PAC1 and TRPV4 to increased voiding frequency and somatic sensitivity in NGF-OE mice. Aim 1: We hypothesize that NGF overexpression exhibited in urothelium and lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of the NGF-OE mouse model induces upregulation of the sensory transducer, TRPV4, in bladder afferent cells in DRG and in urothelial cells of the urinary bladder. We hypothesize that tissue-specific expression of TRPV4, in sensory components (urothelium, DRG) of the micturition reflex contributes to urinary bladder hyperreflexia and pelvic hypersensitivity in NGF-OE mice. Aim 2: We hypothesize that interactions between TRPV4 and PACAP/PAC1 may represent a novel mechanism by which PACAP/PAC1 signaling activates phospholipase C and inositol triphosphate to sensitize TRPV4-mediated changes in voiding behavior and painful sensation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that PAC1 and TRPV4 are co-expressed in bladder afferent DRG and urothelial cells. We will use a multidisciplinary approach including anatomical, biochemical, molecular, electrophysiological, and functional methodologies and a novel ex vivo peripheral nerve recording approach to address these aims. Results will provide key insights into new targets with therapeutic potential to improve urinary bladder function and visceral sensation."
"9217395","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          As the American population ages, bleeding on the surface of the brain (subdural hematoma) has become increasingly common. By 2030 subdural hematoma will be a more frequent surgical problem than both primary and metastatic brain tumors. In the 1960's only 1or 2 of 100,000 people was affected by subdural hematoma each year, but by 2005, that number grew to 20 of 100,000 people per year. In our patient population of adult veterans from 2005-2010, the incidence was 31.5 per 100,000 per year. People requiring surgery for subdural hematomas are often in the hospital for longer time than patients with brain tumors. Subdural hematoma patients may be disabled by their disease, and have a shortened life expectancy.  It is possible that the increase in incidence of subdural hematoma is due to increased consumption of aspirin and other blood thinning medications. Older people and other populations at risk for brain atrophy (shrinkage) may be most at risk for subdural hematoma because veins on the surface of the brain are stretched and torn more easily in these patients.  In this grant, we propose to demonstrate that the amount and pattern of brain atrophy impacts the risk of chronic subdural hematoma, and that consuming aspirin or blood thinners further compounds that risk. The purpose of this work is to establish that a screening tool that evaluates brain images and quantitates atrophy is useful for assessing risk prior to starting aspirin or blood thinners in people who are most at risk for such bleeding.  We will study a cohort of 10,351 veterans who all had imaging studies of their brains performed during the years 2005-10 with a novel automated method for quantitating atrophy using standard CT scans of the head. We will also record whether or not these individuals consumed aspirin or blood thinners. We will follow the patients for four years and track whether they develop subdural hematomas, or other disorders related to brain bleeding or blood clotting. We will then perform statistical analyses to determine how much the risks of atrophy and consumption of aspirin and blood thinners separately and together impact the risk for development of subdural hematoma.  The success of this project would enable prevention of an increasingly common, disabling and potentially fatal brain disorder that already impacts the lives of 60,000 Americans per year."
"9321033","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neonatal cholestatic liver diseases including Alagille syndrome, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bile acid synthesis defects, biliary atresia, cystic fibrosis, mitochondrial hepatopathies and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, lead to significant morbidity and mortality in childhood, frequently necessitating liver transplantation. N single United States clinical center sees a large enough number of patients with these disorders to permit a rigorous answer to unresolved questions including etiology and pathogenesis, optimal methods of diagnosis and treatment, and factors that influence disease severity and prognosis. This competitive renewal proposal from the Pittsburgh Cholestatic Liver Disease Consortium at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC seeks to continue ongoing research activities in the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN). This application for renewal funding includes a strong commitment to continuing the on-going research efforts and two new proposals, one based upon the existing biosamples and clinical database, the other a novel clinical trial. The clinical center at CHP includes an outstanding group of clinician investigators with well-documented expertise in basic, translational and clinical investigation. Performance to date in the on-going studies of ChiLDReN has been exemplary and has taken full advantage of the population base within Western Pennsylvania and the unique referral patterns to CHP as a quaternary center for Pediatric Hepatology and Liver Transplantation. The existing biosample repository and clinical database will be analyzed using genome wide associate and Dynamic Bayesian Network analyses to identify genetic and immunologic factors that influence response to surgery for biliary atresia. An expanded access open label single armed study of the use of 4-phenylbutyrate in the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (Byler Disease) is also proposed. The major end-points of this trial will be safety, tolerability and change in serum bile acids and other biochemical markers of liver disease."
"9283317","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in human immunology is to develop tools for the unbiased analysis of immunity using low input samples from hundreds or thousands of patients. Current approaches have several limitations. First, tissue staining and flow cytometry are hard to scale up and only measure a small number of markers. Second, most genome/proteome-wide studies have focused on aggregated signals, such as mixtures of cells (PBMCs, whole tissues, tumors) that miss cell-type specific signals, or fluids, such as plasma, that combine secretions from billions of cells. Third, although unbiased studies of gene expression in purified immune cell types have shown success in discovery of disease predictors, it remains impractical to scale up such studies using conventional approaches for cell isolation such as flow cytometry or magnetic beads. What we urgently need are methods for unbiased profiling of purified cell types, which scale to large-scale human studies with low input samples. We propose to integrate two rapidly developing technologies -- microfluidics and sensitive RNA amplification -- into a compact device for highly multiplexed purification and RNA amplification of immune cell subsets. Such a major advance in unbiased measurements would advance our understanding of mechanisms and discovery of predictive markers for immune diseases. In preliminary data supporting this proposal, the Blainey lab has demonstrated a microfluidic device that can purify human immune cells using magnetic bead- based affinity purification, and separately, that can synthesize libraries for next generation sequencing (NGS). In parallel efforts, the Hacohen lab has developed low input RNA-seq protocols that work well on flow sorted immune cell types. These combined efforts support feasibility of a microfluidic system that couples cell purification with NGS library synthesis and enables sampling of all the major immune cell types from 1-5cc of blood. We propose to develop a microfluidics device to: (i) isolate immune cell subtypes directly from a mixture of cells; (ii) lyse purified cells; (iii) synthesize libraries for RNA-seq. We will demonstrate the utility of this technology in the analysis of primary human PBMCs from the blood of healthy subjects. Future applications to the clinic will focus, for example, on cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of autoimmune, infectious diseases, asthma, transplant and aging. Such studies are anticipated to lead to better understanding of immune responses and improvements in diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutics for human immune diseases. By creating the first scalable tools for unbiased analysis of cell states within the immune system, we hope to provide human immunologists the tools to study immune diseases at unprecedented depth."
"9322137","Abstract Despite fully suppressive ART for long periods of time, HIV rebounds in the majority of individuals when ART is interrupted. Studies in this proposal will define and quantitate the functional SIV latent reservoirs in tissue to understand the contributions of both CD4+T cells and macrophages to the functional viral reservoir and viral rebound after ART interruption. The SIVmac251 ART suppressed model will be used to quantitate the functional viral reservoir in CD4+ T cells and macrophages to asses their contribution to viral rebound. Depletion of CD4 cells and reduction of the latent reservoir will be done to address whether CD4 cells are the major HIV reservoir or if latently infected macrophages significantly contribute to HIV rebound. The projects in this Program will 1) Identify the differential contribution of resting CD4+ T cells and resident macrophages to viral rebound after antiretroviral treatment interruption; 2) Identify the source of viral rebound using SIV proviral genome analysis; and 3) Use computational modeling and analyses of SIV virus rebound to understand HIV rebound."
"9371805","ABSTRACT B-cells are a critical element of the adaptive immune response, and deficiencies in B-cell development lead to a variety of congenital immunodeficiency syndromes as well as age-related immune decline. Post- transcriptional gene regulation has recently been appreciated to play a major role in developmental pathways. Elements that control post-transcriptional gene regulation in trans include RNA-binding proteins(RBPs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNA. Our recent work suggests that particular RNA binding proteins can exert powerful effects on hematopoietic development. However, the contribution of RNA binding proteins, as a class, to the development of B-lymphocytes has not been systematically assessed. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technologies presents an unprecedented opportunity to study the function of proteins at a genome-wide level. However, the utility of this technique in understanding physiological processes in primary cells has remained limited. Here, we present an innovative proposal, combining sophisticated analysis of RNA expression data with a novel, hematopoietic optimized CRISPR/Cas9 screening system, as a method to study the effects of hundreds of genes on B-lymphocyte development. By using these methods, we will test our central hypothesis that RBPs, as a class, regulate B-cell development. Our preliminary data, derived from RNA-sequencing of B-cell subsets, shows that RBPs are dynamically regulated across development. In this proposal, we will employ novel bioinformatics analyses to describe developmental trajectories of RBPs and compare them with known regulatory genes in B-cell development. Furthermore, we propose to screen developmentally regulated RBPs for a biological function in B-cell development by performing CRISPR/Cas9-based forward genetic screens using our newly optimized retroviral vector system and in vitro B-cell culture system. By identifying RBP knockout alleles generated during the screen, we will identify RBPs that are required for the development of B-cells. By comparing bioinformatically predicted and functionally validated RBPs, we will characterize the utility of bioinformatics algorithms in predicting RBP function in development. In summary, this exploratory proposal represents the first characterization of this important class of post-transcriptional regulators as elements in the control of B-cell development."
"9250638","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects the Veterans and the general population. Currently, there is no effective treatment and most patients die within 2 years after disease onset. One important neuropathology hallmark of ALS is the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the affected neurons, which progressively and irreversibly activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress cell death mechanisms. Indeed, there is mounting evidence that ER stress is an important mechanism driving neurotoxicity in ALS. However, it is unclear how ER stress leads to apoptosis in ALS or whether this highly conserved mechanism can be harnessed to develop therapeutic targets that can improve the ability of neurons to reset the homeostasis of unfolded protein response (UPR), mitigate the disease progression, and prolong the survival in ALS patients. This new RR&D Merit Review proposal will develop small molecule chemicals that block ER stress-induced neurodegeneration in pre-clinical models of ALS. Our unpublished data support an important role of stress-activated protein kinase HIPK2 (homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2) in activating ER stress induced by chemical agents and in mouse model of neurodegeneration caused by mutant SOD1G93A protein. Interestingly, similar HIPK2 activation has also been identified in tissues from patients with familial and sporadic ALS. Together, these results provide proof-of-principle evidence that blocking HIPK2 can protect motor neurons neurodegeneration caused by misfolded mutant proteins in familial and sporadic ALS. If successful, our research will have profound impacts on the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of Veterans who suffer from ALS."
"9507260","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to form associative memories is one of the most important functions of an organism's nervous system. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying learning and associative memory formation have yet to be fully elucidated. Identifying molecules involved in these processes is important not only to gain an understanding of normal brain function, but can also lead to an understanding of disease states such as age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. We will use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has a simple nervous system and its genes have conserved functions in higher organisms, to identify molecules that are most essential for learning and memory. We will identify these molecules combining two techniques developed in our lab, a novel long-term associative memory (LTAM) assay and RNA-seq of individual populations and compartments of neurons. In Aim 1, we will identify postsynaptic molecules that are involved in regulation of LTAM by labeling postsynapses with a translational RFP fusion of a scaffolding protein important for learning and memory, MAGI-1. After LTAM training, MAGI-1:RFP worms will be lysed and subjected to FACS in order to isolate fluorescent postsynaptic compartments. RNA will be purified from the neurons and subjected to RNA-seq. We will then determine the profile of postsynaptic genes induced by memory training. In Aim 2 we will characterize mRNAs identified in Aim 1. In Aim 2a we will use utilize RNAi and deletion strains to identify novel and conserved postsynaptic regulators of learning and memory. In Aim 2b, we will determine which mRNAs of interest may be locally translated by utilizing single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization. Bioinformatic analysis of these RNAs will also reveal potential RNA binding proteins that regulate LTAM. In Aim 2c, we will determine if the protein products of mRNAs identified in Aims 2a and 2b are also synaptically localized. This will allow us to identify novel proteins that are located in the postsynaptic density and may regulate synaptic remodeling during learning and memory. In Aim 3, we will determine if aging causes defects in the postsynaptic processes involved in LTAM, including transcriptional reprogramming, local translation, and postsynaptic remodeling. We will accomplish this by repeating the experiments in Aim 1 and 2 in aged worms, to identify molecules that contribute to age-related cognitive decline."
"9293306","?     DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant): The overarching objective of the Center for Magnetic Resonance and Optical Imaging (CMROI), a Biomedical Technological and Research Center (BTRC), is to develop innovative Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Optical imaging-based biomarker technologies in support of the biomedical research community both at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) and across the country. These technological developments are driven by collaborations between clinically oriented and technologically oriented investigators to address specific clinical     problems and to further fundamental understanding of biophysical, physiological, structural, molecular and functional properties of physiology and pathophysiology in vivo. Based on the compelling projects identified by our collaborators, we have developed 4 broad areas of Technological Research and Development (TRD) research.          The first TRD project involves the development of novel rotating frame MR techniques with exchange-mediated contrast that have high spatial and temporal resolution. These techniques are aimed at studying the biochemical and metabolic aspects of brain, tumors, heart and connective tissues, leading to clinical applications in neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric and cardiac diseases, arthritis, and cancer. The second TRD focuses on the development of optimized, single-shot, whole-brain, perfusion MRI for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF), at 3T used for applications in functional brain imaging, pharmacological MRI, and as a biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases, further development of perfusion MRI at 7T targeting measurement of white matter CBF, and further development of a novel method for direct imaging of myelin water for applications in demyelinating disease. The third TRD focuses on the development of novel MR strategies for efficient data acquisition and reconstruction based on the radial k-space trajectory, with application in dynamic     cancer and cardiac imaging and multi-parametric MRI. The fourth and final TRD is oriented towards noninvasive and minimally invasive diffuse optical imaging and monitoring. Development of bedside probes based on diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) facilitate concurrent monitoring of blood oxygenation and blood flow, respectively, in brain and spine, and a novel, multi-modal optical-MRI breast cancer imaging system will be optimized in standard-of-care hospital MRI scanners          The resource emphasizes synergistic TRD work that is driven by collaborators both from within the home institution and from across the country. Service includes usage and access to the state-of-the-art MR imaging systems including 7T and 3T whole body research magnets, pre-clinical MRI resources, optical imaging instrumentation, polarized gas imaging facilities, and the distribution of pulse sequences and computer analyses software developed by the resource to external sites. The resource also maintains an extensive training and dissemination program in biomedical imaging through a multitude of seminars, workshops, peer reviewed publications, targeted courses, hands-on training and a dedicated website. Furthermore, organized plans and operating procedures for the administrative core contributes to the seamless functioning of the resource. The resource has an exceptional scientific environment in the form of world-class faculty, senior research investigators, and outstanding institutional commitment. It remains committed to intellectual interchange and the interdisciplinary pursuit of basic and clinical medicine through the proposed developments and thus has all the attributes required for a national BTRC."
"9459147","Proposal: Identifying a network of miRNAs and genes that regulate breast tumor metastasis Abstract Metastasis is the major cause of death in breast cancer patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and metastasis are not clear. We have recently identified tumor initiation cells (TICs) from human breast tumors 1,2. TICs carry certain properties of stem cells, are more resistant to conventional cancer therapies, and are involved in tumor metastasis. How to effectively target TICs or metastasis initiating cells (MICs) thus becomes one of the most propelling questions. Endogenous single strand small RNAs of 20- 22 nucleotides in length, known as microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), have emerged to be powerful regulators of tumor progression 3-15. In this project, we aim to characterize novel miRs that regulate human breast cancer initiation and metastasis and identify their target genes. Then in our future endeavors, we will examine miR regulation mechanisms at the transcriptional level and further translate our understanding to clinical applications, such as novel cancer biomarkers or therapeutics. Most previous metastasis models are limited in their ability to fully represent human tumors, due to genetic changes accumulated in culture for human cancer cell lines, genetic differences in mouse tumor models compared to human tumors, and bypassing the natural steps of metastasis via bloodstream inoculations. This project will take advantage of our recently established human-in-mouse breast cancer models, which are derived from clinical tumor specimens and develop spontaneous lung or lymph node metastases upon orthotopic transplantation into mouse mammary fat pads. To closely monitor breast tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo, we have also transduced primary cancer cells with optical reporters and improved the detection sensitivity to 10 cells in vivo via non-invasive bioluminescence imaging. MiRs are more stable and resistant to analysis protocols than mRNAs, thus serving as promising novel cancer biomarkers. Furthermore, they are endogenous small RNAs with little toxicity compared to compound drugs; therefore hold the promise to be developed as innovative cancer therapeutics. Our long-term goal is to combine our understanding of tumor initiation and metastasis with knowledge in multi- disciplinary technology (such as chemistry and bioengineering) to improve clinical medicine and reduce cancer mortality.

"9267836","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infertility and premature ovarian senescence are life-changing consequences of cancer in young women. Yet, the reproductive window after cancer treatment in young adult cancer survivors (YA survivors) is not known. In light of growing numbers of YA survivors and emergence of promising interventions on fertility after cancer treatment, there is a clear need to identify and categorize patterns of ovarian aging after cancer and the clinical profiles associated with them to assist in patient counseling and decision making. 1000 female YA survivors who are between ages 18-35 will be enrolled at varying durations after cancer treatment and followed for 18 months. First, the study will test the hypothesis that patterns of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2) after cancer treatment will differ among three broad treatment toxicity groups. Ovarian function biomarker levels will be measured from serial self-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples in each participant. Data from the entire cohort will then be modeled by time after cancer treatment, and patterns (including time to peak, duration at peak and time to decline of ovarian function) will be compared among minimal, moderate and severe treatment toxicity groups. The aim will demonstrate that these biomarkers can depict differential durations of the reproductive window. Second, spurred by exciting preliminary data, the study will test the hypothesis that disproportionate psychological distress experienced by this population is associated with hypothalamic suppression of ovarian function. The aim will determine the association between distress (measured by patient-reported symptoms and salivary cortisol) and luteinizing hormone (LH), FSH, E2 and AMH. Hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis suppression has never been studied in the context of cancer, and discovery of an association between distress and ovarian function would be critical to future intervention studies on distress to modify reproductive health outcomes. Third, the study will generate clinical risk profiles for te window of ovarian function for the moderate toxicity group, which encompasses the majority of YA survivors. Due to heterogeneity, there are no data on predicting variability in the course of ovarian aging within this group. This aim will identify subpopulations in patterns of ovarian function within the moderate toxicity group, followed by the clinical factors that are associated with them. Building on the PI's K23 data, this proposal directly responds to priorities of the NICHD Fertility Preservation Program to develop biomarkers and clinical parameters to better predict gonadal reserve, and optimize and expand options for fertility preservation. The significance lies in estimating the reproductive lifespan in the context of cancer in order to guid patient counseling, individualize risks and preserve opportunities for biologic parenthood. Through innovative use of social media for recruitment and non-clinic- based, minimally invasive DBS and saliva collection for biosample accrual, the proposal overcomes longstanding, critical barriers to studying young adults with cancer. 1"
"9266206","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling drives the malignancy of a number of human cancers and also is responsible for a number of human developmental disorders. Likewise, PTEN is a well-known tumor suppressor gene that is inactivated in a large variety of human tumors. FGFRs are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that activate many cellular responses through a signal transduction pathway that activates both AKT and ERK signaling. Despite their central importance to human health, detailed mechanistic understanding of how Fgfr stimulation dictates diverse cellular responses in different tissues remains incomplete. PTEN is a phosphatase that exhibits activity both on lipids and proteins. Recent literature suggests that FGFR signaling and PTEN signaling genetically interact. The ocular lens is a relatively simple developmental system in which FGFR signaling plays an important role. Inhibition of FGFR activity in vivo leads to lens cell apoptosis and overexpression or exogenous administration of FGF leads to fiber cell differentiation in lens epithelial cells. To dissect the role of FGFR signaling in lens cell survival and differentiation, this application proposes to genetically remove FGFR signaling in the lens both in vivo and in lens explants to decouple survival signals from differentiation signals This proposal will test the hypothesis that PTEN inhibits FGFR- mediated survival without inhibiting FGFR-mediated fiber cell differentiation. In addition to revealing the underlying mechanism by which PTEN regulates FGFR signaling the aims of the proposal will develop the first comparative transcriptome of lens cells with intact and deficient FGFR signaling in differentiating conditions with and without regulation by PTEN."

"9272867","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The close integration of immune and metabolic responses associated with obesity lead to the development of metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. However, the endogenous molecules that signal metabolic stress and the mechanisms that sense and relay such signals to metabolic and immune response systems are incompletely understood. The double stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR is activated in response to pathogens and nutrients, and work by our laboratory and others suggests that PKR plays an important role in integrating signaling networks that modulate inflammation and the development of insulin resistance. Based on our preliminary data we propose that the study of PKR activation represents an opportunity to identify the metabolic signals and novel mechanisms at play in immunometabolic regulation. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to characterize the endogenous lipids and RNAs that modulate PKR activity and the formation of the active PRK complex in the setting of metabolic stress, with the goal of translating these findings to a broader understanding of the molecular signals that contribute to the integration of metabolic stresses and inflammation in obesity. We believe that successful completion of this work has the potential to highlight new therapeutic targets and strategies for use in the fight against the epidemic of obesity and related pathologies."
"9384199","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose of the project. This application focuses on the use of imaging to better understand, reverse, and monitor immune suppression and metabolism in murine models of aggressive/metastatic breast cancer. High LDH-A and monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 4 (MCT-1 and MCT-4) have been linked to poor prognosis, and greater metastatic potential. Based on clinical analyses of GEO and MSKCC?s cBio Portal: i) tumors with increased expression of genes involved in lactate metabolism are more aggressive and have poor survival, and ii) there is an inverse correlation between the expression of glycolysis genes and immune-related genes. These data support our hypothesis: that high rates of tumor glycolysis leads to a lactic acid-rich tumor microenvironment (TME) with the exclusion of T cells, resulting in more aggressive tumors with a propensity to form metastases. We further hypothesize that reversal of the T cell exclusion with metabolic inhibitors will render tumors that are resistant to immune modulation with checkpoint blockade (CTLA-4, PD-1) to be responsive to the treatment, due to repopulation of T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we propose to use multimodal imaging to explore the mechanisms by which metabolic and immune modulation therapy reverse the restriction and inactivation of cytotoxic T cells in clinically relevant murine models of aggressive breast cancer. We plan to: 1) characterize in vivo changes in tumor lactate and T cell infiltration during LDH-A and MCT-1/4 inhibition; 2) evaluate the responses to adjuvant and neo-adjuvant single and combination therapy (metabolic inhibition and ?checkpoint? blockade in vivo); 3) validate the imaging results by assessing correlations between glycolytic biomarkers and T cell infiltration using ex vivo immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS); and 4) assess the potential for clinical translation. The translational goal is two-fold: 1) to induce regression in primary and metastatic breast cancer, by increasing tumor penetration and effector function of cytotoxic T cells, and 2) to monitor treatment response by non-invasive imaging. Experimental Strategy. We have established several murine models of aggressive breast cancer in immune competent host animals. In Aim 1, in vitro and in vivo studies will define how tumor-cell metabolism affects T cell function, and identify a ?therapeutic window? for optimizing the magnitude and timing of T cell repopulation of aggressive murine breast tumors following LDH and MCT pharmacologic inhibition. In Aim 2, metabolic and immune-PET imaging will monitor how changes in the TME (induced by anti-LDH and anti-MCT treatment) affect T cell infiltration and function. Based on Aim 1 and 2 studies, an ?optimized? lactate inhibition treatment strategy (established in Aims 1 and 2) will be combined with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1 and anti- CTLA4) and assessed in Aim 3. Imaging will be used to quantitate tumor lactate, the conversion of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate to lactate, glycolysis (reflected in FDG uptake) and the trafficking of CD8+ T cells."
"9292331","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical function of the vertebrate retina is to change its sensitivity based on the recent history of the stimulus in order to maintain a visual response when the environment changes. This process, known as adaptation, occurs in multiple forms, although many aspects of the cellular and circuit origin of these computations remain unknown. Recently, it was found that certain retinal ganglion cells increase their sensitivity following a strong stimulus. These sensitizing ganglion cells maintain a high sensitivity to weak stimuli, even when other types of ganglion cells adapt and fall below threshold. This proposal aims to analyze the circuit basis for the adaptive computation of sensitization. To understand sensitization arises, we have developed a novel approach to directly measure the functional role of individual retinal interneurons. We record the intracellular visual response from a single interneuron, while simultaneously recording from a population of retinal ganglion cells using a multielectrode array. Then, by playing back an altered version of the cell's own signal using injected current, we directly probe how that cell's output changes the behavior of the circuit. Mathematical models are used to explain how the responses of interneurons combine together to yield the responses of ganglion cells. Amacrine cells are a diverse population of inhibitory interneurons in the retina, most with unknown function. Some amacrine cells are known to adapt to the contrast of the stimulus, but the functional role of this process is unknown. The goal of this proposal is test the hypothesis that adaptive inhibition generates sensitization, and to develop a quantitative circuit level description of how sensitization arises. The specific goals are: 1) In the salamander and mouse retina, we will measure the spatiotemporal structure of how adaptive excitation and inhibition combine to generate sensitization, and capture these properties with a computational model. Using pharmacology, we will identify the broad class of amacrine cells that are essential to sensitization. 2) Using intracellular and multielectrode recording, we will measure the computation of sensitization through salamander retinal circuitry by recording from interneurons during sensitization, and then directly measure their connectivity to different classes of ganglion cells. Synaptic currents in salamander and mouse ganglion cells will be analyzed using whole cell recordings. 3) We will directly measure how changes in transmission from single inhibitory amacrine cells generate sensitization in the intact salamander retina. Understanding how a diverse population of neurons combines to perform neural functions is a critical barrier to our understanding of retinal mechanisms and diseases involving the degeneration of the retinal circuitry. These findings will be essential to understanding basic mechanisms of how retinal circuitry processes information and will be useful in the design of electronic retinal prosthesis systems."
"9389115","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of our program is to train post-doctoral biomedical, behavioral, health care and other public health scientists to conduct research on treatment and early interventions for alcohol abuse and alcoholism. An overarching goal is to enhance the scientific reasoning skills needed to advance treatment research in alcohol abuse. From our perspective such research will benefit from interventions guided by sophisticated and fully developed theory using a multidisciplinary framework that includes the biological, psychological, social and cultural context in which interventions occur. While other institutional training programs may address treatment/early intervention research, this is the primary mission for this program. Distinctive features of our training program are: that it is interdisciplinary; tat it embraces no single ideology or theory concerning the nature of dysfunctions related to alcohol or drug abuse; that it provides training in early intervention and treatment along a continuum; and that it provides trainees with highly individualized opportunities to develop competitive grant  applications and by doing so, contribute new knowledge to the base of alcohol-related dysfunction and treatment. The training experience is structured to provide individualized research experience and training, complemented by a common academic curriculum to which fellows' allocated 20% of their training time. Four distinct areas are covered in the curriculum: (1) statistics/research methodology; (2) grantsmanship; (3) ethical issues in research; and (4) a two-year sequence of formal courses covering the etiology and treatment of hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorders from varying disciplinary perspectives. We also subscribe to a research apprenticeship model under the guidance of the research mentor. The fellow's individual research training experience emerges from an individualized development plan (IDP) developed by the fellow and agreed to by his/her mentors, and reviewed and approved by the Training Committee. The program has a primary emphasis on training in innovative treatment development and clinical trials with a secondary emphasis on the translation of clinical efficacy research into services, effectiveness, and cost- effectiveness research. Our didactic and research experiences in neurobiology and neuroimaging, behavioral genetics, and alcohol administration have expanded our focus of translational research from basic to clinical research. The expected training program duration is two years but on occasion we extend this training period to three years. We offer 3rd years for fellows with less extensive training in research methods; fellows who are cross-training, e.g. adding HIV/AIDS training to a primary background in alcohol research; or for fellows in each cohort who need more time to accomplish their goals of becoming independent investigators. The program has been accepting on average 3 to 4 new fellows per year. At any given time there are likely to be 9 to 10 fellows in residence. However, in order to comply with the $500K budget cap, we are requesting funding for a total of 8 fellows at this time. This is a reduction from the 10 of previous segments of this Training Program."
"9389972","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The androgen receptor (AR) is even more widely expressed in breast cancer (BC) than estrogen receptor alpha (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR), yet we still understand relatively little about its role or its potential as a therapeutic taget in the main subtypes of BC (ER+, Her2+ and triple negative). Thus, the long-term goal of this proposal is to determine how AR interacts with other pathways in BC subtypes, particularly in tumors that exhibit de novo or acquired resistance to current therapies. The objective is to utiliz old and new generation anti-androgens with different modes of action to elucidate the unique roles of AR and identify cooperating pathways to target in combination with AR. The central hypothesis is that AR plays subtype-specific roles and cooperates in different ways with proteins/pathways that drive these three main subtypes. Preliminary data demonstrate that AR plays crucial, subtype-specific roles in BC. The following specific aims will test the central hypothesis: Aim 1. Elucidate the mechanism of action by which AR affects ER activity. Our working hypothesis is that nuclear AR is essential for E2/ER-driven proliferation in ER+/AR+ BC. Aim 2. Identify mechanisms by which AR affects Her2+ BC. Liganded AR upregulates Her3 in some Her2+ BC lines; however, in many others Her3 is not affected, yet anti-androgens still inhibit proliferation. Thus, our working hypothesis is that there are novel mechanisms of action whereby AR impacts Her2+BC. Aim 3. Determine the mechanisms by which AR supports survival and maintains a tumor initiating population to facilitate metastasis of AR+ TNBC. Determining how AR functions in BC subtypes and identification of previously unknown targetable pathways with which AR interacts, will lead to novel therapeutic strategies. Our studies challenge the dogma that AR and androgens are protective in breast cancer. We propose that like ER, AR is an indicator of a more well-differentiated type of tumor; however, it can most certainly drive BC growth and progression, and therefore represents a logical therapeutic target. ."
"9338226","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women."
"9295914","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Two related human research projects are proposed as part of this program project (PPG) that require quantitative assessment of sleep and wakefulness. Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for such assessments. We have therefore developed a plan for the continuation of a PSG Core as part of this Program, in support of these projects, to ensure the accurate and efficient acquisition, analysis and interpretation of PSG derived measures of sleep and wakefulness. Over the years, PSG methodology has  undergone dramatic changes that allow for the collection and analysis of large digitized data sets. Moreover, these developments have resulted in a high degree of sophistication of PSG hardware and software that require a team of specialists who operate and maintain these tools. The general objective of the proposed PSG Core is to provide a knowledge base and an integrated infrastructure to maintain high quality standards  in PSG in support of Projects 1 and 2 as well as the Biostatistical and Analytic Core within the program.    Specifically, the objectives of the PSG Core will include the following activities:  1. Acquisition and maintenance of PSG equipment and supplies  2. Training of technical research staff at the BWH Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) in equipment use and instrumentation of research subjects for PSG  3. Assisting in PSG quality assurance at the CCI, and providing technical advice to staff and investigators  4. Archival of digitized PSG data  5. Vigilance state scoring of PSG recordings, and scoring of slow eye movements as a measure of attention failures in wake recordings  6. Quantitative analysis of the sleep EEG with Fast Fourier Transform-routine based spectral analysis in order to obtain measures of homeostatic sleep pressure and circadian sleep drive."
"9282600","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Outcomes for patients with multi-morbidity (MM) are often poor, in part because of low adherence to self-management behaviors (SMB).Research has identified key determinants of SMB for individual diseases and shown the powerful influence that illness representations and medication beliefs have on these behaviors. Yet, little is known about the impact of illness representations in the context of MM where beliefs about one illness and its treatments may be at odds, or symbiotic, with those for comorbidities. Without this knowledge, our ability to provide optimal self-management support for MM patients is limited. The goal of this study is to determine    how beliefs about chronic illness and their treatments affect SMB in the context of MM and to translate this information into self-management support counseling modules for use in future interventions. We will focus on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disabling and costly health problem, and evaluate the impact of 3 comorbid conditions that differ in level of self-management    complexity and symptomatology: hypertension (HTN), diabetes (DM),and depression. The study design is rooted in the Self Regulation Model (SRM), a theory of health behaviors that has been used to develop interventions, but has only been applied to research on behaviors around single diseases. Depression is of great interest in the study of the SRM because patients with depression often have maladaptive representations and perceptions of illness. By understanding the interplay of illness representations and medication beliefs and their impact on SMB in the context of comorbidities, we will advance both the SRM and the clinical care of patients with MM. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Examine the interactive effects of COPD, HTN, and DM related cognitive and emotional illness representations and medication beliefs on patients' self-management of these conditions over time? 2) Assess the association of major depression with COPD SMB over time and evaluate the pathways, via illness representations and medication beliefs, mediating this relationship?(3) Guided by findings from Aims 12 and the SRM, develop and pilot test education and counseling modules for COPD patients with MM to promote adherence to SMB. We will conduct a mixed methods prospective cohort study of 400 COPD patients with HTN or DM in NY City and Chicago and interview them every 3 months for 15 months. We will also conduct interviews during and after COPD exacerbations to assess changes illness representations and their impact on SMB. For Aim 3, we will conduct qualitative interviews with patients who have good or low medication adherence to understand cognitive processes that guide SMB and to identify the self-management strategies they use. We will then create counseling modules to improve self-management and pilot them among 100 patients. The study will expand the SRM to MM, elucidate how patients respond to varying beliefs in the context of MM, and provide prototype self-management    support counseling modules for application to a future, fully developed intervention to improve SMB and outcomes for adults with MM."

"9382167","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. Patients with extensive UC of more than 8 years duration have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) which approximates 0.5-1% per year of colitis; this leads to a recommendation for life-long surveillance colonoscopy. However, cancer surveillance for these patients is expensive, time-consuming and invasive. Moreover, the sensitivity of detecting dysplasia in colonoscopy is only moderate, largely due to the difficulty in detecting flat dysplastic lesions in the setting of UC. An objective molecular biomarker for dysplasia would have great clinical value in the management of cancer risk in UC patients. In our efforts for biomarker development for UC dysplasia, we previously discovered that the non-dysplastic mucosa is genetically abnormal in UC patients who have neoplasia elsewhere in their colon (progressors), i.e. there is a field defect phenomenon in UC progressors which is not present in UC non- progressors (patients without dysplasia). Recently, we further discovered that the same field defect extends to abnormal expression of proteins in the non-dysplastic mucosa from the rectum of UC progressors. These findings are exciting because these protein changes occur in randomly sampled colon and/or rectal mucosa regardless of whether dysplasia is present or not. These abnormally expressed proteins could be valuable for developing biomarkers that are effective and relatively non-invasive for detecting UC dysplasia. One can envision that a random biopsy from an unprepped rectum would suffice to provide the sample needed for biomarker testing. This proposal seeks to develop molecular biomarkers for two purposes: 1) to detect current dysplasia/cancer; 2) to predict (track) future dysplasia/cancer progression. Molecular biomarkers will be developed by using cutting edge quantitative and then evaluated and validated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and targeted proteomics methods. Finally, the molecular biomarkers will be evaluated for their clinical value in detecting and predicting UC neoplasia progression in different cohorts. We believe that this project will greatly improve the current surveillance strategy for early detection of UC-associated colorectal cancer."
"9305077","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop, optimize, and pre-clinically assess a robotic platform that may provide a safer alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at a shorter interval than that recommended for the general population. Therefore, over the course of an IBD patient's lifetime, they are subjected to a significantly larger number of colonoscopies than their non-IBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in post-procedure adverse events. The main risks of colonoscopy are those related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making colonoscopy a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to safely perform. Capsule endoscopy has already been extremely helpful for IBD patients, especially in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease in children and young adults. Adapting capsule endoscopy to colonoscopy as proposed by this project would allow for reduced risk of adverse events, thus providing great benefit to patients with IBD. By using the robotic platform we propose, the endoscopist will be able to remotely control the motion of a soft-tethered capsule to perform diagnosis and treatment at any location inside the human colon. Manipulation of the capsule is achieved by magnetic coupling, thanks to the interaction of two permanent magnets - one integrated inside the capsule and the other placed at the end effector of a robotic arm. Leveraging extensive preliminary results, with this study we will develop a fully vetted system ready for human clinical trials, and we will test the hypothesis that our approach has diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities comparable to standard colonoscopy, while at the same time, shortening the learning curve and decreasing both the degree of looping and mesenteric stretching. We will pursue these goals by (1) optimizing our robotic platform for human use, (2) implementing a safe, robust, and intuitive control, and (3) benchmarking the proposed technology with standard colonoscopy involving three different tiers. The Investigative Team, combining engineering and clinical faculty from Vanderbilt University, is uniquely positioned to achieve the success of this study. Specifically, the Investigators collectively possess expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical colonoscopy, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. If successful, this approach will widen the implementation of IBD surveillance programs to rural areas thanks to the low cost of the platform (i.e., less than $20,000), ease of transport, no need for anesthesiologists or sedation monitors, and no need for specialized facilities within which examinations are performed."
"9266395","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diabetes population and related costs are expected to double in the next quarter century, as more than 79 million Americans are at risk of developing diabetes. In trials, lifestyle changes aimed at weight loss were successful at reducing risk of type 2 diabetes (t2DM), the most common type of diabetes. However, long-term weight maintenance in the clinical setting has proved elusive. Importantly, even after successful weight loss, substantial residual risk (~40-50%) remains and may be attributable to other modifiable factors. Several medications used to treat established t2DM have also been studied for t2DM prevention and many have been shown to delay incident diabetes; however, the role of pharmacotherapy for diabetes prevention is not clear. Therefore, there is a continued and pressing need for identification of modifiable risk factors and interventions that are safe, inexpensive and acceptable to prevent t2DM and decrease diabetes-related disease burden. Based on a large body of recently published studies, vitamin D has emerged as a potential determinant of type 2 diabetes (t2DM) risk. In longitudinal observational studies, higher vitamin D status was associated with up to 83% reduction in the risk of t2DM. However, the evidence to support vitamin D supplementation for prevention of t2DM remains inconclusive. The favorable association between vitamin D status and t2DM risk in observational studies may be confounded by a variety of factors. Directly extending our prior work, the goal of the research described in this grant application is to address the issue of causality by evaluating whether vitamin D is an effective intervention for prevention of t2DM among high-risk individuals. We propose to conduct the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study, a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo- controlled, parallel-group primary prevention clinical trial to evaluate the safety of vitamin D supplementation and its effect on the time to onset of diabetes in participants with pre-diabetes. The need for a trial such as the D2d study has been recognized in recent editorials and reviews, including the 2011 Institute of Medicine report on dietary reference intakes for vitamin D, which identified diabetes as one of the most promising non-skeletal outcomes with an urgent need for rigorously conducted trials to confirm the promising results seen in observational and mechanistic studies. The proposed trial, therefore, addresses an important and timely question and has the potential for significant impact in the clinically important area of t2DM prevention with direct public health implications. The potential impact of the study is heightened by the assembly of a team of highly qualified investigators with complementary expertise and experience in conducting nutrition-based multicenter trials, many of whom have worked together previously."
"9306832","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, thousands of patients in need of a kidney transplant find a live donor but are relegated to forego the benefits of live donor transplantation because of ABO or HLA incompatibilities. They can participate in kidney paired donation (KPD, also called kidney exchanges or chains), but >50% will not find a compatible match through KPD due to broad HLA sensitization or hard-to-match blood types. Without incompatible live donor kidney transplantation (ILDKT), the only option for these patients is the 90,000-patient deceased donor waiting list, where waiting times average 5-8 years and death rates average 5-10% per year.  ILDKT is an emerging practice in which patients can receive transplants across antibody barriers through the use of various pre- and post-operative desensitization strategies. We recently showed that close to 100 centers perform ILDKT in the US, although few have studied or reported their outcomes. While great gains have been recently made in this field, future growth is currently limited by inferences from single-center reports which suffer from publication bias, lack of statistical power, inability to compare protocol effectiveness within a single-center (because of protocol homogeneity within a given center), and lack of generalizability.  The only way to move this field forward is for centers to study outcomes collaboratively, but data collection burden is an obvious concern. A mandated, national transplant registry does exist, but data relevant to ILDKT are not collected. We propose a large, highly efficient, mixed retrospective/prospective multi-center linkage of minimal-burden ILDKT-specific primary data to rich, longitudinal national registry data, through which we can: (1) quantify patient, antibody, and treatment protocol factors associated with ILDKT outcomes; (2) identify patients who derive survival benefit from ILDKT compared with other available options; and (3) explore center-level associations with ILDKT outcomes, including center-volume relationships.  No single-center studies have been powered to study risk prediction in ILDKT. We will collect ILDKT- specific data of approximately 5800 recipients and link to the national registry for multivariate analyses of factors associated with outcomes. To compare ILDKT with the other available options, i.e. waiting for a compatible deceased donor or KPD, we will use a Markov decision process model that combine inferences drawn from observational data of the waiting list with inferences drawn from simulations of KPD. We will use interaction term analysis to identify factors that amplify or attenuate the effect of ILDKT on survival benefit.  This researh will establish a framework for patient selection and counseling for ILDKT that is evidence- based and in the best interest of patients. Robust quantification of the risk and survival benefit associated with ILDKT is novel and will be immediately useable clinically throughout the country. A better understanding of this emerging modality at a national, generalizable level will help improve the feasibility, availability, and quality of ILDKT for the thousands of patients each year who could potentially benefit from it."
"9363593","Project Summary The ultimate goal of this project is developing a new class of broad spectrum antibiotics, focused on Gram- negative bacteria. Inspired by a natural product, this class targets an unexploited binding site of the bacterial ribosome that selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. With ever increasing reports of resistance to frontline therapies addressing Gram-negatives, there is a critical need for new therapies, yet very little can be found in the development pipeline. As a result, any new therapeutic that targets Gram-negative bacteria will address an unmet medical need. Crystal structures of the natural product and C?rza analogs bound to the T. thermophilus ribosome have been used to guide medicinal chemistry efforts. These crystal structures revealed that a highly conserved region of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) that has yet to be exploited by any existing antibiotics is in fact a viable new therapeutic approach against a well-vetted target, the ribosome. Binding to this site of the PTC appears to convey bacterial selectivity. Molecular modeling using these complexes as a guide for preliminary optimization has produced new leads that have expanded the antibacterial spectrum of activity from solely Mtb to include potent activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus (including drug-resistant strains for each of these). These analogs inhibit protein synthesis in the nM concentration range, exhibit selectivity indexes of >400 for inhibition of bacterial versus eukaryotic protein synthesis and have very limited toxicity to mammalian cells. This five-year R01 project will ultimately develop a new potent, broad spectrum antibacterial drug candidate, focusing on Gram-negative pathogens ready for IND preparation. Development of this antibacterial lead series will be accomplished by the following aims. Aim 1 will optimize the lead series to expand activity to additional Gram-negative pathogens, notably P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Aim 2 will define mechanism of action, biochemical/microbiological activity and in vitro ADME-Tox of analogs by evaluating activity against bacterial and eukaryotic protein synthesis (including mitochondrial), a panel of bacteria representing Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms (including antibiotic-resistant). Preliminary ADME-Tox will be evaluated in vitro using Vero cells to predict cytotoxicity, microsomal stability, inhibition of hERG and cytochrome P450s, Ames test for genotoxicity and in an in vitro receptor binding assay of 44 primary molecular targets. Aim 3 will use in vivo PK to guide optimization followed by determining the MTD and in vivo efficacy in a mouse thigh infection model to select a single lead compound for advancement. Aim 4 will expand the microbiological profile by determining MIC90s, characterization of resistance and potential cross-resistance to other antibiotics. Aim 5 will expand in vivo efficacy and PK/PD to pneumonia infection models. Aim 6 will address CMC issues and produce an initial cGMP lot for use in GLP toxicology studies in Aim 7."
"9282555","The goal of Project 2 is to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for longevity and cancer  resistance of long-lived rodents. Naked mole rat is the longest-lived rodent species with the maximum  lifespan of 32 years. Furthermore, naked mole rats are highly resistant to cancer. Since naked mole rats are  related to the short-lived and cancer-prone laboratory rodents, they represent an ideal model for the studies  of longevity and cancer resistance. We identified a novel mechanism of cancer-resistance in the naked mole  rat termed early contact inhibition (ECl). Naked mole rat cells are hypersensitive to contact inhibition and  arrest proliferation at low cell density. ECl is associated with induction of pi6'^'^^ (p16). We found that cells  of the naked mole rat, as well as another long-lived rodent the blind mole rat, secrete large amounts of  extremely high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA), which is required for ECl. The properties of HA  depend on the polymer length, with longer polymers being more beneflcial. Remarkably, naked mole rat HA  is over six times longer than mouse or human HA. We show that HMW-HA protects cells from oxidative  stress and rehioval of HA causes naked mole rat cells to form tumors. Based on these findings, we  hypothesize that that HMW-HA plays a key role in the naked mole rat longevity and cancer resistance. Our  aims are: (1) Determine signaling pathways leading from HA to cell cycle arrest and ECl. We will test the  hypothesis that HMW-HA signaling via CD44 receptor activates expression of pi6, and identify intermediate  signaling events. In collaboration with Project 4 we will identify genes from HA and pi6 signaling pathways  that are activated by HMW-HA and examine their effect on cell cycle arrest in vivo. (2) Identify mechanisms  responsible for cytoprotective properties of HMW-HA. We hypothesize that in addition to being an  extracellular scavenger of ROS, HMW-HA triggers signaling events that either suppress apoptosis or  activate intacellular antioxidant machinery. We will identify the targets of HA signaling, and test whether  expression of naked mole rat HAS2 improves oxidative stress resistance in mice. In collaboration with  Project 4 we will analyze the stress-signaling genes showing differential expression in the naked mole rat. In  collaboration with Project 3 we will determine whether HA has anti-mutagenic effect. (3) Test whether  beneficial effects of HMW-HA from the naked mole rat can be transferred to other mammals. We will use two  approaches: generate transgenic mice expressing naked mole rat HAS2 or treat mice with hyaluronidase  inhibitors. We will test whether these treatments improve mouse cancer and/or stress resistance.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The naked mole rat is the longest living rodent with the maximum lifespan of 32 years. In addition to its  longevity, the naked mole rat has an extraordinary resistance to cancer as tumors have never been  observed in these rodents. The goal of Project 2 is to understand the mechanisms behind the extraordinary  resistance to cancer in the naked mole rat. We expect that investigation of long-lived mammalian species will  unravel mechanisms of cancer resistance and longevity that will be applied to extend human lifespan."
"9315138","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric liver disease has significant morbidity and mortality. Biliary atresia accounts for more than half of pediatric liver transplants. Genetic causes of neonatal cholestasis include Alagille's syndrome, alpha-1- antitrypsin deficiency, Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC), bile acid synthetic defects, mitochondrial hepatopathies, and cystic fibrosis. All of these diseases can progress to cirrhosis and end stage liver disease. In order to study the diagnosis, progression, and treatment of these rare disorders, we propose to continue participation in the CHILDREN Research Network, contributing and studying children with the above diseases. The goals of the network are to follow large numbers of these subjects longitudinally to allow accumulation of clinical data and biospecimens for studies that can help diagnose, prognosticate for, and treat these diseases. Identification of biomarkers to use for diagnosis and to ascertain disease progression is a particular goal. Translational research founded on this remarkable CHILDREN database and biorepository can result in new insights regarding pathogenesis, disease modifiers, and ultimately treatment. Our center will recruit patients with CHILDREN diseases aggressively, retain them for longitudinal follow-up, and contribute to ongoing studies. The Cystic fibrosis study will continue to evaluate the role of ultrasound in predicting the development of cirrhosis i children with CF and to study the progression of cirrhosis in this disease. Our center will activel participate in clinical trials planned to 1)study the effect of an intestinal bile-acid transport inhibitor on pruritus, one of the most disabling symptoms of cholestasis, and 2) study a novel vitamin supplement targeted to optimally supplement fat-soluble vitamin deficiency in cholestasis. The ultimate goal of the network is to learn more about natural history and pathogenesis in order to inform therapy and clinical management of cholestatic diseases of children. The scientific project proposed by the IU center is a proteomic study of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease. While most patients with CF have some degree of liver involvement, only 5-10% develop advanced cirrhosis. The goals of the study are to identify plasma proteins that are associated with the development of CF cirrhosis and can track progression of that disease. Identification of biomarkers of advanced CF liver disease would allow early identification and the opportunity to select these children for clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents which might improve bile flow and change the course of the disease."
"9280761","Studies in outbred Long Evans rats have contributed to the identification of a neurobiological basis for cognitive impairment in the aged brain of otherwise healthy laboratory animals. Within the medial temporal lobe memory system the selective loss of perforant path connections and an altered condition of the network it innervates in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 region are hallmarks of rats that age with memory impairment. In contrast, that network is relatively maintained in aged rats with preserved cognitive function, including anatomical integrity of the perforant path and a balance of computational properties for pattern separation and pattern completion in DG/CA3 that resembles young adults. A unique feature of this network is the integration of new DG neurons in the adult brain. No studies have yet examined that integration in the context of brain aging. The proposed research in Project 2 will complement studies in the other projects by examining whether the integration of newly DG generated neurons aligns with individual differences in cognitive outcomes. Unimpaired aged rats, consistent with young adults may show a predominant role for the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) in the integrating network. Because the circuit integration of new DG neurons involves other elements that strongly differentiate cognitive outcomes, such as hilar interneurons, CA3 neurons, and basal forebrain cholinergic projections, we will determine whether a broad difference in the circuit integration of new DG neurons occurs in impaired and unimpaired aged rats. In addition to a better understanding of the basis for age-related impairment, the findings will be informative about the condition of the aged brain that maintains a high-level of cognitive capacity, e.g. testing the hypothesis that such animals (but not impaired aged cohorts) integrate a complement of new DG neurons in a manner similar to young. Additional studies in this project will further test whether an impoverished integration in impaired aged rats can be improved by a therapeutic treatment that has been shown to boost molecular markers in key monosynaptic afferents in the entorhinal cortex and DG/hilus. Those findings, together with studies in Project 1 and 3, will address an emerging hypothesis in this research program that a failure through the LEC steam of information processing disproportionately contributes to memory impairment in the aged brain. Alongside better maintenance of those properties in aged unimpaired rats, research in this model suggests that adjustments in the aging brain, which are distinct from young adults, contribute to preserving cognitive function. Project 2 will further examine whether unimpaired aged rats engage greater inhibitory control over the entorhinal/DG/CA3 network as suggested by our findings. Neural overactivity in the brains of impaired aged rats, and a parallel condition detected by functional imaging in studies of human aging/MCI suggest that recruitment of inhibitory control in unimpaired aged rats could play an adaptive beneficial role in neurocognitive aging.  "

"9309128","This Yale TL1 application has been developed to provide outstanding mentoring, educational training and support for career development to exceptional trainees in the Yale Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, and Biomedical Engineering to help them successfully pursue careers in clinical and translational research focused on improving human health. In recognition of the critical need for fostering successful career paths in all aspects of clinical and translational research for biomedical trainees at multiple points during training, we have established three programs that span both pre- and post-doctoral training for the TL1. These include: 1) The National Clinician Scholars Program that provides two years of outstanding training for postdoctoral fellows in either nursing or medicine who are focused on careers in T3-T4 translational research to improve health and healthcare policy for communities and populations; 2) The Investigative Medicine PhD Program that provides 3-5 years of rigorous PhD training for physicians who have completed their clinical training and haven chosen to pursue careers in translational (T1-T4) research; and 3) The Multidisciplinary Pre-Doctoral Training Program in Translational Research that provides predoctoral trainees in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health and Biomedical engineering with a full year devoted to training across the full span (T1-T4) of clinical and translational research.  These programs each have a rich history of successfully preparing trainees for careers in translational research. The goals of this TL1 application are to identify and to support a representative and diverse group of outstanding trainees in each of the four programs who specifically want to pursue careers in clinical and translational research; to train them in the use of state-of-the-art research tools; to facilitate their abilities to work collaboratively in complex multidisciplinary research teams; to provide outstanding mentoring (including concordant mentoring) by experienced and diverse faculty that supports long-term professional development. To facilitate these goals, we have established an educational leadership team with diverse backgrounds in clinical and translational research, and with expertise in the evaluation and dynamic reshaping of medical education programs. The leadership will work directly with both the trainees and their mentors to promote multidisciplinary team-based research that addresses complex medical and/or societal aspects of health and healthcare delivery so as to provide real and measurable positive impacts on health and healthcare in the US and around the world. To objectively judge our success in achieving these goals across such a diverse group of trainees, the leadership team has developed a logic model to clearly define the inputs of the umbrella TL1 and its three sister training programs as well as the activities of individual trainees, and to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate both program content and achievement of short- and long-term goals by the trainees. This will allow real-time improvements in trainee support and in program content to optimize our training of the next generation of successful translational researchers."

Taken together these diseases are responsible for significant symptom burden, chronic health challenges, and progressive loss of kidney function over 1 to 20 years contributing to 10% of incident end stage kidney disease (ESRD) patients per year in the USA. Despite the health burden imposed by primary glomerular disease, significant gaps in understanding disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis and clinical trials exists and have prevented the implementation of effective therapy for these conditions. The GDPrime consortium will establish a comprehensive research platform centered around a prospective, observational cohort study of 2400 cases and 2400 controls. The overarching goal of the DCC application is to establish the data coordinating center to provide the study design, data management and analysis expertise for the consortium and associated ancillary studies. The GDPrime DCC will establish the infrastructure for conduct of the GDPrime study; coordinate the prospective longitudinal cohort study of children and adults with primary glomerular disease and healthy controls; define disease course and investigate predictors of outcomes in patients compared with non-disease controls and their associations with disease progression. The GDPrime DCC and overall consortium will establish a comprehensive ancillary study program for extramural collaboration and partnership to advance the identification and evaluation of novel biomarkers, therapeutic targets, outcome measures and as yet undefined research proposed by the scientific community at large."
"9419493","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The recognition that inflammation has important roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) arises from evidence that autoimmune and infectious diseases are associated with the development of PAH; inflammation can generate experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH); and perivascular inflammation is present in the pathology of human PAH and animal models of PH. However, whether inflammation is causal, an amplifier of alternative triggering mechanisms, or an epiphenomenon remains unclear. Prior studies on the role of T cells in disease pathogenesis have generated data of unclear relevance to PAH: Th2 and Th17 cells are detrimental in Aspergillus-exposed and chronically hypoxic mice, respectively, while regulatory T cells (Tregs) are protective in rats treated with SU5416 or monocrotaline. The translational application of these data is hampered by limited inflammation in the chronic hypoxia model and unclear mechanisms linking inflammation to vascular remodeling. We propose to interrogate a model system with a relevant antigen that activates specific Type 2 immunity; a perivascular compartment in which there is antigen uptake and presentation, cell proliferation and recruitment; and molecular mechanisms involving TGF-?1 resulting in pulmonary artery remodeling. We employ a mouse model triggered by the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, which reproduces key phenotypes of likely the most common cause of PAH worldwide. Our proposal seeks to identify the precise role of antigen- specific CD4 T cells as the source of IL-4 and IL-13; how this population arises, expands, and is activated; and its impact on monocyte recruitment and TGF-? activation. We hypothesize that exposure to Schistosoma egg antigens results in clonogenic Th2 CD4 T cell activation and proliferation, leading to production of IL-4 and IL-13; this prototypic Th2 response recruits Ly6C+ monocytes causing TGF-?-driven PH. Our overall goals are to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Schistosoma-PH; identify approaches to develop immunotherapies, such as vaccination, against this parasitic disease; and to more broadly identify novel therapeutic targets in the inflammatory cascade, which may also be applicable to other inflammation-driven PAH etiologies. Specific Aim 1 is to determine that T cell IL-4 and IL-13-driven inflammation caused by Schistosoma leads to TGF-? activation and PH. In this Aim we will investigate the necessity and sufficiency of Th2-activated CD4 T cells in Schistosoma-PH using a systematic series of experiments with deficient mice and immune reconstitution, to precisely determine whether CD4-derived IL-4/IL- 13 is critical for Ly6C+ monocyte recruitment and the overproduction of active TGF-?1 which results in PH. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the Schistosoma antigen(s) taken up by antigen presenting cells that activate pathogenic, clonogenic IL-4/IL-13 producing CD4 T cells in Schistosoma-PH. In this Aim we will identify specific pathogenic Schistosoma antigens; the cells taking up, processing and presenting Schistosoma antigens to activate CD4 T cells; and the CD4 T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire indicative of clonal selection."

"9327017","Project Summary  Children show dramatic developments in executive functioning (EF), the goal-directed processes that support flexible adaptation of behavior in response to changing circumstances. For example, children's early- developing forms of EF are reactive, or on-the-fly, based on retrieval of goal-relevant information as needed in the moment. With development, children become increasingly proactive, or planful, maintaining goal-relevant information in anticipation of needing it. Such EFs and their development are associated with benefits to cognition, emotion, and action, and their impairment has been implicated in clinical disorders, including ADHD, autism, OCD, schizophrenia, and Tourette's syndrome. Given this significance for important outcomes, much research has focused on developments in and interventions targeting core EFs such as working memory.  However, EFs are diverse rather than unitary or all-purpose, each with relative costs and benefits. Proactive forms of EF bring benefits to preparedness, but also costs in terms of time and effort required prior to actually doing something. Similarly, goal-maintenance can aid staying on task, but confers costs when goal- shifting is required. Such trade-offs require people to coordinate which EFs to engage when, for example, in focusing on one task until it is completed, or switching among several tasks to make progress on each. Thus, children's dramatic improvements in EF may rely upon their self-directed, adaptive coordination of distinct forms of EF, particularly as children gain independence and must determine on their own what tasks to take on, which EFs to engage from their expanding repertoire, and when. Moreover, this adaptive coordination of EFs could explain links between performance on EF measures and significant life outcomes.  To address this critical but underexplored aspect of EF, we test developments in the self-directed, adaptive coordination of forms of EF (Aim 1), the factors influencing this coordination (Aim 2), and the trajectories that children show over time (Aim 3), and their relationship to real-world measures. We investigate these processes via cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, using behavioral studies integrated with physiological measures, building on theoretical and empirical work from our lab and others. The studies test: 1) young children, who have demonstrated some capacity for adaptive coordination of EFs, but may rely more on a trial-and-error process sampling from a broad repertoire of potential approaches, 2) older children, who may learn over experience with particular tasks to be increasingly targeted in their adaptive coordination of EFs, and 3) adults, whose adaptive coordination of EFs may be more strategic at the outset across different contexts, reflecting the selection of EFs that are best suited to current demands. We also track children longitudinally as they progress through a key transition window. Together, these studies will advance a new understanding of the role of increasingly adaptive coordination of EFs in development, and provide important constraints and insights for theories and models of executive function and dysfunction more broadly.  "
"9347041","Abstract: Environment and Health Group, Tufts HIV/AIDS Clinic, and the Boston-area PrEP Community of Practice will collaborate under the leadership of Patricia Weitzman, PhD, to develop and test the feasibility and short-term effectiveness of the first-ever individually-tailored, developmentally- and culturally-sensitive, mobile (mhealth) PrEP adherence tool. It will target culturally-diverse, young adult men ages 20-29 who have sex with men (YMSM). When PrEP is taken daily, it can reduce HIV risk by up to 92%. The CDC estimates PrEP is appropriate for 500,000 MSM in the U.S. Impact models show even modest PrEP adherence could reduce new HIV infections among MSM by 29% over 20 years. The recent rise in HIV infection among young adults age 20-29, particularly minority YMSM, points to the value of PrEP uptake and adherence support for culturally-diverse YMSM. In PrEP trials, younger age was the most consistent correlate with low PrEP adherence. Extensive mobile phone penetration among young adults makes mhealth an ideal, low-cost method for providing PrEP adherence support to YMSM. We bring together a developmental understanding of young adult decision making with principles from social learning theory and positive psychology for supporting PrEP adherence.  The proposed project is based on Dr. Weitzman's successful Phase 1 (and current Phase 2) anti-retroviral therapy (ART) mhealth adherence intervention for HIV+ African Americans, which combined tailored pill reminders with age- and culturally-sensitive motivational and educational texts. Experts suggest building PrEP adherence interventions on proven ART adherence interventions as many PrEP adherence facilitators are the same as ART. Moreover, the growing literature on mhealth shows it is a powerful approach to supporting adherence across conditions. In addition to building on our prior ART mhealth tool, we address facilitators/barriers identified in PrEP RCT follow up studies, and CDC PrEP adherence recommendations. Moreover, formative focus groups with diverse YMSM will allow us to identify and target unique adherence barriers and facilitators in this group. The intervention will provide tailored pill reminders with PrEP education texts, as well as developmentally-sensitive motivational texts. We will include sleep hygiene and alcohol use messages, which have direct relevance to young adults. By using a low-cost, accessible mobile phone tool, the intervention eliminates several access barriers to support, which can be a particular problem for low income and minority patients. Our overarching goal is to help stop the rise in HIV among YMSM."
"9272944","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The formation of axon collateral branches underlies the ability of neurons to make synaptic contacts with multiple target neurons and thus give rise to complex neuronal networks. In the context of nervous system injury, the formation of axon collateral branches can have either beneficial or undesired effects depending on the affected circuitry. Collateral branches are also affected by a variety of disease states. However, the cellular mechanisms of collateral branching are only minimally understood. The preliminary data presented in this proposal unveils for the first time that the branch-inducing signal nerve growth factor drives the intra-axonal synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins with roles in the formation of collateral branches. Importantly, the preliminary data also demonstrate that axonal protein synthesis is required for the induction of axon collateral branching by nerve growth factor. Although recent studies have revealed a large set of mRNAs targeted to axons, the functional roles of the axonal translation of axonal mRNAs remains minimally understood. The main aim of the proposal is to determine the roles of the axonal synthesis of individual cytoskeletal proteins in the formation of axon collateral branches. By bridging the expertise of the PI (Dr. Gallo; neuronal cytoskeletal cell biology) and the Co-I (Dr. Twiss; axonal protein synthesis), the project provides the unique opportunity to uncover a new aspect of the mechanism of axon branching and aims to directly link the axonal synthesis of specific cytoskeletal proteins to the regulation f the dynamics of the axonal cytoskeleton. Through the joint expertise of the PI and Co-I, the project takes a multi-pronged in vivo and in vitro approach to address the main Aims. Collateral branching is affected by nervous system injury and disease. However, the ability to manipulate branching in a therapeutic context is mostly lacking. The project has the potential to lead to strategies for the regulation of axon branching by targeting specific axonal mRNA species in the context of neuronal injury and disease. The reagents developed for use in the project (e.g., cell permeable tools to selectively inhibit the axonal translation of individual mRNA species) have the potential for translation to animal model system of collateral branching in future directions o the project. The work we propose will serve as the foundation for these long term goals by determining the relevant mRNA targets through the elucidation of their roles in branching."
"9287787","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), a large, comprehensive, primarily undergraduate, Hispanic Serving Institution is undergoing transformative changes in its research enterprise. Six years ago, CSUF put together a plan to re-organize its infrastructure to improve services supporting faculty and student research, and scholarly and creative activities. Since that time substantial resources were invested in this reorganization leading to a significant increase in grant proposal submissions and awards. However, this rapid growth in grant activities placed additional stress on the relatively new research administration infrastructure, unveiling many still existing barriers that affect faculty productivity and success. These barriers include fragmentation of services, inconsistencies in interpreting policies and procedures by staff in decentralized, grant support offices, and the inability to find up-to-date information across multiple websites. Thus, in order to eliminate thes barriers, and to move CSUF into the final phase of its comprehensive overhaul, the PIs are seeking partial support from the National Institutes of Health Biomedical/Biobehavioral Research Administration Development (BRAD) program for the CSUF Research Gateway Project (CSUF RGP). The overarching goal of the CSUF RGP is to increase the institutional grant support capacity and, thus, enhance research productivity of faculty and broaden participation of students in research programs. To reach this goal, the PIs are proposing the following three Specific Aims: 1) policy review, development, alignment and institutionalization in all pre- and post-award services to eliminate gaps and inconsistencies in grant administration processes; 2) Research Gateway design and implementation to eliminate inefficiencies and fragmentation of information by creating a central, comprehensive online repository of CSUF research-related resources; and 3) training, development and institutionalization to minimize discrepancies in interpretation of policies by individuals from various support offices and to provide ongoing grants development and management workshops to faculty, staff, and students. By achieving the above aims, Cal State Fullerton will provide efficient, consistent, and friendly customer service to its faculty and students, while linking compliance with federal and state regulatory requirements, leading to increased research productivity of PIs and ultimately improve the health and well-being of the community at large by increasing the number of NIH and other grants awarded to the institution."
"9258814","Abstract: As non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are increasingly implicated in cellular functions as well as disease states, there is a need to deepen our understanding of RNA structure-function relationships as well as develop methods to target RNA with small molecules. The conventional view that ncRNAs fold into a single well-defined secondary structure was recently challenged by NMR relaxation dispersion experiments showing that non- canonical RNA motifs exist in dynamic equilibrium with alternative higher energy secondary structures referred to as `excited states' (ES). Mutagenesis studies suggest that RNA ESs exist for the vast majority of RNA molecules. The significantly altered structures of RNA ESs are correlated with altered biological activities potentially providing the basis for new regulatory RNA-based switches. In addition, because ESs trade canonical Watson-Crick base pairs for non-canonical mispairs, their structures are unique and complex potentially offering new receptors for the discovery of small molecules that bind RNA with high affinity and selectivity. Trapping inactive ES conformations of RNA with small molecules may lead to a new strategy for RNA-directed drug discovery. However, RNA ESs pose unique challenges to conventional structural and functional characterization techniques because they exist transiently in low abundance. We propose to develop a new paradigm to structurally and functionally characterize RNA ESs as well as to test their suitability as drug targets with specific application to one of two ESs that have recently been uncovered in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) transactivation response element (TAR) RNA. Aim 1 will validate the TAR ES as a therapeutic target by stabilizing the ES conformation using a mutagenesis approach and testing the hypothesis that mutations that trap the ES significantly alter TAR's activity in HIV-1 transcription. Aim 2 will solve a dynamic structural ensemble of the TAR ES using a new strategy that combines X-ray crystallography, NMR and Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Aim 3 will use a structure-guided approach to identify novel classes of anti-HIV small molecules that bind and stabilize the TAR ES. This work will help evaluate RNA ESs as new drug targets and provide a foundation for structural and functional characterization of other RNA ESs."
"9232168","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rates of prediabetes and diabetes are increasing in the pediatric population, due to the epidemic of childhood obesity. Epidemiologic studies have linked prediabetes in childhood with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Because children with prediabetes represent a high-risk group of individuals who may benefit from early identification and intervention, there is increasing interest in the use of biomarkers previously validated in adults for pediatric populations. The proposed study will evaluate the longitudinal test performance of an array of conventional biomarkers of glycemia, including Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and novel metabolomic biomarkers for identifying progression of glucose tolerance (normal to prediabetes or prediabetes to diabetes) in an overweight and obese pediatric cohort. In addition, a feeding study will also be conducted to examine variability in metabolomic biomarkers associated with abnormal glucose tolerance in response to macronutrient diet composition. The specific aims of this study are the following: Specific Aim #1: Assess whether conventional biomarkers of glycemia longitudinally predict progression of glucose tolerance (normal to prediabetes or prediabetes to diabetes) in a cohort of overweight/obese children. Specific Aim #2a: Identify novel metabolomic measures that longitudinally predict progression of glucose tolerance (normal to prediabetes or prediabetes to diabetes) and insulin resistance in a cohort of overweight/obese children. Specific Aim #2b: Evaluate the variability in metabolomic biomarkers associated with abnormal glucose tolerance in response to high carbohydrate and high polyunsaturated fat diets in an overweight/obese adolescent population. Application of the science of metabolomics to human disease risk is a major focus of the NIH's Roadmap for Medical Research. Although an increasing number of metabolomic studies have been conducted in adults, few studies have been conducted in children. This will be one of the first longitudinal studies to evaluate the predictive capacity of a comprehensive set of conventional and novel biomarkers for identifying adolescents with insulin sensitivity and progression of glucose tolerance status. The proposed research project represents a unique multidisciplinary collaboration of investigators with expertise in pediatric obesity and diabetes, diabetes epidemiology, metabolomics, human nutrition, and biostatistics, and will provide important information relevant for future pediatric screening policy, insights into the pathogenesis of prediabetes/type 2 diabetes during adolescence, and information on specific dietary interventions and their impact on the metabolomic 'at risk' profile."
"9330437","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebrovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in the USA, with more than 140,000 people dying each year from a stroke. While age remains the greatest risk factor for stroke, other conditions are also known to predispose individuals, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes and sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD in particular renders both adults and children vulnerable to ischemic stroke (e.g. 24% of SCD patients have a clinically apparent stroke by the age of 45 and 11% by the age of 20) and silent cerebral infarction ([SCI] which whilst quantifiable by MRI, produces no focal neurologic signs). It is therefore not surprising that SCD is frequently referred to as a ?hypercoagulable state? characterized by a proinflammatory and prothrombogenic phenotype. Whilst the molecular origin of SCD is clear, the mechanisms that contribute to the prothrombogenic phenotype have not been fully elucidated. It is known that circulating neutrophils of SCD patients are activated and as such this has provided indirect evidence for their implication in thrombosis and vasoocclusive crises that accompany this condition. However, the actual role that neutrophils play and how they contribute directly to thrombus formation, especially in the brain, is currently unknown. We believe that by understanding the ways that neutrophils contribute not only to the systemic prothrombogenic phenotype of SCD, but more specifically to the actual local thrombosis, we will uncover the potential of targeting neutrophils as a therapeutic strategy for this debilitating and life threatening disease."
"9208071","Project Summary In TR&D 1, we develop approaches to make complex changes to cells, and we generate biosensors to report on the effects of some of these changes. In the first aim, we establish strategies to rapidly and combinatorially up- or down-regulate a set of genes in a common pathway in order to improve the expression of a desired protein, and optimize these approaches using a vaccine protein that is commercially made in yeast. In the second aim, we devise new selections for use in chemostats and turbidostats to identify the effects of small changes in proteins, in promoters and in untranslated regions of mRNAs. Further, we modify the turbidostat platform to enable ramped selections, allowing feedback on temperature or drug concentration to optimize selections. In the third aim, we design new proteins that bind to a protein-protein interface and disrupt an interaction. These inhibitory proteins will allow us to assess the roles of individual members of large protein families that are difficult to analyze. Finally, in the fourth aim, we generate new biosensors to detect the levels of a small molecule and of a protein produced in yeast."
"9315149","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to a request for applications for the Continuation of ChiLDReN, the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network. Over the past ten years, through a coordinated effort, investigations of eight cholestatic pediatri disorders have been advanced and we have established a robust database and biorepository for further research. Little is known about the pathogenesis, natural history, and optimal treatment strategies for the rare pediatric liver diseases investigated by ChiLDReN. We at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) propose to continue to participate in this Consortium, and thereby advance the field through collaborative research. Only through collaboration can we improve the quality and efficiency of care provided to all individuals diagnosed with one of the diseases studied by this network. CHOP has been a highly productive member of ChiLDReN for the last 10 years. In this application, we propose to continue our participation in all aspects of the ChiLDReN consortium, including clinical trials, observational study protocols, dissemination of research findings and ancillary studies. We also propose to continue genetic screening of patients with Alagille Syndrome in the laboratory of Dr. Nancy Spinner. In addition, we have included a proposal for Genetics and Pathology services that we can offer to the Network. Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive idiopathic, necroinflammatory disease of the extrahepatic biliary tree that presents in infancy, and accounts for 50% of all pediatric liver transplantations in the U.S. Currently there is no accurate way to predict outcome in children with BA at the time of diagnosis. A reliable algorithm for predicting clinical outcome would be valuable in defining prognosis and stratifying patients in clinical trials. In addition, improved understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would promote the development of novel therapies. In our scientific proposal, we will test the hypothesis that genomic and proteomic factors can predict outcome in BA. Using existing genotyping data from our group, we will conduct a genome wide association study of BA patients to identify significant single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants that modify disease outcome. We will compare the variants detected in children with biliary atresia who survived with native liver beyond two years of age to those who did not. We also propose in depth studies to investigate the functional consequences of the variants identified in the GWAS. As a complementary strategy, we will use advanced proteomic technologies to identify serum proteins that predict clinical outcome in BA. Our study will leverage the extensive clinical and genomic data and biospecimens already collected by the ChiLDREN consortium to identify genetic modifiers and protein biomarkers that can predict outcome in this devastating disease. Our investigative team has the expertise and track record necessary to conduct these experiments. We anticipate that this work will contribute new knowledge about the biologic pathogenesis of BA and accelerate the pace of research into new treatments."
"9348407","Summary: Development Core The Development Core aims to increase population science human capital and to facilitate the development of innovative, interdisciplinary population science research projects. CPC conceptualizes individuals' career life courses and projects' research life cycles and uses this conceptualization to identify the key opportunities for making strategic investments in individuals and projects. Moreover, there is a synergy between investing in the career lifecycle and the research life cycle. This can be seen most clearly in developing large, exciting, long- term, high-impact projects and recruiting, retaining and advancing the human capital of CPC Fellows. While CPC does not hire faculty, it can enrich the pool of population scientists at UNC by collaborating with departments and schools that do hold hiring and promotion authority. The Center also works with departments to make retention offers to outstanding population scientists. The Director has primary responsibility for CPC's role in hiring and retaining key population scientists. CPC has had a clear impact on hiring and retention in the last five years. On July 1, 2015, Robert Hummer will become the Odum Professor of Sociology, a CPC Fellow, and Director of CPC's Development Core. He is well positioned to assume the Core Director role based on his prior administrative leadership, his record of federally funded research, and his past mentorship of students and junior faculty. Hummer will direct all other activities of the Development Core: Seed Grants, the Summer- in-Residence Program, Methodological Consultative Services, and CPC Seminars. CPC seed grants invest in promising population research projects--those that are innovative and that begin the exploration of important topics. Seed grants have played a key role in career and project development at CPC. In addition, CPC has a special program aimed at advancing the careers of junior scholars, the ?Summer-in-Residence Program?--a structured program leading to submission of a first NIH application. The program targets assistant professors, although it is open to associate professors who lack NIH grant experience. This program (first funded in CPC's 2009 R24) has enrolled 15 persons (working on 14 different projects) and has produced 13 NIH applications (with the remaining one in preparation). Of the 11 applications that have been submitted and reviewed, 4 have been funded (36%), and 2 are pending review. The Methodological Consultative Services Unit contributes to the quality and innovativeness of research by informing Fellows about new developments and promulgating the use of the most appropriate research methods in population sciences. This unit, which is led by David Guilkey and also includes Barrington, Bollen, Herring, and Suchindran, presents three didactic seminars a year and provides individual consultations on research projects. Finally, through its seminar and workshop series, the Development Core fosters intellectual community, encourages discourse across disciplines, and stimulates new and innovative research ideas."
"9297357","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that fail the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months."
"9268461","?    DESCRIPTION:     PD has a complex of motor and non-motor symptoms with progressive dopaminergic (DA) and non-DA neurodegeneration in multisystem. There is paucity in treatment for non-motor symptoms that include delayed gastric emptying and more prominently constipation, weight loss and reduced water intake. The underlying mechanisms are largely unknown and involve both central and peripheral alterations. Inflammation was found in the brains of PD patients, as well as animal models of PD, which may promote degeneration of DA neurons, is correlated to motor symptom severity and might contribute to the development of non-motor symptoms. An animal model for PD induced by a neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) microinjected unilaterally in the medial forebrain bundle of rats, has partial loss of DA neurons. Beside motor disorders, the rats have constipation, and reduced water intake and body weight as in PD patients. We also previously reported constipation-like disorders and less weight gain in a genetic model (Thy1-asyn mice). Ghrelin is a gut hormone and it has orexigenic and prokinetic effect on the gut through peripheral and central mechanisms. PD patients with body weight loss have lower basal circulating levels of ghrelin, and do not show the late phase postprandial rise suggesting dampened ghrelin release and/or synthesis. Our preliminary data showed that systemic administration of a ghrelin agonist, anamorelin increased body weight and food intake in Thy1-aSyn mice. However, systemic ghrelin did not stimulate the colonic motility, while ghrelin agonist crossing the blood- brain barrier (BBB) did. We showed that a BBB-crossing ghrelin agonist, HM01 increased defecation in 6- OHDA rats. More importantly, ghrelin has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect on DA neurons. Ghrelin agonists have advantages over ghrelin as they are orally active and long acting. The hypothesis is that ghrelin agonists have multiple beneficial effects on PD symptoms via gut prokinetic, orexigenic, dipsogenic and anabolic actions that involve distinct mechanisms. We will validate the ghrelin agonist effects in two animal models which display different PD pathological features, because no animal model recapitulates the progressive nature and complexity of human PD. The effects of BBB crossing (HM01) and non-BBB crossing (anamorelin) agonists will be compared and the targets will be assessed. (1) To assess ghrelin agonists' effect on constipation and altered colonic signals in 6-OHDA rats and Thy1-asyn mice. After oral administration of HM01 or anamorelin, fecal output and water content will be monitored, colonic motility will be measured using a non-invasive miniaturized pressure transducer. The permeability of the distal ileal and colonic mucosa will be assessed in Ussing's chambers. (2) To assess whether ghrelin agonists reduce loss of body weight and fat mass and improve feeding and water intake. HM01 and anamorelin effect in Thy1-asyn and wide type mice on food and water intake, body weight will be monitored simultaneously with energy intake and expenditure using a state-of-art automated metabolism screening system, and meal pattern by an automated feeding episode monitoring system. Ghrelin agonists' effect on body composition of Thy1-aSyn mice and 6-OHDA rats will be measured in rodent MRI equipment, as well as on water intake in 6-OHDA rats. (3) To assess ghrelin agonist effect on PD symptoms in 6-OHDA rats under L-dopa treatment, such as constipation, body weight loss, motor dysfunctions and L-dopa-induced delayed gastric emptying. The related signals in the colon and brain will be measured after ghrelin agonist and L-dopa treatment. This study will help to further validate ghrelin agonists' effect on neuroinflammation and neuroprotection in the nigrostriatal system in the animal models. Treating non- motor symptoms is one of the priorities in PD research. This project will provide preclinical evidence for novel beneficial effects of ghrelin agonists to alleviate constipation, adipsia and weight loss, as well as motor deficits in PD including Veterans who are more vulnerable under stress."

"9315141","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For three decades we have been recruiting and retaining patients with glomerular diseases into inception cohorts in which patients, by signing informed consent, agree to be followed from the time of their disease diagnosis until they die. These inception cohorts currently include over 3,300 patients, and almost 2,000 patients with the four diseases of interest to this consortium: minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy and IgA nephropathy. Our success at recruiting and retaining patients has relied upon our Glomerular Disease Collaborative Network (GDCN). The GDCN is a partnership between the University of North Carolina (UNC) and over 600 private practice nephrologists created for the purpose of conducting research. We now have over 28 years of experience in building inception cohorts, and making use of them in advancing research by participating in single- and multi-center translational, observational, quality-of-life and therapeutic intervention studies. We propose to participate in the this RFA Advancing Clinical Research in Primary Glomerular Diseases as an expanded GDCN Clinical Center based on the existing UNC GDCN in collaboration with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and with most of the hospitals in Montreal, Canada that have formed their own glomerular disease registry. Our colleagues at Vanderbilt University and Virginia Commonwealth University will join the GDCN Clinical Center once the cohorts begin recruiting. We have included in our Center the Duke University David Murdock Registry of 9,000 healthy individuals and thus we have ready access to clinical information and banked bio samples for over 600 healthy subjects. The GDCN Clinical Center will cover much of the geography of the Southeastern portion of the United States and most institutions in Quebec province. Moreover, the institutions within the GDCN Clinical Center, which have demonstrated prowess in clinical and translational research, are proposing, and will propose, an array of translational science, observational and treatment protocols pertaining to each of the glomerular diseases of interest. The GDCN Clinical Center is more than ready to participate in the organizational and scientific collaborative efforts of this proposed multicenter consortium."
"9276614","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain aging is a complex, multifactorial process that can involve aggregation of proteins such as b-amyloid (Ab) and tau, cerebrovascular disease, and alterations in neurochemical function. While many older people with cognitive decline may have Ab deposition related to presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease, in fact the majority of older people have little or no Ab in the brain. This project will specifically address a non-amyloid form of age- related cognitive decline that is associated with alterations in the brain's dopamine system. Dopamine is involved in frontal-striatal systems required for executive function. Executive dysfunction is a frequent hallmark of aging that is associated with fronto-striatal atrophy and which is manifest in tasks that require cognitive control, set-shifting, and attention. Our specific aims for this project are: (1) To recruit a sample of healthy individuals spanning ages 20-85; older subjects will have previously undergone PET scanning with [11C]PIB and will have no evidence of brain Ab. In these individuals we will characterize executive function with neuropsychological instruments and measure brain dopamine synthesis capacity using the PET tracer [18F]flurometatyrosine (2) To assess regional brain atrophy with structural MRI (3) To examine the interactions between large scale brain networks using MR measures of resting state functional connectivity and (4) To study brain activity using fMRI during a set-shifting task The overall framework guiding this study is that alterations in brain dopamine in aging produce adaptations that impair frontal-striatal executive function and produce cognitive inflexibility. We hypothesize that aging is associated with increased dopamine synthesis, resulting in overcompensation that disrupts cognition. We propose that older people will show regional atrophy in prefrontal cortex and striatum, and that greater atrophy will be associated with higher dopamine synthesis and poorer performance on neuropsychological tests reflecting executive function. Existing data in normal young people show that a frontoparietal control network (FPCN) is involved in directing attention to external or internal stimuli, and that it performs thi function by coupling to the default mode network (DMN) during internal processing or the dorsal attention network (DAN) during attention to external stimuli. We hypothesize that in aging, greater dopamine synthesis increases FPCN-DMN coupling, resulting in poorer performance on tests of executive function because of an inability to update or shift set in response to external stimuli. Finally, we propose that performance during a set-shifting task, requiring subjects to shift attention from internal to external stimuli, will be impaired in older subjects, and that thi will be associated with higher dopamine synthesis, reduced DMN deactivation during the task, greater FPCN-DMN coupling, and poorer performance on tests of executive function. These experiments will provide a new, neural systems approach to age-related cognitive decline that has major implications for underlying mechanisms and therapy."
"9278240","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project seeks to evaluate a model of childhood obesity that begins with maternal pre-pregnancy obesity as a distal risk factor contributing to the development of appetite dysregulation and poor executive functioning, increasing a child's risk for excess weight gain. The study will take advantage of a perinatal birth cohort with over 2000 births that has obtained prospectively collected data from the first trimester through infancy, inclusive of pre-pregnancy weight at the first prenatal visit, gestational weight gain, surveys regarding nutrition, stress and lifestyle behaviors, data from medical records on pregnancy and birth complications, maternal blood at the first trimester, and umbilical cord blood at delivery. The proposed study will recruit mother/child dyads from this cohort and conduct detailed assessments of IQ, executive functions (attention, inhibitory control, memory, affective-based decision making), appetite regulation using the eating in the absence of hunger laboratory paradigm, dietary intake, and anthropometric growth among 400 children at ages 4 years and two- years later at 6 years. Maternal blood specimens collected during the first trimester and cord blood at birth will be used to assay Interleuken-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), two cytokines important in both metabolism and normal brain development. The primary hypothesis is that maternal obesity influences neurodevelopmental processes that regulate appetite and executive functions resulting in increased risk for obesity in offspring. A secondary/exploratory hypothesis is that markers of prenatal neuro-inflammatory processes mediate the effect of maternal obesity on adverse child outcomes. Conducting this study in the context of an established perinatal birth cohort provides a cost-effective opportunity to achieve our aims. The study will aid in disentangling the associations between maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, childhood appetite regulation, executive functions and child weight gain. By understanding how developmental factors shape individual differences that predict child obesity, it is possible to markedly improve prevention interventions by targeting key risk factors for childhood obesity at earlier developmental periods and create tailored prevention programs that shift children's weight trajectory toward more healthy outcomes."
"9322828","The goal of this 5-year Global Infectious Diseases (GID) training grant proposal is to establish a research and training program in India focused on the study of the interaction of infectious diseases (IDs) with non-communicable diseases (NCD). NCDs, such as diabetes and chronic respiratory illnesses, are rapidly increasing in prevalence in India as the middle class expands, the population ages, and modern medical care and technology become more accessible. However, IDs, including TB and acute respiratory infections, remain a substantial burden. India is also an important center for the development and spread of bacterial resistance. The high frequency of IDs combined with the substantial and growing burden of NCDs drives a need for Indian scientists with an expertise in NCD-associated infectious diseases (NCDAID). This program will be established at JSS University (JSSU), a medical teaching center in Mysore, Karnataka, India, that serves Mysore city and surrounding rural regions of South India. Collaborators include the Public Health Research Institute, India (PHRII), also located in Mysore, and the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) and San Francisco (UCSF). Key personnel at these institutions have ongoing projects and collaborations. This training program will expand the number of faculty and range of projects involved in these collaborations to include projects along two specific tracks: (1) field epidemiology and (2) molecular epidemiology. Projects will initially focus on infectious diseases associated with diabetes mellitus and chronic respiratory illnesses. Masters, medical, or doctoral candidate trainees in the field epidemiology track (1-2 per year) will train in the US for 6 months before returning to India to conduct their field work with support from PHRII and their JSSU mentors. Doctoral trainees will return to the US for up to 12 months to conduct advanced data analyses with their US mentors. We also propose to create a data surveillance and analysis/management system at JSSU that can serve as a long-term training site to study NCDAID in South India. The molecular epidemiology track will include the training of a junior faculty member in the US for 2 years, who will then return to establish a molecular epidemiology laboratory at JSSU. Then, each year a doctoral candidate will be trained for 12 months in the US who will then return to help establish and complete their research in the new JSSU facility. In-country workshops will be held annually for trainees and faculty in molecular epidemiology, data management and analysis, and mentorship. We thus plan to establish a long- term molecular and field epidemiological research capacity at JSSU that can address this emerging ID public health problem resulting from the increasing prevalence of NCDs in India."
"9278098","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Gulf War Veterans' illness (GWVI) continues to cause suffering and disability for many Veterans decades after returning from their deployment. Although the major GWVI symptoms clearly point to persistent biologic nervous system abnormalities, the limited neurobiological studies to date of nervous system function and structure in GWVI have not yet clearly demonstrated pathobiologies that can guide treatment development. This application incorporates neuroscientific advances in neuroimaging, genetics, pain and sleep physiology, neuroendocrinology and neurodegeneration biomarker development in a multidisciplinary approach to defining neurobiologic abnormalities underlying GWVI symptomatology. Rationale for this effort is strengthened by our neuroimaging evidence of reduced brain metabolism and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker evidence of neuronal damage in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND)-deployed Veterans who had no lifetime history of traumatic brain injury or posttraumatic stress disorder. A multidisciplinary group of neuroscientists will address the following Specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1. To identify in GWVI abnormalities in brain structural and functional integrity.  Hypothesis 1a - GWVI is characterized by decreased cerebral glucose metabolism in brain regions relevant to cognition (e.g., medial temporal lobes) using fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography; decreased structural and compositional structural integrity using magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging and macromolecular proton fraction mapping; and decreased brain regional connectivity among nodes of the ventral and dorsal attention networks on blood oxygen level dependent functional connectivity MRI.  Hypothesis Ib - GWVI is characterized by changes in CSF biomarkers associated with neurodegeneration (decreased Ab42, increased CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) and oxidative damage (increased F2-isoprostanes), and decreases in the neurotrophin, brain derived neurotrophic factor,  Hypothesis Ic - GWVI is characterized by deficits on challenging neurocognitive tasks that assess prospective memory, cognitive processing speed, and multitasking.  Specific Aim 2. To identify in GWVI abnormalities in central and peripheral systems regulating pain perception, fatigue, and sleep.  Hypothesis 2a: GWVI is characterized by increased pain sensitivity by Quantitative Sensitivity Testing and impaired activation of endogenous opioids in response to Conditioned Pain Modulation.  Hypothesis 2b: GWVI is characterized by abnormalities in neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, hormones, and immune factors associated with pain and fatigue perception and sleep.

Hypothesis 3a: GWVI is characterized by increased frequency of the apolipoprotein E (APOE)-e4 - allele, the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) H1 haplotype, the Met allele of the brain derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met variant, the Val allele of the catechol-O-methyl transferase Val158Met variant, the G allele of the mu opioid receptor 1 A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (i.e., rs1799971), the Arg allele of the paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Gln192Arg variant, and decreased functional activity of PON1.  Hypothesis 3b: GWVI is characterized by altered DNA methylation levels in CpG Islands in the PON1, APOE, MAPT, and BDNF genes."
"9293293","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney stone is an exceedingly common disease. The lifetime risk of developing a kidney stone is about one in eight in American men and one in twenty in American women. An overwhelming majority of the kidney stones are recurrent, adding significantly to the pain, suffering and medical expenses. Kidney stone formation or nephrolithiasis is believed to be a multistage process, but precisely how each step takes place in a physiological environment remains poorly understood to date. In the past, attempts to understand the pathogenesis of kidney stone depended heavily on in vitro experimentation and human specimens harboring full-fledged stones. While extremely necessary, these approaches alone do not allow a comprehensive analysis of the full-spectrum of the lithogenic process from the beginning to the end. Over the last 10 years, our laboratory has been developing genetically engineered mouse models to characterize the sequential steps of nephrolithiasis. In particular, we inactivated the gene encoding Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP; also named uromodulin), a major urinary protein made by kidney's thick ascending limb of loop of Henle. We found that these knockout (KO) mice are prone to developing intra-renal calcinosis that bears strong resemblance in many respects to human patients bearing idiopathic calcium oxalate stones. The main goal of this renewal proposal is to significantly expand and deepen our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby defects of THP lead to intra-renal calcification. Specifically, we will investigate how interstitial calcification in THP KO mice originate and evolve in a spatial and temporal manner by performing ultra- structural and chemical and protein composition analyses. We will examine how renal epithelial cells uptake the intratubular crystals and whether and how this leads to cytotoxicity. We will determine whether formation of bona-fide kidney stones in THP KO mice relies on heightened urinary supersaturation of calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate by generating compound, genetically engineered mice that naturally develop these conditions. Together, these interconnected and mutually enforcing studies should offer novel insights into how kidney stones develop and how they can be better prevented."
"9451654","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advancing CBPR Practice Through a Collective Reflection and Measurement Toolkit Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) and Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) are key to NIH goals of reduced health disparities, diversified research workforce, increased minority enrollment in research, and enhanced external validity of research findings. Despite rapid CEnR growth and innovation, a shared measurement and evaluation science is still minimal. Multiple high-functioning research partnerships have solid evaluation designs, but most CEnR partnerships are in an emerging or intermediate stage, with little evaluation expertise to assess effective partnering processes. Without internal assessment and collective reflection, adoption of best practices for partnership quality improvement and for impacting health is limited. There is little to no national consensus on universal measures and tools linking CEnR partnering processes to potential intermediate system changes, community capacity, and research outcomes, nor to distal health outcomes. This application takes that next step: to refine and test evidence-based measures and tools of CEnR partnering processes and outcomes (proximal, intermediate, distal) with national CEnR partnerships. This grant builds from our recently-completed NIH study, Research for Improved Health (RIH), where we tested our CBPR Conceptual Model; developed new psychometrically validated quantitative process and outcome measures; and created a Toolkit of promising practices associated with outcomes from our data. We plan to refine measures and test effectiveness of our Collective Reflection and Measurement Toolkit, comprised of our CBPR Conceptual Model, Measures and other Tools, within an interactive guided Training Intervention to improve partnership success of research and capacity outcomes. Our specific aims include: Aim I: to reconvene our national Think Tank of academic and community CEnR/CBPR experts from the past seven years for expert consensus on measures; training intervention; and finalized CRM Toolkit; Aim 2: to refine and pilot-test reconfigured measures drawn from RIH case study analyses, ie, cultural-centeredness, trust, empowerment, reflexivity, community capacity/readiness, collaboration, implementation/adoption and dissemination/network measures; and Aim 3: to conduct a comparative effectiveness randomized control trial (RCT) with 40 partnerships, identified from NIH RePORTER database and CTSAs. Partnerships will be assigned to either 1) Training Intervention (two-day workshop of our CRM Toolkit with Internet-based assessment and personalized data analysis of measures of each partnership's processes and outcomes paired with motivational interviewing, followed by bi-monthly coaching (10 partnerships in four Trainings/each = 40 total); compared to 2) Minimal Web Intervention (providing access to CRM Toolkit resources and website in public domain). With increasing interest from CTSAs, NCI-designated Cancer Centers, ACA commitment to patient/stakeholder input, and from CBPR/CEnR researchers and practitioners, the lack of systematic partnered science is untenable. This study offers two critical outcomes to add to this science: validated and strengthened measures and tools; and effectiveness-testing of the CRM Toolkit to enhance partnership adoption of promising and best measures/practices for improved research and health outcomes."
"9313890","A longstanding idea is that the regulation of energy intake and body weight depends on the integrative control by external food-related cues in the environment and physiological signals arising from the internal milieu. In fact, according to several accounts the ability of such environmental food cues to evoke appetitive and consummatory responding is held in check by interoceptive satiety signals that inhibit those behaviors. Within this framework, energy dysregulation leading to obesity can be seen as a failure of interoceptive satiety cues to adequately counter response evocation by food cues in the environment. This type of failure would presumably be an important contributor to what has been termed the ?obesogenic? environment. The purpose of research proposed in this application is to elucidate the factors that contribute, to and the mechanisms that underlie, the weakening of internal stimulus control of appetitive behavior relative to control by external food-related stimuli. Based on recent research from our laboratory and elsewhere, we propose that both the ability of environmental cues to evoke eating and the ability of physiological cues to inhibit intake are dependent on learning and memory. However, both types of cues involve different types of learning and memory processes that rely on distinct brain structures and circuits are involved with the evocation, compared to the inhibition, of appetitive and consummatory behavior. The research we plan to do will evaluate a specific, mechanistic, and testable account that explains how consuming a diet high in saturated fat and sugar (a.k.a. ?Western diet? (WD)) can disturb the function and physiology of the hippocampus (a brain structure long-identified with learning and memory). These disturbances reduce the ability of internal satiety signals to inhibit eating behavior evoked by signals in the environment related to food. Research planned in this application will advance knowledge about the operation of this mechanism, along with its neural substrates, in both male and female rats and will investigate the implications of this model for interventions that could both prevent excess intake and body weight gain and restore normal regulatory function following consumption of WD."
"9175814","Project Summary/Abstract The beneficial infant outcomes of maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) in pregnant smokers is supported by our robust pre-trial evidence in animal models and convincing human pilot data. This evidence served as the basis for our current multi-center double blind randomized trial ?Vitamin C to Decrease Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function? (VCSIP; NCT01723696). Recruitment is completed as scheduled with 252 pregnant smokers randomized to vitamin C or placebo. VCSIP's primary and secondary outcomes, respectively, are pulmonary function testing (PFT) of infants at 3 months of age, and PFTs and the incidence of wheeze at 12 months of age. This application is a renewal for the VCSIP trial to continue following mothers and their offspring through 5 years of age. Time is critical, as the study population is predominantly under-resourced making rapport crucial to cohort retention, which requires personnel and time. The aim of this renewal proposal is to determine whether prenatal supplementation with vitamin C can improve pulmonary function and decrease recurrent wheeze through 5 years of age in the offspring of smokers. Our hypothesis is that supplemental vitamin C in pregnant smokers will significantly improve their children's pulmonary function and decrease recurrent wheeze. This is a logical continuation for the VCSIP trial as transient versus recurrent wheeze are not clinical distinguishable until 5 years of age. Following infants from the VCSIP until age 5 years: will differentiate patients with transient versus recurrent wheeze (a more likely predictor of asthma); will determine if early life protective effects of vitamin C are sustained to this older age; and will provide structure for continued biologic samples from the children for future mechanistic studies of vitamin C action. All investigators, clinical staff and participants will remain blinded to treatment allocation. We are currently completing the primary outcome, and based on the number of randomized smokers we will have a sufficient number of pulmonary function measurements at 3 months of age in the infants of randomized smokers to meet the predetermined sample size for this analysis. The first infants of VCSIP turned 1 year old in May 2014; therefore this proposal is being submitted now, prior to the analysis of the primary outcome of the VCSIP study, to minimize gaps in the follow-up of this valuable cohort. The children will be followed with quarterly respiratory questionnaires and yearly visits, collecting the following samples: maternal and child hair for nicotine; child buccal swabs; maternal exhaled carbon monoxide; pulmonary function tests at 3, 4,and 5 years of age. This competitive renewal will allow us to study the longer term outcome of our intervention with vitamin C with regards to childhood pulmonary function and the occurrence of recurrent wheeze through 5 years of age. It will also allow us to follow this unique, extensively phenotyped cohort of children born to pregnant smokers to 5 years of age to address important scientific questions related to maternal smoking and childhood respiratory health/wheeze/asthma."
"9323638","In 2014, the World Health Organization estimated that there were 1.5 million deaths as a result of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection (0.4 million of which were HIV-positive). Vietnam is located in a region that accounts for 58% of the world's TB cases, and an estimated 137,000 Vietnamese are infected with TB per year (5,000 of which acquire drug-resistant TB). Of these, the disease kills an estimated 19,000 Vietnamese annually. In the current proposal, we aim to enhance and strengthen a research training program between the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the Institute of Marine Biochemistry at the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (IMBC-VAST), and the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) in Hanoi, Vietnam. We aim to enhance host country basic and translational research capacity that focuses on the discovery and development of antibiotic leads for TB. Since the 1990s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have invested heavily in both clinical labs and HIV/AIDS/TB surveillance systems in Vietnam, though these and several other efforts have focused predominantly on building medical infrastructure. Our proposal will bridge this gap by enhancing basic and translational science research infrastructure and a researcher training program that focuses on utilizing host-country resources to discover antibiotic leads that will treat TB and probe its basic mechanisms of pathogenicity through coordinated antibiotic lead screening programs in Hanoi. The success of this program is driven by short- and long-term research training and education. UIC has a strong track record of collaboration with VAST. Through NIH and MacArthur Foundation funding in the past 20 years, the team has worked to build a plant-based drug-lead discovery and resource conservation program. However, with greater than 3,000 km of coastline, Vietnam harbors some of the richest marine biodiversity in the world, from which this proposal aims to mine. The aims of this program are 1) Establish three independent investigators at IMBC-VAST/NIHE via long-term postdoctoral training at UIC; 2) Provide short- and long-term antibiotic-specific training to nine IMBC/NIHE predoctoral students over the course of the program period; 3) Enhance biological assay research infrastructure through creation of an in vitro M. tuberculosis screening program at NIHE. In a five-year period, our program will generate twelve highly trained scientists who specialize in TB antibiotic discovery and development. Three of the twelve scientists ? with considerable institutional support from the Director and President of their respective institutes ? will establish independent research groups that complement a broader program that uses Vietnam's natural resources to discover TB antibiotics, and to use these leads to explore mechanisms of M. tuberculosis pathogenicity. Beyond the five-year project period, the significant enhancement in research capacity at IMBC and NIHE will establish northern Vietnam as a translational screening center for TB, and will facilitate collaboration with institutions across and outside Vietnam."
"9280756","The Animal Resource Core (Core B) is an essential component of the research program in its study of neurocognitive aging to provide young and aged rats to each of the Projects. A major objective of the overall research program is to elucidate the basis of neurocognitive aging in behaviorally characterized healthy aged rats. The overall research program further exploits the feature of individual differences in neurocognitive aging, a phenomenon that is well-documented in humans and captured in the animal model used in this research. The many years of work with this outbred model of male Long Evans have established that a subpopulation at older ages exhibit impaired performance while other rats in the aged cohort maintain preserved performance on a par with young adults. These well-characterized individual differences have been used successfully to examine neurobiological variations in the medial temporal lobe that are closely coupled to cognitive outcomes.  The Animal Resource (Core B) maintains a colony of pathogen-free male Long-Evans rats, which are additionally screened for disability and physiological impairment. All rats in the Animal Resource undergo assessment of cognitive function in a standardized protocol for ?place? and ?cue? learning in a water maze apparatus. The Animal Resource together with the Data Management (Core C) provides routine analysis of these results to characterize presence/severity of impairment. Additional behavioral assessments (e.g. object recognition) are provided for specific project experiments. The Animal Resource compiles records on animal health, inventory, and analysis of the behavioral assessments, all in an archived form maintained by Core C (Data Management and Statistics).  Animals from the resource are then made available to the Projects for further studies, with assignments under the supervision of the Administrative Core (Core A). In many instances live animals are transferred from the Resource to projects for further in vivo analysis (i.e., electrophysiological recording, additional behavioral assessment) or to provide fresh tissue as needed for in vitro studies.  In addition to providing rodent material for current projects, Core B also banks tissue specimens (dissected brain regions, peripheral organ tissues, blood samples) to be used at a later date by project investigators or outside scientists, This resource sharing activity is managed and coordinated by the Administrative Core (Core A)."
"9319721","The mission ofthe Genetic Engineering and Gene Therapy (GEGT) Core is to work cooperatively with Liver  Research Center (LRC) Investigators to facilitate the development of genetic engineering reagents for in  vitro and in vivo experiments. The specific aims are to (1) generate customized oncoretroviral, lentiviral,  adenoviral and non-viral vectors with integrating or episomal characteristics; (2) provide state-of-the-art  reagents for site-specific gene insertion for cell marking, phenotypic correction/modification or down-regulating  gene expression; (3) provide viral and non-viral vectors for reprogramming somatic cells to  induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells; (4) when appropriate, train investigators and their research personnel in  generating gene transfer vectors in their own laboratories; (5) provide consultation for study design and, if  appropriate, data analysis to the investigators. To fulfill these needs, the GEGT is established through a  cooperative cost-sharing arrangement with the Gene Therapy Core of the Albert Einstein College of  Medicine. The GEGT Core will function in close collaboration with other LRC Cores, as well as other  institutional Shared Facilities, but the specialized services of the GEGT do not overlap with those offered by  other Cores. The Core will benefit from the 25-yr experience of the Scientific Director, Jayanta Roy-  Chowdhury, Professor of Medicine and Genetics in gene transfer in vivo and ex vivo for pathobiological and  translational research, as well as the significant technological expertise of the Operations Director, Dr. Xia  Wang. GEGT Core will add value to LRC investigators by enabling them to generate and use vectors and  reagents that would be prohibitively expensive or technically difficult for individual laboratories to develop. It  will also give LRC investigators priority for service and discounted chargeback rates. Resource sharing with  other LRC Cores, as well as other institution-wide shared facilities will allow the Core to provide its services  in an effective and cost-efficient manner. By supporting the multifaceted pathophysiological and translational  research projects of the LRC members, as well as extramural investigators, the Core will be highly relevant  to healthcare-related liver research."
"9354270","Elucidation of the decades? long period of time during which Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies begin to develop prior to the appearance of cognitive symptoms (i.e., ?preclinical? AD) has been largely driven by the study of disease biomarkers. Such biomarkers are now being used to more precisely define various stages within this preclinical period in order to better understand the pathologic processes taking place during this early stage and to better inform the design and interpretation of prevention trials aimed at identifying diseasemodifying therapies that have the best chance of preserving normal cognitive function. Data from ACS Project 2 contributed to the finding that preclinical AD (defined by CSF biomarkers) in older individuals (? 65 yrs) increases the risk for developing symptomatic AD in a stage-dependent manner. In addition, changes in amyloid-related markers (Aß42) over time were observed in early middle-aged participants (45-64 yrs), whereas changes in tau and ptau181 were observed in those in mid middle-age (55-64 yrs) and coincided with initial declines in cognition. As the current ACS cohort is aging, we are now poised to evaluate biomarker trajectories in individuals as they progress from being biomarker-negative to biomarker-positive (preclinical AD) to cognitively impaired (symptomatic AD). The proposed experiments are designed to evaluate the utility of CSF markers for identifying those individuals with preclinical AD who are in the transition period from cognitive normality to impairment. Novel markers of synaptic dysfunction will be evaluated in addition to the traditional markers of core AD pathologies. CSF tau and ptau181 will be compared with tau PET imaging to validate their utility as presumed markers of neurofibrillary tangles. Finally, in an exploratory aim, we will utilize the innovative method of Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetics (SILK) pioneered by Dr. Randall Bateman to evaluate the potential of a plasma (and CSF) Aß kinetic measure as an indicator of brain amyloid pathology. Aim 1. Continue to measure CSF concentrations of Aß40, Aß42, tau, ptau181, YKL-40, and VILIP-1, as well as novel markers of synaptic dysfunction, Neurogranin and SNAP-25. Aim 2. In longitudinal analyses, assess the annual rate of change in CSF biomarker concentrations as a function of AD risk (age, family history, APOE?4 status) and their relationships with baseline and future rates of change in other CSF markers. Aim 3. Correlate fluid biomarker measures (and rate of change over time) with clinical and psychometric performance (Clinical Core), novel tau imaging as assessed by T807 PET (Project 1), attentional control measures (Project 3), and structural neuroimaging (via MRI) and amyloid PET (via florbetapir) (Project 4). Aim 4. Evaluate the utility of Aß isotope kinetics (using stable isotope labeling kinetics methods [SILK]) in CSF and plasma as indicators of the presence/absence of brain amyloid."
"9273597","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mortality associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) accounts for up to 50% of pediatric deaths with over 48% of CHD mortality occurring in children less than 1 year of age. Post-operative infections contribute significantly to this mortalty with a recent study indicating a mortality rate of nearly 25% associated with post- operative infections. Nearly all children with CHD require surgical correction of their lesions necessitating the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, CPB stimulates the immune system to produce pro- inflammatory cytokines that are counteracted by a compensatory anti-inflammatory response generated by the immune system. In some children, this compensatory anti-inflammatory response remains prolonged, leading to an immunoparalyzed state in which the pediatric patients are no longer able to fend off pathogens resulting in post-operative infections. Importantly, immunoparalysis can be revered in critically ill children by treating them with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Even though immunoparalysis is associated with the dysregulation of immune function and the devastating consequences of post-operative infections, it remains a challenge for clinicians to identify those children who are immunoparalyzed and may benefit from GM-CSF to prevent post-operative infections. One major reason for the limited identification of children with immunoparalysis is the lack of validated immunomonitoring platforms that can allow real-time determinations of immunoparalysis. Two current methods exist to detect immunoparalysis: whole blood stimulation assay, which involves measurements of the capacity of peripheral blood leukocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines following pathogen stimulation using ELISA, and flow cytometry for enumeration of peripheral blood monocytes expressing HLA-DR receptors. The whole blood stimulation assay is time-consuming and can only provide the clinician with a determination of immunoparalysis in 72 hrs at the earliest. Flow cytometry for enumeration of peripheral blood monocytes expressing HLA-DR receptors can provide fast results; however it does not reflect the functional status of monocytes. Further, current protocols for isolation and functional testing of key leukocyte subpopulations (such as monocytes) require blood volumes that make such testing dangerous in small children. Thus, to understand the impact of immunoparalysis on outcomes for children following CPB as well as to identify functional status of key leukocyte subpopulations that are dysregulated in children who are immunoparalyzed, there exists a significant need for a real-time, functional immunophenotyping method that can achieve accurate, multiplexed functional cellular characterization of subpopulations of immune cells using only minute amounts of patient blood. To address this need, our central objective of this research is to develop an integrated microfluidic immunosensing platform for efficient isolation, enrichment, enumeration, and sensitive multiplexed functional immunophenotyping of subpopulations of immune cells from blood specimens. To extend our research to make clinical impact, we propose to implement our microfluidic immunomonitoring technology to further determine the incidence and impact of immunosuppression in critically ill children and its functional connection to post-operative infections. The Specific Aims of this collaborative R01 research thus are: (Aim 1) To develop and validate an integrated microfluidic immunophenotyping assay (MIPA) device for rapid, accurate, and sensitive parallel detection of multiple cytokines secreted by immune cells; (Aim 2) To develop and validate an integrated MIPA device for efficient isolation, enrichment, enumeration, and multiplexed functional immunophenotyping of subpopulations of immune cells from blood specimens; (Aim 3) To utilize the MIPA device to identify immunoparalyzed pediatric patients following CPB and determine its predictive power for post-operative infections."

Several unique characteristics distinguish our site as a logical choice for ChiLDReN. These unique characteristics include an established team from pediatric hepatology, pediatric surgery, pediatric radiology, and pediatric pathology that have worked together for >10 years to provide comprehensive care to children with liver disease. We demonstrate that our Center has a large recruitment pool of subjects for current and future ChiLDReN protocols, and the ability to recruit and retain those subjects. For our Scientific Research Plan, unique characteristics include an established nexus for genomic collaborations, innovative tools we will make available to the network, and an existing and robust analytical pipeline for genomic medicine. In Aim 1, we will enroll infants, children, and adolescents in current and future ChiLDReN protocols. For Aim 1, facilities and resources include Primary Children's Hospital and the University of Utah's Center for Clinical and Translational Science. In Aim 2, we will use our innovative genomics pipeline to identify, characterize, and share the genetic causes of liver disease in children. We will provide ChiLDReN with innovative tools and software for genome analysis, including VAAST, a probabilistic gene-finder used widely; pedigree-VAAST, an extension of VAAST that incorporates pedigree data; PHEVOR, a new algorithm for incorporating phenotypes into genome analyses; and Opal, which provides a fast and easy-to-use analysis environment for collaborative genome interpretation across ChiLDReN. Accomplishing these aims as a collaborative member of ChiLDReN will lead to new knowledge regarding the biology, natural history, etiology, and therapy of liver diseases that affect children, and improve the diagnostic and management options for patients afflicted with them."
"9355247","The University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Center will focus on understanding the electrophysiological features that underlie the motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) and developing new deep brain stimulation (DBS) strategies to treat them. This will be accomplished in humans through a combination of intra-operative microelectrode and post-operative local field potential (LFP) recordings using the Medtronic RC+S ?Brain Radio?, and DBS therapy implemented through the lens of novel targets and stimulation paradigms. These data will be complemented in nonhuman primates, by the development and electrophysiological characterization of optimization tools for improving subject-specific precision of DBS therapy. Specifically, the first goal (Project 1) is to enhance our understanding of the pathophysiological basis of PD motor signs by clarifying the changes in synchronized oscillatory activity that occur within the pallidum and STN at rest and during movement under conditions that improve and worsen motor signs (during DBS or following administration of levo-dopa). These data will provide the rationale for the development of novel DBS paradigms and targets. The second goal (Project 2) is to identify the physiological signatures associated with dopa-responsive and resistant motor features of PD, use MRI-derived computational models to examine the pathways mediating the behavioral changes and investigate alternative DBS targets and stimulation paradigms to treat these motor signs. The third goal (Project 3) is to leverage the well-established MPTP nonhuman primate model of PD to identify unconventional DBS settings that increase the window between successful therapy and emergence of side effects, develop closed-loop strategies for tuning DBS settings to maximize the therapeutic effect on individual parkinsonian motor signs, and investigate how the level of therapy depends on electrophysiological changes in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem. Critical to all three projects is the ability to accurately determine DBS lead and contact locations, and develop model based predictions of which motor pathways are activated during stimulation (Imaging Core). Clinical and quantitative motor assessments will be obtained (Clinical Core) and correlated to physiological data obtained acutely in the operating room, subacutely in patients whose leads are externalized and chronically through postoperative assessments using the Medtronic RC+S ?Brain Radio?. The Biostatistics Core will provide study design, logistics planning, overall data management, quality control and statistical analysis, as well as data integration with and transfer to the NIH/NINDS Data Management Resource. The Administrative Core will support all aspects of the UMN Udall Center, implement and support patient education and public outreach efforts and provide training for the next generation of PD researchers. Together, these approaches will provide critical data towards the development and translation of novel patient-specific DBS therapies."
"9295919","Why is it that low levels of education are associated with worse adult health and higher mortality? Despite decades of research, we know surprisingly little about the mechanisms through which education influences mortality and health. Though a dense literature documents the mediating role of factors such as income, risk behaviors, and environmental exposures, there are only a handful of investigations that explore early environments (genetic, material, familial, social and emotional). In this project, we focus on very early conditions (some inherited) that drive the child's physical and mental growth and development, including episodes of ill health, but more broadly exposure to a range of stressors linked to deprivation, family characteristics and parental behavior and expectations. We conjecture that these factors contribute to the formation of cognitive and non cognitive resources that influence educational attainment and, ultimately, adult physical and mental health. As an important innovation, part of our investigation will focus on specific genetic traits recently suspected to be involved in the modification of the effects of educational attainment (or of some of the factors responsible for it) on mental health. The aims of this project will include 1) developing a methodology to estimate the importance of cognitive and non-cognitive factors as mechanisms that mediate the relationship between education and health by decomposing the effects of education on health and mortality into a component due to cognitive and non-cognitive traits and another due to standard factors (i.e. material resources, health behaviors); 2) testing the hypothesis that educational attainment has become a stronger determinant of health and mortality across time in part because of the salience of early conditions as determinants of both educational attainment and health status and mortality and 3) evaluating the role of genetic endowments in moderating the relationship between education and mental health outcomes."

"9304307","Abstract Obstructive sleep apnea is a major public health problem. Small airways, often further narrowed by fat deposits, are vulnerable to collapse during sleep when the upper airway dilator muscles (mainly the genioglossus, GG) relax. Restoration of GG tone is necessary for recovery from each obstructive event. It is widely believed that arousal is necessary for this process but recent data suggest that may not be the case. Thus, in many OSA patients augmentation of their GG activity during sleep would prevent and reverse airway obstruction. Discovery of a pharmacological agent(s) that could achieve this would be a major advance in clinical OSA management. In order to design an effective pharmacological treatment for OSA we must identify a target or combination of targets capable of augmenting GG activity and its responsiveness to airway obstruction-related stimuli (primarily CO2 and negative airway pressure) during sleep. A recent exciting demonstration of recovery of phasic respiratory GG activity during REM (when it is normally very small or absent) by local microdialysis of mAchR antagonists into the XII nucleus published last year (Grace et al., 2013) indicates that there is a system of cholinergic neurons that prevent respiratory-linked drive to the GG. We hypothesize that a drug that inhibits this process would be therapeutic for OSA. In this project we propose to identify the cholinergic neurons responsible for suppression of the GG and identify their mechanism of action. We expect this will lead to identification of pharmacological targets for OSA. ."

Together these activities of the DSMC will ensure robust data management and statistical analysis throughout the Yale ADRC."
"9279104","Imaging Core B: Project Summary  The DDBTRCC Imaging Core B is designed to provide our Research Base investigators. equipment for and instruction and assistance in use of multiple levels of classical and cutting edge fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy (EM) techniques for study of the physiology and cell biology of GI track epithelial cells at the level of organs, tissues, cell models, and sub-cellular organelles. These include confocal and multiphoton confocal microscopy with applications for intracellular pH and Ca2+ measurements and protein trafficking at a single cell level, FRET microscopy for detection of protein-protein interactions in in vitro and in vivo models, FRAP microscopy for monitoring the changes in protein mobility due to the changes in protein complexes, and META spectral imaging for more than 4 fluorophores. The Core also offers ratio-excitation imaging systems of single cells (microscope/camera based) or groups of cells (fluorimeter) for quantitative measurements of ion concentrations in polarized epithelial cells or in non-polarized cells and a cooled CCD camera for documenting histologic slides. Core B has expanded the repertoire of microscopy imaging techniques by being awarded a SIG (collaboration with JHU Imaging Core) to bring super resolution technology to JHU. Additionally, we developed a partnership with industry and opened an Olympus Equipment Demonstration Center, to provide access to Center members of advanced Olympus microscopy equipment which already includes confocal-in-a- box technology for long time (days) live tissue imaging and advanced TIRF microscopy. Core B also assists DDBTRCC investigators in preparation of intestine, liver, pancreas, and kidney for EM imaging and data interpretation. Since the Center was funded in 2011, the Imaging Core has provided services to 44 current and previous Center investigators, 37 Members and 7 Associate Members and contributed to 76 publications."
"9304304","Project Summary/Abstract This project seeks to explore the brain circuitry that relays the signal for CO2 arousal to the forebrain during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Our previous studies have implicated the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus (PBel) as a key site for relaying signals to the forebrain that cause arousal during brief exposure to high CO2 levels, such as occur during OSA. Those studies further identified key targets of the PBel which may relay this arousal: the supramammillary nucleus (SUM); orexin fields in the lateral hypothalamus (LH); substantia innominata (SI) just ventral to the anterior pole of the globus pallidus; central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA); and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST). In Aim 1, we propose to inject the PBel on one side of the brain with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) expressing the genes for Archaerhodopsin TP009 (ArchT) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a Cre-dependent manner (AAV-ArchT-GFP) in mice that express Cre recombinase under the CGRP promoter (a gene that is selectively expressed in the PBel). The PBel on the other side of the brain will be genetically lesioned with an AAV that expresses the lethal diphtheria toxin A in a Cre-dependent manner. We will then determine the effect on CO2 arousal of optogenetic inhibition of either the remaining PBel or its key target regions in the forebrain. Studies from other labs have indicated that both the serotonin system and locus coeruleus (LC) modulate CO2 arousal, and we hypothesize that this occurs via interactions of these systems with either the PBel itself, or with its targets. In Aim 2, we will examine the serotonin system by injecting either the dorsal or medullary raphe (or both) in serotonin transporter-Cre (Sert-Cre) mice with AAVs that code for Cre-dependent expression of the hM4Di-mCherry inhibitory receptor. We will then examine the effect on CO2 arousal of inhibiting the serotonin neurons with systemic injection of hM4Di ligand, clozapine-N-oxide. To determine the site at which these neurons act, we will inject the raphe site(s) that affect CO2 arousal with the AAV-ArchT-GFP vector and genetically lesion the PBel with AAV-DTA on one side of the brain, and then attempt to block CO2 arousal by optogenetically inhibiting the key raphe site or its terminals in the remaining PBel or the targets of the PBel. In Aim 3, we will do a parallel set of experiments for the LC to study the noradrenergic contribution to CO2 arousal. Finally, in Aim 4, we will inject the PBel with AAV-ChannelRhodopsin2-mCherry, and in brain slices we will determine the effects of optogenetically activating PBel terminals on patch clamp recordings from different classes of neurons in its target areas, and the effects on this activation of serotonin or norepinephrine or their antagonists. These experiments will identify key components of the chemical circuitry that underlies CO2 EEG arousal, and provide the basis for pharmacological attempts to intervene in this process."
"9304305","Scammell Project Summary  In patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), arousals play a life-saving role, and we hypothesize that neurons in the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT/PPT) play an essential role in many aspects of arousal, including arousals from sleep in OSA. Our goals are to determine the specific functions of the LDT/PPT neurons producing acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA; to map the anatomic projections of these cells; and to examine how they influence the activity of key target regions that regulate sleep/wake behavior and respiration. We will pursue these goals using optogenetics to examine acute, brief increases or decreases in neuronal activity within a behavioral state, and pharmacosynthetics using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to examine changes lasting hours. As a model of OSA, many experiments will use the Repetitive CO2 Arousal (RCA) method to examine responses to hypercapnia during sleep.  To determine if specific LDT/PPT neurons are sufficient for wakefulness, EEG activation, and the response to RCA, we will activate each class of neurons using the hM3 DREADD or channelrhodopsin (ChR2). To determine if specific LDT/PPT neurons are necessary for wakefulness, EEG activation, and the response to RCA, we will inhibit each class of neurons using the hM4 DREADD or ArchT, an inhibitory archaerhodopsin. To define the key LDT/PPT target regions mediating these behavioral responses, we will map projections of specific LDT/PPT neurons using conditional anterograde and retrograde tracing; determine which projections form functional synapses using ChR2- Assisted Circuit Mapping (CRACM); and determine which target regions are functionally most important by focally stimulating or inhibiting glutamatergic and cholinergic nerve terminals in each target region using ChR2 or ArchT.  Collectively, these multidisciplinary experiments will define the neural mechanisms through which specific types of LDT/PPT neurons promote wakefulness, cortical activation, and arousals in a mouse model of OSA. The results of these experiments should substantially improve our scientific knowledge of the neural mechanisms that generate wakefulness and arousals due to hypercapnia, and ultimately lead to better treatments for obstructive sleep apnea."

"9295909","The Biostatistical and Analytic Core (BAC) will provide advanced statistical and analytic support for all experimental projects within the Program Project Grant (PPG) and will be instrumental for achieving the overall aim of quantifying the relative contributions of sleep loss and circadian disruption on metabolism in healthy older people. To achieve this overall aim, the BAC will analyze data collected in the proposed PPG, as well as data across studies from the proposed, current, and previous PPGs and other studies conducted in the same facilities by PPG investigators. The integrative power of the PPG will therefore enable the BAC to extend the work of the individual experimental Projects by using data from multiple projects. This integration will allow more powerful and detailed statistical analyses, as well as cross-experiment analyses and comparisons that will enable stronger conclusions to be made about the effects of sleep loss and circadian disruption on physiology, metabolism and autonomic function in humans and rodents. The BAC specific aims are: (SA1) To conduct the primary and secondary statistical analyses for each of the individual projects within the PPG using state-of-the-art statistical and analytic methods for evaluating the specific aims of each individual project; (SA2 and SAS) To quantify the effects of sleep loss and circadian disruption, their interaction, and recovery from these exposures on various metrics of metabolism (SA2) and autonomic function (SAS) by using longitudinal analyses and by analyzing and comparing data across different experimental protocols. Analytic and statistical methods - along with the bio-mathematical models developed by the Analytic Cores within previous PPGs - have been used to design and to analyze most experiments in the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Division of Sleep Medicine (DSM). New methods are required because of the longitudinal, correlated, and frequently non-normal distributions of the data collected. Appropriate statistical and modeling techniques determine whether an intervention has a significant effect, and to enable extraction of additional information from previously collected data. Therefore, the BAC will  support and greatly extend the results of the PPG experimental work."
"9280758","This Data Management and Statistics Core (Core C) has played an essential role in the research program over its 20 year history. The Data Management and Statistics Core will continue to serve the overall research program and each of the component projects (Projects 1-3), along with the Animal Resource (Core B).  The Core will provide expertise in statistics and experimental design to all projects under their respective research plans. This function of the Core is critical in the design and analysis of experiments that provide increasingly complex data and may benefit from analytical methods beyond the expertise of Project Leaders. Core C personnel with statistical expertise will participate in all research planning meetings (as described in detail in Core A). Continued consultation with investigators during the conduct of the research, data analysis, and preparation of publications will occur between this Core and the Projects. In these activities the Core maximizes communication across all project components to further the understanding of data to be analyzed, statistical procedures for those analyses, and appropriate interpretation of findings.  This Core continues to develop and implement data management strategies to process and document all data collected in Core B (Animal Resource) and in the Projects. Through its data management activities the Core will continue to build an archive of data generated under this mechanism of support. Because all data are keyed to the age and cognitive status of AI and AU rats, and each subject has a unique identifier that links subject data across datasets, many opportunities exist for comparison of data in this animal model across studies and projects. These archives serve all members of the investigative group and constitute a highly valuable base of information in the area of neurocognitive aging. Specific personnel in Core C are tasked with the database resource development and data management. Large archives of data (e.g. behavioral data and health records from the Animal Resource, microarray datasets in basal and experimental conditions) are managed in an accessible format for internal use and for data sharing both within the Program Project and with outside investigators, the latter under the supervision of Core A."
"9334702","PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT 2) The focus of this project is to exploit the Drosophila model system to study the role of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) in the progression of cellular dysfunction that occurs during aging, and to develop inter- ventions that suppress RTE activity and extend healthy life span. The maintenance of repressive hetero- chromatin declines with age, resulting in increased expression and mobilization of RTEs across species as diverse as fruitflies and mice. We hypothesize that the increase in the expression and mobilization of RTEs leads to an accumulation of damage to the genome of somatic cells, causing loss of cellular and organismal homeostasis, and thus promoting aging. We will use the powerful molecular and genetic tools and the short life span of Drosophila to determine the effects of RTEs on aging, and in particular, we will do this over the entire life span of the organism, something that would not be possible in humans, and would be prohibitively time- consuming and expensive in any mammalian model system on a large scale. Confirmation of a mechanistic relationship between RTE activity and aging will provide the groundwork for developing interventions that diminish RTE activity and genomic damage during aging, and should extend healthy life span.  The aims of this proposal are to test the hypotheses that: (i) loss of chromatin-regulated suppression of RTE activity with age is associated with increased DNA damage and genome instability; (ii) decreases in sirtuins with age lead to elevated RTE activity that can be reversed by increasing sirtuin activity; and (iii) interventions that suppress RTE activity in somatic cells can extend healthy life span.  To better understand the relationship between RTE activity, genomic damage and longevity, as well as to develop new interventions that can extend healthy life span, in Aim 1 we will develop high throughput DNA sequencing methods (collaboration with Project 1, Core B), deploy available and new RTE reporters (collaboration with Core B) to measure mobilization of RTEs in aging Drosophila, and carry out a forward genetic screens to identify new genes and pathways involved in the suppression of RTEs. We will examine the effects of (i) age, (ii) dietary restriction (DR), and (iii) genetic interventions that stabilize heterochromatin, such as increasing Su(var)3-9, HP1a, Dicer-2, Piwi or decreasing Adar expression, on RTE activity and mobilization. In Aim 2, to determine the role of Sir2 and Sirt6 in the repression of RTE activity during aging, we will combine the tools developed and utilized in Aim 1 to monitor RTE activity with genetic manipulations that increase or decrease the expression of Sir2 and of Sirt6 activity (collaboration with Project 3 and Core B). In Aim 3, we will (i) determine the effects of the genetic interventions developed in Aims 1 and 2 on the life span of flies (collaboration with Projects 1 and 3 and Core B), and (ii) test the effects of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nRTIs) and RNAi knockdowns of specific retrotransposons on RTE mobilization and lifespan (collaboration with Projects 1 and 3 and Core B)."
"9208069","Project Summary It is critical to the mission YRC as a Biomedical Technology Research Resource (BTRC) to disseminate newly developed technology and associated data to the research community and the public. To maximize the impact and utility of technology and data, the YRC is committed to making technology and data as accessible as possible to biomedical researchers and data scientists alike. The YRC will continue to invest in the development of high-quality, high-impact publications, talks, and seminars describing the details and application of new technology. Online, the YRC will develop and maintain a comprehensive public website designed around the center TR&Ds that describes the technology in detail, provides information about the center, links to all publications, provides access to YRC-developed software, links to online data resources, and reaches out to potential collaborators who wish to leverage our technology in their own research. The YRC generates large amounts of complex experimental data and inferred biology results from both technology development and the application of our technology to ongoing collaborations. The YRC is committed to making all of these data available to the public. When possible, data are submitted to existing online data resources designed to disseminate specific types of data. However, because of the cutting-edge nature of the YRC, it is often the case that no such resource exists. In these cases, the YRC has developed (and will continue to develop) new data dissemination technology designed for new kinds of data. Intuitive, responsive interfaces, integrated with other data and biological annotations, help ensure biologists and biomedical researches can find and make the most effective use of YRC data. Additionally, raw data downloads and integrated web services application program interfaces (APIs) ensure bioinformaticians and data scientists can find and make the most use of the data, as well. Collaborative data are confidential by nature, so cannot be made immediately available to the public. To support private dissemination of these data, the YRC has developed secure data dissemination resources designed for collaborators to search, visualize, and analyze their data. These resources will be integrated to support a better single point-of-contact for collaborators to receive YRC data. The resources will be updated to improve and simplify the visual interface to the data, to simplify the submission of data to both non-YRC and YRC public data dissemination platforms, and to simplify the collation of project-related data for annual reporting requirements. The development of technology often includes the development of new software with broad, high impact applicability to the research community. The YRC is committed to the dissemination of these software in a way that fosters use, extension, and contribution from the research community?including free software licenses, source code availability, and comprehensive documentation. Finally, the YRC will continue to distribute plasmid DNA and yeast strains to perform the yeast two-hybrid assay, yeast strains containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs, and a pooled version of the two-hybrid activation domain array, as well as other plasmids and strains."
"9310239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glomerular diseases are responsible for a large fraction of end stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. There are four idiopathic disorders that account for the majority of cases: IgA nephopathy (IgAN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy (MN) and minimal change disease (MOD). The major challenges include relative rarity, under-diagnosis, and etiologic heterogeneity of these disorders (resulting in the scarcity of well powered case cohorts), and relapsing-remitting patterns of activity with slow average rates of progression and high variability in prognosis (necessitating long-term follow up of several years to decades). Therapeutic options for these diseases are also recently limited. There has been recent progress in defining critical disease mechanisms for these four disorders, including discoveries of new genetic susceptibility alleles, novel circulating factors, and specific environmental insults inciting the disease. Accordingly, this project aims to develop a longitudinal observational cohort of 650 patients with IgAN, FSGS, MN and MCD (along with 650 ethnically and geographically matched healthy controls). The cohort will be followed at 6-month intervals with prospective collection of clinical data and biological materials, including blood, urine, saliva, and fecal material. These data and biomaterials will facilitate integration of clinical, genetic, biochemical, and immunologic studies to advance the science of glomerular disease. As part of this proposal, we suggest a number of innovative clinical, genetic, and biomarker pilot studies that would become feasible with the establishment of this cohort. In addition to enabling well-powered translational studies, this unique resource will also provide invaluable insights into the natural history of these disorders. The findings from this cohort will also lay basis for new therapeutic clinical trials, and thus wil directly impact the care of patients. The proposal brings together an experienced team of investigators with considerable contributions to the field of glomerular disease, including members of the Columbia Glomerular Center, Columbia Renal Pathology Division, Columbia Pediatric Nephrology Division, and the Gaslini Pediatric Institute. Moreover, our proposal has a considerable support from the industry, FDA, and patient advocacy groups."

"9208075","Project Summary The overall goal of the collaboration efforts of the Yeast Resource Center is to continue refining technologies developed within the center while simultaneously providing access to expertise and resources to the scientific community. Our resource has been an invaluable collaborative resource for the scientific community by making available advanced technologies developed by the center. In the last 5 years our Biomedical Technology Research Resource (BTRR) has had a total of 347 collaborations that are widely distributed throughout the United States. Collaborations differ from our Driving Biomedical Projects in that they don't require the development of new technologies but instead directly apply more established methods that make use of the expertise, instrumentation, software, and protocols facilitated by our resource. We have a history of openly supporting the scientific community by accepting collaborations that align with our expertise. A strength of a ?Yeast? resource center is that we have been a valuable resource and source of collaboration for the yeast scientific community. These collaborations have become an excellent opportunity in refining our established technologies. Once refined, methods often get extended to collaborations in experimental systems beyond yeast as the technology matures."
"9278262","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic advances have been made in recent years in the identification of genes that cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), two closely related neurodegenerative diseases. This includes at least three RNA binding proteins (TDP-43, FUS and MATR3) and a hexanucleotide expansion in RNA transcripts of the C9orf72 gene. These findings have focused much attention on understanding how changes in RNA metabolism might underlie these diseases. Although most cases of ALS are sporadic (no obvious familial inheritance), in almost all cases the TDP-43 protein is found in cytoplasmic inclusions in affected motor neurons, suggesting the functions of this protein are broadly relevant to ALS. We have characterized the functions of TDP-43 in a model system (C. elegans) and cell culture, and discovered that loss of this protein results in accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and abnormal processing of ribosomal RNA. The goal of this proposal is to determine if these changes in the metabolism of RNA play a role in ALS/FTD pathology. We will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 limits dsRNA, and seek to determine if loss of FUS and MATR3, or expression of the C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion, have similar effects on RNA metabolism. The disease-associated cytoplasmic redistribution of TDP-43 will also be investigated, particularly in response to expression of the C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion and the associated production of aggregation-prone poly-dipeptides. These studies will employ RNA interference, genetic mutations, immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization, and deep sequencing to globally characterize RNAs (the transcriptome), using both human cell culture and C. elegans models.  We will test the disease relevance of our findings by extending these studies to patient cells (fibroblasts and reprogrammed neurons) as well as pathological samples. In particular, we will test the hypothesis that the RNA changes we have identified may play a role in the neuroinflammation and astroglial dysfunction that has been implicated in ALS pathology."
"9323379","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to remain a Member of the Childhood Liver Disease Research and Education Network (ChiLDReN). As a Charter Member of the Network, our proposal represents a logical extension of the long- standing commitment of our Center to improve the care of children with chronic liver disease through innovative patient-based research. In the previous member of the Network, we worked collaboratively with investigators from other Centers to build a strong infrastructure to conduct patient-based studies on biliary atresia, cholestatic syndromes, mitochondrial hepatopathies and cystic fibrosis. Our key contributions included data submission and analysis of two retrospective studies; leadership in the development, implementation, and completion of the first clinical trial (the steroid trial); high enrollment and retention of subjects into prospective studies; completion of ancillary studies seeking novel molecular phenotypes of biliary atresia; completion of a pilot project on defects in bile acid synthesis; and participation in working groups and committees related to project reviews, writing of manuscripts, and development of core resources. We look forward to significantly contributing to the operation of ChiLDREN through three aims. In Aim 1, we will enroll subjects into prospective ChiLDREN protocols to enable translational science. This will be done by pursuing high enrollment rate of subjects into approved protocols, with the timely collection and submission of data and tissue samples to meet the enrollment goals established by the Network. In Aim 2, we will develop and implement research protocols for clinical trials. We have worked with Network investigators and NIDDK Program Directors to start a new trial for infants with biliary atresia (PRIME trial), and are completing the regulatory requirements to start a trial investigating the efficacy and safety of a small molecule inhibitor of the intestinal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (IMAGINE-ITCH-INDIGO trial). We are also working in research groups to develop a trial to test a new fat-soluble vitamin preparation to treat vitamin deficiencies in cholestatic children with biliary atresia (CholADEK trial) and the use of glycerol-phenylbutyrate to treat cholestatic children with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). And in Aim 3, we will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques in ancillary studies using ChiLDREN data and tissue to discover biomarkers of disease phenotypes and treatment in biliary atresia, and to define genetic mutations in children with mitochondrial hepatopathies. By pursuing the three aims, we will be well positioned to fully execute the new Network aims of pursuing clinical science projects and conducting trials to improve the outcome of children with liver diseases."
"9461739","Leishmania braziliensis is the most important causal agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) in South American. Additionally, in 19S6 we reported a new clinical form of leishmaniasis called disseminated leishmaniasis (DL). DL is defined by the sudden development of a febrile illness in an individual with a primary ulcer and the appearance of 10 and up to 1000 acneiform papules and ulcerated lesions spanning the whole body. DL is of growing concern because of the increasing number of cases in the last 20 years, from 0.2% to 4% in Northeastern Brazil, the presence of a large number of lesions, the occurrence of mucosal disease in up to 40% of the patients, and a high rate of failure to therapy. L. braziliensis is polymorphic and isolates that cause DL have genotypic characteristics different from CL and ML. Additionally parasites isolated from DL induce higher production of pro- inflammatory chemokines and TNF in macrophages than CL isolates. The histopathologic findings in DL are similar to CL with few parasites, lymphocyte infiltration and granuloma formation. Moreover we have not detected any impairment of macrophages in leishmania killing and no impairment in T cells response in DL. In contrast macrophages from DL produce higher levels of TNF, CXCL9 and CXCL 1O than CL cells. We have also demonstrated that CDS cytolytic T cells mediate increased pathology in CL patients and metastasis in L. brazi/iensis infection. It is known that inflammation plays a key role in metastasis in cancer. Our hypothesis is that an exaggerated inflammatory response mediated by macrophages and CDS T cells leads to metastasis and pathology in DL. In Aim1 of this project, we will determine the host and parasite factors that lead to DL, and based upon this knowledge propose new and effective methods of treatment. In Aim1 we will characterize parasite and vector factors in DL. We will determine if parasites from primary ulcer differ from those of metastasis lesions, and if parasites from patients with 10-12 lesions differ from these obtained from patients with more than 5 lesions. We will also determine if phlebotomies species in the area of cases of DL will be different from sandflies isolated from the environment of patients with CL. In the Aim 2 we will assess the contribution of monocytes and macrophages to the exaggerated inflammatory response and metastasis of L. braziliensis infected cells. In the Aim 3 we will define the participation of CDS+ T cells in the inflammatory response and metastasis observed in DL infected cells. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): Disseminated leishmaniasis (DL) is a severe form of leishmaniasis highly associated with failure to therapy. DL is not due a poor immune response but rather to an exaggerated inflammatory response. Defining the cells and molecules that cause inflammation in DL will allow us to develop therapies to decrease this deleterious response and improve responses to therapy."
"9481735","PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood obesity is a major public health problem that impacts health across the life course. Based on published studies to date, pregnancy weight gain is modifiable and is associated with offspring size and adiposity. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of the pattern, timing and overall magnitude of pregnancy weight gain on child adiposity development and future cardiometabolic health. The Institute of Medicine revised recommendations for pregnancy weight gain (2009) emphasized the need for research focusing on the pattern and timing of gain in addition to examining effects of total gain. This application addresses this important research area. I am seeking this Pathway to Independence Award to gain additional training in advanced trajectory modeling and human phenotyping to accomplish my career goals of becoming an independent investigator with expertise to rigorously examine the role of maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation on both maternal and child health. The training portion of this award includes formal courses, directed readings, apprenticeships, participation in working groups, attendance of seminars and career building activities to gain skills in: 1) longitudinal methods for trajectory analysis; 2) advanced methods for body composition assessment and analysis; 3) dissemination of research findings and grant writing. The research component of this project applies innovative trajectory modeling approaches to examine maternal weight trajectories in pregnancy. I will leverage existing data from the Columbia Children?s Center for Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study and the NICHD Fetal Growth Study to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Identify maternal weight trajectories reflecting timing and overall pattern of gestational weight gain using nonparametric trajectory methods and to examine determinants of these trajectories. 2) Examine how maternal weight trajectories relate to child growth, body composition and cardiometabolic health. 3) Conduct a pilot study to evaluate whether maternal fat mass changes are associated with specific maternal weight trajectories during pregnancy and neonatal adiposity. These training and research activities will lead to publications, conference presentations and will prepare me to successfully compete for R01 funding during the R00 phase."
"9278097","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Data from family-based, candidate gene, and genome-wide association studies converge to suggest a significant overlap in the molecular genetic risk factors for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). This suggests that overlapping genetic variants that influence risk for these illnesses do so via effects on shared dimensional phenotypes. Among these shared traits, neurocognitive impairment, is of particular clinical relevance as it does not adequately respond to available treatments and it is among the strongest predictors of functional disability across both disorders. Moreover, there is strong evidence that neurocognitive impairment is influenced by genetic factors in both SZ and BD, making this an endophenotype which is critical toward understanding trans-disorder pathophysiology. The identification of the relevant molecular networks associated with neurocognitive functioning in psychosis is not only an important step in elucidating the causes of these disorders, but also in identifying novel treatment options for this disabling symptom domain. We will focus on neurocognition as a critical dimension that is directly associated with disease risk and attempt to identify the clinical and molecular factors that underlie cognitive impairment in psychosis. To do so, we will characterize a prospective sample of 300 patients with psychosis, including both affective and non-affective psychosis, and empirically classify subjects based on neurocognitive performance profiles. We will also collect blood samples for DNA extraction and genotype a targeted list of high priority SNPs (based on prior association with BD/SZ risk and/or neurocognitive functioning) using a customized array. These data will be applied to a multidimensional modeling analyses in an effort to identify the risk alleles and molecular pathways that contribute to neurocognitive impairment in psychosis."
"9282296","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Psychiatric hospitalization presents a critical opportunity for delivering targeted treatment to reduce suicide risk and promote functional recovery. Yet, there are no suicide-specific empirically-supported interventions that can be feasibly delivered during a typical Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) inpatient stay.9 Although VHA now requires the provision of evidence-based, recovery-oriented inpatient psychotherapy,9 extant empirically-supported interventions for patients at high risk of suicide were developed for use in outpatient settings and are too time and resource-intensive to implement as intended in inpatient psychiatric settings, where shorter lengths of stay are expected. Furthermore, these interventions focus nearly entirely on preventing suicidal behavior without also targeting functional recovery.10 Similarly, inpatient psychiatric treatment has traditionally focused on medical management of acute illness, not on improving patient functioning.11 Preventing suicide during a crisis is only a short-term solution i we fail to assist patients in understanding how they can rebuild a life they deem worth living. Given that approximately 50% of inpatients do not engage in recommended outpatient mental health care and are at the highest risk of death by suicide, it is vital that inpatient care promot functional recovery.12 The ideal brief intervention for Veterans at risk for suicide needs to reduce risk of suicidal behavior while simultaneously fostering recovery.  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a recovery-oriented, psychosocial treatment approach ideally suited for utilization among Veterans hospitalized for suicide risk.5 ACT teaches psychological skills to handle painful thoughts, emotions, and sensations, but rather than focusing on symptom reduction, ACT directly targets functional recovery by assisting patients in identifying and engaging in value-consistent behaviors despite the potential for distress.5 ACT has been successfully adapted for inpatient use among patients with psychosis,1,2,13 but there are no brief, ACT-based, transdiagnostic treatment protocols designed to address suicide risk. In order to fill this gap, the investigators consulted with leading experts in ACT to develop and manualize ACT for Life, a brief, transdiagnostic, recovery-oriented intervention for Veterans hospitalized due to suicide risk. The ACT for Life manual details the application of ACT to recovery from suicidal crises and consists of three modules, [designed to be utilized in three to four 60-minute individual sessions.] If funded, the proposed two arm, randomized, controlled pilot study would provide critical information to inform final revisions to the treatment manual and research design for a future efficacy study of ACT for Life. Veterans who enroll in the study will be randomized to: (a) treatment as usual or (b) treatment as usual plus ACT.  The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Determine the acceptability of ACT for Life. (2) Determine the feasibility of the study design and research procedures. (3) Characterize participants' psychosocial functioning and self-directed violence using candidate outcome measures for a future efficacy trial. The performance of validated measures will be assessed, along with selected NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) modules.14 All participants will complete a baseline assessment, and follow-up assessments one and three months after hospital discharge. Participants in the ACT group will also complete a post-treatment assessment on acceptability of the intervention. The proposed study is a critical first step in a line of research likely to yield a recovery-oriented, empirically-supported intervention designed for inpatient use with Veterans at risk of suicide. ACT for Life's objectives are directly in line ith Rehabilitation Research and Development Service's goal to optimize Veteran functioning and community reintegration. By doing so, this intervention may assist Veterans in building lives they deem worth living, reduce the risk of decompensation, and ultimately prevent suicide."
"9273514","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increased accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) promotes obesity-associated chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. Although there have been some advances in the study of ATMs in obese condition, the mechanisms underlying ATMs recruitment and activation remain to be determined. Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) has been identified to be an adipokine and its expression levels correlate positively with human obesity, adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. By using TSP1 deficient mice, preliminary studies revealed a novel role for TSP1 in stimulating macrophage recruitment and activation in adipose tissue that contributes to inflammation and insulin resistance resulting from high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO). Moreover, TSP1 promoting macrophage migration and activation is through the N-terminal domain and the type 1 repeats to interact with receptors LRP1 and CD36, respectively. Blocking the interactions of TSP1/LRP1 and TSP1/CD36 inhibited TSP1 stimulation of macrophage function. Based on these data, we hypothesize that blockade of the stimulatory effect of TSP1 on macrophage function prevents/ameliorates obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1, tissue specific TSP1 knockout mice will be used to definitively answer the question of whether adipocyte-derived TSP1 serves as a primary chemokine to stimulate macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue and promotes the development of obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance. In Aim 2, utilizing the identified stimulatory domains on TSP1 as targets, based on their available x-ray crystal structures, new decoy peptides will be designed by structure-based computational design strategy. The inhibitory effect of decoy peptides on TSP1stimulation of macrophage function will be tested. In Aim 3, whether blocking of TSP1/CD36 interaction can prevent/ameliorate obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance in vivo will be tested. Together, these proposed studies may lead to novel therapeutics for obesity-induced insulin resistance and metabolic complications, and therefore, have significant clinical relevance."
"9271981","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Declining male fertility and an increased incidence of reproductive tract abnormalities have been postulated to be a consequence of increasing environmental exposure to chemicals with estrogenic activity. This project is an outgrowth of recent studies of mice and sheep in our laboratory that have uncovered a new phenotype induced by exogenous estrogens: We have found that exposures during testis development affect the events of meiotic prophase in the adult male, significantly and permanently reducing levels of meiotic recombination in the exposed individual. Because recombination is an essential feature of male meiosis, and decreasing levels below a specific threshold (i.e., one exchange per homologous chromosome pair) results in the demise of the cell, this new testicular phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to exogenous estrogens adversely affects male fertility. In addition, because recombination creates genetic diversity, our findings have important evolutionary implications. The exposure windows used in our preliminary studies coincide with the epigenetic reprogramming of the male germline. In addition, because the effect on recombination is permanent and the phenotype is evident when germ cells from exposed males are transplanted into a control testis, we hypothesize that estrogenic exposures act directly on the germ cells of the developing testis, altering the epigenome of the spermatogonial stem cell. We will test this hypothesis by defining the developmental window(s) during which the testis is susceptible to the meiotic effects of exogenous estrogens and the cell type(s) that are vulnerable, and by characterizing the epigenetic modifications of the germline that result from exposure. Importantly, the recombination phenotype used in these studies provides a novel, sensitive, and quantitative approach to measuring the effects of exposures on an essential aspect of spermatogenesis and for tracking effects across generations."
"9349059","ABSTRACT More than one million people have been displaced to Lebanon by the civil war in Syria. The vast majority lives amongst the five million Lebanese and interact with them daily. At the same time, HIV prevalence has increased among Lebanese men who have sex with other men (MSM) from <2% in 2010 to >10% in 2014- 15. In our recent study of 290 MSM in the Beirut area, 25% were born in Syria. They experienced more discrimination and abuse, were more likely to exchange sex for drugs, money, or goods, and less likely to have ever been tested for HIV than their Lebanese-born counterparts. We are proposing an exploratory study to obtain a larger sample of 1,000 MSM consisting approximately of 60% Syrian-born and 40% Lebanese-born MSM to (1) confirm the increased HIV prevalence in the MSM population, (2) quantify differences in HIV testing rates and HIV incidence, and (3) determine differences in access to and retention in HIV treatment for those testing HIV positive. Using the Minority Stress Model, we aim to explore if forced migration, minority stress, stigma associated with both sexual minority and refugee status, mental health difficulties, the lack of economic opportunity, and sexual and substance use behaviors among Syrian MSM living in Lebanon, in comparison to their Lebanese-born counterparts, are associated with lower rates of HIV testing among Syrian-born MSM, increased sexual risk taking, and diminished access to HIV care. These will be ascertained from the data collected from the thousand MSM and augmented by qualitative data collected from a subsample of 72 men, 24 who are HIV-positive and 24 low risk and 24 high-risk HIV- negative men of both Syrian and Lebanese nationality. Qualitative data collection and analysis will focus on personal life histories of significant events, social and sexual relationships, migratory experiences, socio- economic and substance use influences on sexual behavior, and access to and use of HIV prevention and treatment services. A mixed methods approach will combine the quantitative and qualitative data obtained through this exploratory study with the intention of developing one or more interventions to reduce HIV incidence and increase access to and retention in HIV care in a country in which HIV prevalence in the MSM population has been rapidly increasing. The opportunity here is to identify, respond to, and prevent an incipient HIV epidemic occurring within a context of massive population displacement and migration."
"9206902","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Many types of brain injuries, particularly stroke, can result in serious language impairment. Many veterans with aphasia have some degree of difficulty understanding language when they are spoken to, which affects their ability to communicate. Some recover their auditory comprehension skills over time, while some do not. To date, there is no clear-cut explanation as to why this occurs, making it difficult for clinicians to offer a concrete prognosis to their patiets and family members as to the degree of language recovery that can be expected. The proposed study will examine the neural factors associated with recovery from auditory comprehension impairment. Novel neuroimaging techniques will examine the brain structures that affect recovery, particularly the fiber pathways that connect cortical regions to each other. Damage to these fiber tracts will be assessed with the latest in diffusion imaging to visualize and quantify the damage in individual tracts. 45 veteran aphasic patients with auditory comprehension deficits will be assessed at 1 and 12 months post- onset of their stroke to track the degree of comprehension impairment and the course of its recovery. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will also be performed at 1 and 12 months post-onset to assess the extent of the damage to cortical areas and whether this damage can predict recovery. High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), also obtained at the same time intervals, will quantify the extent of the damage to individual white matter pathways, while tractography will provide visual confirmation of each fiber tract in each patient. Finally, white matter integrity will be measured t 1 and 12 months to assess the changes that occur in fiber pathways during the recovery period. The proposed project will examine several aspects of recovery that have not been fully explored. With our expertise in aphasia and neuroimaging and our success in using HARDI tractography to characterize the full extent of the damage in white matter pathways, we are in a unique position to carry out this innovative research. This project will yield information that can directly influence patient care; clinicians will have more accurate information with which to guide their treatment approach, and better inform veterans and caregivers as to how to plan their futures."
"9344673","Abstract. Despite treatment with effective anti-retroviral therapy, HIV-infected individuals are at in- creased risk for the development of COPD, manifesting as emphysema, with a higher incidence than the general population developing at an earlier age. Based on the knowledge that the first pathologic manifestations of COPD are in the small airway epithelium (SAE), that the lung destruction that char- acterizes emphysema begins in the alveoli surrounding the SAE and preliminary data demonstrating that airway basal stem/progenitor cells (BC) are capable of expressing a variety of destructive prote- ases, subsets of airway BC express HIV receptors, and that HIV can induce BC to up-regulate ex- pression and release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 via triggering the HSPG2 receptors and ERK and AKT pathways, we hypothesize that there are subsets of human small airway BC that have receptors for HIV, and consequent to the interaction with HIV, these BC subsets are pathologically reprogrammed to acquire a ?tissue destructive? phenotype that initiates local alveolar destruction. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose 3 aims. Aim 1. To assess the hy- pothesis that subsets of the population of human small airway BC have receptors for HIV, and that HIV can interact with and reprogram these BC subpopulations. Based on preliminary data, HIV will bind to, but not replicate in BC, using single cell RNA sequencing and FACS sorting, we will identify and characterize the susceptible BC populations and the specific BC HIV receptors. Aim 2. To examine the hypothesis that, consequent to HIV interaction, airway BC subsets are patho- logically reprogrammed to acquire a ?tissue destructive? phenotype, capable of initiating con- nective tissue destruction, and that these processes are exaggerated by cigarette smoke. Us- ing the relevant BC subpopulations, alone or in the presence of cigarette smoke, studies will be car- ried out to characterize the HIV-induced BC ?tissue destructive? phenotype, identify the specific recep- tors and pathways in BC activated by HIV binding, and to demonstrate that inhibition of these path- ways will return the BC ?tissue destructive? phenotype to normal. Aim 3. To investigate the hypoth- esis that airway BC of HIV+ individuals, and to greater extent, HIV+ individuals that smoke, have acquired a ?tissue destructive? phenotype in vivo, and that this process continues after HIV treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy. To validate the in vitro studies in aims 1-2, airway BC recovered by bronchoscopy and brushing of the SAE of HIV+ (uncontrolled and controlled) of nonsmokers and smokers will be assessed for the ?tissue destructive? phenotype com- pared to comparable HIV? individuals, and determine whether this phenotype can be reversed with relevant pathway inhibitors."
"9331314","Summary This proposal requests partial support for the FASEB Scientific Research Conference on NAD Metabolism and Signaling to be held in New Orleans, Louisiana on July 9-14, 2017. This conference began in 2009 and has been attended biennially by researchers from across the world. This conference is critical to the missions of the NIA and the NIDDK because NAD dependent processes mediate healthy aging, digestive health and resistance to prediabetes, diabetes and diabetic complications. Although there are specialized conferences that focus on sirtuins, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), calcium signaling, transcription, mitosis, immunology, drugs and nutritional interventions that interface with the fundamental and translational science of NAD, only one conference cuts across all of these areas to bring together the leading investigators in NAD biology and train the next generation of investigators to advance NAD discovery sciences and to make inroads into improving human health by optimizing NAD Metabolism and Signaling in model organisms and human beings. The major goals of the FASEB Conference on NAD Metabolism and Signaling are to foster new interactions between scientists who do not normally interact in the course of our work and to promote interdisciplinary interactions that will lead to new collaborations, advance the entire field and facilitate translational research leading to safe human interventions to improve healthy aging, digestive health and resistance to the ravages of obesity and diabetes. We expect that the new insights that are formed during the course of this meeting will result in advancement of an evidence basis to optimize NAD metabolism in healthy people and in people affected by diseases of aging, digestion and metabolic dysfunction. The objective of this proposal is to obtain funds to support travel and conference fees for outstanding US investigators, with a particular emphasis on individuals that are junior, female and/or underrepresented in science."
"9276672","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research focuses on the neuropeptide amylin and its role in controlling for palatable food intake and body weight through action in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the mesolimbic reward system. FDA-approved amylin analogs for the treatment of Type II Diabetes Mellitus produce improvements in blood glucose regulation and, in addition, produce meaningful reductions in food intake and body weight in both humans and animal models. While the literature has largely focused on the area postrema (AP) of the caudal brainstem as the primary site mediating the anorectic effects of amylin signaling, it is important to note that amylin receptors are also expressed in brain regions associated with reward and cognitive processes [e.g. VTA, nucleus accumbens (NAc)] and little-to-no investigation has been done to examine their contribution to energy balance control. Indeed, humans treated with an amylin analog report improved perceived control of eating and a 45% reduced risk of binge eating. Moreover, humans treated with amylin receptor agonists reduce their intake of highly palatable food more so than less-palatable food. Given that the excessive food intake contributing to obesity is driven, in part, by exposure to external stimuli associated with palatable food, it is of critical importance to investigate neurobiological systems that function to reduce excessive food seeking and consumption in response to food-related stimuli. It is also critical to evaluate the potential for amylin to interact with other physiological systes to produce an augmented reduction in food intake given that combination drug therapy holds greater promise than monotherapy for obesity treatment. Indeed, emerging basic science and clinical evidence shows that combined signaling by amylin and the adipose-tissue derived hormone leptin can lead to enhanced (potentially synergistic) suppression of food intake. Endogenous signaling by either leptin or amylin in the VTA is necessary for the normal control of food intake, thus highlighting the VTA as a potential neural locus mediating the amylin-leptin interaction. Experiments in this proposal will utilize novel approaches that combine behavioral, molecular, electrophysiological, electrochemical, neuropharmacological, genetic, and transgenic techniques to examine: [1] the neuronal and behavioral mechanisms mediating the role of endogenous VTA amylin receptor signaling in excessive feeding; [2] whether VTA amylin receptor signaling modulates NAc dopamine and NAc neural activity in response to food cues; [3] whether VTA processing mediates the food intake reducing interaction between amylin and leptin signaling. The research proposed will provide a novel framework for the development of more effective amylin-mediated treatment options for obesity."

"9276690","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Viruses are among the best-known and studied pathogens and infect virtually every living organism from bacteria to humans. As viruses are parasites of their hosts, the life cycle of any virus is inextricably tied to that of the host cell Despite this dependence, all viruses share a number of essential tasks that they must accomplish for survival. Most viruses must find and recognize a cell in which they can replicate, release their genome, generate new viral components and assemble them into precursors that mature into stable, progeny virions that are primed to be transmitted and infect a new host. These tasks are accomplished by viruses in different ways as a result of adaptation to different cellular environments. Each task involves interactions between components within the context of the whole virion and hence requires the visualization of the entire structure at which the techniques of cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryoEM), cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), and three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction ('cryo-reconstruction') excel. We will exploit these powerful tools to study a diverse set of viruses, including those that infect humans and other mammals, protozoa, insects, bacteria, and fungi. Numerous projects funded by the current grant have illustrated the structural response of different viruses to the common tasks of the viral life cycle. This proposal involves ongoing as well as new studies that focus on structural investigations of viruses and virus complexes and dynamic events that lie beyond the current realm of crystallographic technology. The large number and extent of our studies are made possible through several fruitful collaborations, which provide important correlative information such as from biochemical, genetic, and X-ray crystallographic experiments. Icosahedral and non-icosahedral and enveloped and non-enveloped viruses will be studied. These include representatives of several different virus families, all of which make excellent model systems for studying form and function: Iridoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Partitiviridae, Parvoviridae, Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, Tetraviridae, Togaviridae, and Totiviridae (and also some yet unclassified viruses). Specific examples include: three totiviruses and one partitivirus that infect protozoa, which in turn cause human disease (Tricomoniasis, Leishmaniasis, Giardiasis, and Cryptosporidiosis); several adeno-associated viruses being developed as gene delivery vectors; Sindbis virus, a BSL-2 select agent; recombinant, virus-like particles of several  human papillomavirus serotypes, which together cause >90% of cervical cancers; Sf6 bacteriophage, which infects Shigella flexneri that causes bacillary dysentery in humans; and many other insect and fungal viruses, including one that targets a fungus that infects plants and also causes human allergies. Lastly, the use of bacteriophage P22 capsids and polyheads as nano-particles for drug delivery will be investigated."

"9279118","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal of this research is to understand the complex interplay between transcription factors and epigenomic modification that regulates gene expression programs establishing and maintaining adipocyte cells. We recently identified the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and CAAT/enhancer binding protein ? (CEBP?) as critical transcriptional regulators that activate the adipogenic program by co occupying thousands of specific sites in the genome during early adipogenesis. We hypothesize that GRCEBP?bound regions, the majority of which are positioned far away from active genes, control transcription by forming long-range associations with core promoter elements occupied by the transcription initiation apparatus. Specific Aim 1 will identify GR and CEBP? direct gene targets and determinants of long-range chromatin interactions on a genome wide scale during mouse adipocyte cell differentiation. Preliminary results from chromatin interaction analysis by paired end tag sequencing (ChIAPET) demonstrate the feasibility of detecting long-range associations for CEBP? that globally link distal binding sites with regulated genes. Chromatin conformation capture (3C) validates a loop spanning 170 kilobases of DNA, suggesting that the ChIAPET data are robust and informative. Determinants of DNA looping will be examined by gain and loss of function studies targeting sequence specific factors and coregulator activities. Specific Aim 2 will identify on a genome wide scale the GR and CEBP? adipogenic targets that are conserved between human and mouse. Preliminary chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIPseq) results reveal that only a small minority of bound sites is shared in both species, and we hypothesize that comparison of the GR and CEBP? chromatin interactomes in human and mouse will uncover the direct transcriptional pathways driving adipocyte differentiation. This will be tested by performing ChIAPET for GR and CEBP? during adipocyte differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Specific Aim 3 will identify GR and CEBP? direct gene targets on a genomewide scale in mouse adipose and liver tissues. Preliminary ChIPseq results reveal extensive colocalization of GR and CEBP? in either adipose or liver, but only a minority of bound sites is shared in both tissues. We predict that comparison of the chromatin interactomes from adipose and liver tissues will reveal fundamental mechanisms controlling cell type specific gene expression by GR and CEBP? in vivo. As a whole, these studies use an innovative approach that will increase understanding of the development and function of adipose tissue, which normally benefits health, yet in excess as in obesity, is a strong risk for metabolic diseases including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and heart disease."
"9303190","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genes encoded by our DNA form the template for the RNA and proteins that make up our cells and tissues and allow them to carry out their normal functions. However, not all of our DNA is expressed simultaneously by every cell. Epigenetic regulation changes the packaging and handling of DNA, providing genetically identical cells the ability to produce dramatically different patterns of gene expression. It allow for cells and tissues to silence the genes they don't need, and activate the genes they do. Now, advances in sequencing technologies are revealing that epigenetic regulators are among the most frequently altered genes in cancer. In many cancers, these epigenetic regulators do not function properly, often as a result of mutations in their DNA sequence. Our group and others have identified Multiple Myeloma SET domain-containing protein (MMSET) as an important epigenetic regulator in cancer. In normal cells, MMSET modifies the packaging of DNA in specific chromosomal regions to activate expression of genes. However, in many cancers, changes in the MMSET gene result in increased production of MMSET, which can cause increased cell growth and is associated with poor patient prognosis. Recently, a hyperactive form of MMSET was detected in several cancers of lymphoid cells, including relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This hyperactive form is generated by a single mutation at position 1099 in the MMSET gene (MMSET E1099K). However, the biological function of MMSET E1099K in cancers is not fully understood. We hypothesize that the E1099K mutation leads to alterations in DNA packaging and handling, which results in changes in gene expression and in turn drives progression of lymphoid malignancies. We will test this hypothesis by examining the gene expression changes and biological consequences of the MMSET E1099K mutant in ALL and MCL cells and in mice. The mouse mutant will also help us learn how MMSET collaborates with other important drivers of cancer pathology. These studies will further our knowledge of lymphoid malignancy progression, as well as help us learn how to best design cancer therapies to target epigenetic dysregulation generated by MMSET E1099K."
"9314645","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Collateral blood flow plays a central role during acute ischemic stroke, and the presence of good collaterals has been linked to improved clinical and radiologi- cal outcome measures both with and without successful recanalization. Despite this, the only method to assess adequacy of collaterals currently is in- vasive and expensive, digital subtraction cerebral angiography (DSA). It would be tremendously beneficial if collaterals could be visualized using a tomo- graphic, non-invasive imaging based modality, so that early treatment deci- sions could incorporate this critical information. AIMS AND METHODS The overall goal of the imaging the Collaterals in Acute Stroke (iCAS) study, is to identify and quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) delivered via collateral routes using arterial spin labeling (ASL), a non-contrast MRI technique, and to determine its impact on ischemic lesion growth and patient outcome. We will perform a prospective, multi-center study of 180 acute stroke patients imaged in the 4.5-12 hr time window with large vessel occlusive stroke who are under consideration for endovascular thrombolytic therapy. We will add two ASL sequences to our rapid stroke protocol: pseudocontinuous ASL (pcASL, 2.5 min) for identifying collaterals and velocity-selective ASL (VS-ASL, 2.5 min) for measuring quantitative CBF independent of arterial arrival delay. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate equivalence between DSA and pcASL for collateral assessment, and determine the relationship between collateral and quantitative CBF using VS-ASL. Then, in Aim 2, we will determine whether ASL might be used to supplement or replace conventional bolus contrast PWI, determine the predictive ability of collateral assessment upon ischemic lesion growth, and evaluate how to incorporate collateral measurements into patient selection algorithms for endovascular therapy by examining the relationship between collaterals, revascularization, and patient outcome. SIGNIFICANCE We believe successful attainment of these aims will markedly improve acute stroke care by validating a non-invasive MRI-based method to assess both the presence of collaterals and the amount of CBF they deliver. iCAS will be the first prospective, multi-center study of ASL, a promising new non-contrast perfusion method, in acute stroke. In particular, the use of VS-ASL to obtain quantitative CBF measurements at serial timepoints in acute stroke will yield invaluable information on this critica hemodynamic parameter. It will provide a framework for incorporating collateral status into treatment decision-making, specifically by answering the question of whether patients with either very good or very poor collaterals benefit from recanalization. This study will lead to bettr understanding of the benefit of ASL measurements in patients with severe cerebrovascular disease and enhance the already significant diagnostic power of MRI in acute ischemic stroke."
"9378917","PROJECT SUMMARY The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose ?to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,? all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for ?Moffitt 3.0.? Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area ? notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond."
"9276632","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking's effects are different in men vs. women. Men experience greater reinforcement and reward from the nicotine whereas women tend to smoke for stress and affect regulation. Studies report that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is more effective for smoking cessation in men. Understanding sex- differences in the neurochemical mechanisms underlying treatment efficacy and smoking behavior will help drive gender-sensitive treatment development. Innovation: We will use PET imaging, a novel experiment that includes smoking in the scanner, and analysis that captures temporal information to detect sex-differences in the brain's dopamine (DA) response to smoking a cigarette. To date, PET imaging studies of smoking have been hampered by suboptimal experimental designs or inadequate models of the data. We fill the knowledge gap in design with high resolution scanning and high frequency motion correction. We fill the gap in analysis with our innovative model, lp- ntPET, that specifically accounts for short-lived and time-varying DA activation caused by smoking. Preliminary Findings: Thanks to our new methods, we recently discovered that men activate DA transmission in right ventral striatum when smoking but women do not. We also identified distinct areas in dorsal striatum where women activate DA faster than men while smoking. These preliminary data provide insight into the potential biological bases for established behavioral sex differences. Approach: Aims (1, 2): To examine large cohorts of men and women smoking in order to identify sex- differences in location, spatial extent, and timing of DA release due to smoking. Aim (3): To measure sex- differences in the effect of NRT for smoking cessation on the DA system. Aim (4): To examine the effect of Chantix on DA timing as an explanation of its unique mechanism of action. Further aims seek to relate the location and temporal patterns of DA release (generated by our novel methods) to individual behaviors during smoking (e.g., craving) and to clinical measures (e.g., dependence). In this way, we will uncover mechanisms of action of medications and establish new image-based, spatiotemporal biomarkers of addiction Key elements. PET will be conducted with the D2 antagonist tracer, 11C-raclopride. Smokers will smoke cigarettes inside a high-resolution brain scanner equipped with high-frequency head-motion detection. Smokers will be scanned after 1 week of medication (NRT or Chantix) and after 1 week of placebo control. All will be blinded and order will be randomized. lpntPET is a novel model for dynamic PET data, developed by the investigators, for capturing DA kinetics at the voxel level. The methods are novel but validated and uniquely suited to discover the neurochemical bases of sex-differences in response to smoking and medications for smoking cessation."
"9334046","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Adverse cardiovascular remodeling is particularly prevalent in elderly patients, resulting in poor quality of life and devastating consequences. In response to various physiological and pathological stressors, the cardiac and vascular systems remodel with changes in shape and function that progressively lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes1. At the cellular level, this pathological remodeling is initiated and sustained by abnormalities in intracellular signaling pathways especially those controlled by calcium (Ca2+)2. Recent studies from both our laboratories have identified a new source of Ca2+ entry in cardiovascular myocytes (i.e., cardiac myocytes; CMs and vascular smooth muscle cells; VSMCs)3-5. This source is controlled by a complex composed of STromal Interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1), a Ca2+ sensor mainly expressed at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, which interacts with and activates a new family of Ca2+ selective plasma membrane (PM) channels, the Orai family (Orai1 through 3). The STIM1/Orai1-3 signaling paradigm can either form: i) PM Ca2+ channels activated by ER Ca2+ store depletion (Orai1 homomers) termed Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, or ii) store-independent Ca2+ channels activated from the cytosolic side by the arachidonate metabolite, leukotrieneC4 (LTC4) and mediated by heteromultimers of Orai1 and Orai3 (named LRC for LTC4-regulated Ca2+)3-7. In different cellular and animal models of cardiac and vascular disorders, we have demonstrated the emergence of the STIM/Orai-mediated Ca2+ signaling that specifically couples to gene transcription and underlies phenotypic changes associated with cardiac and vascular remodeling (i.e. CM growth - cardiac hypertrophy and VSMC proliferation - vascular stenosis respectively)3-5. The targeted manipulation of this local calcium source prevents adverse cardiac and vascular remodeling thus offering new therapeutic perspectives3-5. The goal of this project is the characterization of the molecular processes that are specifically controlled by the different elements of the STIM1/Orai complex in the cardiovascular system. Our recent data indicate that along with Orai1, Orai3, which is exclusive to mammals, is a key component of the STIM1-dependent store- independent Ca2+ selective currents that emerge in pathological cardiovascular myocytes. We thus hypothesize that Orai3 channels more specifically regulate key pathways and gene networks that are activated during cardiovascular remodeling in order to promote cell growth, proliferation and survival. We propose to compare the transcriptional signature of isolated cardiovascular myocytes (i.e., cardiac myocytes and arterial smooth muscle cells) from Stim1 and Orai3 tissue-specific knockout mice and from wild-type mice under normal and pathological conditions of cardiac and vessel remodeling. Together, these exploratory results will support Orai3 targeting in age-related cardiovascular remodeling."
"9487564","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metabotropic Glutamate receptors (mGluRs) belong to the Family C of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and critically regulates neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity through recognition of the amino acid and excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Many disorders of the CNS have been linked to alterations in neuronal excitability via the glutamatergic system. Accordingly, mGluRs have been the subject of an enormous drug discovery effort as they represent major therapeutic targets for treating numerous physiological dysfunctions and for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. Apart from the prototypical seven transmembrane helix (7TM) domain, mGluRs also include a large extracellular venus fly trap' (VFT) domain that constitutes the glutamate binding site and a cysteine rich domain (CRD) that links the VFT to the 7TM. Binding of glutamate to the extracellular VFT domain triggers a large conformational change in the VFT domains from an open to a closed conformation. This clam-shell like closure of the extracellular domain results in receptor engagement and activation of G-proteins on the intracellular side of the transmembrane domain. Receptor activated G proteins then act to either enhance or repress secondary messenger signaling cascades. Despite intensive efforts, the mechanism of allosteric communication across the cell membrane by the mGluRs remains enigmatic due to the lack of structural information on full- length proteins. Here we propose to apply single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) visualization in order to characterize the structure of mGluR5 and mGluR2 in activated and inactivated states and also in complex with their cognate G-proteins. The obtained structures will be used for molecular dynamics simulations aiming to unravel the molecular basis for conformational transitions coupled to signal instigation or silencing. Given that mGluRs are important drug targets for several CNS conditions including Parkinson's disease, Fragile X syndrome/autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, cognition, addiction, depression, anxiety and pain, the results obtained will have profound biomedical interest and will form the basis for the design of novel therapeutic strategies against neurological disorders."
"9325386","ABSTRACT Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group?s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD."
"9376638","PROJECT SUMMARY  Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of population worldwide. Exogenous insulin treatment is the standard of care for T1D, but often negatively affects the quality of life and is ineffective in preventing recurrent hyperglycemia episodes and chronic complications. Recent studies show that human islet allografts can restore long-term normoglycemia and insulin independence, protect from severe hypoglycemia, and slow progression of microvascular lesions in immunosuppressed T1D patients. However, immune rejection and continuous use of immunosuppression to control rejection are two major limitations of clinical islet transplantation. Standard immunosuppression is ineffective in achieving long-term graft survival and also has significant adverse effects on the graft and graft recipients. Therefore, the development of novel approaches to prevent rejection of islet grafts without chronic immunosuppression is a significant goal.  Allogeneic islets are subject to rejection by both alloreactive and autoreactive T effector (Teff) cells. An imbalance in the frequency of pathogenic Teff and protective T regulatory (Treg) cells is the underlying cause of T1D and allogeneic islet graft rejection. Restoring the physiological Teff and Treg balance has significant therapeutic potential. Approaches attempting to tilt the balance in favor of Treg cells have so far targeted either Teff or Treg cells individually for modulation with limited success. The primary goal of this application is to target both cell types simultaneously for modulation for an outcome in favor of Treg cell expansion. This will be achieved using innovative polyethylene glycol hydrogel particle platforms for graft-targeted delivery and controlled presentation of two novel biologics serving as agonists of Fas and IL-2R receptors. Teff cells activated by antigens express Fas receptor and become sensitive to FasL-mediated apoptosis. IL-2R signaling preferentially sensitizes Teff cells to Fas-induced apoptosis and is also required for Treg cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) generation, expansion, and survival. Therefore, we hypothesize that the combined use of agonists of Fas and IL-2R will preferentially eliminate Teff cells and generate/expand Treg cells within the graft microenvironment, resulting in induced-immune privilege and sustained survival and function of islet allograft in the absence of any immunosuppression. A set of preliminary data support this hypothesis and provide strong scientific premise and feasibility for this application. This concept will be tested in three different allogeneic islet transplantation settings for efficacy and mechanisms; chemically diabetic BALB/c-to- C57BL/6 mice, spontaneously diabetic C57BL/6-to-NOD mice, and human islets into humanized mice. These models will generate critical data relevant to the human setting. Furthermore, proof-of-efficacy and the elucidation of the immune mechanisms regulating effective outcomes will expedite further refinement of this immunomodulatory concept and its eventual translation to nonhuman primates as a prelude to clinical trials for the treatment of type 1 diabetes."
"9274974","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AIDS-related human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) retinitis causes vision loss and blindness in HIV-immuno- suppressed patients who do not have access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) or who fail to adhere to or respond to cART. AIDS-related HCMV retinitis therefore remains a significant ophthalmologic problem worldwide. A critical barrier to progress in advancing our ability to diagnose, prevent, and/or treat AIDS- related HCMV retinitis is an absence of an understanding of the mechanisms by which HCMV, a human ?? herpesvirus, causes retinal tissue destruction during onset and progression of AIDS-related HCMV retinitis. Our goal is to address the problem of AIDS-related HCMV retinitis and the critical barrier to progress by obtaining the information needed to establish the relative role of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), SOCS3, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in the pathogenesis of AIDS-related HCMV retinitis. Our central hypothesis is that SOCS1, SOCS3, necroptosis, and pyroptosis individually conspire via different mechanisms to contribute collectively to retinal tissue destruction during the pathogenesis of AIDS-related HCMV retinitis. Our objectives are to use a well-established and clinically relevant animal model of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) retinitis in mice with retrovirus-induced immunosuppression (MAIDS) coupled with in vitro cell culture approaches to (1) obtain the information needed to understand the mechanisms by which SOCS1, SOCS3, necroptosis, and pyroptosis contribute to retinal tissue destruction during evolution of MAIDS-related MCMV retinitis, and (2) use this information to demonstrate that these mechanisms of retinal tissue destruction also operate during AIDS-related HCMV retinitis. These objectives will be met through successful completion of three Specific Aims: (1) test the hypothesis that SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MAIDS-related MCMV retinitis, (2) test the hypothesis that necroptosis and pyroptosis play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MAIDS-related MCMV retinitis, and (3) test the hypothesis that HCMV stimulates SOCS1, SOCS3, necroptosis, and pyroptosis during AIDS-related HCMV retinitis. Our expected outcomes will include establishing that (1) MCMV promotes retinal tissue destruction through intraocular stimulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins that interfere with the JAK/STAT pathway and/or toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling to dampen antiviral Type I ??? interferon (IFN) production, (2) MCMV promotes retinal tissue destruction through intraocular stimulation of multiple cell death pathways that include necroptosis and pyroptosis as well as apoptosis, and (3) HCMV promotes retinal tissue destruction during AIDS-related HCMV retinitis via SOCS1, SOCS3, necroptosis, and pyroptosis mechanisms. The impact on the field of AIDS-related HCMV retinitis research will include new information that could directly or indirectly lead to novel therapeutic approaches for management of AIDS-related HCMV retinitis as well as other retinal diseases of herpesvirus origin."

"9355254","Project Summary/Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the region of the globus pallidus (GP) or subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been demonstrated to provide clinically meaningful improvements in motor function and improve patient quality of life in people with Parkinson?s disease (PD). While the STN is the typical target of choice at most neurosurgical centers, there has been a resurgence of interest in selecting the GP as a target. This interest is based on evidence that the overall clinical effects are comparable to those of STN DBS, but GP DBS may have fewer neuropsychological side-effects and affords greater flexibility for programming and adjustment of medications. Yet, there is considerable variability in response to GP DBS across patients, levodopa dose typically remains high, and, like STN DBS, is it ineffective for levodopa-resistant motor features such as postural instability, gait disturbances and freezing of gait. We argue that significant improvements in the efficacy of GP DBS can be gained through an increased understanding of the mechanisms, locations and pathways mediating the motor effects of DBS in the human pallidum. The premise of this project is that the motor effects of conventional GP DBS are compromised by a balance between the need to suppress levodopa-induced dyskinesias (akinetic) and reduce bradykinesia (prokinetic). We will test the hypothesis that the mechanisms and locations mediating these ?opposite effects? are in functionally and topographically separate regions of the GP. This hypothesis will be tested by conducting a systematic study of the effects of GP stimulation location on both levodopa- responsive (rigidity and bradykinesia) and levodopa-resistant (balance, gait, freezing) motor features of PD (Aim 2), and the topography of movement-related oscillatory activity within the pallidum (GPi and GPe) and STN by recording local field potentials in people with chronically implanted electrodes (Aim 3). State-of-the-art high-field MRI (7T) and patient-specific tractography-activation models will be used to focus stimulation to the region of interest (ventral GPi, dorsal GPi, ventral GPe) and estimate the pallidofugal pathways activated by stimulation (Aim 1). The results of these experiments will provide critical information about the stimulation location and axonal pathways mediating improvement or deterioration of motor signs with GP DBS, the neurophysiological biomarkers of disordered movement, and how these biomarkers are changed by medication and DBS. This knowledge can be translated to the next generation of DBS devices that provide current steering and closed-loop control to provide optimal therapeutic outcomes."
"9280933","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metabolic syndrome has become a global epidemic that dramatically increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Brown fat plays an important role in the defense against cold and contributes to whole body energy balance. To date, the metabolic action of brown fat has been primarily attributed to its unique ability to stimulate uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. Secreted factors exert diverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues and the maintenance of systemic energy homeostasis. Adipose tissue hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin, gut-derived fibroblast growth factors, and myokines sense nutrient status and coordinate key aspects of cellular metabolism. Whether brown adipocytes engage other metabolic tissues through secreted factors to regulate nutrient and energy metabolism in the body is unknown. In preliminary studies, we identified a novel brown fat-enriched secreted factor that is highly inducible during brown adipocyte differentiation. Using gain and loss of function mouse models, we established that this brown adipokine regulates whole body glucose and lipid metabolism. In this proposal, we will test our central hypothesis that brown fat secreted factors play a central role in metabolic crosstalk. In Aim 1, we plan to define the role of brown adipokine in metabolic adaptation during thermogenesis and in obesity. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the mechanisms underlying the metabolic action of this secreted factor. In Aim 3, we will assess the extent to which elevated adipokine expression protects mice from diet-induced metabolic derangements. Our proposed work will provide insights into a previously unrecognized role of brown fat in endocrine signaling and generate critical preclinical data for future therapeutic development."
"9274824","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Despite uncertainty in the Department of Defense (DOD) ''plume'' model assumptions of sarin (GB; o-isopropyl methylphosphonoflouridate) and cyclosarin (GF; cyclohexyl methylphosphonoflouridate) exposure following the destruction of an Iraqi munitions storage complex at Khamisiyah, Iraq during the first Gulf War (GW), we and others have found evidence of brain atrophy in three separate cohorts of GW veterans with suspected exposure at 8-19 years after the incident.[1-3] We believe this makes it the most replicated biological finding in GW veterans to date and worthy of additional research. However, the combined total number of GW veterans with suspected exposure in the past studies (N=130) represents only a tiny fraction of the more than 100,000 GW veterans with suspected GB/GF exposure. Therefore, it is important to confirm and extend the findings of structural and functional brain changes in a larger, non-overlapping sample of GB/GF exposed GW veterans. The goal of this study is to replicate and extend our previous findings of brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in a new sample of 150 GB/GF exposed relative to a new sample of 150 matched non-GB/GF exposed GW veterans. The first aim is to replicate our previous findings of reduced brain volume in GB/GF exposed veterans. Aim 2 will expand our previous finding of hippocampal atrophy in GB/GF exposed veterans by examining the effect of GB/GF exposure on hippocampal subfields. Aim 3 will expand our previous finding of reduced total brain white matter volume in GB/GF-exposed veterans by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine the effects of GB/GF exposure on white matter microstructure integrity. Aim 4 will replicate and extend our previous finding of impaired cognitive function (i.e., attention and memory) in GB/GF exposed GW veterans. Exploratory analyses will: 1) examine the relationship between estimated cumulative GB/GF exposure levels, based on the DOD reanalysis of the 2000 plume models using improved meteorological modeling and more accurate estimates of the total number of GB/GF-containing rockets destroyed with measures of brain and hippocampal subfield volumes, DTI indices, and cognitive performance; 2) assess potential differences in wartime experiences between exposed and non-exposed groups using Dr. Lea Steele's Kansas Gulf War Military and Health Questionnaire [4,5] and the relationship between these wartime experiences with measures of brain and hippocampal subfield volumes, DTI values, and cognitive performance. The exposed and unexposed GW veterans will be a priori matched for age, sex, and Gulf War Illness status. We will account for other potentially confounding variables such as years of education, posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptom severity, smoking, alcohol and non-alcohol substance use, apolipoprotein ? 4 genotype, and for analyses of brain volume, intracranial volume as covariates in the statistical analyses. Evidence suggests that reduced brain volume and impaired cognitive function may increase vulnerability to the pathological effects of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, if we find confirmatory evidence of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in yet another cohort of GB/GF exposed GW veterans, this could have implications for the VA to employ non-pharmacological, and pharmacological, when they become available, dementia preventive measures in the treatment of GW veterans with suspected GB/GF exposure as these veterans approach old age."
"9306987","Abstract Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a chronic, debilitating pain condition that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Our research group has demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in reducing functional disability in adolescents with JFM. However, in order to achieve stronger and clinically meaningful improvement in functional disability and reduce pain, changing sedentary behavior and increasing engagement in moderate-vigorous physical activity is a crucial component of JFM pain management. Incorporation of physical exercise has emerged as a logical next step to enhance CBT, yet regular participation in any physical activity is difficult to initiate and maintain in JFM patients. Our multidisciplinary team of experts in Behavioral Medicine, Rheumatology, Exercise Science and Pain Medicine have developed a novel intervention - the Fibromyalgia Integrative Training program for Teens (FIT Teens), which enhances established CBT techniques with specialized neuromuscular exercise training derived from evidence-based pediatric injury prevention research. Innovative features include 1) progressive neuromuscular training designed to limit delayed-onset muscle soreness; and 2) seamless integration with CBT to enhance psychological coping skills and decrease fear of movement. Our pilot work shows that this intensive group-based 8-week (16-session) intervention is safe, produces excellent patient engagement, has no adverse effects, reduces fear of movement and has a greater impact on pain-related disability than CBT alone. Moreover, these improvements are accompanied objective improvements in strength and movement competence documented via sophisticated 3-D motion capture technology ? indicating greater capacity for safely engaging in physical exercise. This treatment approach is extremely promising in its wide ranging impact on treatment of JFM as well as other chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions in children. In this U01, we propose a rigorous 3-arm multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test whether the FIT Teens intervention is more effective in reducing disability than CBT alone or graded aerobic exercise alone at the 3-month primary endpoint and whether treatment effects are sustained over 1 year. We will also explore how changes in coping, fear of movement, and objectively measured physical activity, movement competence and physical fitness predict changes in outcomes. The proposed RCT will be the largest (N=420) and most rigorous trial in JFM to date which necessitates a multi-site study with multi-disciplinary collaborators whose complementary expertise ensures success in accomplishing the study aims. Supported by a U34 planning agreement, we have established a robust RCT infrastructure with a central Data Coordinating Center and seven clinical sites, accomplished key administrative and regulatory milestones, completed feasibility assessment and developed standardized protocols for a streamlined transition to a U01 clinical trial. The planned project will provide clear direction for the best clinical care for JFM patients as well as the largest registry of well-characterized JFM patients for potential ancillary projects focused to investigate the pathophysiology of JFM."

We will do this using florbetapir F18, which is a test for amyloid which has approval by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we evaluate the functional changes in the brain associated with the transition from the asymptomatic (preclinical) stages of AD into the symptomatic stage of AD dementia. We also use MRI to evaluate the brain?s structure, looking at grey matter atrophy with volumetric MRI, and investigate the changes in white matter using a new technique, diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI). In collaboration with Project 4, in Aim 1, we will generate unique brain maps for each imaging test, in each stage of AD, as people move from an asymptomatic state into AD dementia. In Aim 2, we will then examine these maps in relation to one another, to develop an integrated timeline for the imaging changes which occur during the transition from asymptomatic and symptomatic AD. We will then use these maps as a way to predict the stage of the disease in specific individuals ? in other words, to predict how long it would be before someone developed dementia. This mapping and predictive information is critical for the development of new drugs for AD and for the appropriate design of clinical trials in the future."
"9293282","Project Summary/Abstract The Human Airway Cell and Assays Core provides in vitro models of well-differentiated, primary cultures of human airway epithelia for translational, pre-clinical assays of small molecules and target protein manipulations to judge their efficacy for improving the density and/or activity of WT and mutant CFTRs. These services have an outstanding record of promoting translational assessments of CF pathogenesis and therapy, and they support numerous funded research projects both within and outside the CF Research Center. The overall hypothesis driving these efforts is that impaired ion transport due to missing or defective CFTR compromises the volume and composition of the airway surface liquid (ASL), impeding mucociliary clearance, and leading to infection, inflammation and bronchiectasis. Core A is focused on the production of polarized cultures of human bronchial (HBE) and nasal (HNE) epithelia from CF, non-CF and non-diseased lungs. Studies of channel function, biogenesis and drug-mediated mutant protein correction, performed in polarized HBE cells, are predictive of clinical outcome in the pipeline of therapeutic strategies. This resource supports a large number of funded projects. New methods have markedly increased the Core's capacity to generate air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, so that HBE availability is no longer rate-limiting. Patient genotype is correlated with CFTR function and drug- induced changes in ion transport. A more directed approach with nasal cells allows for similar analyses on a broader set of rarer genotypes, as embodied in the CFTR2 project. These models are used by P30 investigators who seek to evaluate CFTR biogenesis, the regulation of CFTR and ENaC channels, other relevant transporters, the mechanisms that regulate ASL volume and composition, inflammatory mechanisms arising from airway infections, and treatments to correct CF defects. To support mechanistic evaluations of CF pathogenesis and pre-clinical therapeutics, the Core performs ASL composition, transport and trafficking assays in collaboration with Center members. The interface of HBE and HNE cultures with physiological assays optimizes the use of primary airway cells by Center investigators and for outside academic and industrial interactions. This Core has provided cells, differentiated HBE and assays for numerous studies of new therapeutics. With ion transport as the core defect in CF airways, the successful pharmacological manipulation of channel biogenesis, stability and function, when performed in polarized HBE cells, establishes the translational efficacy dataset needed for advancing a therapeutic strategy to clinical trials."
"9293287","ABSTRACT Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common recessive disease among Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride ion channel. Ninety percent of CF patients carry at least one copy of the ?F508 allele. Recent studies have shown that two small molecules, the folding corrector VX-809 and the potentiator VX-770, act in combination and partially restore ?F508-CFTR ion channel function in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. However, these compounds are only marginally effective for patients with the ?F508 mutation. A key limitation is that most CF patients produce high levels of Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-?1. Our published work showed that clinically relevant levels of TGF-?1 repress ?F508-CFTR transcription in HBE cells, acting upstream of modulators to block rescue of ?F508-CFTR. High TGF-?1 levels also prime CF patients for inflammation, epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and fibrosis. TGF-?1 initiates signal transduction by stimulating the constitutively active TGF-?1 receptor (T?R)-II to interact with and phosphorylate T?R-I at the plasma membrane. By contrast, Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) protects T?R-I from constitutive activation by T?R-II in non-stimulated cells. It is unknown how TGF-?1 blocks PP1 interaction with T?R-I to activate signaling. Our preliminary work in HBE cells indicates that the scaffold organized by Lemur Tyrosine Kinase (LMTK2) at the basolateral plasma membrane favors TGF-?1 signaling by inactivating the catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1C), thus allowing activation of T?R-I and signal transduction. Moreover, our data indicate that activating PP1C blocks TGF-?1 signaling in HBE cells. Our central hypothesis is that TGF-?1 stabilizes the LMTK2 scaffold to activate signaling leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and transcriptional repression of ?F508- CFTR in HBE cells. In so doing, LMTK2 allows TGF-?1 to antagonize ?F508-CFTR protein rescue by small molecules, and worsens outcomes. Targeting the LMTK2 scaffold thus represents a novel therapeutic strategy for CF to control TGF-?1 signaling, attenuate inflammation and fibrosis, and facilitate rescue of ?F508-CFTR in HBE cells. In Aim 1 we will examine TGF-?1 effects on the protein-protein interactions between T?R-I, LMTK2, and PP1C in HBE cells. In Aim 2, we will test whether TGF-?1 recruits and/or activates LMTK2 at the basolateral plasma membrane in HBE cells. In Aim 3, we will elucidate whether TGF-?1 signaling can be attenuated by blocking LMTK2 inactivation of PP1C in HBE cells. We will use state-of-the-art research tools. Because TGF-?1 signaling is cell-type and cell-context dependent we will use HBE cells expressing ?F508- CFTR, which exhibit many of the characteristics associated with CF airway disease in vivo and are an ideal model for pre-clinical experimentation. We anticipate that our studies will lead to novel therapy targeting excessive TGF-?1 signaling triggered by high TGF-?1 levels present in most CF patients, to preserve airway integrity, and to allow small molecules to restore the ?F508-CFTR function."
"9266211","To fulfill the new NCATS vision for the CTSA Consortium and accelerate scientific discoveries into improved outcomes for patients, academic health and science systems must invest, transform, and innovate to optimize their unique strengths. Our vision, aligned with that of NCATS, is to create a research environment at Duke that stimulates the translation of scientific discovery from bench to bedside by 1) linking discovery science to a creative engine that efficiently accelerates development of new technologies; and 2) integrating clinical trials, registries, and electronic health records in a learning health system where research and practice form a continuum. Our research environment will be driven by scientific merit and societal need, agnostic to disease or specialty discipline, aligned with our updated institutional framework for research oversight and quality, and continually evaluated for academic productivity, efficiency, and cost. To achieve these goals, we will create an Integrated Home for clinical and translational research by providing infrastructure and resources to serve investigators and trainees across the research spectrum. We will offer resources based upon common needs among our researchers, including education, biostatistics, biobanking, regulatory expertise, ethics, pilot funding and recruitment assistance. We will also tailor our offerings to specialized needs across research communities that include early translation, proof of concept, site-based research and population based research, which includes multi-site trials, outcomes, health services, implementation science and community engaged research. Integrating these resources will require a new tool, a portal for all trainees and investigators, MyResearchHome(@Duke, and its human counterpart, MyResearchTeam@Duke. These tools will provide a single point of entry for all clinical and translational research at Duke, regardless of their department or school. Thus, we will enhance our Integrated Home for clinical and translational research with a combination of sophisticated information technology and mentoring and navigation; provide access to common and specialized resources for all of our translational research communities and train the next generation of researchers in our educational and training programs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The CTSA will foster the translational research process, ensuring that new discoveries are developed and evaluated more quickly and that clinical research is done with high quality, efficiency, safety and cost- effectiveness."
"9294119","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem that affects 10% of Americans, increases morbidity and mortality, and imposes a huge economic burden. Persistent renal tubular injury is an important component of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF), the common feature of progressive CKD of any etiology. Growth factors such as transforming growth factor-? (TGF??) are important determinants of how tubula epithelia respond to injury. Although excessive TGF-? signaling promotes TIF, blocking TGF-??using genetic tools results in increased tubular damage after mouse models of CKD, suggesting that TGF-??signaling has protective effects as well. TGF-??mediates many differet cellular effects including G1 arrest of cell cycle progression and epithelial de-differentiation. Tis proposal tests the hypothesis that TGF???signaling in the proximal tubule promotes survival ater chronic renal injury by inducing cell cycle arrest and epithelial de- differentiation. The first ai investigates how TGF-? alters cell cycle progression and how these changes affect epithelial survival using murine models of injury and pharmacologic inducers of G1 arrest. To test this, we will use genetically modified mice that lack the TGF?? receptor (T?RII) specifically in the proximal tubule and induce chronic kidney injury by either angiotensin/ uninephrectomy or aristolochic acid. We anticipate that mice lacking T?RII have impaired G1 arrest and reduced epithelial survival after injury and that this improves with administration of palbociclib, an FDA-approved inducer of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Proximal tubule cells with and without T?RII in vitro will be used to understand the signaling pathways through which TGF-? induces cell cycle arrest. The second aim explores mechanisms whereby TGF????lters epithelial differentiation nd how these changes impact survival. The role of epithelial differentiation in chronic kidney injury will be defined using mice with epithelial-specific deletion of Snail, a key transcription factor downstream of TGF-?? Proximal tubule cells with and without T?RII will be transfected with siRNA and constructs in vitro to test the hypothesis that Snail mediates TGF-?-dependent de-differentiation. The third aim defines how the Wnt/?-catenin pathway, important in renal injury, interacts with TGF-? to affect epithelial survival. Genetic models and cell culture techniques wil be used to test the hypothesis that TGF-? increases canonical Wnt/??catenin signaling to improve epithelial survival through increased de-differentiation and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. This proposal uses innovative genetic approaches and a new strategy for analyzing injury in a quantitative and location-specific way. These studies will provide valuable insights into the roles  of cell cycle and epithelial plasticity in the epithelial response to CKD, focusing on the proximal  tubule which is the target of acute kidney injury and a mediator of CKD. However, information about cell cycle, epithelial plasticity and response to chronic injury has implications beyond the kidney as most organ dysfunction results from chronic epithelial injury."
"9319749","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The first two years of life are increasingly recognized as a critical period for the development of obesity. Prior studies demonstrate the importance of parents in shaping this risk with particular emphasis on associations between maternal responsive feeding (i.e., higher responsiveness to child hunger and satiety cues and fewer assertive prompts to eat) and lower child BMI. However, research to date has been primarily cross-sectional, based on parent-report, and done almost exclusively in preschoolers or older children; longitudinal studies of mothers and toddlers that assess objective measures of responsive feeding within the context of antecedent and concurrent factors, are needed to better understand factors that promote responsive feeding and reduce long-term child obesity risk. We propose to enroll 156 mother-toddler dyads into a prospective study of feeding interactions and obesity risk, with assessments at 18, 24, and 36 months, in order to achieve the following aims: 1) understand factors related prospectively to responsive feeding between mothers and toddlers at 18 months; 2) determine whether responsive feeding at 18 and 24 months predicts change in zBMI and adiposity from 18-36 months; and 3) explore which factors are most strongly predictive of child zBMI change from birth to 36 months. Responsive feeding will be assessed with two home-based meal observations at both 18 and 24 months (total of 4). At these time points, mothers and toddlers will wear accelerometers to assess physical activity and sleep, and mothers will also complete three 24-hour dietary recalls of their own and their toddler's intake, and measures assessing additional maternal (e.g., perceptions of feeding practices and styles, dietary restraint) and toddler (e.g., temperament, appetite) factors that could influence maternal responsiveness and toddler obesity risk. Mothers' and toddlers' heights, weights and circumference/skinfolds will be measured at 18, 24, and 36 months. We propose to recruit participants from Healthy Beginnings (HB), an NHLBI-funded, two site randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a multi-component behavioral intervention in reducing risk of excessive weight gain during pregnancy. Half of HB participants were randomized to an intervention designed to reduce pregnancy weight gain, providing a unique opportunity to examine long-term effects on all of the above-noted study aims. HB also provides a unique opportunity to cost-effectively conduct this longitudinal study: participants are already being enrolled in HB; all are overweight or obese and 42 percent are Latina (important risk factors for child obesity); relevant assessments of women in HB occur at study entry (<16 weeks gestation), 22-24 weeks and 35 weeks gestation, and mothers and infants at delivery, 6 and 12 months. HB ends when infants are 12 months old. Extending follow-up through 36 months will enable understanding of longitudinal associations between early life influences on responsive feeding during toddlerhood, and prospective associations between responsive feeding and obesity risk. Findings will have important implications for preventive interventions during this important and understudied developmental period."
"9398501","Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually worldwide. Currently available oral cholera vaccines (OCV) achieve a lower efficacy and duration of protection in young children compared to that seen in older children and adults, possibly due to the inability of young children to mount polysaccharide-specific antibody responses. We have recently reported that mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are activated in cholera and are associated with higher class-switched V. cholerae polysaccharide-specific antibody responses. In pilot studies, we have identified a subset of MAIT cells that express genes associated with B cell help. Additionally, in preliminary in vitro experiments, we show that MAIT cells can induce B cells to differentiate and produce antibodies. Thus, we hypothesize that a subset of MAIT cells, when activated following infection or vaccination, undergo clonal expansion and provide help to B cells through MR1-dependent and -independent interactions to enhance polysaccharide-specific antibody production. In collaboration with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), we propose to determine the role that MAIT cells play in the adaptive response against V. cholerae infection and vaccination. In Aim 1, we will characterize the clonal expansions of MAIT cells during human V. cholerae infection and oral cholera vaccination. We will test the hypothesis that there is a subset of MAIT cells that express factors consistent with B cell help, and that this subset has lower activation and expansion in young child vaccinees compared to older child vaccinees and infected young children. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms through which MAIT cells affect B cell differentiation and antibody production. We will test the hypotheses that MAIT cells provide help to B cells through both MR1-dependent and MR1- independent (cytokine-mediated) interactions with B cells, and that MAIT cells of young children have deficits in one or more of these mechanisms compared to MAIT cells in older children. At the completion of these studies, we will have gained new information on the capacity of MAIT cells to impact polysaccharide-specific antibody responses, which are associated with protection against cholera. This information has the potential to critically inform the development of better vaccine strategies targeted at preventing cholera and other enteric infections in young children."
"9354276","OVERALL ? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Age related diseases causing dementia are an increasing global, social and economic catastrophe that mandates broad and aggressive research. Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects over 5 million people in the US alone. Vascular contributions to dementia and AD are increasingly recognized. However, the role of the cerebrovascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD, and the underlying neurovascular mechanisms remain, to date, largely unknown and under- researched, representing a critical barrier in the field. The overall goals of this program are to advance current knowledge on the vascular contributions to dementia and AD, and establish whether the neurovasculature plays a major role in cognitive decline, and therefore is a key new therapeutic target to treat dementia and AD. This is a program project application with multiple projects, cores, institutions and investigators. It represents an integrated whole far greater than the sum of its parts. Each project and core complements the others so that a synergistic relationship among them is achieved with a common focus on goals of the program, namely to test the neurovascular hypothesis of AD. This hypothesis holds that cerebrovascular dysfunction and disruption in the neurovascular integrity underlies and contributes to the onset and progression of cognitive decline. We have enlisted established clinical and translational research groups that collectively bring significant expertise in all aspects of the research plan and each have contributed productively over many years to the study of dementia and AD. To test the ?neurovascular hypothesis?, the participating investigators will apply cutting-edge molecular and imaging methods. We will perform parallel studies with analogous measures in humans and rats in two AD genetic risk groups with the major genetic risk factors for late-onset AD, i.e., apolipoprotein E-?4 (APOE4) gene and early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), i.e., presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations that both develop early vascular dysfunction and significant cerebrovascular pathology, and in the rat model of AD (line TgF344-AD) that faithfully recapitulates the rich clinico-pathological spectrum of human AD including the presence of early vascular dysfunction and cerebrovascular pathology. Central to our approach is our commitment to take a new research direction with the overarching goal to provide an answer to the broader question; ?what is the role of the vascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD?, and ?what is the prognostic and diagnostic value of neurovascular molecular and imaging biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline?. The relationship between neurovascular integrity, brain connectivity and cognitive function has not been explored. The collective expertise of the investigators, overall environment, preliminary results, and experimental design for each of the projects and supporting cores hold tremendous promise for the success of this program. We are confident that the proposed studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of pathogenesis, treatment, and early prevention of dementia and AD."
"9250765","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the US, and podocyte injury is an important feature of DKD. However, mechanisms of podocytopenia in DKD are poorly understood. Podocyte apoptosis and activation of RhoA are observed in immortalized human podocytes exposed to the sera of patients with T1D or T2D and DKD in conjunction with cholesterol accumulation and can be prevented by cyclodextrin (CD), an oligosaccharide that removes cholesterol from cells and that protects diabetic mice from the development of proteinuria. Excessive glomerular cholesterol deposition has been described in clinical and experimental DKD, is associated with impaired cholesterol efflux as suggested by the down-regulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) expression, and can be induced by TNFa. The relative contribution of free and esterifed cholesterol to podocyte injury is unknown. Our long-term goal is to develop therapeutic strategies that target podocyte cholesterol accumulation in DKD. We hypothesize that: 1) TNFa-mediated downregulation of ABCA1 in podocytes results in accumulation of cholesterol; 2) accumulation of esterified cholesterol in early DKD causes podocyte hypertrophy while free cholesterol in late DKD causes podocyte apoptosis; 3) therapeutic strategies that reduce intracellular cholesterol accumulation protect podocytes in DKD. In order to test these hypotheses, we will utilize genetically modified mouse models, NIH approved models of DKD and in vitro experiment in human podocytes with the aim to: 1-Determine if ABCA1 deficiency in podocytes worsens podocyte injury and proteinuria in DKD. 2-Determine the relative contribution of free and esterified cholesterol to podocyte injury. 3-Determine if podocytopenia in DKD can be prevented by podocyte depletion of free cholesterol with CD and/or ABCA1 inducers. This proposal is innovative as the role of intracellular free and esterified cholesterol n the pathogenesis of podocyte injury in DKD has never been explored. In order to match innovation with adequate expertise, we have assembled a unique team of investigators that includes podocyte biologists, lipid biologists, pathologists, nephrologists and endocrinologists. We aim to advance the knowledge related to DKD by uncovering novel disease mechanisms amenable to therapeutic intervention."
"9494981","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to continue our aging-related research training efforts on both the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (UC-AMC) and the University of Colorado-Boulder Campus (UC-B). The focus of this second renewal of our 5-year training grant will be expanded to reflect the new title Integrative Physiology of Aging. As with the past 2 funding cycles, the major participating programs will be the Division of Geriatric Medicine (DGM) and the Center for Human Nutrition (CHN) at UC-AMC, and the Department of Integrative Physiology (IPHY) at UC-B. However, the expanded focus will enable us to involve additional outstanding aging-related investigators from our 2 campuses as additional mentors on this T32. Of the 52 training grants at the University of Colorado, this is the only one specifically dedicated to aging issues. Because of our success during our last 9 years of funding and our expectations for wider faculty participation, we are now requesting support for 5 pre- and 5 post-doctoral trainees each year. The specific objectives of this training program are to: 1) expand the cohort of faculty mentors interested in aging research; 2) recruit and retain outstanding pre- (Ph.D.) and post-doctoral (Ph.D. and M.D.) trainees; 3) support their research training through a combination of experiential and didactic instruction; 4) insure the highest level of academic success through the conscientious monitoring of a carefully constructed career development plan; 5) enhance the mentoring skills of a cadre of associate mentors through co-mentoring with a more experienced primary mentor. These objective will be carried out by offering: 1) up to 2 years of research training support (the second years dependent upon successful progress); 2) dual mentoring by outstanding primary and associate mentors; 3) a wide variety of relevant classroom experiences on both campuses; 4) frequent and careful review of trainee progress/success; 5) ongoing appraisal of the program goals, strength and weaknesses; and 6) sound financial and administrative oversight. Our previous success is exemplified by our ability to: 1) fill our positions with outstanding trainees; 2) produe academically successful and productive trainees; 3) build a pipeline of mentors, and transition trainees to associate mentors and associate mentors to primary mentors; and 4) expand aging-research at both campuses through ongoing collaboration among the participating programs and faculty."
"9362692","The clinical reality for patients with the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype is grim because of a lack of response to targeted therapies against the estrogen receptor (ER) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Furthermore, TNBC presents with increased rates of metastasis, relapse, and mortality. Common sites of metastasis for TNBC include the lung, bone, liver, pleura, and the brain. Of particular interest is breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) because it accounts for about 15% of metastatic disease observed in breast cancer patients but have poor median survival times that are only between 4 to 6 months. Brain metastasis is an even more common feature in TNBC patients, with incidence rates that reach up to 20-50%. At the present time only palliative options are available for patients with BCBM, primarily because of challenges in determining the molecular basis of brain metastatic lesion development. In our preliminary research, we have taken the initial steps of identifying the scientific underpinnings of BCBM. Our preliminary data indicate that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Lnc-BM shows predictive potential for brain metastatic development in breast cancer patients. Also, our preclinical models demonstrate that elevated Lnc-BM expression levels resulted in increased breast cancer cell metastasis to the brain, while Lnc-BM knockdown drastically inhibited the incidence of brain metastasis.  The central hypothesis of the proposal is that Lnc-BM-triggered activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway promotes breast cancer brain metastasis, which could be attenuated in vivo by nanoparticle-delivery of siRNAs. The hypothesis will be addressed in accordance to the following specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will demonstrate the functional role of Lnc-BM and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in promoting breast cancer brain metastasis. In Specific Aim 2, we will demonstrate the underlying mechanisms that promote Lnc-BM-dependent JAK2 hyperactivation. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine whether targeting Lnc-BM using NP-delivered siRNAs can effectively inhibit the development of brain metastatic lesions in xenograft models.  By using mouse models, the proposal will assess the biological significance of Lnc-BM by delivering anti- Lnc-BM siRNAs across the blood brain barrier (BBB) using nanoparticles and by evaluating its ability to diminish Lnc-BM levels in vivo as well as the extent of brain metastatic lesions. If further developed, Lnc-BM may prove useful in early identification of breast cancer patients who are at increased risk for developing brain metastatic lesions. Although additional studies will be required to validate the degree of Lnc-BM involvement in brain metastatic potential in TNBC patients, a prognostic screening marker would improve early detection and perhaps even prevention."
"9261945","PROJECT SUMMARY The International Diabetes Federation estimates the global burden of diabetes to have skyrocketed to over 387 million people with healthcare costs reaching over $612 billion in the United States alone. Diabetes management for these individuals, particularly Type I Diabetic patients, is extremely rigorous and does not provide an efficient means of disease maintenance. Current standard of care for patients with Type I Diabetes is treatment with exogenous insulin, a measure, which simply put, allows patients to live normally, but does not inherently solve any of the underlying pathologies associated with the disease. Additionally, there are very few Type I Diabetes adjuvant therapeutics, none of which are known to improve ?-cell health and function. We have a growing body of evidence that suggests that this protein, specifically the alpha subunit (G?z) plays a notable role in mediating pathways regulating multiple ?-cell pathologies associated with Type I Diabetes. Therefore, our long-term goal is to fully elucidate the signaling mechanism by which G?z acts in both normal and diabetic ?-cells, determining the steps that become dysfunctional in the diabetic state, and ultimately modulating these steps for preventative and therapeutic purposes. The overall objective of this work, which is the next logical step in pursuit of our goal, is to characterize the role of ?-cell G?z on the molecular and cellular signaling pathways responsible for its impact on diabetes pathophysiology. Our central hypothesis is that activated ?-cell G?z negatively modulates specific intracellular and autocrine/paracrine signaling pathways critical for ?-cell compensation, ultimately leading to ?-cell dysfunction and loss of ?-cell mass resulting in diabetes pathogenesis. We will test our central hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish the objective of this application, by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) Determine the role of ?-cell G?z on ?-cell function in the Type I Diabetic condition and (2) Elucidate the effect of ?-cell G?z on signaling pathways that mediate ?-cell survival following insulitis. With the completion of these aims, we anticipate a much more complete understanding of the role of G?z in both healthy and diabetic ?-cells. Such results are anticipated to have an important positive outcome on the diabetes field, as G?z is a unique player in the integrated signaling pathways that mediate ?-cell function and survival, providing a new target for developing therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of Type I diabetes."
"9275995","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It was recently found that subretinal injection of Adeno associated virus (AAV) in patients with RPE65 Leber congenital amaurosis-2 (LCA2) led to a loss of central retinal thickness and central visual acuity. Because the vast majority of inherited retinal diseases are caused by mutations in photoreceptor (PR)-specific genes, there is an obvious need to develop gene replacement strategies that can more safely target these cells. We propose to develop novel AAV vectors capable of transducing PRs following a safer, surgically less invasive intravitreal injection. In so doing, we will overcome a major hurdle in th field of retinal gene therapy - how to safely deliver genes to rods and cones in fragile, diseased retinas that are prone to further damage upon surgically-induced retinal detachment. The ability to safely target genes to central cones is especially significant because this is the area of the retina responsible for acute, daylight vision. Transduction of inner retina via the vitreous with unmodified AAV serotypes depends on their ability to bind heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), a glycan present in the inner limiting membrane (ILM), a basement membrane that forms the vitreoretinal interface. Our hypothesis is that the AAV capsid can be simultaneously optimized to confer adhesion to the inner limiting membrane and traffic to the outer retina while maintaining or gaining photoreceptor tropism. To achieve this goal we propose the following three aims. In Aim 1, we will test novel variants developed via rational design and directed evolution (novel, highly complex AAV capsid libraries) for their ability to transduce mouse PRs via the vitreous. Relative transduction efficiency will be quantified using a mouse model with sortable (GFP-positive) PRs- the Rho-GFP knock in mouse. Because their ocular characteristics are most similar to human, in Aim 2, we will screen and test vectors in non-human primate and determine whether capsid motifs that confer PR transduction to AAV mutants in mouse retina are also important in primate. Sortable NHP PRs will be created via subretinal injection of a vector proven to have exclusive activity in rods and cones of NHP, AAV5-hGRK1-GFP. In Aim 3, the most efficient variants will be tested for their ability to restore vision to mouse models of CNGB3 achromatopsia and GUCY2D Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA1). Results may directly impact clinical trial designs for both diseases and be applied more broadly to other photoreceptor-mediated retinal disease. In summary, results of this study would transform the way gene therapy agents are administered to inherited retinal disease patients, converting a full blown vitreoretinal surgery into an outpatient procedure akin to that required for wet age related macular degeneration drugs, Lucentis and Avastin. Such vectors could be administered in clinic rather than a surgical suite, thereby increasing accessibility of gene therapies to much larger patient populations. Access to gene therapies would improve as the number of clinical trial study sites qualified to administer study agent would greatly increase."
"9495671","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) (U01) (RFA-DK-11-026) Funding Opportunity Announcement. Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is found in many pathologic conditions. Measurement tools that are not disease-specific can help better characterize symptoms of LUTD across conditions; potentially linking those symptoms to genetic variants and clinical subtypes. This in turn can improve care for patients with LUTD. New measurement tools need to be expanded to include men and woman alike. Effective LUTD symptom reporting can help better characterize urology patients, more effectively guide treatment, and clarify relationships between phenotype and biological substrates (e.g., genotype, neurophysiology). This is an important aim of the NIDDK's Prostate Strategic Plan. Existing self-report tools measure different symptoms with varying reliability and validity; this proposal will redress inconsistencies and deficiencies found in existing measures of urinary symptoms. Using methods we developed in PROMIS and related projects, we propose to develop a state-of-the art self-report measure of LUTD as well as their associated features and common comorbidities. Because our newly-created self-report measure will employ item response theory (IRT)-calibrated item banks where possible, we will create both static and adaptive, computer-based versions of the test. Computer adaptive testing (CAT) allows for brief-yet-precise measurement, reducing patient burden. Measures that are responsive to treatment impact are needed for clinical research and clinical practice aimed to manage symptoms of LUTD. Our methods include two aims: Instrument development/calibration; and clinical validation. To develop and calibrate the instrument, we will conduct two phases of qualitative research with approximately 40 urology patients, conduct a systematic and comprehensive literature review, collect input from 15 experts, and conduct state-of-the-science psychometric analysis of data collected from an Internet-based study of 800 individuals with LUTD, sleep disorder, obesity, or healthy controls. We will evaluate item response theory parameters, convergent validity with established self-report measures, and the relationships among LUTD and two emerging risks for LUTD: obesity and sleep disorders. We will then validate our new tools against conventionally-used questionnaires (e.g., International Prostate Scoring System), known biometric correlates of LUTD, such as urinary flow rate (Qmax), and newly-identified candidate genes for LUTD. Specifically, we will examine the ability of our new scale, and existing scales, to detect differences across, and associations within, four groups: obesity (n = 64), sleep dysfunction (n = 64), people with a history of LUTD (n = 160); and healthy controls (n = 64). This phase of the project will provide information about patient phenotype, and advance our knowledge on genotype-phenotype relationships."
"9208073","Project Summary Most essential proteins perform their function as part of a protein complex. Many such complexes are large, multi-subunit entities whose structures are well beyond the capabilities of traditional methods of structural determination. This TR&D builds upon previous pioneering achievements by the YRC in developing novel techniques to determine the structure of proteins and protein complexes. We will develop an arsenal of new techniques that will complement current methods of structural determination, empowering the scientific community to address structural questions that were previously out of reach. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop our already highly successful protein cross-linking/mass spectrometry (XL-MS) technology to: (1) Facilitate its adoption throughout the scientific community through development of a quality control toolkit; (2) Increase its sensitivity through improved fragmentation of cross-linked peptides; (3) Incorporate quantitative capabilities allowing XL-MS to be used to study dynamic populations of protein complex conformations and; (4) Develop a comprehensive set of computational tools to identify cross-linked peptides and statistically validate those identifications. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop a complementary method, molecular painting, which will allow the determination of surface-surface interactions in protein complexes ? even in vivo where current techniques such as HD exchange cannot be applied. In our third and final specific aim we will use co-evolution data to model protein structures and interfaces based on covariation of pairs of residues. We will develop technology to apply deep mutational scanning data (a technology developed in the YRC) to model protein interfaces if sufficient sequences are not available for co-evolution methods to be used. We will integrate these predictions with data generated by cross-linking and molecular painting. Through these aims we will drive the field of higher order protein structure determination into the future."
"9293887","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone marrow fat accumulation is part of dynamic processes that affect bone density and strength. The ability to measure marrow fat non-invasively has greatly advanced clinical research in this area. Cross-sectional studies have identified associations between higher marrow fat and lower bone density (BMD) measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Importantly, previous research shows that marrow fat is associated with prevalent vertebral fractures, independent of BMD. These cross- sectional results are encouraging but cannot address key questions regarding the dynamic processes connecting marrow fat and bone. At this juncture, longitudinal studies are needed to clarify whether marrow fat predicts bone loss and to determine if changes in marrow fat are accompanied by changes in bone. Longitudinal studies are also needed to determine the role of marrow fat during weight loss, an important risk factor for bone loss and fracture risk in older adults. Severe calorie restriction increases marrow fat. Research is needed to determine if bone loss caused by weight loss in older adults is mediated in part by increases in marrow fat. In studies of marrow fat and bone, it is important to account for the potential effects of other fat depots, including total body fat, visceral fat and fatty infiltration of muscle, that are associated with bone density and fracture and, in some studies, with marrow fat. Another crucial issue is to determine whether the gender differences suggested in cross-sectional studies of marrow fat, bone and vertebral fracture are observed in longitudinal studies and if these differences are due to sex hormone levels. Associations between higher marrow fat and lower BMD appear to be stronger in women. However, the association between higher marrow fat and prevalent vertebral fracture may be stronger in men. To address the need for longitudinal data on marrow fat and bone, taking into account sex hormone levels, changes in weight and in other fat depots, we propose a study among 557 older adults in the Iceland AGES Reykjavik cohort that will measure changes in bone at the spine and hip, using QCT and DXA, and changes in vertebral marrow fat, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), as well as visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat and thigh muscle fat infiltration (measured by QCT) and total body soft tissue composition (measured by DXA), over a period of 2-5 years, with sex hormone levels and prevalent vertebral fractures measured at baseline. This project will determine if changes in marrow fat are associated with changes in BMD, independent of changes in other fat depots; if changes in marrow fat account for any of the association between weight loss and bone loss; if sex hormone levels alter the relationship between marrow fat and BMD; and if higher marrow fat is independently associated with vertebral fractures in both men and women. This study promises to substantially advance our understanding of the dynamic relationship between marrow fat and bone, and these advances may translate into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis."
"9293278","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cystic Fibrosis Research Center (CFRC) at the University of Pittsburgh is comprised of ~50 faculty members from ten departments, providing research strengths from basic and clinical investigators. It garners more than $13 M/yr in extramural grants and contracts to support its CF research efforts. They are focused on three major scientific themes. The Center has a strong basic and pre-clinical science component that addresses the Cell and Molecular Biology of CF and CFTR, and it is supported by NIH, NSF and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) grants. Investigators in this group make extensive use of differentiated, primary human bronchial epithelia (HBE), and more recently human nasal epithelia (HNE), to define important steps in CFTR trafficking, airway liquid transport and mucociliary clearance. These studies are directed at elucidating the functional properties of wild type CFTR in relation to its more or less common disease mutants, as well as CFTR's associated transporters, including ENaC and SLC26A9. P30 investigators are identifying their impact on ER protein biogenesis and quality control, post-ER trafficking and their impact on the regulation of airway surface liquid volume and composition, studies that are directed to facilitate therapeutics development. Technical expertise and HBE having specific mutations are being provided to academic and industrial partners for the development of drugs that are currently available to patients or are in clinical evaluations. The Infection and Immunity component of the Center focuses on airway bacterial and viral infections, their interactions, and mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, using HBEs and animal models. These studies aim to improve our understanding of the inflammatory response in CF disease pathogenesis, define biomarkers and outcome measures to improve clinical trials, and identify targets for anti-inflammatory therapy, often through industrial interactions. Third, the Translational/Clinical Studies component translates pre-clinical findings into new therapeutic approaches. It develops and evaluates methods to improve and standardize airway drug delivery, in vivo isotopic clearance and liquid absorption assays, and test therapeutics that target the core defect in CF. The proposed CF Research and Translation Core Center (P30) is directed by Dr. Raymond Frizzell with Drs. Jay Kolls and Joseph Pilewski serving as Associate Directors. The Center is comprised of three scientific cores that support its large research base: Human Airway Cells and Assays (Drs. Frizzell and Pilewski, PIs), Translational/Clinical Studies (Drs. Pilewski and Kolls, PIs), and Imaging (Dr. Simon Watkins, PI). In the last grant period, several new assays have been developed by core associated investigators. The Core Center operates a Pilot and Feasibility Program to initiate new investigators into CF research and to facilitate the pursuit of new important ideas by established scientists and clinicians. The Center emphasizes the translation of basic knowledge into applied therapeutics."
"9486489","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary African Americans are at significantly greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than non-Hispanic whites. Despite the long-standing recognition of this racial disparity and attempts to eliminate it, it persists. Diabetes is associaed with reduced quality of life, decreased life expectancy and increased economic burden, and therefore African Americans experience a greater health burden than non-Hispanic whites. Thus, more efforts to combat this disparity in diabetes is urgently needed in order to achieve health equity for African Americans. Laboratory and observational studies have observed (1) significant associations between deficient sleep and increased diabetes risk and (2) shorter sleep durations and poorer sleep quality in African Americans compared to whites. No research to date, however, has explicitly examined whether deficient sleep partially accounts for the increased diabetes risk in African Americans. Therefore, we propose to examine sleep duration, sleep quality and circadian disruption as novel biobehavioral mediators of the racial disparity in diabetes risk. Indeed, despite it being well-recognized that (1) short sleep durations alter circadian phase, (2) circadian disruption produces metabolic disturbances, and (3) the melatonin rhythm directly impacts beta-cell function, circadian disruption has not previously been considered as a key mediator between sleep and diabetes risk. Thus the 3 primary goals of this study are to (1) conduct comprehensive and ecologically-valid assessments of sleep in people's homes, (2) assess circadian phase in the home environment by objectively controlling for light exposure and timing of sample collection and (3) determine if differences in home sleep and circadian measures partially explain differences in diabetes risk factors between African Americans and non- Hispanic whites. Our primary marker of diabetes risk will be the Matsuda Index of insulin sensitivity, estimated from a frequently-sampled oral glucose tolerance test. Secondary outcomes will include area-under-the-curve of glucose levels, disposition index, and a marker of inflammation (C - reactive protein), blood pressure, heart-rate variability, and lipid profiles. We plan to study 72 African Americans and 72 non-Hispanic whites without diabetes or sleep disorders. We have preliminary data that 1) support the existence of racial differences in the duration, structure and timing of sleep, (2) support our hypothesis that deficient sleep may mediate some health disparities, (3) support the existence of racial differences in circadian timing, (4) demonstrate the feasibility of conducting unattended in-home PSG, (5) demonstrate the feasibility and validity of data from at- home circadian phase assessments and (6) demonstrate the feasibility of the complete shortened protocol to be used in this study. This important multidisciplinary project will yield unique insights into the bio behavioral mechanisms underlying increased diabetes risk in African-Americans and will likely lead to the development of novel targeted interventions for diabetes including bedtime extension or regularity and chrono-therapeutic treatments. This application is in response to PA-09-262 Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases."
"9403837","ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is the deadliest global infection (1.4 million deaths in 2015), having recently surpassed HIV/AIDS. ~250,000 of these deaths were from multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, with only ~50% success in treatment of MDR-TB. Unless new strategies to combat or prevent emergence of drug-resistant TB are found, the global spread of MDR-TB will be an epidemic of epic proportions. Kanamycin A (KAN) is an antibiotic of last resort used to treat MDR-TB. Resistance to KAN signifies extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB, which is nearly incurable. One-third of KAN-resistant TB is caused by upregulation of the acetyltransferase Eis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), caused by mutations in the eis promoter. We investigated the mechanism of Eis and discovered and validated several Eis inhibitor scaffolds in the previous funding period. In Aims 1 and 2 of this application, we propose to develop a novel strategy to combat and forestall KAN resistance in TB. These Aims are focused on the preclinical development of these Eis inhibitors for their ultimate use as a combination therapy with KAN against MDR-TB. In Aim 3, we propose to determine the mechanism(s) of the anti-Mtb activity of novel compounds that were discovered to inhibit Eis and potently inhibit Mtb bacteria without KAN, ultimately to develop them as therapeutics against both drug-resistant and drug-resistant TB."
"9276132","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a application to implement blood based screening for postpartum depression (PPD) using a novel epigenetic biomarker we have developed, enabling the longitudinal evaluation of PPD specific neuroimaging phenotypes in the postpartum period in individuals at risk and in matched controls. The project will take advantage of the talents of a leader in the field of women's mental health and PPD, a highly experienced DNA methylation and biomarker researcher, and an accomplished neuroimager. Through a recent cross species translational experiment investigating hippocampal epigenetic responses to estrogen and epigenomic profiling in a prospective sample of women at risk for PPD, we identified a set of epigenetic marks functionally related to modulating synaptic plasticity and capable of predicting PPD with >85% accuracy. Our results indicated that risk to PPD is mediated by an increased sensitivity to estrogen. The availability of peripheral biomarkers opens novel opportunities to perform imaging epigenetics in the PPD population. While there is some consistency across MDD and PPD specific neuroimaging phenotypes, it is unclear if these findings represent disease etiology or the state of depression and requires longitudinal study in spontaneous and previous mood disorder diagnosed cases to elucidate. The central hypothesis is that PPD risk may arise due to an altered sensitivity of the epigenetic reprogramming machinery in response to gonadal hormones and that peripherally measured epigenetic variation at these loci will be associated with longitudinally progressive depression associated neuroimaging phenotypes including resting state functional connectivity alterations of corticolimbic pathways, emotional processing, working memory, and hippocampal subregion specific activity changes in the postpartum period. In Aim 1, we will use standard third trimester blood draws to perform PPD prediction and generate a sample of women at risk for PPD from the general population and from women with a previous history of mood disorder. In Aim 2, we will perform a series of fMRI tests to assess resting state functional connectivity, emotional response, working memory, and hippocampal subregion specific alterations at both a pre-depression time point of two weeks at six weeks during major depressive episodes. A within groups comparison will identify trait associated endophenotypes that will be integrated with epigenetic, serum hormone, and psychological data in Aim 3. The analyses performed will identify novel brain endophenotypes susceptible to hormone and epigenetic interaction that will aid in our understanding of the molecular pathology of PPD and hold the potential to act as novel and modifiable therapeutic targets."
"9474281","Project Summary The overall aim of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which Cux1 regulates the expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27 in kidney development and polycystic kidney disease. Cux1 is highly expressed in the nephrogenic zone during normal kidney development, but is sharply downregulated when nephrons undergo terminal differentiation. Cux1 is ectopically expressed in human ADPKD cells, and in mouse models of polycystic kidney disease, including Pkd1 null and cpk mice. Transgenic mice that ectopically express Cux1 develop renal hyperplasia resulting from the aberrant repression of p27. However, studies on the Cux1 transgenic mice demonstrate that ectopic expression of Cux1 alone is insufficient to cause cyst development. Rather, increased levels of Cux1 expression appear to be required for cyst progression. Our preliminary results suggest that reducing Cux1 levels in polycystic kidney disease results in increased expression of p27, leading to cell cycle arrest and decreased cyst growth. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the downregulation of p27 by Cux1 results in the proliferation defects observed in PKD. Thus, in specific aim 1, we will characterize cell proliferation in collecting duct cells isolated from mice carrying targeted deletions of both Pkd1 and Cux1, and determine whether Cux1 is required to form a repressor complex on the p27 promoter. Our preliminary results suggest that Cux1 interacts with Grg4 to recruit the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC3 to regulate p27 expression. Thus, in specific aim 2, we will define the interaction between Cux1, Grg4, and the p27 promoter, and use the chromatin conformation capture assay to characterize the repression complex formed on the p27 promoter. Finally, treatment of Pkd1 null embryos with HDAC inhibitors slows cyst progression. Thus, in specific aim 3, we will determine whether HDAC inhibition results in increased p27 gene expression, and whether Cux1 regulation of p27 in PKD is dependent on HDAC activity. These studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of cell proliferation during kidney development and polycystic kidney disease."
"9355244","Most current approaches to understanding the neural basis of cognitive processes are severely limited in two respects. First, most commonly used methods do not have the temporal (e.g., fMRI) or spatial (e.g., MEG/ EEG) resolution to capture the relevant dynamics. Second, even methods with high spatio-temporal resolution (intracranial EEG - icEEG) typically approach target cognitive processes in a fragmentary, un- integrated way. For instance, language is typically studied as a conglomeration of separate subsystems: perception, pattern recognition, categorization, semantically/syntactically appropriate response selection, cross-modal integration, motor control and sensorimotor integration. The present proposal aims to remedy both limitations by using icEEG to study a model system, reading/speech/language, from an integrative and unified perspective. We focus on reading, a complex task that involves visual pattern recognition, visual- auditory and visuo-motor integration, semantic, syntactic and phonological access, and (in reading aloud) - response selection and motor sequencing. Reading allows for easy, yet ecologically valid manipulations of cognitive load in the language system. The neuro-computational framework we propose to test is that computation is achieved not by information passing through a sequence of discrete processing stages in individual modules but via state transitions of a distributed network. We will recruit a large cohort of 80 patients in whom we will quantify both local as well as inter-regional cortical dynamics during word reading - from early primary visual perception, through selection, to word output. We will leverage our established techniques for precise co-localization and analysis of grouped icEEG data, circumventing the sparse sampling problem inherent to human icEEG experiments. The combined use of sub-dural grid electrodes and stereo-electroencephalographic depth electrodes will enable the study of not only classic peri-sylvian regions, but also of deep sulci (and regions such as the planum temporale). We will then characterize dynamic network interactions using linear and non linear measures of amplitude covariance in high frequencies, following analyses we have developed previously. Critical nodes and critical transitions in network states will then be perturbed using closed-loop activity-triggered direct cortical stimulation. To achieve these goals we have set up a collaboration between the Texas Comprehensive Epilepsy Program and Johns Hopkins Medical Center - both centers have a proven record of studying language with icEEG. Our team has expertise in all aspects language, reading, icEEG signal analysis, population level network modeling from intracranial recordings; and neural networks. This work will dramatically improve our understanding of language systems and test and develop a new way to model neural computation generally."
"9315157","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a consequence of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet ?-cells and the underlying causes for this process are not completely understood. Yet to be defined are the roles of lipids generated in ?-cells and immune cells in this process. Islet ?-cells and immune cells express Ca2+- independent phospholipase A2? (iPLA2?), which hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 position to generate lipids that can promote inflammatory responses. We hypothesize that iPLA2?-derived lipids (iDLs) provide critical signals linking immune cells, ?-cells, and ER stress with ?-cell death associated with autoimmune diabetes. In support, we find that (a) iPLA2? is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytokine-mediated ER stress and ?-cell apoptosis are reversed by iPLA2? inhibition, (b) ?-cells and immune cells in a spontaneous model of autoimmune diabetes (non-obese diabetic mice, NOD) express higher iPLA2? during the pre-diabetic phase, (c) administration of an iPLA2?-selective inhibitor (FKGK18) to NOD mice preserves ?-cells mass and reduces diabetes incidence, insulitis, and autoimmunity, (d) pre-treatment of immunodeficient mice with FKGK18 reduces adoptive transfer of diabetes by T-cells, (e) overexpression of iPLA2? in ?-cells accelerates and increases the incidence of diabetes in NOD, (f) reduction of iPLA2? in NOD mice mimics the protective effects seen with FKGK18 administration, (g) M1 inflammatory macrophage polarization is reduced with iPLA2? deficiency, and (h) there is feedback regulation between iPLA2? and ER stress, and between inflammation-related transcription factors and iPLA2?. Our hypothesis will be tested using whole animal (mouse models with altered iPLA2? expression on a NOD or immunodeficient-NOD background), mechanism-based in vitro, and translational (human T1D and autoantibody positive but not diabetic subjects) approaches through the following Aims: 1. Delineate the impact of iDLs generated by immune cells on autoimmune diabetes development. 2. Delineate the impact of iDLs generated by ?-cells on autoimmune diabetes development. 3. Delineate the cellular mechanisms by which iDLs induce ?-cell death in autoimmune diabetes. 4. Assess the contribution of iDLs to human T1D development. These Aims will encompass generation of islet and immune cell lipidome during autoimmune diabetes development; adoptive transfer protocols to distinguish importance of iDLs generated by immune cells and ?-cells to diabetes development; co-culture assays to assess impact of iDLs on islet antigenicity; protein and message analyses to address link between ER stress, iDLs, and inflammation; ChIP and CRISPR/Cas9 analyses to examine transcriptional regulation of iPLA2?; and human subjects to asses the potential of iPLA2? as a biomarker of T1D susceptibility. Our long-term goal is to elucidate underlying mechanisms by which iPLA2?-derived lipid signals contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D, so that novel targets that might be candidates for drug intervention to counter T1D can be developed."
"9268419","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this Pathway to Independence Career Development Proposal are to request support for training to develop expertise in experimental models of breast cancer while addressing a fundamental gap in knowledge that could have a significant impact on the treatment of breast cancer patients. K99/R00 support during this transitional phase of my career will be integral to my successful development as an independent investigator at a top-tier research institution. The training plan outlined herein will take advantage of the extensive resources available at Vanderbilt University as well as key senior personnel with track records of scientific excellence to serve as mentors and collaborators. As part of my pathway to independence I have assembled a mentoring team at Vanderbilt to provide career development advice and scientific direction. Didactic seminars, lectures, and workshops provided by Vanderbilt and the Biological Research Education and Training (BRET) office will provide structured support for this guidance and will help further prepare me for an independent faculty position. A technical workshop offered by Jackson Labs on the Experimental Models of Human Cancer as well as two workshops in Bioinformatics will be taken during the earlier phase of this proposal in order to enhance scientific and technical knowledge on genetically engineered mouse models and to expand my expertise and skills in Bioinformatics, both major features of the work outlined herein. The scientific portion of this proposal focuses on experimentally and mechanistically testing the potential role of DUSP4 as a mediator of drug resistance in breast cancer. DUSP4 is a dual-specificity phosphatase with activity against ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, key signaling components of the MAPK pathways. We have previously shown that DUSP4 loss, in part by epigenetic silencing, is common in basal-like and luminal B breast cancer, and contributes to resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Our own published data and the preliminary data in this application support a role for DUSP4 as a mediator of drug resistance in breast cancer, and suggest that genetic or epigenetic DUSP4 loss may be a therapeutically exploitable molecular alteration within the tumor cell. Therefore, in line with these data I will explore two overarching scientific aims; 1) to determine the mechanism by which DUSP4 loss inhibits chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and how this can be circumvented, and 2) to use high-throughput siRNA screening for >7,500 gene targets in isogenic cell lines which lack or express DUSP4 in order to identify synthetic lethal targets in breast cancers with DUSP4 loss. The completion of the scientific aims of this proposal will develop my research skills in experimental models of breast cancer while also developing the rationale for clinical trials to overcome therapeutic resistance in DUSP4-deficient breast cancer. Finally, this proposal seeks identify novel therapeutic targets which could impact breast cancer treatment."

"9274972","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Summary  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss among people aged 65 and older in the US.  Since the advanced form of this disease affects central vision function, reading difficulties are one of the most common complaints of AMD patients.  Most research on reading in AMD has focused on people with advanced disease, who already have significant central vision losses.  However, research suggests that reading and other non-standard functional vision measures are afected earlier in the disease, prior to losses in standard visual acuity.  This project aims to examine the contribution of visual, motor and cognitive factors to reading performance in elderly individuals with early AMD.  This study also seeks to determine whether reading performance and other non-standard vision function measures can be used to predict which participants will go on to develop the advanced forms of the disease.  Current clinical metrics (such as fundus appearance) provide little guidance on how much risk a given patient with early signs of AMD has of progressing to advanced disease and the accompanying central vision loss.  Better, more accurate methods of identifying those at risk are needed.  Our approach is to apply simple, inexpensive vision function tests, requiring minimal special equipment, and little time to administer, that can improve the ability to predict AMD progression.  Previous research strongly suggests that some combination of such simple tests, in conjunction with existing clinical protocols identifying fundus risk factors, could boost the clinician's chances of prognostic success significantly.  To examine these questions, individuals with early AMD will take part in test sessions consisting of vision, motor, and cognitive testing, along with an extensive reading assessment.  These measures will also be compared in control groups with no retinal disease and with advanced AMD.  Participants will also undergo a comprehensive eye exam by a retinal specialist.  Study participants will be followed over time, and analyses will determine the best predictors of advanced disease progression.  Understanding the causes of reading problems will allow us to identify the specific skills lacking in people with early AMD, which will aid in better understanding of the course of the disease, and suggest appropriate rehabilitative strategies.  The significance of improving predictive ability is two-fold:  As emerging AMD treatments that can be applied in the earliest stages of the disease become available, it will be absolutely vital to have appropriate and practical tools to identify which patients should receive them.  This is key since all medications have costs and side effects.  Second, availability of simple predictive tools will greatly simplify and streamline clinical trials of AMD treatments by reducing the number of subjects needed for statistical power and length of time over which the studies must be carried out."
"9294122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a K12 Career Development Program on Omics of Pediatric Lung Diseases DC based within the Department of Integrative Systems Biology (ISB), George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences (GW), and fully commensurate with the Center for Genetic Medicine Research (GenMed) at Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) in Washington DC (ISB/GenMed) (see www.gwumc.edu/isbweb). Omics is a systems biology approach to biology in health and disease, and an underlying lynch pin for the emergence of 'personalized medicine'. Providing career development support in omics of lung diseases is timely and highly important for both physician/scientists and PhD scientists A fundamental problem is that systems biology approaches utilizing multi-level omics data sources are exceptionally multi-disciplinary, requiring the lung researcher to have working expertise in many areas of academic endeavor that were, previously, considered distinct (aka 'siloed'). The key challenge for K12 omics career development programs is to break down traditional siloes in academic medicine, providing a large research tool box to the Scholar that ranges from epigenomics, to bioinformatics of next-generation sequence data, to phenotype/environment interactions. Our K12 program responds to this need by providing time for Scholars to: 1) take coursework in omics and systems biology relevant to their research; 2) learn state-of-the art laboratory methodology in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics; 3) develop preliminary data under the supervision of a Lead Mentor and Mentoring Team that will lead to submission of an independent NIH grant application; and 4) learn to effectively translate their accomplishments to the improvement of pediatric lung diseases. In order to accomplish their goals the K12 Scholars will spend at least 75% effort honing these skills over a 1-3 year period of time, depending on past experience and topic area. During this period each of the above goals is addressed in a systematic fashion including participation in a core curriculum in research methodology and biostatistics and performance of increasingly independent research in the laboratory of a Lead Mentor. Our proposed K12 program draws 11 Lead Mentors and 16 secondary Mentors from the ISB/GenMed roster who will function as a Mentoring Team in four Affinity areas: Genetics and Genomics; Proteomics; Bioinformatics, and Clinical and Pre-Clinical Phenotyping. The administrative structure of the K12 includes two Co-Principal Investigators with complementary expertise in omics and lung biology/diseases who will serve as Program Director and Career Development Director, respectively, a Director of Minority Recruitment, and internal and external advisory committees. We propose to select and train a total of 2-4 K12 Scholars during a 5 year grant period."
"9354278","OVERALL ? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Age related diseases causing dementia are an increasing global, social and economic catastrophe that mandates broad and aggressive research. Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects over 5 million people in the US alone. Vascular contributions to dementia and AD are increasingly recognized. However, the role of the cerebrovascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD, and the underlying neurovascular mechanisms remain, to date, largely unknown and under- researched, representing a critical barrier in the field. The overall goals of this program are to advance current knowledge on the vascular contributions to dementia and AD, and establish whether the neurovasculature plays a major role in cognitive decline, and therefore is a key new therapeutic target to treat dementia and AD. This is a program project application with multiple projects, cores, institutions and investigators. It represents an integrated whole far greater than the sum of its parts. Each project and core complements the others so that a synergistic relationship among them is achieved with a common focus on goals of the program, namely to test the neurovascular hypothesis of AD. This hypothesis holds that cerebrovascular dysfunction and disruption in the neurovascular integrity underlies and contributes to the onset and progression of cognitive decline. We have enlisted established clinical and translational research groups that collectively bring significant expertise in all aspects of the research plan and each have contributed productively over many years to the study of dementia and AD. To test the ?neurovascular hypothesis?, the participating investigators will apply cutting-edge molecular and imaging methods. We will perform parallel studies with analogous measures in humans and rats in two AD genetic risk groups with the major genetic risk factors for late-onset AD, i.e., apolipoprotein E-?4 (APOE4) gene and early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), i.e., presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations that both develop early vascular dysfunction and significant cerebrovascular pathology, and in the rat model of AD (line TgF344-AD) that faithfully recapitulates the rich clinico-pathological spectrum of human AD including the presence of early vascular dysfunction and cerebrovascular pathology. Central to our approach is our commitment to take a new research direction with the overarching goal to provide an answer to the broader question; ?what is the role of the vascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD?, and ?what is the prognostic and diagnostic value of neurovascular molecular and imaging biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline?. The relationship between neurovascular integrity, brain connectivity and cognitive function has not been explored. The collective expertise of the investigators, overall environment, preliminary results, and experimental design for each of the projects and supporting cores hold tremendous promise for the success of this program. We are confident that the proposed studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of pathogenesis, treatment, and early prevention of dementia and AD."
"9293310","TR&D 4: Optical Imaging & Monitoring  P.I: Arjun G. Yodh, PhD  ABSTRACT   Diffuse optics has proven to be clinically relevant, and as a result, many scientists, engineers and clinicians  are now working together in this field of biomedicine. Technological innovation with diffuse optics continues  along two branches: imaging and monitoring. Clinical innovation with diffuse optics is focused on many  problems, notably cancer diagnosis and monitoring and brain injury management. Biomarkers are the key  reason for the sustained interest of this broad community. In particular, hemodynamic, perfusion and metabolic  contrasts, among others, are available to the optical method and have demonstrated value for detection,  diagnosis and monitoring of tumors, and for characterization and monitoring of diseased and injured states of  brain and muscle tissue. The technology is also attractive because it offers the possibility for non-invasive,  rapid, portable and continuous measurements at the bedside. TRD4 will focus on both branches of technology  development, imaging and monitoring, and it will also focus on two important classes of clinical problem, breast  cancer and brain injury. A recurring theme is the combination of two data-types: blood flow & oxy-/deoxy-  hemoglobin concentration. In combination, these data provide untapped access to tissue metabolism and  autoregulation.   One research direction is oriented towards neurovascular monitoring. TRD4 will develop new dual-data-  type instrumentation and algorithms based on blood flow and blood oxygenation contrast that directly address  issues that have plagued all optical measurements of brain: corrupting signals from extra-cerebral tissues, and  the so-called ?hair? problem. Solution of these problems leads naturally to the development of a more  comprehensive optical monitor that interrogates cortical flow and oxygenation comprehensively (and non-  invasively) over the whole head. Lastly, minimally-invasive probes for spinal cord monitoring will be developed  to address a new clinical application in the surgical suite wherein continuous, real-time measurements at the  surgical bedside are crucial: spinal cord ischemia.   The second research direction is oriented towards breast cancer imaging. TRD4 will complete and utilize a  multi-modal DOT-MRI clinical breast imager within a standard-of-care hospital MRI scanner at the Hospital of  the University of Pennsylvania (i.e., 1.5 T with Sentinelle breast biopsy coils). Soft spatial priors from MRI  enable tumor optical properties to be derived with high fidelity, and the combination of optical and MRI  biomarkers will be explored for improved cancer characterization via computer aided diagnosis (CAD). Finally,  multi-modal experiments will combine DOT hemoglobin concentration data with Ktrans data (i.e., flow data) from  dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and KWIC (TRD 3) to enable construction of oxygen metabolism  images of breast."
"9503869","The long-term goal of Project III is to identify non-invasive imaging and blood biomarkers of eariy  cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive health. Specifically, aims of this project are to define and  characterize in participants of Projects I and II: 1) cerebral microvascular dilatory capacity using transcranial  Doppler ultrasonography; 2) the cellular origin, content, and thrombotic potential of blood-borne microvesicles  using flow cytometry and platelet functions using assays for platelet secretion and activation; and  3) relationships among characteristics of blood-borne microvesicles, platelet functions, and cerebral  microvascular dilatory capacity with changes in brain stmeture and cognition, as defined in Projects I and II.  Three independent observations from our group provide the basis for this project and potential links among  hormonal status, blood-borne elements, vascular function, and cognition. First, numbers of blood-borne  prothrombotic microvesicles increase with decreases in estrogen at menopause; second, the dilatory capacity  of the cerebral microvasculature decreases in women at menopause; and third, numbers of platelet  microaggregates correlate positively with brain white matter hyperintensities and negatively with cognitive  performance within 36 months of menopause. Experiments of this proposal will define sources and  characteristics of blood elements and microvesicles simultaneously, together with cerebral microvascular  dilatory capacity in women at risk for cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline based on either a history of  preeclampsia or estrogen deficiency at menopause. Results of this study stand on their own but link results of  Projects I and II to the overarching theme oif the SCOR of how female sex-specific conditions of a history  preeclampsia or menopausal hormonal status affect cognition through changes in cerebrovascular function.  Furthermore, assessment of platelet and microvesicle characteristics provides potential mechanisms by which  cerebral microvascular dilatory capacity could be modulated and associate more generally with development of  cardiovascular disease in women."
"9355255","Abstract: The overall goal of project 3 of the University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Center is to investigate why deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) works better in some individuals than in others and to develop methods to decrease the variability of DBS therapy for individual motor signs of PD. To deliver DBS therapy at a level consistent with the best responders, it is critical to investigate the (1) emergence of DBS- induced side effects that impede the delivery of more effective stimulation parameters, (2) logistical challenges in optimizing stimulation settings for each parkinsonian motor sign on an individual basis, and (3) multi-scale neurophysiological differences across the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem that underlie the individual variability to DBS therapy. This project will leverage the well-characterized non-human primate model of PD (systemic MPTP) implanted with two scaled-down versions of the human DBS lead (subthalamic nucleus, STN and globus pallidus, GP). The approach involves a novel combination of high-field imaging (7T/10.5T, Imaging Core), computational neuron modeling of DBS, development of optimization algorithms based on quantitative behavioral assessments, multi-parameter regression analysis techniques (Biostatistics Core), and multi-scale electrophysiological analysis of DBS therapy that spans single-cell, ensemble, and whole-brain levels. Aim 1 will investigate the ability for narrow DBS pulse widths to extend the therapeutic parameter space window between alleviating parkinsonian motor signs and evoking motor side-effects. This aim will further enhance our understanding of the functional relationships between DBS parameter settings and their resultant therapeutic effect sizes and wash-in/wash-out time constants on a subject-specific, pathway-specific basis. Aim 2 will develop a novel real-time, behavior-based optimization algorithm for automatic and efficient selection of DBS parameters that minimize the expression of individual parkinsonian motor signs including rigidity, bradykinesia, akinesia, and gait/posture. Aim 3 will identify the subject-specific electrophysiological features that most closely correlate with the temporal and steady-state behavioral responses to DBS found in the first two aims. The simultaneous recordings will include local field potentials in the STN and GP as well as unit-spike recordings in three nuclei innervated by pallidofugal projection neurons (i.e. motor thalamus, centromedian-parafascicular complex of thalamus, and pedunculopontine nucleus). At the conclusion of the experiments, whole-brain transcription factor analysis for two metabolic markers (c-fos and egr-1) will be conducted through histological techniques to provide single-cell resolution for the neural pathways modulated by behaviorally-optimized DBS therapy. Together, these aims will provide critical new insight into the pathophysiological basis for the expression of each parkinsonian motor sign and which specific targeted pathways and electrophysiological features are most relevant to delivering the most effective and efficient level DBS therapy for each individual."
"9334703","PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT 3) Genomic and epigenomic instability plays a contributing role in aging. Genomic instability arises from chemical and physical damage to DNA as well as from errors in DNA replication and repair. Recently, activation of endogenous retrotransposable elements has emerged as another major source of age-related genomic instability. SIRT6 plays an important role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating DNA repair. Recent studies by our laboratory demonstrated that SIRT6 has another function in maintaining genome stability by repressing LINE-1 (L1) transposable elements. We showed that SIRT6 represses L1 by mono-ADP ribosylating KAP1, which promotes its interaction with heterochromatin factor HP1. Sirt6 knockout mice display premature aging with a lifespan of 3-4 weeks, associated with dramatic L1 activation. Remarkably, our preliminary data suggests that repression of L1 retrotransposition extends lifespan of these mice. Upon DNA damage SIRT6 vacates L1 promoters and relocalized to DNA damage sites. The dual function of SIRT6 in DNA damage and L1 repression may provide a mechanism for age-related genomic instability. We hypothesize that with aging SIRT6 relocalizes from L1 promoters to the sites of DNA damage and shortened telomeres leading to L1 activation and genome destabilization. The goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanism of L1 repression by SIRT6 and to dissect the interplay between DNA damage, L1 activation and aging. We will pursue the following specific aims. (1) To determine the mechanism of L1 repression by SIRT6 on the molecular level we will identify the KAP1 amino acids mono-ADP-ribosylated by SIRT6 and determine how this modification affects the binding and recruitment of other heterochromatin factors to L1 promoters. In collaboration with Project 1 we will examine the interaction between SIRT6 and pRb L1 repression pathways. (2) To understand the interplay between SIRT6 function in DNA repair and L1 repression we will perform ChIP-seq to determine SIRT6 localization in young and old mice and in human fibroblasts under basal conditions and after DNA damage. To identify factors that regulate SIRT6 localization on chromatin we will identify posttranslational modifications that direct SIRT6 to either L1 promoters or DNA damage sites. (3) To examine the contribution of L1 activation to the aging process we will treat wild type, Sirt6-late onset, brain-specific, and full body knockout mice with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and test whether the treatment alleviates aging-related phenotypes (with Core C). In collaboration with Core B we will perform TIP-seq or single-cell TIP-seq on the Sirt6 knockout mice to quantify the retrotransposition events before and after treatment. To determine which molecular functions of SIRT6 are involved in longevity we will breed Sirt6 knockout mice with mice harboring SIRT6 separation of function mutations. Finally, we will collaborate with Project 2 to determine the effect of SIRT6 on retrotransposition and lifespan in Drosophila."
"9298652","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epithelial barrier presents a significant obstacle to the delivery of macromolecules in the size range of 20 - 150 kDa. In particular, the tight junctional complex, which links adjacent cells and occludes the paracellular space, presents a significant obstacle to delivery of macromolecules. To improve the transport of macromolecular biologics across epithelia, new approaches need to be developed that enhance paracellular drug transport by specifically and reversibly modulating tight junctions. In this proposal, we investigate the effect of nanostructured surfaces on the modulation of tight junction permeability and transport of key therapeutic molecules in vitro. We seek to determine the mechanisms through which epithelial permeability is enhanced by nanotopography and optimize nanostructured materials to broaden the types of drugs that can be delivered paracellularly. It is expected that the fundamental knowledge gained in these studies will enhance the development of new epithelial drug delivery systems."
"9276671","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary incontinence (UI) is a physically, emotionally, and economically burdensome condition that is common among women of all ages. Yet, only a minority of women, even those with severe symptoms, discusses UI with their healthcare provider. The goal of this project is to provide data to inform decisions about UI care seeking and management, with the long-term aim of reducing UI burden. Our specific aims leverage detailed data on UI over up to 16 years among >140,000 women, aged 37-91 years, in the Nurses' Health Studies (NHS, NHSII). The first aim addresses the lack of data tracking UI natural history; improved knowledge of natural history will help facilitate discussions between women and clinicians about the expected course of UI symptoms and timing of prevention or management. We will track changes in UI frequency, severity, and subtype, collected via questionnaires administered every 2 to 4 years, over up to 16 years. Separate analyses will consider natural history within older and younger women. The second aim of this project is to evaluate potential determinants of care seeking for UI, which could help providers target and inform women who do not discuss their symptoms. We will specifically evaluate relations of UI characteristics (e.g., higher severity, more bother, mixed UI subtype, longer duration) and independent health factors (e.g., more co-morbidity, worse health- related quality of life) with self-reported discussions about UI with healthcare providers. In complement, we will also evaluate relations of potential determinants with UI identification by providers utilizing linked Medicare and NHS data. Finally, information on treatment likelihood, or on how different UI subtypes are treated, has not been possible to determine, since it requires joint knowledge of UI, UI characteristics, and treatments utilized. Thus, in the third aim we will leverage linked NHS and Medicare claims data to examine utilization of medical and surgical treatments for UI, including which patients receive (and don't receive) treatment, and how UI subtypes are treated. These data could help identify patients who might benefit from treatment discussions and help inform providers on treatment guidelines. Overall, the three aims of this proposal have direct clinical relevance to optimizing care for UI and reducing its burden."
"9295916","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Circadian rhythms in organs, tissues and cells, which are entrained to the 24-h day by cycles of light and nutrition, lose amplitude and phase stability with age. Humans exhibit an endogenous circadian rhythm in glucose tolerance and respond to meals with higher glucose levels at night. GWAS implicate circadian genes in the risk of T2D, and some key components of the circadian molecular clock (CMC) that regulate glucose metabolism. We have found that acute circadian misalignment in young adults leads to higher post-prandial glucose despite elevated insulin, whereas recurrent circadian disruption (RCD) combined with sleep restriction  leads to higher post-prandial glucose and decreased insulin, even when the meal is consumed at  an appropriate circadian phase. This may explain why night workers are at increased risk of conditions associated with metabolic aging: obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Since circadian dysregulation is common in older Americans, 3 million of whom work at night, it is critical for development of targeted therapies to understand the metabolic risks associated with RCD, even when sleep loss is minimized.  Project 1 will evaluate the impact of RCD on glucose metabolism in older adults. Whereas chronic sleep loss and acute circadian misalignment induce insulin resistance, we hypothesize that RCD disrupts coordination among central and peripheral CMCs, thereby profoundly impairing pancreatic P-cell responsiveness and inducing insulin resistance. By comparing responses of older participants on a forced desynchrony (T=28h) protocol for a month with those on a 24-h day, we will test the hypotheses that in response to a standard test meal: 1) acute circadian misalignment will induce increase glucose levels, despite increased insulin levels; 2)  3-week history of RCD (while minimizing sleep loss) will induce increased glucose levels accompanied by reduced insulin levels, even when the meal is consumed at a normal circadian phase; 3) 3-week history of RCD (while minimizing sleep loss) will alter the waveform and amplitude of the circadian Cortisol rhythm; and that 4) re-imposing a 24-h light-dark/meal schedule for 1 week will re-entrain circadian rhythms, normalizing the Cortisol rhythm and the glucose and insulin responses to a standardized meal.  This Project will contribute to understanding the distinct metabolic risks from circadian disruption, laying the groundwork for research designed to develop therapies targeted to reduce the risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and enhance the health and quality of life of older Americans whose circadian rhythms are disrupted by age-related changes, irregular schedules, and/or night shift work."
"9293202","Summary Extracellular amyloid plaques are a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease brain pathology. A poorly understood aspect of these plaques is the massive abundance of lysosomes that selectively accumulate within dystrophic (swollen) axons that pass close to them. This axonal enrichment for lysosomes stands in sharp contrast to their near exclusion from the axons of healthy neurons. Beyond the potentially negative consequences of lysosome dysregulation on neuronal proteostasis and health, the enrichment within endosomes and lysosomes of proteases (? and ?-secretases) responsible for amyloid ? (A?) peptide production combined with the acidic environment of the lysosomal lumen that could further promote A? nucleation and suggests a vicious cycle whereby extracellular amyloid plaques trigger axonal membrane trafficking defects that result in abnormal lysosome accumulation and enhanced production/processing of A?. However, lysosomes also contain other proteases (cathepsins) that contribute to A? clearance. Due to these positive and negative contributions of lysosomes to A? metabolism, it is not clear whether the highly abundant lysosomes within dystrophic axons exert protective versus destructive effects on neuronal health. Thus, while there is evidence to suggest that modulating neuronal lysosome activity could represent a novel therapeutic opportunity, greater understanding of the functions of lysosomes in this context and of the basic cell biology that underlies this phenotype is required for the identification of the specific and relevant molecular targets. The proposed research builds on the unique experience in neuronal membrane traffic, lysosome homeostasis and in vivo imaging of the PI and co-PIs to address these problems in mouse models that recapitulate this Alzheimer's disease phenotype. To this end, we propose to: 1) investigate the mechanisms that give rise to the extreme abundance of lysosomes within Alzheimer's disease dystrophic axons; 2) take advantage of novel imaging-based assays for assessment of amyloid plaque formation and growth to dissect the relationship between amyloid plaque growth and neuronal lysosome function; and 3) evaluate specific strategies that modulate neuronal lysosome function in mice for their ability to protect neurons from the toxicity of abnormal ?- amyloid metabolism. These studies will test the hypothesis that abnormal neuronal lysosome functions are an important contributing factor to Alzheimer's disease pathology and may point to new therapeutic targets for the disease.?"
"9279116","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multi-center, multi-vendor study will validate a rapid magnetic resonance-based confounder- corrected R2* mapping method as a quantitative imaging biomarker of liver iron concentration (LIC). Excessive accumulation of iron in various organs, including the liver, which affects both adult and pediatric populations, is toxic and requires treatment aimed at reducing body iron stores. Measurement of LIC is critical for detection and staging of iron overload, and for monitoring iron-reducing chelator therapies that are expensive and have side effects. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely available, accessible, and safe technology, and it is very sensitive to the presence of iron in tissue. Translation of an MRI biomarker of liver iron concentration into broad clinical use requires that i is clinically feasible, precise, robust to changes in scan parameters, calibrated to a validated reference standard of LIC, and is reproducible across sites and manufacturers. There are currently no available MRI methods that meet these requirements. R2*-MRI holds the greatest promise to meet these requirements. R2* mapping can be performed very rapidly with whole-liver 3D coverage in a single 20s breath-hold. Past work has demonstrated excellent correlation and linear calibration between R2* and LIC. However, current R2*-MRI methods are affected by three key confounding factors: [1] fat, [2] noise, and [3] magnetic field variations. A quantitativ confounder- corrected R2*-MRI method developed at the University of Wisconsin shows great promise to address the shortcomings of current R2*-MRI methods. By addressing the confounding effects of fat, noise, and magnetic field variations, this single breath-hold method is robust to changes in protocol and is precise (repeatable) with multiple measurements. Preliminary clinical data of the confounder-corrected R2* method demonstrates linear calibration with LIC with excellent correlation. Preliminary phantom studies show excellent reproducibility across sites and MRI manufacturers. However, the performance and reproducibility of this technique for in vivo liver iron quantification across different sites and platforms have yet to be validated. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to validate rapid confounder-corrected R2*-MRI as a biomarker for liver iron overload in a multi-center study (participating sites: Stanford, UT-Southwestern, Johns Hopkins and UW-Madison), including the three main MRI vendors (GE, Siemens and Philips) at different field strengths (1.5T and 3T), in adults and pediatrics with live iron overload. Specifically, we aim to establish the [1] precision and [2] robustness of confounder-corrected R2*-MRI, [3] to calibrate R2* MRI to LIC at 1.5T and 3.0T, and [4] to establish the reproducibility of R2* across manufacturer and site. Successful validation of confounder-corrected R2*-MRI is needed to translate this method into a biomarker that is independent of site, platform, and scan parameters, and would provide a universal and standardized method to assess body iron content with widespread impact and clinical applicability."
"9354267","Data from fluid biomarker studies have been critical for defining Alzheimer disease (AD) as a continuum, with pathology developing decades prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms which eventually progress to dementia at the end stage of the disease. This concept is impacting disease nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, prognostic potential, and clinical trial design. Revisions in diagnostic criteria to incorporate biomarker results have recently been proposed in order to increase the confidence of AD as the underlying etiology of a clinical impairment and to permit a diagnosis of AD across the disease continuum, eventually perhaps in the asymptomatic period. Individuals in this ?preclinical? stage are receiving intense focus as a targeted population for secondary prevention trials aimed at identifying disease-modifying therapies that have the best chance of preserving normal cognitive function. The ACS Biomarker Core (Core C) implements well-established and efficient workflows and standard operating procedures for the standardized collection, storage, tracking and sharing of fasted CSF and plasma samples and associated data. Data from samples obtained to date have identified biomarker abnormalities that characterize preclinical AD and have shed preliminary light on the rates of change of these biomarkers in relation to their clinical consequences (i.e., progression from cognitive normality to abnormality). Having already obtained CSF and plasma samples (>600 each) from 337 unique ACS participants (longitudinal samples from 187) who are largely middle-aged, through continued collection of samples (and providing them to Project 2 and other qualified investigators), we will be able to assess whether the biomarker changes initially observed during middle-age are predictive of greater rates of change at older ages and ultimately cognitive decline and progression to dementia. Furthermore, as one of the leading groups in fluid biomarker discovery and world-wide standardization efforts, we will continue to participate in ongoing and future collaborative (and internal) projects involving the performance of current and future biomarker candidates and their assays. Aim 1. Continue to maintain and grow a biorepository of fasted CSF and plasma for present and future studies of aging and AD. Aim 2. Coordinate the distribution of CSF and plasma samples to qualified investigators. Aim 3. Participate in studies regarding fluid biomarker assay development/validation and protocol quality control and standardization efforts."
"9403816","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to take advantage of a unique opportunity to study cognition and its relation to other domains in a large untreated sample of individuals with psychosis (IWP), within an ethically appropriate context that is unlikely to continue to be available. After the onset of psychosis, studies of cognition in treated IWP suggest persisting deficits in many SCZ patients; these are present in bipolar affective psychoses to a somewhat lesser extent, indicating a continuum of severity in psychosis. To address this, we propose to study cognition among a large sample (n=500) of completely untreated IWP, assessed prior to AP treatment, within Ningxia Province who span a wide age range (21 to 65) and are community sampled. Ningxia is among the most poor and remote provinces in China, where the 686 Program has not fully penetrated but where identification of untreated cases is increasing. A community sampled comparison group of treated IWP's (n=500) (matched on locale, gender, age, and duration of illness) will also be recruited. Our goal is to illuminate the natural course of cognition and its relation to symptoms and functioning, in the absence of medication effects. We possess an unprecedented opportunity to do so within the 686 national treatment program. Our multidisciplinary research team is comprised of world-recognized experts from the fields of epidemiology, clinical psychology, and psychiatry. Building upon a history of successful collaborations, each investigator brings extensive capacity-building experience to execute this challenging project. A major goal is also to train a new cohort of investigators in Ningxia Province to increase capacity to intervene with untreated psychosis, thus serving as a model for scale-up for the 686 program."
"9298651","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the project is to develop a general optical imaging technology for studying vital small bio-molecules (e.g., amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, glucose, neurotransmitters and drugs) inside live cells and tissues, an important but otherwise intractable goal. To do so, we propose to couple the emerging stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, which is capable of producing concentration maps of chemical bonds in biological samples, with three distinct classes of small vibrational tags with characteristic Raman transitions, including alkyne moieties (i.e., C¿C triple bond), deuterium isotope and 13C isotope. While alkyne tags are generally applicable to any small biomolecules, deuterium isotope and 13C isotope will be particularly useful for labeling amino acids. When spectrally targeting these vibrational tags labeled to small bio-molecules, SRS microscopy is ideally suited for probing functional metabolism of living systems at microscopic level, as proved in our recent publications.  We have laid out systematic plans as to how to crystallize this concept into a mature and general technical platform. Accompanied by the technical development, several biomedical applications are being proposed (some with exciting preliminary data) including imaging neurogenesis in living brain tissues by monitoring the metabolic incorporation of alkyne-tagged deoxyribonucleoside into newly born neurons, multicolor chemical imaging by developing a color palette of metabolite library, monitoring protein synthesis in nervous systems with deuterium-labeled amino acids, and probing intracellular protein degradation during Huntingtin aggregation with 13C-labeled phenylalanine.  If successfully implemented, we will establish a new imaging platform of bioorthogonal nonlinear Raman microscopy that could allow us to interrogate a broad spectrum of small bio-molecules with superb sensitivity, specificity, biocompatibility and multiplex ability. The resulting bioorthogonal nonlinear Raman microscopy might do for small bio-molecules what fluorescence imaging of organic dyes and fluorescent proteins has done for larger molecular species, bringing small bio-molecules under the illumination of modern light microscopy."
"9348881","The overall number of people living with HIV-1 continues to increase worldwide. With no prospect for an effective vaccine, treating infected individuals and preventing HIV transmission from infected to uninfected individuals becomes increasingly important. Commensal bacteria that can impact systemic immunity are often involved as the first defense against viral infections. Given this knowledge, we were the first to identify a group of oligosaccharide molecules (termed CC5Ap) associated with the oral commensal bacterium Streptococcus cristatus CC5A, and found that it enhanced the expression of A3G/F and MX2, and inhibited HIV-1 replication in target cells, such as monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MD-DC). We hypothesize that CC5Ap may serve as a potential agent to prevent/treat HIV/AIDS based on its actions toward increasing the levels of A3G/F and MX2. In this application, we propose to test this hypothesis by the following three specific aims: (1) Lead compound screening and structural activity relationship (SAR) study of the lead compound for potential novel anti-HIV drug development. (2) Explore the mechanism of the lead compound in inhibiting HIV-1 replication. (3) Determine the antiviral potency and cytotoxicity of the lead compound using human cervical explants. This study will provide vital information regarding the potential of the lead compound to be a candidate for developing an anti-HIV- 1/AIDS drug, which synergistically targets both early and late stages of HIV-1 replication. As there is no clinically approved anti-HIV-1 drug based on boosting host innate immunity, this work will facilitate the development of a new class of HIV-1 antivirals."
"9302260","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adoptive immunotherapy approaches for cancer treatment are limited by the exhaustive activation protocols necessary for sufficient T cell expansion. The resultant tumor-specific CD8 cell population is in a hyporeactive state, characterized by reduced cytokine polyfunctionality, upregulation of inhibitory receptors, and decreased proliferative capacity. Less terminally differentiated cells - that is cells that still hve polyfunctionality and proliferative potential - have been linked to greater efficacy in clinical trals. The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the role of a novel target, sprouty2, in rescuin chronically activated CD8 cell effector functions in adoptive immunotherapy through the development of an innovative dual-acting artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC). Sprouty2 (SPRY2) has been identified as a negative regulator of polyfunctionality in chronically activated HIV-specific CD8 cells, and its knockdown restores these effector functions. The engineered platform will function in two capabilities: 1) stimulate a single clone of tumor-targeting CD8 cell to attack and destroy cancer cells and 2) specifically knockdown an inhibitory molecule, SPRY2, in only these tumor-specific cells capable of interacting with the aAPC. The ability to knockdown SPRY2 expression in a monoclonal population of tumor-targeting CD8 cells may improve ACT efficacy while reducing or minimizing off-target effects associated with systemic immune activation.  To accomplish these goals, the project will progress in three phases. First will be th synthesis and optimization of a dual-acting nano-aAPC. The aAPC will be capable of extracellular activation through the formation of signaling complexes with the CD8 cell and subsequent internalization and transfection of the tumor-specific CD8 cell clone. The aAPC will consist of a polymeric core and encapsulated siRNA which will be optimized based on transfection efficiency, cytotoxicity, and proliferative capacity, and will be functionalized with he two necessary signals for T cell activation - signal 1 MHC dimer loaded with a tumor antigen and signal 2 anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody. Phase 2 will involve targeted SPRY2 knockdown and the correlation of tumor-specific CD8 cell functionality with SPRY2 levels in vitro. Finally, the third phase will consist of evaluating aAPC-mediated SPRY2 knockdown in an in vivo model of murine colon cancer. If successful, the research will reveal a novel target for improved ACT as well as engineer an innovative platform for monoclonal T cell transfection and stimulation."
"9409764","ABSTRACT: The global death toll from Malaria is estimated to be upwards of 600,000 people each year, with more than 1,000 children succumbing every day. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) Sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines are the only intervention in humans, proven to induce robust, high-level (>90%) and long-lasting (at least 14 months) protective efficacy against malaria, forming the basis of Sanaria?s unique technology platform of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved live Plasmodium falciparum Sporozoites (PfSPZ). Among its products, PfSPZ Vaccine contains live PfSPZ attenuated by radiation, PfSPZ-GA1 is attenuated genetically, and PfSPZ-CVac comprises of infectious parasites that are arrested at the blood stage by co-administration of chemoprophylactic drugs like chloroquine. To date, 100% protective efficacy against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) has been achieved in five clinical trials in the United States, Tanzania, Mali, and Germany in individuals vaccinated with PfSPZ Vaccine or PfSPZ-CVac, and efficacy against intense natural transmission of malaria has been established in Mali. Driven by the stellar clinical safety and efficacy results, and backed by an uncommon consortium of international investigators from >35 research groups in 18 countries, Sanaria plans to receive approval for a Biologics License Application (BLA) by the beginning of 2019 for travelers and by 2020 for all age groups and for mass vaccination programs intended to eliminate Pf malaria from geographically defined regions. Sanaria received Fast Track Designation in 2016 from the FDA for PfSPZ Vaccine, in recognition of its progress. In keeping with the aggressive clinical timeline, and scaling-up manufacturing operations, our goal in Phase I was to automate a key step of isolating SPZ from the salivary glands of mosquitoes based on amalgamating and integrating various biological, physical, chemical and engineering principles. Significant technological advancements included the first-ever development of prototypes for batch-processing mosquitoes in two steps of decapitation and gland extrusion and collection, resulting in at least a 3-fold higher throughput with reduced operator fatigue, a 10-15 fold reduction in operator training time, and significantly improved product purity. In Phase II we propose to implement the semi-automated mosquito microdissection system (sAMMS) in cGMP manufacturing, and incorporate further automation by combining novel fluidic, sensing, and vision-guided robotic strategies. Fully automated mosquito microdissection systems (fAMMS) that are compatible with downstream processing will be tested iteratively to meet efficiency and consistency standards for robust operations in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). By moving iteratively towards greater operator productivity, and eventually elimination of almost all operators, in a more economically efficient production process, automation of mosquito discussion will accelerate Sanaria?s march to licensure, and greatly facilitate the increased production volumes required for post-licensure deployment to benefit enormous numbers of individuals world-wide in need of this vaccine."

"9210549","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The overall goal of this research is to determine the mechanisms of symptom maintenance and     exacerbation in Gulf War Veterans (GVs) suffering with Gulf War illness (GWI). To date, the pathophysiology of GWI is poorly understood, and there are currently no confirmed efficacious treatments for these Veterans. Research involving GVs and civilians with similar chronic multi-symptom illnesses (CMI) such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia show that multiple physiological systems are dysfunctional - principally the central, autonomic, and immune systems. Moreover, dysfunction within these systems is magnified and symptoms are exacerbated following an exercise challenge (i.e., post-exertion malaise [PEM]), providing a controllable model for the study of GWI.     Our central hypothesis is that dysfunction across multiple physiological systems interacts to     produce and maintain the symptoms of GWI, and this dysfunction is best studied via a PEM model. Our     pilot data demonstrate that compared with healthy controls, patients with CMI (including GVs) demonstrate: (1) enhanced ratings and brain responses to painful stimuli and poor cerebral vascular auto-regulation, (2) augmented ratings and neural responses to fatiguing cognitive tasks, and (3) enhanced symptoms, increased pain sensitivity, and up-regulated gene expression to exercise challenge. These systems have been primarily studied in isolation and need to be studied under the same circumstances and within the same Veterans to determine the pathophysiological significance of their interactions. The primary goals of this project will b accomplished by comparing GVs with GWI to healthy GVs. The specific aims of the project are to determine: (1) baseline function across multiple physiological systems (CNS, autonomic, immune) in GVs with and without GWI; (2) the impact of an exercise challenge on CNS regulation of pain/fatigue, cardiovascular autonomic function, and immune system activity and symptoms in GVs with and without GWI; and (3) whether interactions among multiple systems significantly explain symptoms of GWI. CNS regulation of pain/fatigue will be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Autonomic regulation will be measured via cerebral blood flow and parasympathetic responses to postural challenge. Immune activity will be measured via gene expression of inflammatory mediators (i.e., pro-inflammatory cytokine, metabolic and glucocorticoid receptors). The exercise challenge will consist of a single bout of cycling on a standard cycle ergometer at 70% of predicted peak heart rate for 30 minutes. CNS regulation of paint/fatigue, autonomic regulation, and immune activity will be measured 24 hours post-exercise when Veterans are experiencing PEM. Symptoms will be measured with validated instruments to assess pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Symptoms will be followed for one week after exercise challenge to characterize the presence, magnitude, and time-course of PEM in GWI. We expect that GVs with GWI will demonstrate dysfunction across multiple physiological systems, that these systems will become more impaired as a result of an exercise challenge, and that interactions among these     systems will significantly explain symptoms at baseline and during symptom exacerbation (i.e., PEM).     The goals of this project will significantly enhance our understanding of GWI and will begin to determine     the physiological systems that are most impaired. Study findings will provide the first critical steps     towards designing treatments for GWI that are mechanistically based on physiology rather than     standard approaches designed to target symptoms. These goals are consistent with a recent Institute of Medicine evidence-based review (IOM, 2014) of treatment options for Veterans of Gulf, Iraq,and Afghanistan citing the need for individualized treatments that are specific to the Veteran. This treatment approach cannot be realized without first determining the pathophysiology of GWI - the primary goal of the proposed research."
"9277462","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic dysfunction of external urethral sphincter (EUS) contraction and relaxation is a consequence of neurological pathology such as detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (increase of urethral resistance during voiding) after spinal cord injury (SCI) that disrupts central nervous system regulation of micturition reflexes. This results in dys-coordination between detrusor and EUS. A variety of neuromodulation approaches are developed to modulate the lower urinary tract (LUT) function by targeting the Onuf's nucleus located at lumbosacral levels. Here, we propose a novel method on stimulating spinal EUS relaxation controlling center by using epidural stimulation (EpS) to modulate EUS relaxation between storage and voiding phases. Spinal EUS relaxation controlling center will be identified by using EpS over several upper lumbar levels (L2-4) based on the previous publication (Chang et al., 2007) and preliminary results. Modulation of EUS relaxation controlling center by EpS possibly facilitates voiding by suppressing EUS tonic contraction, in other words, inhibits urethral resistance. After chronic SCI, a combination of EpS and serotonergic input promotes the suppression of EUS tonic contraction and further evokes the EUS relaxation during voiding. EpS of EUS relaxation controlling center provides the key for switching EUS activation between tonic contraction and relaxation. Functional assessment of LUT will be investigated to provide the information of voiding efficiency in the animals with neurogenic bladder dysfunction after chronic SCI. The proposed study focusing on EUS neuromodulation by using EpS (bioengineering aspect) and/or serotonergic modulation (pharmacological aspect) represents a cutting-edge research approach to improve LUT function with neurogenic bladder, and can be also used to reduce urethral resistance with impaired voiding contractions such as neurogenic bladder dysfunction of overactive and underactive bladders, peripheral nerve injuries, and aging."
"9491993","PROJECT SUMMARY / DESCRIPTION How does our healthy brain grow? The simplicity of this question masks the highly complex and multifaceted nature of human neurodevelopment. Across fetal development, infancy and early childhood, our brain undergoes remarkable change in response to diverse genetic and environmental pressures. Processes including myelination and synaptogenesis are at their peak across the first 2-3yrs of life, contributing to the emergence of nearly all cognitive and behavioral skills, and laying the foundation for future learning and academic success. While the importance of this early life period to life-long mental health is widely recognized, important questions remain regarding the influences that shape brain growth and cognitive development: 1. How is brain growth altered by specific pre- and post-natal environmental or genetic factors; 2. How are patterns of brain growth associated with, and predictive of, emerging cognitive and behavioral abilities; and 3. How are these brain-behavior relationships influenced by modifiable factors experienced throughout childhood? This proposal seeks to address these fundamental questions using a unique longitudinal neuroimaging dataset that spans fetal, infant and childhood development (22wks to 10yrs of age) and contains more than 2500 measures from ~650 children with diverse birth outcomes, environmental exposures and genotypes. Alongside multimodal MRI, extensive neurocognitive, sociodemographic, physical health, family and medical history, anthropometric, nutrition, sleep, and biospecimen (DNA, oral and fecal microbiome, and shed deciduous teeth) data have been collected on each child and updated at biannual or annual visits. Using this extensive dataset, we aim to address our central hypothesis: that intrauterine events, early life environmental exposures and genetic factors influence cognitive/behavioral outcomes by altering patterns of brain growth. We will examine this hypothesis in three incremental steps. First, we will demonstrate that intrauterine events, early life exposures and specific genetic polymorphisms give rise to altered trajectories of brain development. Next, we will show that differing patterns of neurodevelopment are associated with varying cognitive and behavioral profiles. Finally, we will take a holistic approach and examine how modifiable factors, specifically child nutrition and obesity, sleep health, and our microbiome may mediate these brain-cognition/behavior relationships within the context of related pre- and post-natal environmental and genetic influences. This marks a distinct departure from prior studies, which have typically examined these factors in relative isolation and using cross-sectional study designs. Over the course of this proposal, an additional 500 children will be recruited and 3000 longitudinal measures acquired (bringing the totals to ~1100 children and ~6100 measures). This represents the largest pediatric neuroimaging database that spans birth to 10yrs, and the only that includes fetal and infant measures on the same children. This study and dataset, therefore, represent an unprecedented opportunity to examine the diverse influences, and their complex interactions, that shape brain growth across a fundamental yet understudied period of development."
"9398410","PROJECT SUMMARY An evolutionarily ancient strategy to activate innate immune defenses involves monitoring for changes in cellular physiology, rather than the presence of pathogens themselves. Key insights into these mechanisms have come from studies in the nematode C. elegans, which consume bacteria for food, and rely on ?surveillance immunity? to discriminate pathogens from potential food sources. Although several elegant examples of surveillance immunity have been described, the host proteins that sense intracellular pathogen- associated ligands to activate protective host responses are not known. As a critical first step to solving this problem, we have identified a cellular surveillance network that coordinates immune effector induction in C. elegans. These data offer a new paradigm of how immune pathways are activated in the intestinal epithelial cells of a metazoan host. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a surveillance network composed of nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) functions an intracellular monitor for small molecule toxins (or their effects) and engages protective immune responses. In support of this hypothesis, we have made several key observations that provide the rationale for the proposed work: (i) An immunostimulatory small molecule called R24 causes the robust induction of immune effectors via a mechanism that is distinct from known innate immune pathways, but is dependent on the conserved transcriptional regulator MDT-15/MED15. (ii) A single NHR is the central regulator in a cellular network that surveys intestinal epithelial cells for xenobiotic toxins. We have shown that this NHR drives the induction of protective defense responses by physically interacting with MDT-15. (iii) A specific fatty acid, whose synthesis is regulated by MDT-15, is required for the induction of immune defenses. In this proposal, we will characterize a surveillance network that activates immune defenses following toxin exposure (Aim 1). We will define the role of the fatty acid signal in controlling immune activation (Aim 2). We will determine whether the immune surveillance network acts locally within intestinal epithelial cells or systemically in mediating pathogen defense (Aim 3). Mechanisms of surveillance immunity are among the most primitive forms of pathogen detection in metazoans, and are conserved in humans. Thus, it is our expectation that insights from these studies in C. elegans will reveal evolutionary conserved strategies of immune activation, toxin recognition and cellular homeostasis in mammalian immunity."
"9287059","Abstract: The overall goal of this grant is to elucidate the specificity, function and role in disease pathogenesis of an innate immune receptor (CLEC2d) that we have discovered recognizes cellular histones and HMGB1. The importance of this project is that histones and HMGB1, when released from injured cells, at as damage- associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of important diseases, including sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, toxic organ damage and autoimmunity. The study of CLEC2d will provide insight into how these DAMPs mediate their effects and whether CLEC2d could be a therapeutic target to block the contribution of these DAMPs to disease. The first aim will elucidate the function of CLEC2d in innate immune cells. We will explore the hypotheses that this CLEC is important for: (a) the direct stimulation of innate immune cells by histones and HMGB1; (2) stimulation of innate immune cells by histoneHMGB1-associated immunostimulatory molecules (PAMPs and DAMPs), and/or (3) the clearance of extracellular histones/HMGB1. The second aim will elucidate the role of the CLEC2d in histone/HMGB1- mediated diseases in vivo. We will explore the hypothesis that the CLECs are needed for histone/HMGB1- mediated pathology in vivo and the pathogenic sequelae of tissue injury and sepsis. The third aim will define the specificity of CLEC2d, how histone modifications alter recognition and responses, and whether this receptor recognizes other poly-basic DAMPs. Our hypotheses are that CLEC2d recognized a poly-basic degenerate motif(s) that is shared between 5 histones, HMGB1 and some other DAMPs and is sensitive to alternations in post-translational modifications of these DAMPs that occur in some diseases."
"9363776","PROJECT SUMMARY  Filoviruses cause fulminant hemorrhagic fevers with a case-fatality rate of up to 90% in human outbreaks. Although filoviruses (Ebolavirus (EBOV) and Marburgvirus (MARV)) are endemic only to certain parts of central Africa and the Philippines, their extreme virulence and potential for weaponization have lead to the determination that both are high priority biothreats to US national security and medical countermeasures have been prioritized for acquisition into the Strategic National Stockpile. While strategies for passive immunotherapy have made significant progress recently, vaccination remains the most economical and technically feasible approach to protect larger groups of people from acquiring one of these viral infections. While multiple Ebola vaccine candidates have recently made significant progress on their clinical development path, it is unknown which of the filoviruses may next cause a public health emergency. Therefor a continuing need exists to develop a universally safe, multivalent filovirus vaccine that meets stockpiling requirements.  The overall goal of this project is to develop a thermostable, trivalent, recombinant subunit filovirus vaccine that can protect at risk populations against infection by all pathogenic strains of EBOV (Zaire Ebolavirus), SUDV (Sudan Ebolavirus), and MARV. Thermostability will be achieved by lyophilization of the recombinant antigens allowing reconstitution at the time of use. The highly purified recombinant filovirus subunit proteins are expressed from stably transformed insect cells. A key advantage of this production system is the ability to consistently produce large quantities of pure, stable, and properly folded viral proteins. Immunoaffinity chromatography is key for the highly efficient production and is being facilitated by the use of plant-expressed monoclonal antibodies. Unlike other vaccine technologies, the recombinant subunit approach permits inclusion of antigens from diverse pathogens to achieve truly broad spectrum efficacy. Fine tuning of antigen dosing, immunization schedule, and adjuvant selection allow the rapid inclusion of new or modified targets into a core vaccine formulation. This core formulation will be further defined during the proposed work. The unique advantages of our platform are initially targeted at demonstrating feasibility in a candidate with protection against three filoviruses, having a safety profile only achievable with the use of highly purified subunit proteins.  This research is divided into four Specific Aims: In Aim 1, the trivalent formulation will be tested for efficacy against each of the three filoviruses in non-human primate (NHP) models of filovirus disease. In Aim 2 the immunogenicity of lyophilized antigens will be confirmed in mice and then the lyophilized trivalent formulation will be tested against challenge with each of the viruses in comparison to a liquid (non-lyophilized) formulation using NHP models. In Aim 3, we will define the final dose level and test the durability of protection of the final formulation (up to 12 months). Aim 4 is focused on antigen production methods development establishing a fully scaleable and controlled process to generate well-characterized antigen lots of the three antigens."
"9388151","Summary Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp) is a globally emerging Gram-negative pathogen and the etiologic agent of melioidosis, a multifaceted and difficult-to-treat disease. Our knowledge of the factors that allow Bp to resist antibacterials is still rudimentary. ?-lactam antibiotics such as ceftazidime are crucial to the success of melioidosis therapy. The chromosomally-encoded PenA Class A ?-lactamase is the single most important resistance determinant compromising clinical use of ?-lactam antibiotics with Bp. We discovered that PenA is a presumably outer membrane (OM)-associated lipoprotein, one of only three such ?-lactam lactamases described to date in Gram-negative bacteria. Membrane localization of these enzymes and its significance remains a mystery. We hypothesize that because OM membrane localization is not essential for enzyme activity or substrate specificity, it must serve another purpose. Our preliminary and recently published data with NDM-1 carbapenemase frame the overall hypothesis that PenA OM association facilitates its shedding in OM vesicles (OMVs), which can fuse with recipient cells to confer phenotypic rather than genetic resistance on susceptible recipient bacteria thus providing a niche population survival advantage in the presence of antibiotics. A role of a putative lipoprotein that is genetically closely linked to penA in this process cannot be excluded. To this hypothesis, we will build on our preliminary data and use the tools available in our laboratory to 1) investigate the biochemical properties of NlpD; 2) establish that PenA and NlpD are located in the OM and subsequently disseminated into OMVs; and 3) assess whether OMVs can fuse with recipient cells and bestow ?-lactam resistance and if so, whether fusion with recipient cells limited to kin. Studies of OM and OMV localization of clinically significant ?-lactamases contribute new knowledge in terms of antibiotic resistance, its diagnosis and therapeutic development.  "
"9438066","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BD) is a serious and chronic mental illness that is associated with substantial impairment in quality of life and functional outcomes, high rates of suicide, and high financial costs. In spite of a proliferation of treatments for BD, nearly half of individuals with BD do not benefit from pharmacotherapy because of sub-optimal medication treatment adherence. Non-adherence with BD medication treatment dramatically worsens outcomes. Reasons for non-adherence among individuals with BD are multi-dimensional, and it has been suggested that adherence enhancement might work best if the intervention specifically addresses factors that are important and modifiable for a specific individual. In spite of the enormity of the problem, the literature on interventions to improve treatment adherence is surprisingly limited. There is an urgent need for interventions to enhance treatment adherence among BD patients that: 1) are at high risk for future treatment non-adherence; 2) may not have access to or interest in long-term, high-intensity, and specialized care; and 3) are flexible and patient-focused taking into account reasons for non-adherence for a specific individual. The proposed study builds upon the investigator's extensive body of work in BD treatment adherence, and development of a customized adherence enhancement (CAE) psychosocial approach that is brief, efficient, and practical. The investigators have manualized the CAE intervention for intended use by staff that might typically be present in public-sector mental health settings. Pilot work by these investigators suggests that CAE can improve medication treatment adherence, reduce BD symptoms and improve functional status in poorly adherent BD patients. These preliminary findings have set the stage for the next appropriate step, which is testing of the CAE intervention compared to broadly-directed, non-individualized education (EDU) in a prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The proposed study is a first-ever RCT focused specifically on BD treatment adherence enhancement, and will test whether CAE improves adherence and mental health outcomes compared to EDU. A unique feature of the proposed study is a supplemental and complementary qualitative evaluation that will inform future intervention refinements. Taken together, the proposed project has the potential to greatly advance the care of BD patients who are at greatest risk for poor health outcomes, with findings expected to be generalizable across a variety of treatment settings."
"9375268","Overall Abstract Influenza viruses are responsible for a great deal of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in high isk populations. Obesity has been associated with increased severity of influenza infection and decreased response to influenza vaccines in both humans and animals models. Therefore, it is vital to understand how obesity impacts influenza virus pathogenesis and prophylaxis. Recent evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiome plays a major role of immune function and initiation not only in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract but also in other distal mucosal sites, such as the respiratory tract. Indeed, the GI microbiome plays a crucial role in response to respiratory viral infections such as influenza as well as response to influenza vaccination. Interestingly, obesity is known to directly impact the gut microbiome as well as increase susceptibility to influenza infection and diminish vaccine responses. Surprisingly, co-housing obese and lean mice for six week prior to influenza infection resulted in decreased morbidity and mortality in obese animals while enhancing morbidity and mortality in the lean mice. Given that obesity is known to impact the GI microbiome, which in turn has been shown to be important for primary and vaccine-induced responses to respiratory tract infections including influenza virus, we hypothesize that altering the obese microbiome by cohousing with lean mice leads to changes in viral pathogenesis and vaccine responsiveness in the obese host. The following specific aims will test our hypothesis:  1. Determine the impact of co-housing on influenza virology and pathogenesis  2. Determine the impact of co-housing on response to influenza vaccination in the obese host  3. Is this really all a difference of microbiome between lean and obese mice? Importantly, our laboratory has the necessary expertise to accomplish the proposed aims having extensive experience with influenza research as well as the obese model. Further, we have already begun to understand the microbiome changes associated with changes in pathogenesis and vaccine responses in lean and obese animals. A unique strength of our project is access to strong core facilities at St Jude Children?s Research hospital including microbiome and animal care resources. Collectively, this ensures success of the proposed projects. This overall research plan will have tremendous impact on our ability to combat these highly prevalent human pathogens.

"9459438","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is increasingly prevalent in the United States. The cellular dynamics that lead from energy intake to complications such as metabolic syndrome are complex and include the activation of inflammatory cells (metainflammation). Increased myeloid (monocyte, neutrophil, macrophage) inflammation in adipose tissue with obesity as well as an increase in circulating monocytes contributes to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but the origins of this inflammation are not well understood. Advancing this research question requires an individual uniquely trained in understanding the interface between inflammation and metabolism. The applicant is a Pediatric Endocrinologist who actively treats obese diabetic and pre-diabetic children. To become a physician-scientist with expertise in metainflammation, the candidate will accomplish the following training goals: 1) To further develop expertise in the use of mouse models of obesity to assess glucose and lipid metabolism. 2) To develop expertise in the assessment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and paradigms of experimental immunology in mouse models. 3) To develop the skills necessary to lead an independent basic science research lab, which includes hiring and supervision of technicians and mentoring trainees in the lab. 4) To develop into a successful independent physician scientist, as evidenced by successful collaborations, presentations, publications, and success with independent funding. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Singer has gathered a group of experts in metabolism (Carey Lumeng MD PhD), immunology and cell and developmental biology of HSCs (Doug Engel PhD and Ivan Maillard MD PhD) to oversee this training. Accomplishing this training will facilitate the long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise in inflammation and metabolic syndrome in the context of pediatric obesity. The environment at the University of Michigan Medical School is uniquely suited to facilitate this plan through its research centers in diabetes, obesity, and stem cell biology. The scientific goals of this proposal are to investigate the centra hypothesis that diet-induced obesity leads to innate alterations in HSCs promoting myeloid differentiation, and promoting production of inflammatory macrophages that contribute to tissue specific inflammation. The rationale for this direction is based on preliminary observations that hematopoietic stem cells are increased and skewed towards myeloid progenitors with obesity. This research proposal is significant as it has the capacity to identify novel regulated steps in metainflammation along with providing novel areas for intervention in obesity-associated diseases. The specific scientific aims of this proposal are 1) To identify the dietary fatty acids that augment long term hematopoietic stem cell myeloid differentiation during obesity. Aim 2) To determine the role of toll-like receptor 4 in obesity-induced activation of HSCs. Completion of these scientific aims will provide the training required to gain expertise in stem cell assessments, generation and analysis of bone marrow chimeras, and evaluation of nutrient metabolism in mouse models of obesity. The guidance provided by experts in obesity-induced inflammation and hematopoietic stem cell biology will maximize the potential for the applicant to be a successful physician scientist at the interface between these fields."
"9271954","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that is mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), disruptin fluid and ion balance in multiple epithelial tissues. In the lung, failure of mucociliary clearance facilitates the establishment of drug-resistant bacterial biofilms, despite advanced antibiotic and pulmonary clearance strategies. As a result, chronic lung infection and inflammation are currently the major causes of CF morbidity and mortality, limiting lifespan to <40 years. ~90% of CF patients carry one or two copies of the ?F508 allele, which encodes a protein that is inefficiently folded, shows limited channel activity, and is rapidly degraded. Compounds have been identified that address the folding and channel defects. Neither provides significant benefit as a monotherapy, but in combination they produce significant improvement in lung function (?FEV1 >10%) in 25% of ?F508 homozygous patients. To reach more patients and increase the functional response, we propose the early-stage pharmacological validation of a novel translational strategy to address the remaining defect - the degradation of rescued ?F508-CFTR. No clinical trials include compounds specifically designed to increase CFTR stability at the apical membrane. Having identified the CFTR-Associated Ligand (CAL) as a key mediator of CFTR degradation, we have localized a critical binding interface, designed peptides that block it, and shown that they act as first-in-class 'stabilizers' of functional ?F508-CFTR in polarized CF bronchial epithelial cells. Preclinical advancement of our inhibitor-of- CAL (iCAL) approach is currently limited by lead affinity, delivery, and limited data on the extent of additioal rescue compared to combination therapies currently in clinical trials. Here, we propose to leverage preliminary advances in all three areas. Our new data confirm substantial additivity for a cell-permeable iCAL in concert with VX-809. With a validated target, multiple lead chemistries, a strong suite of functional assays, and structural and biochemical expertise, we propose an integrated structure-activity approach to optimize CAL inhibitors and confirm their therapeutic potential. In Aim 1, using existing peptide inhibitors with state-of-the-art ex vivo CF patient intestinal current measurement and in vitro mucociliary transport assays, we will establish a functional pipeline to evaluate combinations of CAL inhibitors with potentiator and corrector molecules approved or in late-stage clinical trials. In Aim 2, we propose to validate and optimize the bioactivity of iCAL peptides for systemic or inhaled therapies. In Aim 3, building on a suite o biochemical assays, we describe structure-based strategies to improve the affinity and selectivity of small-molecule inhibitors. Together these studies will determine threshold parameters governing CFTR rescue. Having joined forces to produce proof of concept for CFTR stabilizers, our interdisciplinary and tightly coordinated collaboration is well positioned to obtan second-generation CAL inhibitors with demonstrated efficacy and biological tolerability, while developing a compelling portfolio for the further pharmacological development of this novel therapeutic target."
"9272778","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for pulmonary emphysema, a critical phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, it remains unclear why emphysema persists despite smoking cessation. Emerging evidence suggests a potential role of persistent DNA damage due to DNA repair insufficiency. Our novel preliminary data determined that protein expression of the DNA repair gene XRCC5 is markedly reduced and associated with increased small ubiquitin-related modifier conjugation (SUMOylation) in the lungs of patients with COPD. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) significantly decreased XRCC5 protein, but not mRNA, in primary human bronchoepithelial cells (HBECs). Suppression of XRCC5 expression augmented CSE-induced cytotoxicity and DNA damage (?H2AX) in immortalized HBECs. By contrast, XRCC5 overexpression attenuated the CSE effects. Furthermore, the hemizygous deficiency of XRCC5 augmented emphysema in response to cigarette smoke (CS) and influenza virus (IAV) infection. These preliminary data led us to an overarching hypothesis that CS-induced depletion of the critical repair protein, XRCC5, contributes to persistent DNA damage and the formation of emphysema. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the lungs of ex-smokers with COPD exhibit XRCC5 loss and DNA damage compared with ex-smokers without COPD. In Aim 2, the mechanisms of CS-induced depletion of XRCC5 in vitro will be investigated. In Aim 3, to determine whether XRCC5 protein expression modulates CS-induced DNA damage and emphysema, we will execute loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies of XRCC5 in vivo using XRCC5+/- and XRCC5 transgenic mice, respectively. By achieving these aims, we will deepen our understanding of the role of DNA repair in COPD pathogenesis. These findings may lead to the development of novel therapeutics by augmenting DNA repair (e.g., XRCC5) that may modulate susceptibility to CS-induced emphysema."
"9220725","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         We propose to assess the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimation in veterans without cancer or other major illnesses and compare the utility of using US national guideline estimates from ATP4 versus VA-specific formulations developed from VISN 1 and VISN 7. The core variables that will be used include traditional risk factors such age, sex, race, blood pressure, smoking, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and diabetes status. In addition, we propose to identify the best ways to assess CVD risk in veterans with diabetes mellitus and in veterans who have already experienced a CVD event. We will evaluate the precision and accuracy of the ATP4 estimating equations in the VA and separately develop CVD risk equations using ATP4 variables to evaluate the best approach to estimate CVD risk in veterans. This critical evaluation of the risk of CVD in veterans is aimed to provide effective and convenient risk assessment tools - that in the future could be incorporated into clinical care for outpatient veterans and has the potential to guide CVD preventive therapy within the VA so that resources can be aligned to intervene appropriately with cardiovascular preventive services in veterans at high risk for developing a future CVD event. This proposal has direct relevance to the health risks of risky behavior (cigarette smoking), women's health, and patient-centered care."

"9351281","Project Summary/Abstract Genetic testing is an integral part of the evaluation of patients with disorders of sex development (DSD), and the arrival of whole-exome sequencing in the clinic has the potential to greatly facilitate the diagnosis of DSD. However, several barriers prevent this approach from reaching its full clinical potential. Our incomplete knowledge of both the genes and the specific variants associated with DSD impairs our ability to recognize pathogenic mutations. Despite growing evidence that mutations in DSD genes can produce a broad spectrum of phenotypes, current guidelines recommend restricting the evaluation for DSD to severe cases of undervirilization or overvirilization, resulting in potential missed opportunities both for diagnosis and for understanding the full range of genotype-phenotype associations for DSD genes. Psychosocial outcomes of genetic testing have been understudied in patients and families affected by DSD, and while whole-exome sequencing has the potential to provide valuable diagnostic information, it may not produce a clear diagnosis in many cases and has the potential to add to anxiety and stress. This project will address these barriers by applying and evaluating whole-exome sequencing in subjects with DSD and related conditions. Aim 1 of this project uses whole-exome sequencing both in patients with ?textbook? presentations of DSD as well as in patients with an expanded spectrum of presentations of apparent undervirilization (such as hypospadias with or without bifid scrotum) or apparent overvirilization (such as isolated clitoromegaly). Aim 2 of this project assesses the impact of returning genetic testing results on parents using a series of validated measures, including assessments of anxiety, stress, expectations, and utility. These studies will provide essential information to direct the use of whole-exome sequencing in the clinical care of patients with broad range of conditions that result in apparent over/undervirilization."
"9412338","ABSTRACT Developing an effective vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) remains challenging because we do not understand how to improve protective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. While CD4 T cells and IFN- g responses are critical for controlling Mtb infection, they are not sufficient for conferring protective immunity. Moreover, Mtb impairs DC functions, leading to antigen-specific CD4 T cells that are ineffective in controlling infection. Therefore we need to design efficacious vaccines that induce additional DC-T cell responses that confer better protection. There is accumulating evidence that IL-17 and Th17 responses are important for protective immunity to TB in mice and humans but the molecular mechanisms for Th17 generation in TB are not well defined. We previously showed that an avirulent hip1 mutant Mtb strain induces earlier and higher IL-17 responses and attenuated disease, suggesting that wild type Mtb restricts optimal Th17 responses in the lung. Here we present novel data that links the CD40-costimulatory capacity of DCs with Th17 generation during Mtb infection. We show that interaction between CD40 and CD40L is critical for generating antigen-specific IL-17 responses to Mtb and that exogenously engaging CD40 on DCs enhances antigen-specific lung Th17 responses. We propose to test the hypothesis that boosting the CD40-CD40L costimulatory pathway and enhancing Th17 responses will improve protection against TB in mice and that these pathways contribute to immune control in human TB. We will undertake 3 distinct yet complementary approaches consisting of mechanistic studies in the mouse model of TB and clinically relevant studies in human cells. Using a mucosal DC vaccination model, we will test whether boosting CD40-CD40L interactions improves protection and define the Mtb-specific T cell memory responses associated with protective immunity (Aim 1). We will use a BCGDhip1 strain, which induces higher CD40 expression and increased Th1 and Th17 responses, to assess its vaccine efficacy compared to BCG (Aim 2). To expand insights from mice to human TB, we will use ex vivo functional assays to determine whether the capacity of DCs to promote IL-17 is greater in individuals who latently control infection compared to those who develop active TB. (Aim 3). Our studies will provide important mechanistic insights into how Mtb modulates DC-T crosstalk in animal models and human cells and open new avenues to target host pathways that can boost protective immunity and improve vaccine efficacy."
"9282474","SUMMARY Enhanced activity of the heat shock factor-1 (HSF1) transcription factor has protective effects in a variety of tissue culture and in vivo models of protein aggregation-associated neurodegenerative disease. This neuroprotective effect of HSF1 is thought to be mediated through a stimulation of transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs). By acting as molecular chaperones the newly produced HSPs re-fold or help degrade misfolded proteins in cells that suffer thermal or proteotoxic stress. Stimulation of HSP gene transcription by HSF1 requires its homo-trimerization and binding to sequences called heat shock elements (HSEs) located mostly in the promoters of HSP genes. We recently demonstrated that HSF1 can protect neurons from both proteotoxic and non-proteotoxic death by a mechanism does not require its trimerization and is HSP-independent. The goal of this this proposal is to understand this novel HSP-independent mechanism of neuroprotection. We propose that HSF1 acts by binding to non-HSE sequences as a monomer and regulating genes unconnected to HSPs and other chaperones. We propose that neuroprotection by HSF1 through this non-canonical mechanism requires the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and interaction with the Class III HDAC, SIRT1. The specific aims of our project are: The specific aims of our project are - Aim 1: To understand the role of histone deacetylases in HSF1-mediated neuroprotection. Aim 2: To identify genomic sequences bound by monomeric HSF1 using two separate approaches ? ChiP- Seq and Bind-N-Seq. Aim 3: To identify genes regulated by monomeric HSF1 using RNA-Seq. Understanding the mechanism will lead to a better understanding of the process of neurodegeneration and provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases."
"9305770","PROJECT SUMMARY  Adolescent-onset depression is a particularly virulent form of depression due to increased resistance to antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, the manifestation of depression in adolescence and young adulthood is associated with higher risk for depression recurrence across the lifespan. As a result, there is a dire need for the development of novel antidepressants that are suitable for the adolescent brain.  Adolescence represents a critical period of neurodevelopment. It is defined by structural and synaptic maturation and reorganization within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). During this time, dendritic spines, the primary site of excitatory synapses, are pruned, refined, and stabilized. Research in animal models suggests that structural stability confers resilience to neuropsychiatric diseases, such as depression.  Research using conditional knockout mice indicates that one critical regulator of the neural maturation and stabilization in adolescence is the ?1-integrin receptor. The ?1-integrin signaling pathway inhibits Rho Kinase-II (ROCKII) activity to promote stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. I have shown that the ROCKII inhibitor, fasudil, has antidepressant-like efficacy in adolescent, but not adult, mice. Fasudil also prunes dendritic spines while increasing synaptic marker expression in the adolescent PFC, suggesting that it enhances typical dendritic spine pruning and strengthens synapses. I hypothesize that fasudil converges with endogenous ?1-integrin- mediated signaling events during adolescence to exert its structural and therapeutic-like benefits.  Aim 1 will measure the expression and activity levels of proteins downstream of the ?1-integrin receptor in the healthy developing PFC, a critical step in determining the feasibility of therapeutically targeting the ?1-integrin signaling cascade in adolescents. Next, Aim 2 will use viral-mediated gene silencing, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and 3D dendritic spine reconstruction to test the hypothesis that fasudil?s beneficial impact on the maturation and pruning of dendritic spines in the PFC during adolescence is due to convergence with endogenous ?1-integrin-mediated signaling and synergistic inhibition of ROCKII.  Aim 3 will evaluate the antidepressant-like efficacy of enhancing signaling of the ?1-integrin cascade and will test the hypothesis that the behavioral efficacy of fasudil is also attributable to convergence with endogenous ?1-integrin-mediated signaling to inhibit ROCKII. I will also assess the antidepressant-like efficacy of DPH, a novel activator of Arg kinase, a primary ?1-integrin substrate in the PFC. Lastly, I will test whether site-selective ?1-integrin knockdown in the adolescent PFC induces a depressive-like phenotype.  Positive outcomes from these experiments will indicate that ?1-integrin signaling events may be a viable target in the development of novel intervention strategies for adolescent-emergent depression and will identify ?1-integrin-mediated signaling as a resiliency factor in mood regulation in adolescence."
"9502003","Men tend to store fat in visceral adipose tissue in the lower abdomen while pre-menopausal women store fat  primarily in peripheral adipose tissue in the hips, buttocks and thighs. As individuals age, sex hormone  production declines and is accompanied by an increased storage of fat in visceral adipose tissue. Increased  visceral fat is linked to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities associated with  aging.   We have discovered a subpopulation of adipocytes (fat cells) that are produced from bone marrow stem  cells. These stem cells leave the marrow and travel to fat tissue where they become new fat cells. The  bone marrow-derived fat cells accumulate preferentially in female rather than male subjects, and in visceral  rather than peripheral adipose tissue. Moreover, the rate at which they accumulate differs from other types  of fat cells. These observation have led us to hypothesize that sex hormones may differentially regulate the  pro-duction of different adipocyte populations in a depot-specific manner, and thus explain in part differences  in fat distribution and function between men and women and changes in fat distribution with aging.   This project will test whether loss of sex hormones or their receptors control the production and turn-over  of different types of fat cells, and determine if this occurs the same way in both male and female subjects.  We will also test whether the production of bone marrow-derived adipocytes is linked factors associated with  chronic disease including blood glucose and lipid levels, the production of inflammatory proteins, and insulin  responsiveness.   Completion of these studies will provide a comprehensive understanding of sex hormones in regulating  the production and distribution of distinct adipocyte populations. The results are likely to highlight new  targets for controlling the generation of bone marrow-derived adipocytes and other fat cells, and thereby  mitigate their harmful effects on health."
"9355253","ABSTRACT  The overall goal of project 1 of the University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Center is to characterize the pathophysiological basis underlying the development of parkinsonian motor signs and use this information to refine current and develop alternative deep brain stimulation (DBS) strategies for the treatment of Parkinson?s disease (PD). Parkinson?s disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, yet we understand little about the pathophysiological changes that underlie the abnormal movements associated with this disorder. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been demonstrated to reduce motor signs and improve the quality of life for patients with PD, outcomes vary significantly among patients and for individual motor signs within patients. This project will examine the relationship between changes in synchronized neural activity and motor behavior directly in patients by leveraging opportunities afforded by intra-operative, microelectrode mapping of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during DBS surgical procedures as well as post-operatively in patients with temporarily externalized DBS leads and using the fully- implanted Medtronic Activa© RC+S ?Brain Radio? system. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) identify the changes in oscillatory brain activity that are associated with abnormal movements through intraoperative recordings of neuronal (single and paired) and LFP activity during the performance of reaching and repetitive movement tasks; (2) further characterize the changes in that oscillatory activity in response to pharmacological and DBS treatment that reduces motor signs; (3) evaluate the potential role of these oscillatory changes as pathophysiological biomarkers for use in adaptive, closed-loop DBS systems; and (4) evaluate the acute and carry-over effects of coordinated reset (CR) DBS of the STN on both motor signs and oscillatory activity using the Activa© RC+S implant. The RC+S implant allows for subcortical local field potential (LFP) recordings and novel stimulation paradigms to be administered post-operatively, in the fully implanted patient, thus providing a unique opportunity to postoperatively evaluate the potential role of synchronized oscillatory activity in specific frequency spectrums as therapeutic biomarkers in next-generation DBS systems. The simultaneous collection of neuronal and LFP data during motor behavior intra-operatively is unique and will clarify the role of changes in neural activity, including synchronized oscillatory activity within and across specific frequency spectrums within the GPi, GPe and STN with abnormalities in motor performance. Overall this project will enhance our understanding of the pathophysiological basis of PD motor signs, clarify the changes in oscillatory activity that occur within the pallidum and STN during movement and how they change in response to interventions that improve motor signs. This study will also provide the rationale for the development of closed-loop and novel DBS paradigms designed to induce long term improvements even after discontinuation of stimulation.    "
"9282552","instmctions); The Animal, Cell and Tissue Culture Core (Core B) will be responsible for providing investigators of the Program Project (PPG) with animal models, tissues and cells necessary to achieve their specific aims. Experiments of this PPG focus on identifying mechanisms responsible for differences in longevity between the species of rodents. Rodents offer a unique opportunity for such comparative study of longevity because of over 10-fold differences in life spans represented within a single mammalian order. For example, short- lived rodents, such as mouse and rat, live 3-5 years, while long-lived rodents, such as naked mole rat, blind mole rat, grey squirrel, beaver, and porcupine have maximum lifespans ranging from 21 to 32 years. To enable the study of molecular mechanisms of longevity in these animals, it is essential to provide access to biological materials from several individuals of multiple rodent species. Core B will maintain and replenish, as needed, the collection of tissues and primary cells from 18 species of rodents. The Core will provide project investigators with tissues, cells, DNA, and RNA, and perform mutagenic treatments of cells. In addition. Core B will maintain mice and naked mole rats for the use by project investigators. Considering the effort needed to collect and establish cell cultures from non-standard organisms that are not commercially available, the centralized resource will save time and effort, and reduce costs! Maintaining the centralized rodent collection will also standardize culture conditions, quality control and biological samples for use across PPG projects, improve reproducibility of results and allow the analysis of the same individual animals by several assays and projects, as well as minimize animal use. RELEVANCE (See instructions); The Animal, Cell and Tissue Culture Core (Core B) will maintain animal, cell and tissue collection for the project investigators.

"9235763","ABSTRACT The next goals of INIA-Neuroimmune (INIA-N) emphasize the neuroimmune mechanisms that underlie excessive alcohol drinking behaviors and include the expansion of genomic studies across species, a genomic-based computational approach for drug repurposing, and the development of systems-level approaches. The present proposal falls into the latter goal and also integrates translational and drug- repositioning components. Our past funding period within INIA-West used behavioral analyses of mouse genetic models to show that mu and delta opioid receptors regulate alcohol drinking through reward-based and anxiety-related mechanisms, respectively, and allowed positioning the orphan GPR88 receptor as a novel target to reduce alcohol drinking. We also successfully developed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in living mice that lacked the mu opioid receptor gene. This study revealed the first ever-reported gene-specific functional connectivity signature in the brain in living mice and demonstrated remarkable reshaping of reward/aversion networks. Here, we capitalize on both new knowledge from INIA-N on neuroimmune gene function and our cutting-edge live neuroimaging approach to decipher neural network mechanisms that underlie alcohol drinking behaviors at whole-brain level. Our working hypothesis is that connectivity maps that combine gene × alcohol and drug × alcohol interactions and the integrated analysis of gene/network/behavior datasets will deliver a deep understanding of biological mechanisms that underlie alcohol drinking and biomarkers with translatable potential for patient stratification and therapy.  To test this, we will combine behavioral and neuroimaging analyses of mice undergoing a history of voluntary or forced alcohol exposure. In all three Specific Aims, we will apply a longitudinal design, in which functional/structural images will be acquired before and after a history of voluntary excessive alcohol drinking or upon a forced alcohol diet. A third set of images will be acquired after a 4-week protracted abstinence period, together with behavioral measures of emotional deficits. Specific Aim 1 will set reference datasets in C57/Bl6 mice. Specific Aim 2 will address mu and delta opioid receptors that are responsible for high (mu/reward/nalmefene) and low (delta/anxiety/ARM390) alcohol drinking. Specific Aim 3 will investigate new mechanisms that underlie alcohol-drinking behaviors, including a novel druggable target (GPR88/motivation) and neuroinflammation (PDE4 inhibitors). The latter aim is most novel because neural networks that are involved in the alcohol-induced neuroimmune response are virtually unknown. This proposal follows the natural progression of INIA-N goals toward the clinic. All of the Specific Aims have demonstrated feasibility and fully synergize with several INIA-N investigators, including neuroimaging and drug selection for the clinic. Finally, in addition to alcohol research for INIA-N, the proposal overall will contribute to two growing fields of neuroscience: the development of connectome genetics and translational psychiatry."
"9305041","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a highly conserved cellular program that allows polarized, immotile epithelial cells to convert to motile mesenchymal cells. EMT is fundamental for tissue remodeling events during development, but this process is re-engaged in adults during wound healing, tissue regeneration, organ fibrosis, tumor invasion and metastasis. While the physiological and clinical significance of EMT is overwhelming, the precise molecular and functional features of EMT remain poorly characterized. Villin is an epithelial cell specific actin-binding protein that is expressed in mos significant amounts in the gastrointestinal, urogenital and respiratory tracts. Villin is a multifunctional protein that regulates epithelial cell plasticity and EMT amongst other functions. Studies done with the villin knockout mice have clearly demonstrated that the absence of villin impairs the ability of epithelial cells to respond to signals that regulate EMT, resulting in a deficiency in wound repair and cell migration. Despite these findings, how villin actuates changes in EMT remains to be determined. In our preliminary studies, we demonstrate for the first time that villin localizes to the nucleus and interacts directly with a transcriptional co-regulator, ZBRK1. Furthermore, we report that nuclear villin activates the expression of the transcriptional factor Slug to modulate epithelial plasticity and EMT. Most importantly, our studies suggest that mislocalization of villin away from the brush border membrane is prognostic of increased mortality in patients with colorectal cancer. Studies designed in this application wil test our novel hypothesis that cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking of villin regulates the stability and/or turnover of the transcriptional co-regulator ZBRK1, thereby modulating the expression of the key transcriptional factor Slug to induce EMT. Additional studies are designed to link the abnormal nuclear localization of villin with metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer. Specifically, the goal of the proposed studies are: (i) to validate the molecular mechanism(s) that regulates the cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking and nuclear retention of villin; (ii) to characterize the villin-ZBRK1 complex and its role in the expression of Slug, a key transcriptional activator of EMT and; (iii) to elucidate the function of nuclear villin in the regulation of EMT and metastasis. The experimental approach we have proposed combines mechanistic and functional biochemical, cell and molecular biological studies together with in vivo studies in the villin-/-, villin+/+, ApcMin/villin-/-; ApcMin/villin+/+, and severe combined immunodeficiency mice (SCID) mice to allow us to unravel the complex question of how EMT is regulated. Additional studies are proposed using two unique human colon cancer tissue microarray resources namely, a cohort of 334 clinical trial specimens from patients enrolled in phase III MAX trial and a tissue microarray (TMA) of 29 matched primary and metastatic colon tumor specimens. The long-term goal of our studies is to translate our findings into clinical outcomes to diagnose, prevent and/or treat fibrosis and metastasis."
"9309123","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of our Program for Advanced ReseArch Capacities for AIDS in Peru (PARACAS) is to consolidate a mature HIV research training framework at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH), in which outstanding young or mid-career health researchers will reach scientific autonomy by providing sound evidence for the implementation of optimized and efficient care models that comprehensibly address the fact that HIV is rather a chronic, prolonged condition. Undeniably, health services should foster earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in parallel to increasing retentio in care of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), as this combination preserves and benefits individual and community health. In that regard, PARACAS' trainees will propose intervention strategies built upon a comprehensive analysis that considers biomedical aspects and multidimensional perspectives related with the processes of entry and retention in care, such as the perspectives of PLWHA (adult, adolescents, and children), of their families, their communities, and the health staff. Accordingly, the proposed interrelated training at US (3 MPH trainees and 2 postdoctoral positions) will be based on two pillars: behavioral sciences for a broad, scientific analysis of those perspectives; and implementation science, to assure that the analysis can be translated to specific evidence-based interventions. Because coexistent tuberculosis (TB) and particularly multidrug resistant TB, frequent in Peru, add burden of disease to PLWHA, our PARACAS will also address the role of these infections as barriers for early entry and retention in care. As PARACAS stands as an initiative that follows the successful collaboration of three universities, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH), the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), long-standing academic outputs are also envisioned. PARACAS will enable mentoring systems and promote transformative learning by means of fostering the thinking critically ahead model and stimulating the interaction, leadership, and team work of trainees with complementary expertise and different level of experience, even advanced undergraduate medical students (tandem research groups). These strategies should serve to nurture new incoming generations of physician scientists whose contributions should continue notoriously improving the lives of PLWHA."
"9348649","PROJECT SUMMARY Nerve damage following surgery is a continued morbidity experienced by ?600,000 patients annually in the US alone. Currently no clinically approved method exists to enhance direct nerve visualization in the surgical suite. Nerve-sparing prostatectomy is a compelling clinical example of significant patient morbidity, where nerve damage is reported in ?60% of patients resulting in incontinence and impotence. Development of a near infrared (NIR) fluorophore that specifically highlights nerve tissue in the operating room would have direct clinical translation to nerve sparing prostatectomy through the FDA approved fluorescence channel in the da Vinci surgical robotic system (Intuitive Surgical), which is currently utilized for ?80% of robotic assisted nerve sparing radical prostatectomies (RARP) and will be used for swine imaging herein. Previous work from our lab synthesized libraries of nerve-specific fluorophores that bind to all nerve tissue when administered systemically. However, the prostate structure is highly innervated and systemic labeling of all nerve structures is less desirable compared to directly labeling the neurovascular bundle that contains the nerves responsible for function. A direct fluorophore labeling methodology will be validated herein for in vivo nerve imaging in rodent and swine models, where generation of nerve signal to background ratio (SBR) equivalent or better than systemic administration will be achieved. Nerve imaging in the prostate presents an added challenge as the organ is surrounded by adipose tissue. We have shown that fluorophores with physiochemical properties in the range to cross the blood nerve barrier (BNB) also often exhibit lipophilicity and adipose accumulation upon systemic administration. We have established that co-administration of a spectrally distinct, non-specific fluorophore can be used to differentiate specific and non-specific tissue uptake. This strategy will be investigated, where we will examine the co-administration of spectrally distinct NIR adipose- and nerve-specific fluorophores for their ability to enhance nerve SBR as compared to administration of a nerve-specific fluorophore alone. In the proposed work, we will synthesize a focused oxazine library modeled after our lead, nerve-specific, red-shifted Oxazine 4 fluorophore. The 400 synthesized oxazine fluorophores will be characterized for spectral properties and tissue biodistribution using our previously developed assays. Two direct administration strategies will be investigated in rodent and swine nerves using Oxazine 4 as a model nerve-specific fluorophore to determine the strategy that provides the highest nerve SBR. Dual administration of spectrally distinct oxazine nerve- and adipose-specific fluorophores will be tested to enhance nerve SBR over nerve-specific fluorophore administration alone. NIR oxazine fluorophores will be formulated for in vivo studies, where the optimized direct administration strategy will be used in rodents. Quantified rodent nerve SBR will be used to select the formulated NIR oxazines to scale to swine studies, which will be conducted in collaboration with Intuitive Surgical using the fluorescence channel in a da Vinci surgical robot."
"9272845","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tumor growth requires high energy and nutrient supplies. As a result, cancer cells usually undergo various types of metabolic stress. Overcoming metabolic stress is a critical step in cancer development. However, how cancer cells engage strategies of metabolic adaptation to survive and grow under metabolic stress is not well understood. Our long-term goal is to study key signaling pathways in metabolic stress response in the context of cancer development, so as to enable the medical community to rationally target such pathways in the treatment of human cancers. The objective of this application is to study the roles of FoxO transcription factors (FoxOs) in energy stress response and tumor suppression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Our extensive preliminary data support the central hypothesis of our proposal that FoxO-BNIP3 axis plays a dual role in inhibiting both cell growth (cell size increase) and cell survival in response to energy stress, and loss of FoxOs or BNIP3 is one important strategy renal cancer cells adapt to energy stress during tumor development. The rationale for the proposed research is that studying the roles of FoxO signaling in energy stress response and renal tumor suppression will advance our understanding of how renal cancer cells bypass energy stress to survive and grow, and will provide important insights on the development of novel therapeutic strategies or prognostic markers targeting metabolic stress in renal cancer treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine the regulation and mechanisms of FoxO signaling in energy stress response in renal cancer cells. Specific Aim 2. To determine the roles of FoxOs and BNIP3 in mTORC1 inhibition and renal tumor suppression in vivo. With respect to expected outcomes, our proposed studies will identify novel mechanisms of energy stress pathways, clarify the tumor suppression function of FoxO and BNIP3 in renal cancer, and provide important insights on the use of FoxO/BNIP3 expression in prognostic stratification of renal cancer patients. Our proposal is highly innovative, because it focuses on a previously unexplored pathway that fills in the current gap to link energy stress to renal tumor development. Our proposed studies will have significant impact on both understanding the fundamental mechanisms of energy stress signaling and manipulating energy stress pathways clinically in the stratification and treatment of human cancer patients."
"9307792","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PaCa) is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the United States and 8th leading cause worldwide. However, if caught at an early stage, there exist effective surgical treatments. A major difficulty with this is the lck established prevention and screening strategies. Here we propose to discover important genetic risk factors to aid in such a strategy, using exome and targeted sequencing of 4,400 pancreatic cases and 4,400 matched controls of European descent. To manage the cost of sequencing such large portions of the genome, we employ the following 2-stage study design, encompassing our first two aims: (1) deep discovery across whole exomes, followed by (2) targeted sequencing of genes deemed most promising in the first stage. This design retains high power (>90%) to identify genes with moderate risk variation for PaCa, based on the patterns of variation discovered in real studies of breast cancer. In our third aim (3) we propose to quantify somatic mutational load in genes identified from large studies of PaCa genomes, using existing tumor tissue. This somatic variation will be paired to whole-exomes sequenced in Aim 1 to elucidate host-tumor genomic interactions. Our proposed work leverages a strong environment of sample resources at MD Anderson Cancer Center and a well-constructed team of diverse expertise spanning fields of Epidemiology, Genomics, Pathology, Surgery and Computational Human Genetics. The analytical methods we propose will be conducted by leading experts in statistical genetics, who have made major contributions to the development of these techniques. Based on previous studies of familial aggregation of PaCa, and the relative paucity of findings to date from genome-wide association studies, we expect there to be numerous genes with rare variation of intermediate to high risk for PaCa. Given the epidemiological and demographic data, our 2-stage study design and large patient resource, our study is well powered for successful identification of these genes. These results will offer new insights in the etiology of this dreaded and deadly disease."
"9402386","A critical barrier to progress in overcoming azole antifungal resistance in Candida albicans is the lack of a complete understanding of its molecular and genetic basis because the known mechanisms of resistance do not fully explain resistance observed among many clinical isolates. Our goal is to advance the treatment of Candida infections by identifying novel azole resistance mechanisms that can be exploited to ultimately overcome this problem. Our central hypothesis is that azole resistance in clinical isolates of C. albicans is multifactorial and involves complex genetic changes that 1) alter azole target binding, 2) activate transcriptional programs that impart resistance, and 3) reduce azole uptake. Our objectives are to 1) delineate the effects of clinically relevant mutations in ERG11, alone and in combination, on the activity of its gene product, fitness, and azole susceptibility, 2) determine the clinical significance of novel Zn(2)Cys6 transcription factors (ZCFs) that influence azole susceptibility, and 3) to discover the determinants of reduced azole import and their contribution to azole resistance in clinical isolates. Our preliminary data suggest that different ERG11 mutations diversely affect sterol demethylase activity, including alterations of catalytic efficiency, target binding kinetics, and reaction velocity. We have also observed that artificial activation of a distinct set of ZCFs in C. albicans increases azole resistance. We have identified azole-resistant clinical isolates that exhibit transcriptional profiles consistent with activation of these ZCFs and that contain candidate activating mutations in these ZCF genes. Finally, we have demonstrated that C. albicans takes up fluconazole by energy- independent facilitated diffusion. We have observed that some azole resistant isolates exhibit reduced fluconazole uptake. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will undertake genetic, microbiologic, and biochemical studies to dissect the effects of single and combinatorial mutations in ERG11 on sterol demethylase susceptibility, substrate affinity, azole binding, catalytic activity, and fitness. In Aim 2 we will undertake genetic and microbiologic studies to determine if and how mutations found in the genes encoding novel ZCFs in resistant clinical isolates result in their activation and increased azole resistance. In Aim 3 we will determine the mechanism of azole antifungal import and its contribution to azole resistance in clinical isolates of C. albicans. Our approach is innovative as we will determine for the first time precisely how mutations in ERG11 influence enzyme activity, dissect combinations of mutations, and determine the impact of such mutations on fitness of C. albicans. This work also explores novel mechanisms of azole resistance. The proposed research is significant as it will provide the understanding needed to ultimately overcome azole resistance through the development of improved azoles, interference with activated ZCFs, and enhancement of azole uptake. By fully understanding the genetic basis of azole resistance it will be possible to eventually develop non-culture based strategies to rapidly and accurately detect azole resistance in clinical isolates."
"9411303","In the US only 30% of all HIV-infected (HIV+) persons are engaged in HIV care and on ART. Accordingly, key to addressing the US HIV epidemic is to identify out-of-care HIV+ persons and to link them into sustainable care. Criminal justice involvement (CJI) is endemic to communities most affected by the HIV epidemic and it creates barriers to HIV care. On the other hand, CJI?and specifically incarceration?presents opportunities to identify out-of-care HIV+ persons and facilitate their return to care. Most incarcerations occur in jails: county- or municipal-operated facilities that house pretrial detainees and inmates sentenced to ? 1 year. Research examining continuity of care among jail inmates has been limited to large urban jails, predominantly in the Northeast. Little HIV research among jail inmates has been conducted in the South, a region with small and mid-sized rural jails and a disproportionately high number of HIV deaths. As a result, a substantial gap exists in elucidating the epidemiology of HIV in jails and identifying opportunities to maintain and re-establish care in this setting. Statewide repositories of jail medical records could facilitate the analysis of HIV care across representative samples of jails, but given jails? local, independent operation, such repositories do not exist.  In response, we propose a Big Data solution: creation of a de-identified database integrating 1) individual- level, inmate records published daily on jail websites and retrieved using a web-scraping program that automates data collection and 2) confidential HIV diagnosis and care records maintained by the state department of public health (DPH). The integrated data will be used to assess the burden of HIV among jail inmates and their continuity of HIV care as they transition between jail and the community. Beyond population- level surveillance, a real-time version of our database that retains personal identifiers could be used by DPH to identify HIV+ jail inmates not engaged in care prior to or during incarceration, and state disease specialists could then intervene to coordinate receipt of HIV care in jail and linkage to community care at release. However, use of a surveillance database with identifiers raises several ethical considerations.  Accordingly, for HIV+ inmates incarcerated in southern state with a large and heterogeneous array of jails, we will: 1) Develop a highly novel, de-identified database combining jail and state HIV records; 2) Use the de- identified database to examine burden of known HIV in county jails, assess inmates? use of HIV services before, during and after incarceration, and identify inmate and facility factors associated with (dis)continuity of care; and 3) Explore HIV+ inmates?, jailors?, and other stakeholders? perspectives on the use of inmates? anonymized data for HIV surveillance and the potential use of their identifiable data to enhance receipt of care during incarceration and after release. Our proposed Big Data project will identify jails which would benefit from greater HIV resources, and explore the potential pitfalls and strengths of leveraging identifiable, sensitive data to improve continuity of care and reduce HIV infectivity among jail inmates."

The large CPC research portfolio (over 250 million dollars expended in the last 5 years) has three Primary Research Areas (PRAs): Demography, Sexual and Reproductive Health, and Population Health. Each PRA addresses a set of important contemporary research questions. CPC's contributions in these PRAs are linked and strengthened by three cross-cutting signature research approaches that have historically distinguished, and continue to define, CPC research: (1) multiple level in approach and multidisciplinary in collaboration, (2) use of longitudinal research design and analysis, and (3) the evaluation of interventions in complex settings. Each of these signature approaches addresses a critical barrier in population science. The support requested in this application will facilitate research in the PRAs by strengthening infrastructure that supports CPC's signature research approaches. Frequently the work in the PRAs and the signature research approaches are employed in the design, collection, dissemination, and analysis of large, population-based, longitudinal public use datasets (e.g., representing cohorts in the U.S., Russia, China, and the Philippines) that include factors from multiple levels (from cells to society). These data overcome a critical barrier in population science - data that did not include information at the genetic and cellular level. The infrastructure for which CPC requests support contributes to four cores that collectively produce an environment conducive to innovative population science research and an institutional infrastructure that empowers CPC Fellows to tackle challenging questions. The Administrative Core provides the Center's leadership and oversees efficient and cost-effective management of Center resources while building synergies across cores and reducing administrative burden so researchers can focus on science. The Development Core supports CPC Fellows and research projects through seed grants at key junctures in the career life course and project life cycle, respectively. This core channels a largr share of resources to junior Fellows; a key mechanism is the Summer-in-Residence Program which offers structured assistance to junior Fellows as they prepare their first NIH applications. The Research Services Core enables the Fellows to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional technical support. The Public Core is a virtual center aimed at an external global constituency of population scientists, policy makers, and the public at large. This core responds to contemporary expectations that research should be linked to real-world problems, that potential solutions should be considered, and that the methods and data used as evidence should be widely accessible. CPC has a long history of collecting and sharing important population data. The Public Core's central aim is to develop tools and best practices for data dissemination while ensuring data security."

"9282458","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Proper cellular function requires efficient folding of cellular proteins. In the cell, protein folding starts co-translationally, concomitantly with protein synthesis by the ribosome, following pathways that can be distinct from the refolding of full-length proteins in vitro. The average, bulk translation rate in E. coli is -20 aa/sec, but this rate can vary by more than an order of magnitude for the translation of specific mRNA sequences. Recent results have highlighted that altering the translation rate of small portions of some genes can significantly affect the folding efficiency of the encoded protein (correct folding versus misfolding and aggregation, or degradation), or alter the partitioning between two alternative folded structures. Yet despite the potential impact of local translation rate on protein biogenesis in vivo, the interactions between the ribosome and mRNA and/or nascent chain sequences that control local translation rate remain opaque. Nor do we know what fraction of proteins in the proteome has co-translational folding mechanisms that are significantly affected by altered translation rate. The PIs of this proposal have constructed a network to span their established expertise in genetics, molecular biology, genomics, biochemistry, biophysics, and organic, analytical and physical chemistry, creating a team uniquely suited to tackle three significant outstanding questions regarding the mechanisms and outcomes of altered translation rate in E. coli. Our network will determine: (1) What specific features of mRNA and/or nascent chain sequences shape absolute local translation rate in vivo, and by what mechanisms? (2) What proteins in the proteome are most susceptible to aggregation or degradation when translation rate is altered? (3) To what extent does translational pausing alter the conformation of the ribosome and/or its interactions with other proteins in vivo? Taken together, results from this proposal will represent crucial steps towards a comprehensive picture of translation rate control in E. coli, and the effects of altered translation rate on protein biogenesis, including the heterologous expression of human proteins."
"9385924","Summary The ability to efficiently compete for available nutrients is a major determinant of success for both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in the human gut. In recent years, there have been monumental increases in our genomic and ecological understanding of the bacterial community (microbiota) that inhabits the human gut, as well as the pathogens that periodically invade this ecosystem. However, functional studies that define the competitive interplay between pathogens and the microbiota are still rare. Thus, there is a need to identify specific metabolites that are important for gut bacterial colonization, along with their sources, and to define how changes in the supply of these nutrients influences the balance between commensals and pathogens. The Bacteroidetes phylum represents a large percentage of the gut microbiota. A defining feature of many members of this group is the ability to degrade a vast array of host-derived and dietary glycans as nutrient sources. We have discovered that the model gut symbiont B. thetaiotaomicron (Bt) and members of many, but not all, other Bacteroidetes species possess the ability to utilize the five carbon sugar ribose a sole carbon source, along with various more complex sources like ribonucleosides. Using Bt as a model, we have identified the genes required for ribose metabolism and have discovered homologous gene clusters in other Bacteroidetes that use this sugar. Genetic dissection of the Bt ribose utilization system has resulted in a working model for ribose liberation and metabolism. However, many questions still remain, such as what dietary and endogenous sources provide accessible ribose for commensal bacteria in vivo? And, how does competition for ribose, or changes in its abundance, influence the competitive balance between the microbiota and invading pathogens? These questions are particularly relevant because the bacterial pathogen enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) has been shown to prioritize utilization of ribose in vivo. We hypothesize that ribose-utilizing commensal bacteria mediate colonization resistance (CR) against EHEC and that loss of these bacteria or disruptions in their physiology make ribose more abundant and promote susceptibility to EHEC. Our preliminary data reveal certain dietary conditions that exert positive selective pressure on ribose- utilizing Bt, while others do not. Extending from these data, we will identify the dietary and host sources of ribose, their concentrations in vivo and further define the mechanisms through which species like Bt metabolize this nutrient. Using competitive colonization experiments between wild-type and mutant Bt strains, we will test the role of Bt ribose acquisition in vivo and probe its mechanistic requirements. Through experiments with more complex synthetic microbiota, in which members can still be manipulated to alter ribose utilization, we will measure the impact of ribose availability on EHEC colonization. These experiments will provide needed functional insight into the pathways connecting diet with the gut microbiota and susceptibility to enteric pathogens and will yield knowledge about to treat or prevent diseases caused by EHEC or related pathogens."
"9380183","The marked rise in rates of asthma over a few decades and the differences in rates among countries and in migrating populations suggest an important role of the local environment, such as diet, in development of asthma. One environmental change over the past 40 years has been an increase in d-?-tocopherol (?-T) in the diet. In our mechanistic studies in adult mice, a 5-fold increase in ?-T elevates eosinophilic allergic lung inflammation (175%) and airway responses whereas a 5-fold increase in another tocopherol isoform, ?-T, blocks eosinophilic allergic responses (65% decrease). In mechanistic studies of signals for eosinophil recruitment in allergic asthma, we demonstrated that ?-T is an agonist and ?-T is an antagonist of protein kinase C? (PKC?). Moreover in our studies with adult humans, a 5-fold higher plasma ?-T level associates with better spirometry and a 5-fold increase in ?-T associates with lower spirometry (10 to 17% decrease in FEV1); this occurred by age 21, suggesting that early in life, tocopherol isoforms may regulate development and lung responses to environmental exposures. We propose a novel concept that early in life, ?-T and ?-T regulate the development of dendritic cells (DCs) and allergic disease. Consistent with our novel concept, we demonstrated that supplementation of allergic pregnant mice with ?-T increased and ?-T decreased pup allergic responses and subsets of lung CD11b+CD11c+ subsets of DCs that are critical to initiation of allergic inflammation. In addition, the inhibitory effect of ?-T early in life was sustained in the pups. In vitro, ?-T increased and ?-T decreased numbers of bone-marrow-derived DCs, suggesting at least a regulatory function of tocopherols on differentiation of DCs. Mechanisms for ?-T and ?-T regulation of the development of DCs and allergic responses are not known. Our long term goal is to identify mechanisms for ?-T and ?-T regulation of the development of DCs and allergic responses. As a step towards our long-term goal, our central HYPOTHESIS is that early in life, ?-T reduces and ?-T elevates mediators that regulate 1) allergic responses and 2) CD11b+CD11c+ DC development and function during the initiation of allergic lung responses. We will test our central hypothesis with the following aims: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that maternal ?-T reduces and ?-T elevates offspring cytokines and growth factors that regulate development of DC and T cell responses to allergen early in life. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that ?-T inhibits and ?-T elevates DC PKC activity during CD11b+CD11c+ DC differentiation and activation and T cell PKC activity during DC activation of T cells. Successful completion of these studies will have a significant impact on 1) our understanding of mechanisms of ?-T and ?-T regulation of DCs during development of allergies and 2) the design of clinical studies with ?-T and ?-T. Furthermore, these studies will provide a basis for design of interventions that significantly impact risk for allergic disease."
"9352332","Project Summary/Abstract Affecting approximately 2 million people in the US each year, concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has only recently been recognized as a major health issue. This injury is by no means `mild' since it induces persisting cognitive dysfunction in many individuals. Moreover, there is increasing concern that there may be a period of vulnerability after one mTBI, during which time a second mTBI may induce greatly exaggerated pathophysiological effects. Despite the impact of mTBI, the field has only just begun to identify mechanisms, especially with regards to repetitive mTBI. Nonetheless, there is mounting evidence that traumatic axonal injury (TAI) plays an important role in single and repetitive mTBI. The goal of the proposed work is to study TAI mechanisms that are relevant to single and repetitive mTBI. This will be done using an integrated approach of in vitro experimentation with computational modeling. Our well-characterized in vitro TAI model has been used to make seminal observations identifying mechanisms of TAI that have subsequently been found in large animal and human TBI. Using this model it is proposed to examine the fundamental biomechanical thresholds that govern microtubule (MT) failure by examining the non-linear viscoelastic response to stretch injury. Since all the individual failure events cannot be accessed in situ, a quantitative ultrastructural computational model of the axon will be used to guide and interpret experimental work. Aim 1 will focus on identifying acute mechanisms of TAI failure as a function of strain and strain rate. Electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and changes in intra-axonal calcium will be used to examine mechanical breaking of MTs and unbinding of the microtubule stabilizing protein tau. A novel computational model, based on the three-dimensional ultrastructure of the axon, identify injury thresholds at the level of the whole axon and nanometer level taking into account MT-tau binding, tau diffusion and MT pretension. Aim 2 will concentrate on the spatio-temporal evolution of MT depolymerization, phosphorylation / translocation of tau and axon degeneration or recovery following TAI. The same in vitro measures from Aim 1 will be used over a temporal time course using identified injury threshold parameters. Aim 3 will examine axon vulnerability to a second injury. This vulnerability will be assessed in relation to MT stability, tau translocation and an axons ability to recover following the first injury. A strain and strain rate threshold for MT failure will be determined. A computational model following the spatiotemporal evolution of phosphorylated densities of tau, MT polymerization kinetics and stress distributions will be developed to predict vulnerability criterion based on stress, strain rate, MT length and time to a second injury. It is anticipated that the data generated will reveal biomechanical thresholds and new mechanisms of single and repetitive traumatic axonal injury that will be relevant to mild TBI in humans."
"9292324","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study will test the novel hypothesis that in the diabetic retina, hyperglycemia stimulates production of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), which in turn decreases insulin receptor binding leading to decreased signal transduction. The overall effect of this signaling cascade would be to create insulin resistance, exacerbate problems caused by limited insulin production in diabetes, and thus contribute to development of diabetic retinopathy seen in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. While our preliminary data and previous reports by others support a major role for inflammatory mediators such as TNFa in diabetic retinopathy, the pathways involved are largely unknown. Our proposed studies will focus on one likely candidate, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) pathway (Fig.1), which is poorly understood in retina and yet represents a promising therapeutic target in future treatments for diabetic retinopathy. Our overall goal is to 1) establish the role of the SOCS3 pathway in regulating insulin signaling (through insulin receptor substrate-1; IRS-1) and apoptosis in normal and diabetic rats and 2) evaluate effects of upstream drug targets on the SOCS3 pathway and their downstream effects on insulin signaling and retinal cell apoptosis."
"9307136","Abstract:  Cancer immunotherapy has taken center stage in the fight against cancer. The mAb and their related counterparts remain at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy applications. However, new and improved therapeutics and/or treatment methods that may overcome their production, administration, and pharmacological limitations, including the evolution of treatment resistance are still in widespread demand. Key to the development of technological innovations that may overcome these limitations are small to intermediate size molecules with the targeting and effector functions of antibodies. Towards this goal, our research objective is to mimic antibody targeting and effector functions with semi-synthetic peptide-protein bioconjugates. In this application, the peptide sequence, Pep42, has been selected to target the Glucose Regulated Protein of 78 kilodalton (GRP78) on the surface of tumors but not on healthy tissues. The selected tumor antigen, B7-H6, exhibits NKp30 receptor binding on NK cells and immunostimulatory activity by the release of inflammatory cytokines that ultimately trigger tumor lysis and death. However, the downregulation or shedding of B7-H6 from tumors reduces NKp30 activation of NK cells, ultimately diminishing their anti-tumor immune responses. Therefore, we propose the development of new Pep42-B7-H6 conjugates that provide effective NK cell targeting and killing of GRP78 overexpressing tumors that lack cell surface B7-H6. The proposed project will be addressed by two specific aims: 1) the preparation of the Pep42-B7-H6 conjugates and 2) evaluation of their anti-cancer effects. Significantly, the Pep42-B7-H6 conjugates are anticipated to potentiate cancer immunotherapy of resilient tumors that evade NK cell-dependent immunity while providing insights into the production of semi-synthetic antibody mimics."
"9488297","Project Summary/Abstract G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) assemble as oligomers that determine their distinct functional properties. However, we actually know little about how these important receptors assemble, or how lipids in the plasma membrane, where most GPCRs function, modulate their structure and function. What determines the selectivity of GPCRs towards lipids, and the coupling between oligomerization and lipid/ligand binding events remains a key knowledge gap in the field; one that if addressed will significantly advance our understanding of how these receptors participate in both normal and pathophysiological processes. For more than three decades, an arsenal of biochemical approaches has been applied to investigate GPCR structure, indicative of the importance of this superfamily of receptors. However, because biochemical data largely constitutes indirect evidence on structure, there exists a controversy in the field as to whether GPCRs function as dimers or larger, and more complex, oligomers. Here, we propose to address this long-standing debate by adapting new ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) technology, whereby non-covalent interactions are preserved in the mass spectrometer, to determine the stiochiometry and distribution of GPCR oligomers. More specifically, we will apply novel IM-MS technology we have pioneered to resolve and interrogate individual lipid and ligand binding events to membrane protein complexes. Unlike other biophysical approaches, these methods allow us to determine the effects of ligands on GPCR monomers and oligomers with unparalleled resolution. As a model GPCR, we propose to work on the rat neurotensin receptor type 1 (NTSR1), and have obtained proof-of- principle data using this receptor bound to agonist (neurotensin peptide). The native mass spectrum reveals two populations of oligomeric complexes, with one of them matching the anticipated one to one complex. Interestingly, the second complex revealed a unique stoichiometry, departing from previous reports of NTSR1 as being dimeric. Our long-term goal is to test the hypothesis that GPCR oligomers are dynamic and modulated by bound ligand and lipid. It is the objective of this R21 application to lay the foundation for those studies by optimizing purification of NTSR1 specifically for IM-MS to allow us for the first time to resolve individual ligand and lipid binding events to NTSR1 monomers and oligomers. We then propose to determine the influence of different detergent environments on the oligomeric states of apo and agonist-bound NTSR1 to lay the groundwork for future studies of how bound ligands determine how NTSR1 and other GPCRs assemble and function."
"9282635","DESCRIPTION: While long term combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has greatly improved survival rates among AIDS patients, a substantial proportion of HIV-1 infected individuals continue to develop comorbidities including heart failure (HF) secondary to left ventricular dysfunction at higher rates than non-HIV-1 individuals. The underlying mechanisms whereby HIV-1 increases susceptibility to HF remain poorly understood. In this respect, HIV-1 Tat, which is produced and released by the latent viral reservoir and upon its circulation can be taken up by uninfected cells, has received special attention due to its ability to induce an array of dysregulatory events that perturb cell and organ function. HIV-1 Tat has the capacity to induce injury and promote death in a broad range of cells including myocytes, and its expression promotes cardiac disease in laboratory animals. Our recent studies demonstrate that HIV-1 Tat physically associates with BAG3, a stress induced protein which is involved in protein quality control, and modulates autophagy and apoptosis. BAG3 is critical for normal cardiac development and maintenance as BAG3 knockout mice develop left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and have a shortened lifespan. Furthermore, recent studies have identified a potential role for BAG3 in patients with HF as heterozygous mutations that decrease the level of BAG3 have been identified in patients with HF within families who develop a heritable form of dilated cardiomyopathy. Moreover, ventricular myocardium isolated from failing human hearts examined at the time of heart transplantation exhibit nearly 50% reduction in BAG3 levels in cardiac tissue, all of which supports the importance of BAG3 for healthy heart function. At the subcellular level, the association of BAG3 with the actin capping protein, CapZ?1, promotes its complexation with Hsp70, events that stabilize CapZ?1and facilitate its proper subcellular distribution in cardiomyocytes. In addition, BAG3 is an important regulator of filamin and myopodin and regulates protein turnover by autophagy in cardiomyocytes. Our preliminary results suggest that the interplay between BAG3 and HIV-1 Tat impacts the ability of BAG3 to regulate several pathways involved in the structural and functional integrity of cardiomyocytes. Thus, one can envision a model in which the inactivation of BAG3, upon its association with HIV-1 Tat, recapitulates the clinical manifestations seen in patients with heart failure associated with low/dysfunctional BAG3. By capitalizing on the expertise of two groups of accomplished investigators in cardiovascular research and in HIV-1 pathogenesis and BAG3 biology, we will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in HIV-1 induced cardiomyopathy in cell cultures, animal models, and clinical samples. The outcome of these studies will provide a unique set of information aimed at developing prognostic biomarkers of disease severity and therapeutic strategies for treating HIV-1 associated cardiomyopathy."
"9309292","The skin is the largest organ in the body with remarkable physiological and social functions. The epidermal portion of the skin is responsible for waterproofing the body and acting as a mechanical barrier; thus, it is associated with vital functions. Upon injury, the immediate response of the epidermis and its stem cells aims at the reestablishment of local homeostasis; however extensive injuries, often observed in burn patients, may overwhelm the capacity to heal. If the epidermis-driven homeostasis is not restored, the organism undergoes dehydration and increased chances for infection and death. New therapeutic strategies aiming at accelerated epithelial migration and accumulation of epithelial stem cells are in great need to improve the health of burn patients and the achievement of better clinical outcomes. Our research bridges new findings in the field of stem cell biology with recent understanding of the role of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) molecular mechanisms in response to epithelial injury. PTEN was initially identified as a negative regulator of the PI3K signaling, the main regulator of cell growth, metabolism, and survival. By targeted disrupting the PTEN gene from the epithelial layer of the skin containing stem cells, we observed a brisk activation of cellular proliferation associated with increased migration. Moreover, we found that disruption of PTEN from the epidermis also results in the accumulation of epithelial stem cells indicating a critical role of the PI3K signaling pathway in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis and response to external injuries. Here, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy to treat wounds by increasing the population of skin stem cells at the donor site before the isolation and graft in the injured recipient site. Furthermore, we will determine the therapeutic effectiveness of pharmacological action on the PI3K signaling during the re-epithelization and scarring after burn. Human- relevant preclinical animal models will be used to test our hypothesis on the efficacy of the PI3K in the treatment of burn. This application is significant; once that will explore novel druggable pathways capable of accelerating epithelial migration and wound closure, induce accumulation of epidermal stem cells, and reduce the development of wound scar."

"9503868","With the growing social and economic impact of dementia on the society, emphasis is shifting from eariy  diagnosis and treatment to prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia. The neuroprotective effects  shown in animal models and cell cultures suggest that estrogen might be used in the prevention or delay of  cognitive impairment and dementia in postmenopausal women. However, estrogen used as a menopausal  hormone treatment (MHT) in older (i.e., not newly menopausal) women did not prevent dementia, and  controversy exists about whether MHT containing estrogen can preserve neurologic function and decrease the  risk of dementia when administered eariy in menopause. In this proposal, we will assess the neuroprotective  effects of MHT on cognitive performance and surrogate brain imaging markers. This project leverages the  existing cohort of women who participated in the Kronos Eariy Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) who were  treated with either oral conjugated equine estrogen ortransdremal 17(3 estradiol or with a placebo eariy in  menopause, which is considered the critical window of opportunity for estrogen treatment. In addition to  cognitive testing (through Core B), we will consider several imaging markers of brain. First is C-Pittsburgh  Compound B (PiB) retention on positron emission tomography; this is a surrogate marker for p-amyloid  pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Second is the change in white-matter hyperintensity load on MRI over  7 years after randomization; this is a surrogate marker for ischemic white-matter disease. Third is change in  brain volume indices on MRI over 7 years after randomization; this is a surrogate marker for neuronal  degeneration. Each imaging marker should provide independent information on the common pathologic  features associated with cognitive health in older adults. This project addresses an important and controversial  aspect of MHT by determining whether therapy in the immediate postmenopausal years preserves cognition  and neuronal integrity. Since participants will also undergo assessment of cerebral microvascular dilatory  capacity and characterization of platelet and blood-borne microvesicles in Project III, insight will be gained into  mechanisms which might impact progression of AD-related pathology. Collectively, findings from this study  have the potential to significantly advance scientific knowledge and clinical practice by providing insight into  effects of MHT on cognitive health eariy in menopause. Our findings will help patients and physicians make  informed decisions regarding the benefit and risk of such treatments."
"9271173","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 69,000 adolescents and young adults (AYA) aged 15-39 years are diagnosed with incident cancer each year. The incidence of cancer within this age group is rare. Five-year survival from cancer is around 80%, resulting in untimely deaths for one-fifth of a young population. Health services research in the AYA population has been poorly studied due to AYA care falling in no man's land between pediatric and adult oncology, low participation in clinical trials, and lack of data of sufficient sample size for observational studies. To date, most of the relevant health services research on end of life care has focused in the Medicare population. End of life decisions are particularly difficult because our societal altruism to do what we can to save a young person from fatal cancer. To begin to understand what health care utilization is important in this population, we have the opportunity to evaluate the healthcare utilization an estimated 10,725 deaths among 257,400 AYA individuals in the largest available national claims data from UnitedHealth Group. Using an observational cohort study, our goal is to understand to current state of end of life care, defined as healthcare utilization within the last 30 and 365 days of AYA population with a cancer diagnosis and subsequent death due to cancer in 2003-2015, using this valuable resource. To address these goals we will: 1) Describe and compare the receipt of medical, surgical, and pharmacologic interventions in AYA population within the last 30 days and 365 days of life by evaluating temporal trends from 2003 to 2015; and 2) Describe and compare the receipt of medical, surgical and pharmacologic interventions in AYA population within the last 30 days and 365 days of life by evaluating U.S. geographic variation. We will use multivariate relative risk regression models to estimate risks of receipt of chemotherapy and hospitalization within 30 days of death as the primary analysis. Similar statistical analysis will be completed for secondary outcomes. Our proposal will address a significant and important need in health services research for end of life care. We propose to evaluate both 30 day and 365 day outcomes to more fully understand the oncology care continuum leading to cancer-related death and recognize temporal trend or geographic region. With the results from this study, we can lay the ground work for future end of life research in AYA population by providing the missing link What is currently happening in end of life care in AYA populations? With this information, future studies can develop relevant comparative effectiveness research questions on utilization of cancer treatment, develop interventions in the incorporation of palliative care in late stage AYA populations, and align patient preferences with cancer care. Using national claims-based data, we will have the largest sample of deaths in AYA population to study national trends over a 13 year period. We have the opportunity to make a critically important contribution to the field of oncology care of young cancer patients. We have the opportunity to overcome a significant gap in understanding end of life care within the AYA population."
"9206899","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Our long-term goal is to greatly impact the management of dry eye (DE) by identifying novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for a disorder that negatively impacts the quality-of-life of one in five veterans. There is a growing appreciation from our work, and that of others, that some manifestations of ocular discomfort commonly described as symptoms of dry eye, are better understood as corneal pain. While DE symptoms were initially attributed to ocular surface dryness, it is now increasingly understood that some DE symptoms are associated with corneal nerve damage resembling the pathologic neuroplasticity of other neuropathic pain syndromes. In susceptible patients, these pathological changes, including peripheral sensitization, central sensitization, and altered descending modulation, may underlie certain persistent dry eye symptoms; and may explain the observed clinical heterogeneity in DE with frequent discordance between tear film measures and symptoms. Furthermore, we have shown that clinical descriptors of neuropathic pain (burning, sensitivity to light and wind) are correlated with severe and persistent DE symptoms, suggesting that dysfunction in the corneal somatosensory system may be an important but overlooked facet of some DE subtypes. To build upon our observations and address our goals we will undertake the following: Aim 1 will define DE subtypes and determine whether DE patients (334 cases) more frequently demonstrate clinical findings consistent with corneal and/or central sensitization compared to subjects without DE symptoms (167 controls) using a comprehensive advanced pain assessment protocol (cornea and cutaneous thresholds, temporal summation, conditioned pain modulation). Aim 2 will determine the relationship between ocular surface biomarkers of environmental stress and corneal injury (i.e., pro- and anti-inflammatory tear lipidome; MMP-9, osmolarity, serotonin) and our defined DE subtypes. In Aim 3, we will utilize state-of-the-art proprietary Pain Gene Exome Array technology to assess candidate genes implicated in DE; identify new genes and biologic pathways associated with susceptibility to DE subtypes; and attempt to replicate these findings using data from other previously genotyped persistent pain cohorts. These experiments will address a major gap in our current knowledge on DE. Our studies will advance our understanding of neuro-ophthalmologic pathology underlying DE subtypes; and greatly impact this field by facilitating more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and mechanism- based therapeutic and preventive approaches for DE. Ultimately, these studies should decrease DE associated morbidity and improve the quality-of-life of veterans and non-veterans alike."
"9353448","ABSTRACT Ischemic heart disease continues to have a tremendous impact on public health, shortening lifespan and impairing the quality of life. The inability of the adult human myocardium to undergo regeneration after a myocardial infarction has inspired research using cell therapy for myocardial repair. However, clinical trials to date have shown modest or no benefit, suggesting the need to consider other cell sources and approaches. In large animal models, derivatives of human pluripotent stem cells have provided promising results, but the grafts have generally been small, transient, and of limited functional benefit. In addition, there remain important questions regarding cardiac cells derived from iPSCs, including the optimal delivery strategy, immunogenicity, maturity, and the ability to couple effectively to the native myocardium without causing arrhythmias. In this proposal, three integrated projects will address these challenges and advance toward the long-term goal of utilizing a functional human cardiac tissue patch (hCTP) for repair of ischemic myocardium. The first project aims to generate novel cell populations, including induced cardiac progenitor cells and genetically engineered cell lines that will be evaluated for their immunogenicity in a novel humanized mouse model. These and other cell products, including commercially available sources, will be utilized to generate large vascularized hCTPs in the second project. The third project will utilize a porcine post-infarction model to test hCTPs and optimize electrical and vascular integration as assessed by optical mapping technology and MRI/NMR spectroscopy, respectively. These studies will overcome critical barriers to generating large, fully functional human cardiac tissues that can be integrated safely into the native myocardium to provide a powerful new approach for treatment of advanced ischemic heart disease."
"9297099","?    DESCRIPTION:  The vascularization of engineered tissues is critical to the ultimate success of tissue engineering as an organ replacement therapy. The formation of new capillary vessels from existing vasculature, or angiogenesis, also is linked to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including cancer, and is regulated by local cues within the tissue microenvironment. The general goal of this renewal project is to understand the mechanism by which local extracellular matrix (ECM) properties regulate endothelial cell invasion and sprout morphogenesis required in angiogenesis. The investigator has found that adhesion to ECM generates not only biochemical, but also mechanical signals that are important in driving endothelial cell function. Preliminary studies from the investigator suggest that ECM stiffness, adhesiveness, and degradability could be used to regulate the angiogenic invasion process through such materials by modulating contractile tension generated by the actin cytoskeleton. In this proposal, the investigator proposes to further investigate the role of these mechanical and adhesive cues in regulating angiogenic behaviors. The project proposes to investigate the contributions of different matrix properties and their cooperation in regulating angiogenesis using both in vitro and in vivo models, and to examine the role of cell generated forces in mediating the morphogenesis of developing vasculature. The investigator will examine whether these materials can be used to control the architecture of angiogenic vessels. Together, these studies will define the mechanisms by which local structural and mechanical properties within ECM modulate endothelial cell function and capillary morphogenesis, and establish new biomaterials design strategies to promote angiogenesis in ex-vivo engineered tissues as well as native ischemic tissues."
"9292327","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual impairment (VI), defined as blindness or low vision, is a major public health concern. Approximately 10% of the world's population (~733 million) is visually impaired and approximately 660 million of these individuals reside in developing countries. More than half of the worlds' visually impaired are of advancing age (> 50 years). The global economic burden of VI is estimated at a staggering US $2.95 trillion and at the individual level VI negatively impacts independence, diminishes quality of life and, increases rates of depression and mortality. Two of the leading causes of VI, uncorrected refractive error and cataract, are significantly influenced by genetic mechanisms and are highly prevalent in developing countries. This project aims to identify rare functional variants influencing ocular biometry and VI metrics in a large extended pedigree, the Jirel people of Dolakha District, eastern Nepal (a developing country). Over the past 28 years extensive genetic research has been conducted in the Jirel ethnic group which provides a solid framework for additional genetic studies. This geographically and culturally isolated population with minimal inbreeding provides a powerful resource to identify rare functional variants influencing ocular biology. To achieve our objective of discovering rare functional variants influencing normal and disease-state ocular biology we will (1) recruit 2,000 members of the Jirel pedigree to undergo an eye examination to identify the distribution and prevalence of ocular biometry and factors contributing to VI, (2) determine the genetic contributions (i.e. heritability and pleiotropy) influencing these ocular trat measures, (3) localize genomic regions (QTLs) most likely to harbor ocular candidate genes, (4) utilize an exome sequencing strategy to objectively prioritize rare functional variants influencing these ocular QTLs, and (5) conduct a replication study of our prioritized ocular variants in a large independent, population-based cohort (n = 2,200) from Bhaktapur District, Nepal. For this project, an existing collection of genome-wide SNP data combined with a novel catalogue of protein coding variants and our extensive family-based study design is a powerful means to identify rare variants influencing ocular biology. Replication of identified variants will lend strng support to pursue deep gene sequencing strategies and/or characterize their functional molecular properties to further elucidate their role in normal and disease-state ocular biology. The current (direct and indirect) impact of VI is only set to increase with the ever increasing, an aging global population. This project will yield novel information on the genetic determinants of eye-related traits and genetic risk for eye diseases of major public health importance. These new insights may also identify novel, or modify existing druggable targets for treatment and prevention of ocular disease. This is required if we are to significantly reduce the negative impact of VI on human well-being."
"9430555","Project Summary Addiction is a tremendous health and financial burden on our society. A growing literature indicates that norepinephrine in the brain plays a key role in stress-reward interactions that may mediate key behavioral responses to drugs of abuse. A previously unappreciated group of noradrenergic neurons in the field of addiction, cells that project through the ventral noradrenergic bundle (VNAB), are thought to supply the key norepinephrine. The primary target of the VNAB in the brain is a group of nuclei referred to as the extended amygdala. In the previous funding periods, we identified actions of each of the major classes of noradrenergic receptors on excitatory synaptic transmission in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, a major component of the extended amygdala. Moreover, we identified a novel mechanism whereby the noradrenergic system interacts with the corticotropin releasing factor receptor signaling system to drive recruitment of specific populations of VTA projecting neurons. We also identified novel actions of alpha2-adrenergic receptors in regulation of excitatory drive into the BNST.  Adrenergic ligands have been identified as potential prophylactic therapeutic candidates in treating addiction. While results in human studies have been encouraging, their overall success in improving outcomes has been modest. We propose that this is in part due to the many disparate actions that the receptors regulated by these ligands regulate, and that if we could develop a more specific understanding of the regulated actions that were key to drug-seeking, we could fine tune treatment strategies to increase effectiveness. Here, we propose experiments to delineate specific pathways through which catecholamine- CRF signaling interactions regulate stress-induced cocaine seeking, and alpha2-adrenergic receptor-induced suppression of stress-induced reinstatement."
"9234603","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The activity and plasticity of dendritic spines and synapses underlie normal cognitive processes, such as learning and memory and are the basis for the complex circuitry found in the brain.  Dendritic spines, which are actin-rich protrusions that emanate from the dendrite shaft, comprise most postsynaptic terminals of excitatory synapses.  Not surprisingly, abnormalities in dendritic spines are associated with a number of neurological disorders, including Fragile-X syndrome, Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy.  Despite the importance of spines and synapses in the central nervous system, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity and plasticity of these structures are not well understood largely because of the current lack of available technologies for probing these structures at single spine/synapse levels.  Furthermore, the capability to study synaptic activity and plasticity in individual spines and synapses would provide significant insight into the function and molecular mechanisms that regulate these structures.  We are developing novel neuron-glia co-culture microfluidic devices with integrated graphene sensors and electrodes and combining them with scanning photocurrent microscopy to detect and stimulate spine plasticity at sub- synaptic resolution (Specific Aim I).  We will use this technology to record electrical properties at individual dendritic spines and synapses and to examine the effects of different electrical stimuli on these structures.  Since reorganization of te actin cytoskeleton is thought to underlie the activity, plasticity, and function of dendritic spine and synapses, we will explore the role of actin-binding protein VASP in regulating synaptic activity and plasticity (Specific Aim II).  We will alter the expression of VASP and determine the effect on the electrical properties of individual dendritic spines and synapses with the graphene probes.  Moreover, we will determine the contribution of this protein to synaptic plasticity.  The development of the proposed microfluidic platforms will be of great interest and benefit to neurobiologists by providing a powerful technology for investigating the mechanisms that underlie the electrical activity and plasticity of dendritic spines and synapses at a single synaps level."
