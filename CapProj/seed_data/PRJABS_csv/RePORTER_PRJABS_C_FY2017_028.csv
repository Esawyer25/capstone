"9445666","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of our training program is to develop active and independent investigators who advance the field of health services research and provide critical evidence for improving the functioning of our health care system. We request continuation of our previously funded 4 pre-doctoral training slots and 2 post-doctoral training slots, which have been 100% filled since the initial award in 2008. The program will be located in the Division of Health Policy and Management (HPM) in the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH). A total of 32 faculty members will be involved from YSPH, Yale School of Medicine, Yale School of Nursing, and Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Pre-doctoral trainees receive their PhDs from YGSAS. Pre-doctoral trainees complete 2 years of courses prior to their dissertations; required courses are in health services research, statistics and methods, and an area of depth. The areas of depth include 1) political and policy analysis, 2) economic theory and application, and 3) organization theory and management. Trainees also complete an integrative readings course as a capstone to the curriculum and participate in the required multidisciplinary seminar. We also include a Translating Research into Practice and Policy (TRIPP) experience, which is a 4-6 week time commitment (which will vary in time and placement as appropriate in individual cases) in which trainees become familiar with institutions and agencies that are central to the dissemination and translation of the trainee's research into practice and policy. The TRIPP experience is planned collaboratively with the trainee, faculty advisor, and agency/organization and is designed to be pertinent to the trainees' research and subsequent use of that research in practice and policy. Post-doctoral trainees, who have completed PhD or MD education, will be selected based on substantial previous research training and research goals consistent with ongoing faculty projects. The typical duration of the post-doctoral training is 2 years, with the focus on mentored research. Post-doctoral training will encompass 100% of their effort; post-doctoral trainees will have no other assigned duties at the University. The HPM division at YSPH has 5 tenured professors and 6 associate and assistant professors in health services research, and is searching for 2 additional faculty this year. Our faculty is multidisciplinary; we have demonstrated outstanding productivity in mentoring pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees, and we are committed to producing applied evidence for policy and practice. Our funded research projects span AHRQ priority areas and have substantial translation components, making Yale an ideal location for AHRQ National Research Service Award Institutional Research Training program in health services research."
"9236208","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central hypothesis of this application is AMPK maintains the balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion by promoting the autophagic degradation of DRP1. This hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims. Aim 1 is to establish the essential role of AMPK in maintaining the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion. In this aim, we will generate the mice with endothelium-specific overexpression of constitutively active AMPK?1 (TG-CA- AMPK). We will use these mice to determine whether constitutive AMPK activation in ECs alleviates mitochondrial fission and endothelial dysfunction in vivo. To determine whether inhibition of endothelial AMPK activity increases endothelial dysfunction and mitochondrial fission in the endothelium, we will examine whether genetic deletion of AMPK promotes mitochondrial fission and endothelial dysfunction in vivo using mice with endothelium-specific deletion of AMPK (AMPK?1endo-/- or AMPK?2endo-/-). We will test whether constitutive AMPK activation in ECs prevents diabetes-induced mitochondrial fission and endothelial dysfunction in vivo by using streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes in wild-type (WT) and TG-CA-AMPK mice. In these mice, we will observe AMPK activity and mitochondrial fission in the development of endothelial dysfunction. Aim 2 is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which AMPK inhibits DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission in ECs. In this aim, we establish the role of AMPK in regulating autophagy and DRP1 expression in ECs. To this end, we will (a) examine if AMPK activation enhances autophagic activity and prevents DRP1 accumulation in diabetic TG-CA-AMPK mice and (b) test whether inhibition of AMPK suppresses autophagy and aggravates diabetes-enhanced DRP1 protein levels in AMPK?1endo-/- or AMPK?2endo-/- mice. (ii) To define the mechanism underlying the autophagy-mediated degradation of DRP1, we will manipulate autophagic activity and measure DRP1 expression. This will allow us to examine if p62 can mediate the autophagic degradation of DRP1, determine the interaction between DRP1 and p62, and identify the region of p62 that is required for the interaction with DRP1. (iii) To determine whether AMPK activation promotes DRP1 degradation via the autophagic pathway, we will treat diabetic WT and heterozygous beclin1 mice (beclin1+/-, with reduced autophagy) with the AMPK activator, A769662, and examine whether inhibition of autophagy can attenuate the AMPK-promoted degradation of DRP1."

"9274747","Project Summary and Relevance (30 lines of text) Project Summary: The goal of this application is to purchase a 9.4T/20 cm bore horizontal MR magnet as a replacement and upgrade for a 4.7T/40 cm magnet which was used as a shared resource for 13 years at MSKCC for in vivo biomedical applications, focused on cancer research. There are 28 users with 42 peer reviewed grants who will use both the existing 7T and proposed 9.4/20 cm systems. The 4.7T/40 magnet is no longer operational and is beyond repair (please see letter from Bruker). The projects that have previously, and will continue to use the Small Animal MRI Core, focus on a range of oncologic problems, including developing and optimizing tumor models, predicting tumor response, immunology, and developing methods of monitoring tumor and drug metabolism to enhance therapeutic outcomes. The projects are highly translational, particularly the imaging aspects, based on the relatively widespread clinical availability of 3T MRI systems, and the growing (although still limited) availability of human magnets at higher field strengths. The long range goal of these collectively diverse preclinical projects is the improvement of cancer care by enhancing responses without enhanced toxicity, either by improving therapies or by development of early markers of response (or resistance) to avoid side effects and futile prolongation from ineffective treatments. The design and methods of these diverse projects share common principles to maximize the data obtained from the proposed system. Our goals include 1) continuing ?high-throughput?, high spatial resolution animal imaging needed by numerous investigators to evaluate new drugs and develop newer, more valid tumor models, 2) focusing more challenging experiments, particularly metabolic measurements and technically demanding imaging studies, on the proposed 9.4T magnet, 3) performing appropriate phantom and preliminary experiments to determine which NIH supported users' experiments will meaningfully benefit by use of the 9.4T magnet, 4) using statistically valid experimental groups, 5) integrating our new PET insert into the MR studies for truly simultaneous MR and PET; and 6) providing support to our users in experimental design, construction of appropriate hardware, and if necessary, performance of experiments to ensure that they are performed in an optimized manner. Relevance: The applications that will be supported on the proposed 9.4T instrument address a wide range of oncology problems. They include a focus on a wide spectrum of tumors (brain, prostate, breast, sarcomas, lung, colon cancers), addressing a variety of clinically relevant physiological problems in oncology (hypoxia, blood flow, drug delivery, the need for better tumor model systems, improvements in imaging, metabolism, immunology etc). The approaches to addressing these problems are quite varied but share the goal of translation from preclinical to the clinical realm."
"9326625","Abstract  The liver is the most regenerative organ in the body following injury or insult, however it is unclear how some components of the liver, namely the extracellular matrix (ECM) and resident macrophages, interact and change with aging. Previous work has identified a significant age-related increase in the number and activation of liver-resident macrophages. Recent studies have also identified the existence of two distinct subsets of macrophages in the liver: Kupffer cells (embryonic origin) and bone marrow derived macrophages. No study to date has examined how these two macrophage subsets are affected by the aging process, which may have major implications for the ability of the host to maintain immune tolerance, as well as respond to infection, injury, and other chronic liver diseases. We hypothesize that the predominant population of liver macrophages will shift from embryonic derived to bone marrow derived macrophages in aged murine livers, with major implications for normal tissue functions. We also hypothesize that changes in the ECM, which composes the macrophage ?niche?, will undergo an increase in stiffness and contribute to macrophage dysfunction with aging. To assess these hypotheses, we have devised two aims: to 1) examine the role of cell ontogeny on the observed increase in resident macrophage number and activation in the aged murine liver and 2) characterize the age-related changes in mechanical and biochemical composition of liver ECM and the effect on the liver-resident macrophages. Our innovative approach involves a transdisciplinary research and mentoring team including basic scientists and engineers using advanced models and techniques such as bone marrow chimeric mice, whole organ decellularization, and biomimetic scaffolds to address our research question. It is critically important to understand how liver macrophage phenotype and function as well as the liver ECM change during aging, and the reciprocal regulation between these two tissue components, to devise new therapies to reduce age-related inflammation and extend healthy aging."
"9252519","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 4-year career development award will combine mentorship, training and research activities to enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in the field of HIV implementation science. In the latter years of this K award, I will submit a competitive R01 application to design and conduct an intervention to retain HIV-positive, postpartum women in care. My prior work found that pregnant HIV-positive women in South Africa are at particularly high risk of dropping out of care soon after delivery, but additional research is needed in order to develop targeted, effective interventions to improve continuity of care. Key unresolved questions that my research seeks to address are the lack of information about the characteristics of mobility within this population and the impact of population mobility on retention in postpartum HIV care. The K-related training program is a critical component of my career development plan, and includes mentorship meetings, didactic coursework, directed readings and discussions, seminars, and professional society meetings. As an epidemiologist, I am highly competent in quantitative analysis, but I require additional training in social and behavioral theory, selected qualitative research methods and geographic information systems (GIS) in order to address existing research questions that will inform future interventions. My K-supported research proposal has 3 AIMS: 1) to determine the frequency of clinic shopping and identify factors associated with clinic switching using existing databases; 2) to characterize mobility and health care utilization among pregnant and postpartum HIV-positive women; and 3) to determine the effect of mobility on retention in HIV care and adherence to ART. Project activities will take place in Johannesburg, South Africa, using existing HIV clinic data for Aim 1 and primary data collection at Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre, a primary care clinic, for Aims 2 and 3. RELEVANCE: My work addresses a substantial knowledge gap related to population mobility and retention in HIV care among a specific population (peripartum women) at highest risk of dropping out of HIV care. Addressing these gaps will accelerate the creation of novel interventions to improve continuity of care for women in Africa. My project aims and training objectives align to enable me to develop the skills and experience to become an independent investigator with the guidance of my highly experienced mentorship committee."
"9268453","DESCRIPTION:         Temporal coding is the ability of the auditory system to detect and transmit fluctuations in time across the acoustic signal. Sensorineural hearing loss and early aging have the potential to reduce the temporal resolving power of the auditory system. The relevant literature, however, shows mixed results from psychophysical studies, speech perception studies, and physiologic studies. The lack of a clear understanding of how hearing loss changes temporal processing (or not) may be the result of several factors including early age-related changes in neural recovery or adaptation and methodological issues (e.g., equivalent presentation levels, stimulus complexity). A series of experiments to measure temporal processing in middle-aged adults with and without high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (abbreviated as HFL throughout proposal) is proposed. This understudied group has been largely overlooked in the study of auditory aging because most older subjects have some degree of high-frequency hearing loss and research is often conducted in low-frequency regions where pure-tone thresholds are similar to those of younger subjects. Presenescent changes have been found for speech perception (Helfer and Fargo, 2009) and for auditory temporal coding (Grose et al., 2006). Significantly poorer gap detection occurs for stimuli presented in regions of normal pure-tone sensitivity when high-frequency hearing loss is present. The proposed research will improve our understanding of early aging and HFL on auditory temporal coding. The purpose of the primary study is to determine the extent to which early aging and HFL impact temporal coding in regions of normal low-frequency hearing. The current study addresses these purposes with the following three specific questions: (1) Is there a significant difference in low-frequency temporal coding between listeners with normal pure-tone sensitivity and listeners with HFL? (2) Is there a significant difference in temporal coding between young subjects (aged 18 - 30 years) and middle-aged subjects (aged 40 - 60 years) who have normal pure-tone sensitivity? and (3) Are psychophysical or electrophysiologic measures of temporal coding related? Four groups of subjects will be targeted for a series of experiments as follows: (1) young adults with normal pure-tone sensitivity (YNH), (2) middle-aged adults with normal pure-tone sensitivity (MANH), (3) young adults with HFL (YHFL), and (4) middle-aged adults with HFL (MAHFL). Normal hearing will be defined as pure-tone thresholds d25 dB HL for the frequencies from 250- to 8000 Hz. High-frequency hearing will be defined as pure-tone thresholds d25 dB HL from 250 - 2000 Hz and e 35 dB HL from 3000 - 8000 Hz. Participants will be recruited from the Audiology Clinic at the VA at Mountain Home. One short-term objective is to acquire a high-level of technical understanding of signal processing and experimental design as well as insight into parallel experimental designs in multiple domains (e.g., clinical audiology, psychophysics, and electrophysiology). The new skills will provide a bridge between my basic research skills acquired to date and advanced skills necessary to transition into an independent VA investigator. A second short-term goal is to acquire the experience needed to analyze cortical auditory evoked potentials, which inherently are complex. Thus, the focus will be practical and theoretical integration by leveraging the expertise of the CDA-2 mentors (Drs. Murnane, Eddins, and Fowler)."
"9185237","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Military activities greatly increase the risk for osteoarthritis (OA). Knee OA, a leading cause of disability, is highly prevalent in Veterans. Current treatment options are limited primarily to palliation until the joint is destroyed and prosthetic knee replacement is warranted. Disease-modifying and preventive treatments are lacking in large part due to a lack of early warning tests that can alert patients and caregivers of the risk of OA onset prior to development of irreversible  changes. Articular cartilage does not have nerves, and thus OA is largely asymptomatic at early stages when cartilage wear begins. By the time symptoms occur, the disease has typically reached an advanced state where irreversible cartilage loss and bone changes are present. Successful intervention requires early detection when pathological changes remain reversible.  Serum-derived biomarkers offer an attractive method to provide early warning of joint distress, and to provide more rapid assessment of the efficacy of disease-modifying therapies than established methods such as radiographs. However, development of a blood test reflecting OA risk has been elusive. Some of the barriers include large inter-subject variability in the nominal resting levels of serum biomarkers as well as the limited ability of systemic markers to reflect local joint conditions. These factors reduce the sensitivity of measuring serum biomarkers in isolation. This study will apply the use of a mechanical stimulus (a 30 minute walk) in the evaluation of serum biomarkers (a stimulus-based approach), to generate preliminary data for the development of an OA stress test to detect early disease and to evaluate the efficacy of new disease-modifying strategies for OA. Similar to what is used in other fields of medicine such as cardiology, where greater accuracy and sensitivity in detecting underlying pathology can be achieved in response to specific provocative stimuli than is possible at a resting state, the use o a walking task to challenge knees with early OA may improve the signal-to-noise ratio for serum markers of cartilage and bone turnover.  Aim 1 of the project will recruit Veterans with symptomatic early knee OA to investigate the use of this novel stimulus-response model to measure the change in serum biomarkers after a walking challenge for identification of early disease states compared to that of structural changes assessed using both morphological MRI and advanced image analysis techniques to measure cartilage matrix structure using quantitative MRI. Aim 2 of the project will use a prospective study design to investigate the ability of the OA stress test to provide an early indication of patient response to a simple and inexpensive load-modifying therapy (variable-stiffness shoe) for medial knee OA. Success of these Aims will provide evidence that serum biomarkers analyzed in relationship to a mechanical stimulus may be able to detect disease at an early enough time point for disease-modifying therapies. In addition, the success of these Aims will lay the groundwork for further clinical studies to determine whether this stimulus-response strategy may shorten the time needed for objective measures of outcomes following an interventional strategy from several years using radiographs to potentially a few months measuring biologic responses to treatment.  It is anticipated that the results of this proposal will provide key preliminary data for the use o a stimulus-based approach to OA biomarkers (an OA stress test), which may enhance the ability to use serum biomarkers in knee OA diagnosis and clinical trial design. The use of such an OA stress test has the potential to provide early warning of the initiation of cartilage matrix breakdown and prompt earlier treatment to slow down the processes leading to OA. The results of this study will contribute rigorous preliminary clinical data important to the treatment and rehabilitation of military service members and Veterans, a population bearing a disproportionate burden from premature disabling OA."
"9361898","The Department of Veteran Affairs is committed to providing cutting-edge medical care to those who have served their country in the Armed Services, and the Office of Research and Development has a responsibility to understand the basic mechanisms of disease, the clinical manifestations of conditions requiring medical treatment, and improvement of health service delivery. This application requests support for shared equipment that provides critical infrastructure to researchers seeking to improve Veteran health through each of those lines of investigation. The research community at the Providence VA Medical Center has a long history of excellence. From the biological bases of cardiovascular disease, to the careful characterization of psychopathology, to the Center of Innovation for Long Term Services, to the outstanding Rehabilitation work for mental and physical disorders the Providence VAMC has been enormously productive in the area of Veteran-centric medical research. Consistent with this history of excellence is the requirement for cutting edge research infrastructure to serve this productive research community. Accordingly, this application requests support for a piece of scientific instrumentation that may extend the impact and innovation of numerous VA researchers.  The instrument that we are seeking support for is a 31-Phosphorus spectroscopy coil to enhance our current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) capabilities. Specifically, this equipment allows for a non-invasive, non-radiation exposing technique for the investigation of metabolism in vivo. 31-Phosphorus spectroscopy uses magnetic resonance signals from nuclei to provide comprehensive metabolic and biochemical information about a variety of bodily tissues. This method is highly versatile and can provide metabolic insights into the role of metabolism (in particular, energetics) in a wide number of conditions, including hypertensive, valvular, and ischemic heart disease, peripheral muscular degeneration, neuromuscular disorders, cognitive/cerebral disease, and malignancy. This method can also be used to monitor patient responses to therapeutic interventions: pharmacologic, surgical, or interventional. When combined with magnetic resonance imaging, spectroscopy enables detailed pathophysiologic insights into the inter-relations among structure, function, perfusion, and metabolism.  Obtaining this new equipment will complement our current MRI research infrastructure that has already served countless Veterans. Examples of studies that will benefit from 31-Phosphorus spectroscopy include Dr. Siddique Abbasi?s work in diabetes and obesity-related cardiomyopathy, my own work in cardiac rehabilitation, Dr. Noah Philip?s work in PTSD and stress-related cognitive states, Dr. Sharon Round?s work in pulmonary hypertension, and numerous other minor users investigating conditions critical for Veteran health."
"9443103","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this Phase I project, Blondin Bioscience LLC, a start-up company in Birmingham, AL, proposes to develop a rapid, accurate and precise fluorometric assay for quantifying cell-free telomeric DNA fragments (cf-tDNA) within serum in order to monitor the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatments. In our preliminary work, conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), we have detected a significant increase in cf- tDNA released from cancer cells into extracellular milieu following chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. We also found a reproducible serum peak of cf-tDNA release following initiation of chemotherapy in leukemia patients. We attribute this release of cf-tDNA to in vivo cancer cell apoptosis. We propose that the measurement of cf-tDNA would decrease the time, cost, and side effects of a potentially inadequate cancer treatment, allowing early switching to a better treatment. Blondin is negotiating an exclusive license for the use of this intellectual property from UAB. Currently cf-tDNA are measured with quantitative PCR (qPCR), which is cumbersome and imprecise, due to the difficulty in amplifying repetitive telomere sequences, and the very low (ng/ml) amounts of cell-free DNA obtained from clinical samples. This new assay will utilize novel, gamma modified peptide nucleic acid (?PNA) miniprobes that are complimentary to the telomeric sequence. ?PNA hybridize to complementary DNA with 100,000 fold higher affinity than unmodified PNA. This increase in binding affinity should allow detection of the very dilute target cf-tDNA found in clinical samples. The ?PNA miniprobes will be designed to exhibit a FRET signal only in the presence of a telomeric DNA target, thus further improving the signal to noise ratio. The proposed research will have three specific aims. In the first aim we will characterize and adapt ?PNA miniprobes for use in a purified model system to detect and quantify cf-tDNA. Test conditions with the best precision and accuracy at the lowest target concentrations will be determined. The second aim is directed toward optimizing and validating the ?PNA cf-tDNA assay for use with complex biological samples. The assay will be validated by assessing the accuracy, precision, specificity, limit of detection and quantification, linearity and range, ruggedness, and robustness as per current FDA method validation guidelines. The final aim will assess the ?PNA cf-tDNA assay in a clinical setting. We will test the ability of the ?PNA cf-tDNA assay to prospectively predict survival in a trial enrolling 30 metastatic prostate cancer patients starting chemotherapy treatment. The main goal of this aim is to test the performance of the ?PNA cf-tDNA assay in a clinical situation. The study is statistically powered to determine if the ?PNA cf-tDNA assay is able to outperform the current response biomarkers prostate specific antigen and circulating tumor cells in this group of patients."

"9332608","Abstract The effects of repetitive heading in soccer, outside the purview of recognized concussion, are a topic of major public importance that has not been well defined. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that repetitive sub-concussive soccer heading is associated with evidence of microstructural tissue damage as well as cognitive impairments. We have found that there exists a threshold number of heads per year whereby subclinical and clinical impairments are evident. Despite this evidence of axonal and functional damage, we have not characterized individuals at greater and/or reduced risk for deterioration from repetitive soccer heading. In this proposed study we will investigate trait biomarkers hypothesized to have an association with neurodegenerative processes subsequent to brain injury. Specifically, we will examine the effect-modifying role of the Apolipoprotein E, Cholesterol Esterase Transfer Protein and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor polymorphisms. Furthermore, we will explore the extent to which the ex-vivo inflammatory stress response can explain the heterogeneity in outcomes. Under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Lipton and investigators with varying expertise pertaining to the project, I am confident that I will accomplish my goal of identifying biomarkers that confer greater vulnerability to heading related impairments. Furthermore, I will receive excellent training in clinical research methods and basic science techniques alike, which will serve as an excellent foundation for my ultimate goal of becoming an independent clinical Investigator.  "
"9261481","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis affects 10 million Americans, and associated fragility fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality. While a great deal is known about the molecular pathways controlling osteoblast and osteoclast function, relatively little is known about the most abundant cell type in bone, the osteocyte. Osteocytes produce sclerostin, a potent inhibitor of bone formation by osteoblasts and an osteoporosis drug target. Notably, the only existing osteoporosis therapy that boosts bone formation, parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1-34 (teriparatide), works in part by reducing sclerostin production by osteocytes. The focus of this grant proposal is to elucidate the intracellular mechanisms controlling osteocyte biology, with an emphasis on sclerostin gene regulation and its control by PTH. Class IIa HDACs (Hdac5 and Hdac4) have been identified as important regulators of osteocytic sclerostin production and osteocyte differentiation in general. Aim 1 will fully characterize the effects of class IIa HDAC deficiency on osteocyte biology in vivo using multiple independent and complementary approaches. Aim 2 will interrogate the role of class IIa HDACs in PTH-mediated sclerostin suppression in vivo. Importantly, though some information is known about how class IIa HDACs might control sclerostin expression, much remains unknown. Therefore, Aim 3 will determine novel class IIa HDAC binding proteins and substrates in osteocytes using cutting-edge proteomic approaches. The candidate Dr. Wein is a physician/scientist dedicated to a career in basic investigation in skeletal biology. His education (combined MD/PhD degrees) provides him rigorous training in basic science and human physiology. An endocrinologist subspecializing in metabolic bone diseases, considerable and complementary overlap exists between his clinical and research interests. Beyond the research proposed within, Dr. Wein's career development plan will allow him to maximize the resources within the MGH Endocrine Unit, Harvard Medical School, and the Broad Institute to achieve his career goals. He has identified a mentor, Dr. Henry Kronenberg, who is a worldwide leader in skeletal biology and PTH actions. Dr. Wein and Kronenberg have a plan for frequent meetings to discuss data and career development. Dr. Kronenberg has clearly identified aspects of the research proposed by Dr. Wein which will form the basis of his independent career. Collaborators within the MGH Endocrine Unit and at the Broad institute have been identified, and an advisory committee has been formed to evaluate progress and plan future directions. Dr. Wein will frequently present his data and attend seminars and journal clubs in the MGH Endocrine Division and at the Broad Institute, and will present his findings at international meetings on an annual basis. Formal coursework is planned in grant writing, public speaking, and computational biology to further enhance his probability of success as an independent physician/scientist. Dr. Wein's immediate career goals include acquiring the skills described in this grant proposal in conjunction with his mentor Dr. Kronenberg and collaborators identified within, and publishing first authors manuscripts in order to gain name recognition and to establish himself in the osteocyte field. Dr. Wein's long-term career goal is to establish himself as an independent investigator studying basic cell biology mechanisms controlling bone cell function in vivo. His PhD work with Dr. Laurie Glimcher focused on osteoblast biology, but at this point he needs additional training in skeletal biology and studying osteocytes in vivo and in vitro. Substantial expertise in these areas is present within MGH Endocrine Unit, a collaborative group dedicated to mineral ion metabolism and bone biology, with close attention to relevance to the understanding and treatment of human disease. Aims 1 and 2 of this grant proposal will allow Dr. Wein to gain experience and expertise in the in vivo approaches required to study osteocyte biology. Aim 3 will facilitate the discovery of new genes important for osteocyte function: as an independent investigator, Dr. Wein will then use the skills acquired in this grant proposal to determine the phenotype of novel mutant strains."
"9249583","ABSTRACT (Overall Component) The overarching goals of our Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC) are to prevent disease and improve public health through innovative programs of excellence in environmental health sciences research, to engage communities to address environmental health issues, and to enhance career development of talented environmental health investigators. The EHSC provides the framework for the generation of novel research findings and their conversion into effective resources for public health officials, medical professionals, and the community. This tradition of success is based on our ability to recruit broad multi- and interdisciplinary expertise, maintain a strong emphasis on basic science principles while incorporating clinical and translational approaches, and effectively interact with the community. The specific mission of the EHSC at Rochester is to improve public health through the generation of fundamental knowledge and elaboration of mechanisms by which chemical exposures, alone or through interaction with other modifying factors, contribute to cumulative health risk across the life span. As such, the theme that guides and integrates EHSC research and community engagement programs is the understanding of interactions of environmental and occupational agents with diverse individual contexts across the lifespan in modulating human disease and dysfunction. The goals of the Center are achieved through a major focus on three research programs: Pulmonary & Cardiovascular Disease Program, Neurodevelopmental & Neurodegenerative Disease Program, and Musculoskeletal Disease Program. While the Center is structurally organized into these Disease Programs, shared thematic biological processes, including immunological responses & inflammation, stem cell biology, early life sensitivities and mechanisms of adult disease, epigenetics, and nutritional/dietary factors, weave these programs together and synergize the research. These research efforts are supported by several structural units: Administrative Core, Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core, Biostatistics Facility Core, Community Outreach & Engagement Core, Pilot Project Program, and Career Development Program for Environmental Health Science Investigators."
"9459108","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to develop an ultra-fast insulin analog formulation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. An ultra- fast pharmacokinetic/dynamic (PK/PD) profile promises to enable superior performance of pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) with enhanced safety and more robust integration with glucose- sensing technologies. Ultra-fast kinetics would also facilitate post-prandial glycemic control following meal- time injections. An innovative structural approach is proposed based on non-standard mutagenesis of the insulin molecule.  The current barrier to more rapid subcutaneous absorption is the rate of disassembly of the zinc insulin hexamer. This rate is controlled by the stability of an anti-parallel b-sheet at the dimer interface of the hexamer. Partial progress towar accelerated disassembly following subcutaneous injection was achieved in the 1990s by conventional site-directed mutagenesis at the periphery of this b-sheet. Insulin aspart (the active component of NovologR; Novo-Nordisk) and insulin lispro (the active component of HumalogR; Eli Lilly) contain such partially destabilizing mutations (ProB28.Asp in Novolog; ProB28.Lys and LysB29.Pro in Humalog (KP)). Because their designs were limited by the conventional mutagenesis technologies available in the 1990s, however, neither of these products could fully exploit structural strategies to promote disassembly of the core b-sheet in the insulin hexamer.  The core b-sheet of the insulin hexamer is remarkable for the confluence of 8 conserved aromatic rings (TyrB16, PheB24, PheB25, TyrB26, and their dimer-related mates). The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of this classical interface is regulated by an intricate series of aromatic-aromatic interactions. We have discovered that the substitution of PheB24 by its non-aromatic analog cyclohexanylalanine (Cha) is compatible with native- like structure and function, but markedly enhances the rate of disassembly of KP-insulin. We therefore propose to synthesize and characterize ChaB24-KP-insulin and ChaB24-AspB28-insulin (as candidate ultra-rapid zinc insulin analog formulations) to obtain improved versions of respective current products HumalogR and NovoR. Dr. B. Frank (principal investigator) was co-inventor of HumalogR during his prior career at Eli Lilly.

We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials."
"9361791","The project is a ShEEP request for a Becton Dickinson (BD) FACSMelodyTM Cell Sorter. The BD FACSMelodyTM Cell Sorter is a high quality flow cytometry sorting instrument, with an automated instrument setup routine, that has the advantage of being easy to learn and use. The unit provides researchers a supportive and comprehensive workflow experience, and is derived from the cited and proven BD FACS Aria Cell Sorter. Typically the system is ready in less than 17 minutes- maximizing uptime. The small unit creates streamlined workflow with instrument settings, as well as gates and sort settings available and retrievable from saved experiments. The cell sorter system anticipates potential issues and identifies root causes with filter/mirror units that communicate with the software to confirm the optical configuration supports for experiments. The instrument will facilitate individual VA investigators with widely varying projects to isolate individual types of cells from normal and disease tissue and study their characteristics, leading to advances in the understanding of tissue inflammation, cancer immunology, and nervous system regeneration. The characteristics of the instrument make it ideal for our VA Research Service because this award will support the work of 5 major VA Merit-funded users (Drs. Hornyak, Atamas, Luzina, Davila, and Makar), and a minor user (Dr. Golding) who is a Career Development Award (CDA-2) recipient. Thomas J. Hornyak, M.D., Ph.D., is the Principal Investigator (PI) for this proposal. He is the Associate Chief Of Staff (ACOS) for Research and Development (R&D) at the VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS), and PI on the BLR&D Merit Review project ?Melanocyte Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine?. He and his laboratory will use the sorter to isolate subsets of both mouse and human skin-derived stem cells in the viable state to evaluate their properties to promote neural regeneration. Sergei Atamas, M.D., Ph.D., and Irina Luzina, M.D., Ph.D., are individually funded VA Merit Review investigators with laboratories located in the Baltimore VA Medical Center (VAMC) who collaborate on the study of interleukin (IL)-33 and pulmonary fibrosis. They will sort tissue- derived macrophages and lymphocytes with the FACSMelodyTM. Eduardo Davila, Ph.D., is a VA Merit Review investigator whose research program is focused on tumor immunology. He will use the cell sorter for his VA Merit Review project to isolate tumor cells expressing varying levels of IRAK-4, postulated to mediate tumor resistance to therapy. Tapas Makar, Ph.D., is a VA Merit-funded investigator who is interested in determining the ability of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to modulate murine experimental autoimmune encephalitis, a disease model for autoimmune demyelinating disease in humans. He will sort immune and inflammatory cells from mouse spleen after experimental treatments to evaluate the immunosuppressive side effects of those treatments. Amit Golding, M.D., Ph.D. is a VAMHCS rheumatologist and a CDA awardee that treats Veterans in the Baltimore VAMC Arthritis Clinic. He submitted a VA BLR&D Merit Review application (Fall 2016 Cycle) subsequent to his CDA-2 project; and has a research program emphasizing autoimmune disease.

"9303396","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our overall objective is to improve the costly long-term course of mechanical low back pain (LBP). In recent work we found that people in both classification-specific and non-specific treatment groups displayed clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function, but differences between groups were smaller than expected. A possible reason for the attenuated group differences can be found in 3 related facts: 1) in addition to specific or non-specific exercise, both groups received training aimed at modifying the pattern of movement and alignment used in the lumbar spine during functional activities, 2) adherence levels were higher and more prolonged for training in functional activities than for exercise, and 3) outcomes continued to improve for about 6 months after the treatment phase but then gradually reversed along with declines in adherence to training in functional activities. In the current project we will capitalize on the effect of training people to modify their movement and alignment patterns during daily functional activities. This will be done by using a motor skill training program which emphasizes challenging practice in performance of functional activities painlessly with appropriate patterns of movement and alignment. We will also attempt to prolong the beneficial effects of the motor skill training by including a booster treatment 6 months after the initial treatment. To accomplish this we will conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial in which people with chronic LBP will be randomized to a treatment of either motor skill training or commonly prescribed, evidence-based, strength and flexibility exercises. Treatment will be provided in 2 phases: 1) initial phase: 6 - 1 hour sessions, once/week for 6 weeks, and 2) booster phase: 1-3 sessions beginning 6 months after the initial phase. We will collect 1) pain, functional limitation, disability, and economic outcomes, 2) reports of adherence, and 3) instrumented measurements of movement and alignment patterns during functional activities. People will be followed for 12 months after the initial treatment phase. We will test 1 if motor skill training results in better outcomes and better adherence than strength and flexibility exercise in the 12 months after treatment, and 2) the effect of a booster treatment provided 6 months after the treatment phase on functional limitations and adherence to treatment. Finally we will examine the relationship between functional limitations and 1) treatment adherence, and 2) movement and alignment patterns displayed during functional activities. Expected outcomes from this project are specific recommendations for the use and timing of motor skill training during functional activities for people with LBP. Successful completion of this project will have an immediate, high impact on rehabilitation research and treatment of people with LBP. In addition, the approach described could be used to study other similarly long-term, costly, and function-limiting musculoskeletal pain conditions."

"9209618","ASBTRACT Historically, our understanding of the fundamental properties of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and progenitor populations has been largely based on assaying populations of cells. Only recently, single cell transplantation studies have revealed intrinsic heterogeneity among seemingly pure populations of HSCs. However, because of the lack of available tools, the existence and mechanistic dissection of functional heterogeneity in the unperturbed `non-transplanted' marrow has been unfeasible. This is a crucially important question for the hematology field, as how stem/progenitor clones become activated and how clone size is controlled are highly relevant for our understanding of normal and malignant hematopoietic processes. We have recently developed a transposon (Tn)-based system for the simultaneous lineage tracing of thousands of single cells in the unperturbed bone marrow. With this model, we have demonstrated that native non-transplant hematopoiesis is highly polyclonal and mainly driven by the action of cells previously defined as short-term multipotent progenitors (MPPs), and not by the action of long-term HSCs, as historically thought. Here, in the context of this Program Project, we propose to utilize this system to examine the clonal response to different types of hematopoietic injury, and identify the consequences of this response on clonal lifespan and complexity. Our results will be intersected with findings of the Scadden and Zon groups, performing similar studies using complementary approaches in mice and zebrafish. Moreover, using a newly developed approach, we aim to define molecular signatures, at the single cell level, of the heterogeneity in this response. Our data will be analyzed in the context of findings by the Tenen and Scadden labs, also producing molecular signatures of heterogeneity. Additionally, we will study the clonal dynamics of blood production during oncogenic stress and determine the effects of pathway-specific chemical perturbation on the emergence of clonal dominance (Orkin and Zon). Our comprehensive and integrative studies will shed led on the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving functional heterogeneity during organismal stress. Moreover, these studies will inform efforts to enhance hematopoietic regeneration and prevent pre-malignant clonal hematopoiesis."
"9308519","The current project is focused on the study of basic mechanisms of polarization of the innate immune response. Macrophages are the primary cell type responsible for the polarization of the innate immunity either by initiating and propagating inflammation (M1 phenotype) or resolving inflammation to promote tissue healing (M2 phenotype). A relative new idea is that the dysregulation of macrophage polarization with the prevalence of M1 over M2 phenotype promotes wide-spread inflammation and acute tissue injury. In the case of lungs acute lung injury (ALI) may evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a highly lethal form of respiratory failure. Hence, understanding the mechanisms by which macrophages polarize into functionally distinct phenotypes may lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat ARDS. Nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) is a master regulator of inflammation being responsible for the expression of genes that promote or resolve inflammation. While the p65/p50 configuration of NF?B promotes inflammation, the p50/p50 configuration promotes resolution. We reason that these configurations also regulate how macrophages polarize into distinct phenotypes. In this regard, we recently discovered that suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) may operate the switch in NF?B function since it targets nuclear p65 but not p50 to degradation changing the relative abundances of these component subunits in the nucleus. The finding that SOCS1 is sensitive to inhibition by nitric oxide (NO) and possibly other reactive species also indicate novel molecular mechanisms by which SOCS1 activity, NF?B function, pro- and anti-inflammatory transcription, as well as macrophage polarization and inflammatory outcomes are regulated. These mechanisms are the focus of our three proposed aims: (1) to determine the mechanism by which SOCS1 promotes NF?B functional switch from that of a pro- to that of an anti-inflammatory transcriptional complex; (2) to determine if changes in the intracellular redox state of macrophages affects SOCS1 activity and NF?B function as a transcription factor and (3) Determine how SOCS1 expression in different immune cell types regulates the transition between inflammation propagation and resolution in a mouse model of bacterial pneumonia."
"9250189","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AAAs are age-associated localized dilations of the abdominal aorta that expand over the years and frequently lead to aortic rupture with a mortality rate as high as 90 %. Importantly, AAAs are one of the few cardiovascular disorders for which there is no pharmacological therapy. The only available treatment is surgical repair of the aortic wall, an expensive and risky procedure that is not a valid option for patients with small AAAs. Thus, the lack of a drug that prevents or slows down AAA growth represents an important unmet clinical need, which highlights the need for a precise knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying this vascular condition. It is widely accepted that the primary events in AAA development involve inflammation and proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix in the vessel wall. We recently reported the existence of a new signaling axis that involves non-canonical Wnt signaling modulators and controls the inflammatory response in the adipose tissue micro-environment. Specifically, we identified Sfrp5 as a new anti-inflammatory adipokine, which antagonizes the pro-inflammatory activity of Wnt5a, a regulator of non-canonical Wnt signaling. Our recently published studies have combined the analysis of human fat specimens and the characterization of novel genetic mouse models to show that Sfrp5/Wnt5a signaling is a regulator of adipose tissue inflammation and systemic metabolic health. However, the endocrine actions of Sfrp5 and the direct contribution of this non- canonical Wnt signaling axis to inflammatory conditions independent of obesity remain to be demonstrated. In this regard, the expression patterns of Sfrp5 and Wnt5a suggest an important role of these molecules in vascular inflammatory disorders in general and AAAs in particular. Sfrp5 is highly expressed in adipose tissue, but severely downregulated by aging (as well as obesity). Conversely, Wnt5a is expressed at high levels in the abdominal aorta and markedly upregulated in human and mouse AAAs. Based on these findings, we propose to test the hypothesis that the aberrant regulation of the Sfrp5/Wnt5a axis represents a previously unrecognized insult to the aortic wall that contributes to vascular inflammation and AAA development. Additionally, given the urgent need for drugs that prevent AAA growth and rupture, we also aim to evaluate whether Wnt5a-inhibitory strategies are effective at preventing the growth of pre-established experimental AAAs. The specific aims of this project are: 1. To investigate the role of the Sfrp5/Wnt5a regulatory axis in experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. 2. To investigate the role of the Wnt5a co-receptors Ror1 and Ror2 in experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. 3. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of Wnt5a-inhibitory strategies in the setting of experimental abdominal aortic aneurysms"
"9238659","?    DESCRIPTION: Chronic wounds are an enormously costly worldwide health concern that causes nearly 80,000 lower leg amputations annually in the U.S. alone and is associated with an increased likelihood of death. Strategies to encourage improved repair would impact both quality of life and mortality rates, yet myriad cellular and pathophysiological abnormalities continue to produce severely limited healing incidences with standard therapies. Promising therapeutic alternatives include the application of cellular scaffolds, topical growth factors (GF), or combination wound dressings. However, the incidence of complete closure remains strikingly low and GF delivery strategies largely fail to provide a sufficient quantity of GF to stimulate robust cellular responses. Additional concerns include the need for high GF doses as well as construct escape/off- target effects. New strategies to stimulate efficient and localized production of GFs in situ, by cells involved in active tissue repair, would offer a provocative approach to overcome these difficulties.  Thus, we detail an innovative strategy to improve control over the dynamics and location of GF delivery by harnessing ECM remodeling to stimulate GF gene release and expression. In particular, we will exploit our expertise in designing collagen-mimetic peptide (CMP) nanostructures to engineer DNA polyplex-modified collagen scaffolds that induce localized, high efficiency GF expression coordinated with tissue repair kinetics. Our prior studies show that CMP linkage retains polyplexes for over a month in collagen and preserves gene activity in serum. In vivo model gene transfer was significantly enhanced by the CMP modification, and the duration of expression could be easily tuned for periods of a few days to multiple weeks. Moreover, CMP/polyplex/collagens only released polyplexes during collagen turnover, and the freed polyplexes were linked to collagen fragments that appeared to hijack natural endocytic collagen processing pathways. The ability to maintain stable gene depots should provide key reductions in dosing and limit construct escape in slow-healing chronic wounds. Meanwhile, on-demand release and expression is ideally suited to the uncoordinated repair processes that are a hallmark of the chronic wound environment.  We will produce CMP/polyplex-modified collagens and will determine whether CMP linkage enhances retention within wound sites and stimulates the simultaneous processing of polyplexes with bioactive ECM fragments. We will elucidate key design parameters controlling polyplex retention, CMP/polyplex/collagen processing, and gene transfer, and will clearly link enhanced gene transfer efficacy to improved activity of GFs such as PDGF. Finally, we will use murine and rabbit wound repair models to test the ability of the PDGF gene product to enhance granulation tissue formation and increase the speed and efficacy of wound repair. These approaches will ultimately be useful as a versatile biomaterials platform able to stimulate improved healing in chronic wounds and a variety of other regenerative medicine applications."
"9296724","Project Summary The transition from fetal to neonatal life comes with profound changes in metabolism and in cardiac function. Changes in fetal cellular metabolism, as occur in fetal hypoxia or asphyxia, are known to impact mitochondrial function. In an animal model with elevated maternal cortisol in late gestation, mimicking mild but chronic stress, we have found a changes in gene expression in the fetal heart suggesting changes in glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function, and energy availability, with a decrease in mitochondrial number. In this model there is also an increase incidence of stillbirth, with an increase in incidence of fetal arrhythmias, including bradycardia, prolonged PR and ST intervals, and reduced fetal aortic pressure at birth. The proposed studies will use this model to test the overarching hypothesis that this phenotype can be rescued using dichloroacetate, a small molecule therapeutic that has been effectively used in congenital diseases affecting mitochondrial function, as well as in adult myocardial ischemia. DCA increases activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which is required for TCA cycle activity, mitochondrial survival, and oxidative metabolism. DCA will be administered acutely during labor, the time at which the abnormalities in ECG become evident in our model. We will test for effectiveness of DCA to improve PDC activity and metabolic status of the heart, including mitochondrial number and function, and the metabolome related to TCA cycle function, as well as its ability to reverse measures of cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmias and heart failure. The data from this study would potentially provide a therapeutic method for acute rescue of neonates with pathophysiologies that limit mitochondrial function."
"9253084","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall Hypertension is a major risk factor for premature death and disability in the United States. New approaches to therapy are needed to improve clinical management and reduce mortality and morbidity. Our Program Project is based on the assumption that redistribution of peripherally stored blood toward the heart via changes in vascular capacitance is an important factor in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Since most peripherally stored blood is in the splanchnic veins, redistribution is driven largely by reduced splanchnic venous capacitance. This can be caused by active constriction of splanchnic arteries, or active or passive constriction of splanchnic veins. Over the past five years our Program Project has focused on characterizing sympathetic neural mechanisms that regulate venous capacitance, with emphasis on differential control of arterial and venous function. Most of our work has been conducted in rodents with mineralocorticoid-salt hypertension. However, clinical hypertension is increasingly associated with obesity and especially with accumulation of inflamed visceral fat in the splanchnic region. Combined with evidence of sympathetic overactivity in obesity, this led us to hypothesize that altered sympathetic control of splanchnic arteries and veins could be a critical link between obesity and hypertension. Therefore, recently we have begun to refocus our work on a high fat feeding model of obesity-related hypertension in rodents and on complementary studies in splanchnic blood vessels and fat obtained from human patients. Over the next five years we propose to: 1) perform in vivo physiological studies in our rodent model to determine the amount, source and impact on arterial pressure of splanchnic sympathetic drive in obesity-related hypertension; 2) examine in rat and human blood vessels how inflamed visceral fat impacts sympathetic neurotransmission; and 3) establish in rat and human blood vessels the importance of both a) sympathetic drive to perivascular adipose tissue and b) a newly discovered adrenergic system endogenous to perivascular adipose tissue itself."

"9254465","PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS) ABSTRACT The objective of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) of the UAB CCC is to assure that the interventional (therapeutic and non-therapeutic) protocols for cancer have scientific merit, that they meet the priorities of the UAB CCC, and that they progress to scientifically meaningful results. The PRMS is made up of the Disease Working Groups (DWG), the Protocol Review Committee (PRC) and the Clinical Trial Operations Committee (CTOC). The PRMS's responsibilities include the scientific review and prioritization of all interventional protocols (clinical trials). The PRMS utilizes a three-tier review process whereby all interventional protocols are assessed by the appropriate DWG for merit and prioritization and, upon approval, are submitted to the CTOC. The CTOC reviews letters of intent for compliance with CCC priority guidelines, feasibility, and infrastructure capacity. Upon CTOC approval protocols are submitted to the PRC. The PRC then undertakes a detailed scientific review and makes final decisions for approval, approval with minor modifications, deferral for major modifications, or disapproval. The PRC is composed of Cancer Center Associate Director for Clinical Research and selected members representing expertise of the various oncology disciplines, laboratory research, basic science, cancer control/prevention, radiology, biostatistics, and research nursing. Written evaluation and recommendations of the committee accompany IRB applications on protocols approved by the PRC. The CTOC also reviews all active protocols monthly in regard to patient accrual and progress and has the authority to terminate any protocol that is not progressing. During the current funding period, the PRMS has provided initial review and/or prioritization of 318 protocols with 277 (87.1%) receiving approval (with or without minor revision) and 41 (12.9%) failing to receive approval including 36 (11.3%) receiving deferral and 5 (1.6%) receiving disapproval. Of the 36 protocols receiving deferral, 35 were granted approval on resubmission. The PRMS also provided administrative prioritization of 66 national cooperative group trials with Disease Working Group support and recommendations. Over the past funding period, the PRMS provided annual review for accrual and progress of 208 active protocols. In the 2014 review for accrual and progress, the CTOC considered 108 protocols and identified 39 underperforming trials. Of those, 27 received a 12-month approval for their action plans and 12 protocols were placed on probation. Subsequently eight of those twelve were closed to accrual. The PRMS will continue rigorous review of Cancer Center protocols for scientific quality and Cancer Center priority as well as monitoring of accrual and progress of active protocols."
"9419173","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The symptoms of pancreatic cancer are usually non-specific and late. Existing blood tumor biomarkers, such as carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), are not sensitive and specific enough to serve as useful screening tests. Tools for earlier detection could increase the proportion of patients who are diagnosed at early stages and potentially cured with surgical resection. Aptamers are oligonucleotide (RNA or DNA) molecules that directly bind to proteins with high specificity and can be used for the dual purpose of identifying novel biomarkers and detecting them in body fluids. We used a novel selection method (known as secretome selection) to identify aptamers that bind to proteins that are secreted by cultured pancreatic cancer cells but not to those secreted by non-cancerous pancreatic cells. One winning aptamer from this selection binds Cyclophilin B (CypB), a protein that has not previously been investigated as a blood biomarker for pancreatic cancer. We have demonstrated that CypB serum levels discriminate well between pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers but not as well between patients with pancreatic cancer and patients with benign pancreatic disease. Our primary hypothesis is that a similar positive/negative aptamer selection strategy can be applied to serum samples from patients with pancreatic cancer and benign pancreatic disease to identify novel serum biomarkers that are specific for pancreatic cancer. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To identify additional pancreatic cancer biomarkers using an aptamer selection strategy applied to blood samples from human patients.  2) To develop assays based on these selected aptamers (including the CypB aptamer) that could be used clinically for the detection of blood biomarkers.  3) To retrospectively evaluate whether these candidate biomarkers can distinguish between patients with early pancreatic cancer, patients with benign pancreatic diseases, and unaffected patients. The successful completion of this project will lead to the identification of new biomarkers that may be useful for the diagnosis, staging, and/or treatment of pancreatic cancer. Moreover, this approach to biomarker selection can be generalized to other cancers for which better biomarkers are needed."
"9457804","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The E2F family of transcription factors are encoded by eight distinct genes that based on structure-function studies and amino acid sequence analysis, fall into two main subclasses, activator E2Fs (E2F1-3) and repressor E2Fs composed of canonical repressors (E2F4-6) and atypical repressors (E2F7-8). Unlike other E2F family members, E2F7 and E2F8 bind DNA independent of dimerization with DP1/DP2 proteins and lack amino acid sequences typically used to interact with Rb-related proteins, and thus these atypical E2Fs may function outside the canonical CDK-Rb-E2F pathway. With the recent development of key genetic tools to conditionally disrupt or express E2f7 and E2f8 in mice, knocking mice that conditionally express endogenous wild type and mutant forms of E2F8 protein and knockin mice containing altered promoters of two key E2F-responsive target genes (Cdc6 and Cyclin A2) we expect to make significant strides towards a mechanistic understanding of how this important arm of the E2F family contribute to the control of transcription, cell cycle, and tumor suppression in vivo. Key preliminary data shows that E2F8 plays a critical role in endocycles and tumor suppression in the mouse liver and that its activity appears to be mediated by physical interactions with E2F7 and associated macro-molecular complexes to regulate gene expression outside the influence of the Cdk-Rb pathway. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that E2F8 functions as a transcriptional repressor to control cell cycles, genome ploidy levels and acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC. Three specific aims utilizing genetic, biochemical, and global profiling approaches will directly test this hypothesis. The long-term goal of these studies is to understand how the atypical (E2F8) arm contributes to the overall E2F transcriptional program in controlling cell cycles and tumor suppression."

A signature element of the investigators' research portfolio is the integration of science, engineering and policy to solve complex problems in environmental health; the CEHS integrates the activities of 45 members across nine departments at MIT and one at Harvard. The integrative approach enables the investigators to take on the following goals: 1) to enhance the translational impact of the CEHS; 2) to enhance the involvement of engineers in the environmental health sciences; 3) to connect their outreach and engagement activities with their basic research programs; 4) to integrate into the new MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative as a central and influential stakeholder; and 5) to leverage their physical assets, intellectual assets and interactive research base to apply for multi-investigator grant support.  The community engagement activities, which are in alignment with the research mission, stress two-way communication on environmental issues with their local communities, specifically with under-served communities in Boston, with the towns of the heavily industrialized Mystic River Watershed, and with Native American populations in Maine. The CEHS is supported by four Facilities Cores: 1) Genomics and Imaging, 2) Bioanalytical, 3) Animal Models, and 4) Integrative Health Sciences. A strong Pilot Project Program stimulates integration of new ideas and early-stage investigators into the CEHS, encouraging both basic and translational research.  The Administrative Core coordinates all the CEHS activities via direct interactions with individual Center members, the MIT Administration, Facilities Cores and External and Internal Advisory Committees. The Administrative Core also manages the investigators' global environmental health efforts, seminar programs, career development program, poster sessions, retreats and other enrichment activities that help make the total of the CEHS greater than the sum of its parts."
"9292433","Title: Tissue Engineered Total Disc Replacement in a Large Animal Model The objective of this project is to develop a tissue-engineered construct including an engineered nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus to treat degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc (IVD). In Specific Aim 1, we will build on our preliminary small animal studies to construct cell- seeded DAPS whose geometric dimensions are comparable to human and goat IVDs. A novel compression-torsion bioreactor and simulated ex vivo disc-like microenvironment will be utilized to promote growth; we will also establish an endplate region to promote boney integration. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the impact of physiological loading on DAPS in vivo maturation and integration in a large animal (goat) cervical spine disc replacement model. Pre- matured DAPS constructs will be implanted into the goat cervical spine following a single-level cervical discectomy. Constructs will be implanted either with or without an integrated PCL foam endplate. Immediately after implantation, a cohort of animals will have their implanted motion segment stabilized using an anterior cervical plate. An additional cohort will undergo implantation without instrumentation. In vivo DAPS maturation will be assessed via MRI, based on our prior in vivo DAPS work. Motion of the goat cervical spine and head will be monitored using a custom large animal motion-tracking device that our group has developed. Terminal assays will assess motion segment mechanics and DAPS biochemical content and ECM distribution at 12 weeks post-implantation. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate remobilization of the tissue-engineered motion segment and analysis of longer-term viability/segmental stability. The DAPS construct with best biomechanical performance in Aim 2 will be implanted after discectomy; at 12 weeks post-implantation, instrumentation will be removed, restoring unconstrained motion. Animals will continue free-range activity for 12 additional weeks, with regular acquisition of cervical motion and fluoroscopy data. At 24 weeks post-implantation, animals will be sacrificed and DAPS-implanted motion segments will be assessed via MRI analysis, biomechanical testing, histological analysis of matrix content and distribution, and biochemical analysis. The goal of this project is to develop tissue-engineered constructs and to assess their therapeutic potential in the treatment of degenerative disc disease. It is anticipated that the proposed study will offer an increased understanding of degenerative disc disease and demonstrate the potential of a novel therapeutic treatment."

"9220564","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Orofacial sensorimotor cortex (OSMcx)-orofacial primary motor cortex (MIo), primary somatosensory cortex (SIo), cortical masticatory area (CMAp)-dysfunction has been implicated in many orofacial sensorimotor disorders, including dysphagia, orofacial dystonia and dysarthria, spasmodic dysphonia, apraxia of speech, bruxism, chronic pain, and temporomandibular disorders. OSMcx displays neuroplasticity in association with acquisition of novel oral motor skills, intra-oral manipulations, and pain, and clinically targeting OSMcx has promise in treatment of orofacial disorders, such as dysphagia. The relationship between OSMcx neuroplasticity and learning of new oral skills is poorly understood, and the potential of OSMcx-targeted therapies for rehabilitation of speech, chewing, and swallowing disorders is barely explored. What roles do MIo, SIo, & CMAp independently and collectively play in control of natural feeding and trained orofacial motor tasks? How are neuroplastic changes in OSMcx orofacial motor and sensory representations related to changes in task performance?  To address these questions, we will quantify neuroplasticity in OSMcx, and encoding of tongue and jaw kinematics and kinetics by recording simultaneously from MIo, SIo, & CMAp during natural feeding and learning of tongue protrusion or incisor biting tasks. We have 3 specific aims: Aim 1: to document the modulation of activity in neural ensembles in MIo, SIo, & CMAp during feeding, and performance of tongue protrusion or incisor-biting tasks before, during, and after long-term training to these tasks. Aim 2: to document simultaneously in MIo, SIo, & CMAp the encoding of jaw and tongue kinematics and kinetics in neural ensembles during feeding and during performance of tongue protrusion or incisor-biting tasks before, during, and after long-term training to these tasks. Aim 3: to document simultaneously in MIo, SIo, & CMAp the timing and nature of neuroplasticity associated with training in tongue protrusion or incisor biting tasks. The proposed research will provide novel insights into neuronal processes underlying OSMcx control of orofacial function and lay the groundwork for future studies of the rehabilitative potential of intensive task training and neuroplastic changes n OSMcx in recovery of orofacial function. These data will inform treatments of sensorimotor disorders that target OSMcx, such as those using stimulation or brain machine interfaces. The proposed research will leverage significant advances in neural recording, kinematic measurement, and data analysis that are being applied to studies of reach-to-grasp behaviors and, for the first time, apply them to addressing clinically significant problems in orofacial function."

"9233173","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately one-third of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with a 10% risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) over their lifetime. Global efforts to combat TB are hampered by the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mtb and variable efficacy of the currently available vaccine, M. bovis BCG (BCG). Thus, the development of an effective vaccine is critical for the elimination of TB as a public health problem. Studies in the past decade have mainly utilized induction of T helper 1 (Th1) responses and production of interferon gamma (IFN?) as readouts for vaccine efficacy against TB. However, despite inducing high levels of IFN-?, MVA85A, the first recombinant TB vaccine tested in human clinical trials, failed to protect against TB disease. These data highlight the importance of exploring new approaches to improve vaccine-induced immunity against TB. During the prior funding period, we demonstrated that T helper type 17 (Th17) cells, which produce the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17), are the primary effector cell mediating vaccine-induced protection against Mtb. Although IFN? is dispensable for vaccine-induced immunity against TB, IL-17 production by vaccine-induced Th17 cells is absolutely necessary to confer vaccine-induced protection against TB. Importantly, mucosal vaccination with the Mtb antigen in adjuvant induced potent lung-resident Th17 cells and improved BCG vaccine-induced protection following Mtb challenge. Our mechanistic studies showed that IL-17 induced chemokines, including CXCL-13, to localize CXCR5-expressing T cells near Mtb-infected macrophages, resulting in the formation of lymphoid follicles and activating macrophages to mediate Mtb control. Despite these major advances in understanding the role of Th17 vaccine-induced cells in TB, the accumulation of vaccine-induced Th17 recall responses in the lung is not accelerated enough to provide sterilizing immunity to Mtb infection. However, we show that vaccine-induced Th17 immunity can be harnessed using DC therapy to achieve near sterilizing immunity against Mtb challenge. Thus, in this renewal, in Aim 1, we will first determine if accelerating Th17 cell accumulation by modulating antigen-presenting cell (APC) function will improve Mtb control. In Aim 2, we will address the functional role of IL-17 in DC therapy in vaccinated mice, and the relationship between a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in the IL-17 promoter and vaccine-induced responses in humans. Finally, in Aim 3, we will identify and incorporate potent Th17- inducing adjuvants into protective mucosal TB vaccines to translate for future use in humans. These objectives will be addressed using novel Mtb T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (Tg) mouse models in combination with gene-deficient mice, mouse models of Mtb infection, novel adjuvants and vaccination strategies, and hypothesis testing in humans. The work proposed in this grant will allow us to promote Th17 responses to generate long-lasting vaccine-induced immunity against TB."
"9237282","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tammy Chang, MD, MPH, MS is a family physician and junior clinical investigator focused on reducing obesity among adolescent mothers and their children. Dr. Chang's long-term career objective is to reduce health disparities among low-income adolescent mothers using tailored eHealth technologies. The objective of this K23 mentored career development award includes a 5-year plan for training and research activities that will provide the skills and experiences needed to become a successful independent investigator. RESEARCH CONTEXT: The United States (US) has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the developed world; the majority of pregnant adolescents gain excess weight during pregnancy. Excess pregnancy weight gain has a significant negative impact on the health of the adolescent mother, increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, and contributes to long-term obesity for both mother and child. In recognition of this important population health problem, both the IOM and AHRQ have identified the development of interventions targeting excess pregnancy weight gain as a major research priority. Compared to adults, relatively little is known about pregnancy weight gain among adolescents. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand adolescents' perceptions of and knowledge about pregnancy weight gain, so that researchers can customize interventions and make them relevant to the pregnant adolescent. The short-term goal of this proposal is to acquire the requisite skills to develop an adolescent-centered tailored eHealth intervention to reduce excess pregnancy weight gain. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine which US pregnant adolescents (aged ?21 years) are at high risk for significant excess pregnancy weight gain; 2) Identify the baselin knowledge, beliefs, and factors that influence excess pregnancy weight gain among adolescents; and 3) Design and test a scalable healthy diet and exercise eHealth intervention tailored to at-risk pregnant adolescents. RESEARCH PLAN: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Chang will conduct analyses using nationally representative data from the Fragile Families and Wellbeing Study; carry out social media mining and corresponding qualitative interviews with pregnant and postpartum adolescents; and design, implement, and evaluate an adolescent- centered and tailored eHealth (tailored text-messaging) intervention. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Chang will broaden her knowledge of advanced statistical methods using a large nationally representative dataset; develop skills in mining and analyzing online social media data; acquire expertise in designing, implementing, and evaluating scalable interventions tailored to pregnant adolescents; and obtain experience in translating research findings into clinically relevant policies and practices. Dr. Chang's career development goals will be supported through close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; guidance from an expert advisory panel; advanced didactic course work; attendance at professional meetings and workshops; participation in seminars and journal clubs; guidance in manuscript preparation and grant proposal development for projects arising from the research she conducts as part of this proposal; and implementing her research plan. This training will directly contribute to Dr. Chang's goal of addressing a vital intergenerational problem of excess pregnancy weight gain among at-risk adolescents, as well as the subsequent submission of a successful R01 application. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Chang's unique resources include a dedicated and accomplished multi-disciplinary mentorship team with whom she has previously collaborated; the outstanding research infrastructure at the University of Michigan and Department of Family Medicine with a particular emphasis on supporting junior investigators; and numerous advanced didactic courses and seminars provided by several distinct academic units at the University of Michigan."
"9242023","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) efficiently establishes persistent infection, with 200 million people currently infected worldwide. In the US, chronic HCV infection accounts for 15,000 deaths via end-stage liver diseases such as liver cancer and decompensated cirrhosis. In addition, nearly 20,000 individuals are newly infected with HCV annually, thereby posing a continuous threat to public health. Thus, an effective prevention strategy remains essential to mitigating the burden of HCV. Towards this ultimate goal, furthering our understanding of host immunity against viral infection plays a critical role. Interferon stimulated genes (ISG) constitute over 300 innate immune effectors which cooperatively restrict viral infection and are critical determinants for efficient mounting of adaptive immunity. ISG expression is dynamic, occurring through differential strength and duration of interferon (IFN) signaling. However, the processes that regulate ISG expression to facilitate viral restriction are poorly defined. In search of novel host factors that stimulate ISG expression for the suppression of HCV infection, we have conducted comprehensive genome-wide cDNA screening. These studies identified the non-receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (TNK1) as a signaling molecule pivotal for enhanced ISG expression and restriction of HCV infection. Our studies indicate that TNK1 presides over a novel signaling pathway that imparts serine phosphorylation of STAT1, resulting in induction of a specific group of ISG that have potent anti-HCV activity. Therefore the proposed studies aim to investigate the hypothesis that the TNK1 pathway induces anti-HCV effectors through a unique process of STAT1 activation. We will conduct the following aims: (Aim 1) Determine the mechanism of TNK1 activation and characterize its enzymatic activity, (Aim 2) Define the signaling cascade governed by TNK1 mediated serine phosphorylation of STAT1, and (Aim 3) Determine the in vivo role of TNK1 in hepatic antiviral innate immunity. The results from this study will provide novel insights into a front line defense against viral infection and contribute to a prevention strategy against HCV infection and emerging viral diseases."
"9257201","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Compared to their age-matched peers, the five-year relative survival rate of cancer patients is now at 68%, improved from 50% thirty years ago. At least one in 250 women of reproductive age are cancer survivors. Today, 90% of these young women will be cured of their cancer. Unfortunately, the chemotherapies that save their life are fertility-threatening; in particular, alkylating agents and platinum-based drugs are highly associated with post-treatment infertility as they cause DNA damage to the oocytes that comprise the ovarian reserve. Most young women with cancer are highly interested in trying to preserve their fertility so they might have children in the future [1, 2]. The cryopreservation and autotransplantation of ovarian tissue is emerging as a powerful approach for preserving fertility for patients that are losing ovarian function. Ovarian  tissue transplantation has preserved fertility (at least 22 live births to date); however, for cancer patients, transplantation may not be possible due to the risk of re-seeding disease. In Aim 1 ofthe proposed research, we refine the procedures for follicle isolation to enable large-scale recovery of primordial follicles, and subsequently investigate the engraftment and function by transplanted follicles within a range of biomaterials. The transplantation of early stage follicles is challenged by the potential to disrupt cell-cell interactions within the follicle during the isolation and encapsulation process, as well as the lack of mechanical support and paracrine factors from the stromal cells following transplantation. Preliminary studies indicate that a biomaterial for follicle transplantation can protect the graft following transplantation, provide a conduit between the host and transplanted follicles, and deliver factors that can locally promote engraftment.  Graft longevity is a key consideration in clinical transplantation, and our preliminary studies indicate significant activation of follicles into the growing pool, thereby depleting the tissue of early stage follicles which are necessary for long-term graft function. For Aim 2, we propose to investigate strategies to modulate the initial recruitment of follicles that would deplete the ovarian reserve, and thereby enhance the duration of graft function. For Aim 3, we investigate the transplantation of follicles from post-pubertal animals, and determine the contribution of age and obesity of the recipient on the engraftment and function of transplanted follicles. The use of post-pubertal follicles simulates the physiological transplant settings found in humans.  Furthermore, transplanting a common follicle population into ovaries of a normal cycling mouse, an aged mouse, or obese mouse can identify the impact of the ovarian environment due to aging or obesity on follicle development in vivo. Finally, in Aim 4, we investigate the transplantation of ovarian follicles from mice with metastatic disease, which simulates the clinical situation of re-seeding cancer cells. We will investigate our isolation procedures to determine the extent to which cancer cells are present, and adapt procedures to remove metastatic cells while maintaining follicle viability."
"9236903","Project Summary/Abstract Exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is one of the most well established risk factors for the development of later child psychopathology. Accumulating evidence from naturalistic observational studies documents that fetal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is associated with risk for later child mental health problems. Maternal depression is one of the most common prenatal complications with approximately 40% of women experiencing elevated levels of depressive symptoms. The majority of past research has been correlational, so potential causal conclusions have been limited. This project will break new ground by testing the hypothesis that manipulating maternal depressive symptoms will benefit infant outcomes. In this project, maternal depressive symptoms will be reduced using brief interpersonal therapy (IPT), a well-established and efficacious treatment, and testing whether this reduction leads to an improvement in the development of infant mechanisms associated with risk for later psychopathology. Consistent with NIMH's priority of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-based processes, we will assess infants with multiple measures that assess the constructs of potential threat (?anxiety?) from the Negative Valence System and cognitive (effortful) control from the Cognitive System. We propose to assess 300 pregnant women who report elevated levels of depressive symptoms and their infants. Prior to the intervention, maternal measures will be collected. Then half of the women will be randomized to receive IPT and the other half will receive enhanced usual care. After completion of the intervention, maternal measures will be collected longitudinally through 14 months postpartum. Infants will be evaluated at birth and at 7- and 14-months corrected age. Infants will be assessed across four units of analysis (brain structure and function, physiology, behavior, and maternal-report)."
"9232202","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal condition for which there is no effective treatment other than supportive care centered on mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation itself, however, can easily cause damage to already injured lung tissues, leading to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The principle goal in managing ARDS is thus to administer mechanical ventilation in a manner that avoids, or at least minimizes, VILI. The standard of care in ARDS involves use of small tidal volumes (Vt), the current ideal being 6 ml/kg ideal body weight, together with positive end-expiration pressure (PEEP) to prevent lung collapse and improve oxygenation. These strategies have led to improved outcomes, but ARDS mortality remains high, so better approaches to mechanically ventilating the injured lung are desperately needed. Unfortunately, continuing to search for one-size-fits-all approaches to mechanical ventilation of the very heterogeneous ARDS patient population is rapidly becoming futile because of the huge number of patients that would be needed to obtain statistically significant improvements over current strategies. For this reason, the search for improved approaches to mechanical ventilation in ARDS must focus on strategies that can be tailored to suit the pathophysiological characteristics of individual patiens. Furthermore, such strategies must be adaptable to the evolving nature and severity of ARDS as it runs its course. These considerations lead us to propose that personalized mechanical ventilation of the ARDS patient must take place within an ongoing feedback loop involving three interdependent processes: 1) assessing the injury status of a given lung, 2) predicting how much VILI will be caused in that lung by a given regimen of mechanical ventilation, and 3) optimizing ventilation to be minimally injurious based on the information provided in steps 1 and 2. This will allow the imposed regimen of mechanical ventilation to be responsive to the ventilatory needs of the patient, while at the same time minimizing the amount of VILI that is produced so that the patient's own reparative processes have the best chances of prevailing. We have undertaken extensive prior studies that show we can assess the current state of injury of the lung most effectively by measuring how its mechanical properties change over time as a result of ongoing recruitment and derecruitment. We have also developed computational models showing how it is, in principle, possible to predict the amount of VILI that will be produced by a given regimen of mechanical ventilation. Our overarching goal in this proposal is to leverage these findings to optimize the personalized design of mechanical ventilation strategies for the injured lung. This goal will be pursued experimentally in mouse models of ARDS and VILI, and computationally by fitting the data obtained to computational models of lung mechanics and VILI development."
"9233214","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Clinical trials are the gold standard method for determining the efficacy of new treatments, yet there are a number of issues inhibiting the pace of discovery in the clinical neurosciences. The result is that many learn (phase I/II) clinical trials are failing to move promising treatments forward into pivotal, confirmatory (phase III) trials in a coherent way. This has led to a high number of confirmatory phase clinical trial failurs and an inability to advance translational neuroscience. Clinical trials are complicated, expensive, and time consuming and many junior investigators working on the development and evaluation of new therapies face substantial barriers to success and progression in the field. With NINDS support, clinical trial networks focused on neuroscience have grown in importance. Analogous to discovery teams within pharmaceutical companies, the NETT Network and NeuroNEXT have created economies of scale with dense cross-university collaborations between clinician trialists, biostatisticians, data managers, monitors, study coordinators and other clinical trial professionals. For this proposal, our overarching goal is to leverage this resource to train the next generation of researchers to deliver the important results from well-designed and scientifically-sound learn phase clinical trials that will form the foundation for successful confirmatory trials in the future. Our proposed research educational plan includes pre-conference webinars, an in-person conference, with post-conference webinars and other activities in an integrated, longitudinal, small group experience. An advanced track in clinical trial simulation and flexible adaptive design is planned for the later years. Our approach will allow us to evaluate progress on specific outcome measures (such as number of grants funded) and internal performance metrics (knowledge and competency in clinical trial planning and conduct with course participants). We will use our innovative, cross institutional collaboration to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Identify promising junior investigators in the clinical neurosciences and provide them with a rigorous foundation in the design, funding, conduct, monitoring/oversight, ethical performance, and reporting of patient-oriented clinical research; 2)Promote ongoing professional career development by supporting participants before, during, and after the course to allow them to follow through on their plans for clinical trials-based research; 3)Enhance the pipeline of scientifically-sound, well-designed early phase clinical investigations that will provide a foundation for pivotal, confirmatory trials to reduce the burden of high-impact neurological diseases; and 4) Create a cooperative infrastructure for collaboration and sharing of educational resources for clinical trialists in the neurosciences to promote scientifically-sound, patient-oriented clinical trials."
"9258390","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dengue virus, a member of the Flaviviridae family, is a Category A pathogen that causes the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral illnesses in humans. The lack of in depth understanding of molecular mechanisms of viral replication and its interaction with the host cell, limits the development of antiviral strategies. The viral genome is an RNA molecule that plays multiple roles during viral replication. It serves as mRNA for translation, a template for RNA amplification, and substrate for encapsidation. A great deal has been learned in the last ten years about the mechanism of DENV genome replication. In contrast, the processes by which the genome is recruited by the capsid protein during viral particle formation and then released from the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm during infection are two steps of the viral life cycle understudied for DENV and other flaviviruses. The viral capsid is a small highly basic protein that binds nucleic acids with low specificity. In addition, packaging signals have not been found in the viral RNA. Despite this, the viral genome is the only RNA encapsidated inside the particle. In this proposal, we will address mechanisms and define the machinery involved in dengue virus genome encapsidation and uncoating. To this end, we will combine our expertise in developing dengue virus genetic tools to dissociate overlapping functions in the viral genome together with proteomic approaches and biochemical studies. In Aim 1, we will investigate how the viral genome is freed into the cytoplasm by analyzing uncoating intermediates in infected cells and studying the fate of viral components during entry. In addition, a novel 3 dimensional single particle orbital tracking methods to trace the capsid protein during infection will be explored. In Aim 2, we will use genetic tools to dissec capsid protein requirements for particle formation and infectivity. It has been recently found that the dengue virus capsid protein suffers a variety of post-translational modification in infected cells. A comprehensive mass spectrometry analysis of capsid purified from infected cells and virions, together with the design of recombinant viruses will be used to define function of structural properties of capsid. In Aim 3, we will define the protein-protein interaction network fr dengue virus assembly and determine the function of the viral protein NS3 in this process. We will use a recently developed proteomic platform in the context of viral infections to define host components required for the assembly process. Dissecting the multiple functions and interactions of the capsid protein with host and viral components will shed light on fundamental aspects of dengue and other flavivirus replication. Importantly, the studies proposed will provide new information about viral processes still unexplored for antiviral intervention."
"9251317","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy."
"9454116","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): UCLA's Department of Health Policy and Management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, in collaboration with RAND Health, the Schaeffer Center for Health Economics at the University of Southern California, and the Veterans Administration Center of Excellence for the Study of Healthcare Provider Behavior, proposes the renewal of its pre- and postdoctoral training grant, which has had an outstanding record of producing the next generation of scholars over the past 20 years. The primary goal of this collaboration, called the Los Angeles Area Health Services Research Training Program, is to provide comprehensive training and experience to highly-qualified pre- and postdoctoral trainees, so that they may effectively engage in, and eventually lead, research and implementation activities aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of the U.S. health care system. Taking advantage of the expertise of faculty and researchers - over three dozen of whom have agreed to be mentors - at these institutions as well as a track-record of community involvement in the Los Angeles area, the Training Program focuses on several key research topics in which the collaboration has particular expertise: health systems change; health equity; health services outside the clinic; implementation science; patient, provider, and organizational decision-making; and health outcomes measurement. Pre-doctoral trainees will complete the Ph.D. curriculum and requirements in the UCLA Department of Health Policy and Management. The Ph.D. program in is designed to provide high-level methodological skills and applied training, with depth in study design and evaluation, statistics/econometrics, and applications to the health care sector. Moreover, each student is required to choose a cognate (examples include economics, sociology, public policy, organizational behavior, and health care outcomes research) in which they take additional courses that develop competencies in cognate-related theory, conceptual models and research methods. The postdoctoral program will provide individualized training plans for postdoctoral trainees. Unlike many such programs in the sciences, trainees are not assigned to work on particular projects. Upon entry into the program, they meet individually with key faculty involved in the Training Program at the four collaborating institutions, so that they can learn about the opportunities in each institution and choose appropriate mentors and projects. During their postdoctoral experience, they collaborate with the program's faculty and researchers, develop their own research, submit journal articles, and write grant proposals to help facilitate their move to their next professional position."
"9362000","With this application we request funds from the ORD Shared Equipment Evaluation Program (SHEEP) to purchase a new generation Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) unit with OCT- angiography (OCT-A) capabilities. Specifically, we seek to obtain a Heidelberg Engineering Spectralis Tracking OCT System - HRA+OCT w/OCT2 ? MultiColor and Heidelberg Engineering Widefield Imaging Module. This instrument will be shared among investigators within the Department of Veterans Affairs Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Visual Loss (CPTVL). The rationale for our purchase is twofold. First, our current OCT, a Heidelberg Engineering HRA-OCT is becoming outdated and cannot be upgraded to a newer OCT-A mode. Second, the new version of the Spectralis HRA-OCT instrument offers several scientific advantages over the older version, which include the ability to image retinal vasculature without the need to inject dye into the animal. The investigators that are submitting this proposal are all investigators within the Iowa City VA Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Visual Loss. All investigators are interested in discovering the causes of various forms of visual loss and developing new treatments for visual loss to help affected Veterans. The research portfolio of investigators within with proposal is diverse with respect to visual loss. These include radiation-induced retinal damage, glaucoma, visual loss related to traumatic brain injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, retinal complications of diabetes, outer retinal visual loss, image analysis of retinal diseases and corneal damage and dysfunction. Thus, acquisition of a Heidelberg Spectralis HRA+OCT with OCT-A and Multicolor analysis will enhance the ability of investigators at the Iowa City VA to determine the causes of visual loss in mice through retinal imaging. This instrument will also integrate seamlessly with our multi-disciplinary image analysis team, which will allow us to extract a maximum amount of information from each animal subject."
"9353181","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in genome sequencing revealed that recurrent mutations in chromatin regulators are a common feature in malignancy, including multiple myeloma (MM). Among these lesions, mutations in histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone demethylases are prominent. These mutations may yield global, genome-wide dysfunction of chromatin, strongly affecting gene regulation and possibly influencing other chromatin-dependent processes. The balance between histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), associated with gene silencing and H3K4 methylation, linked to gene activation, is critical for normal gene expression. The PRC2 complex (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) contains at its core a H3K27-specifc HMT, EZH2. Loss of function mutations of EZH2 or partner proteins such as ASXL1 lead to global loss of H3K27me3, while gain of function mutations of EZH2 in lymphoma increases H3K27me3. The importance of this residue was underscored by discovery of H3K27->M mutation in pediatric brain tumors, precluding histone modification 20 and blocking EZH2 action 21. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of MMSET, an H3K36-specific HMT, in MM causes a genome-wide decrease in H3K27me3. Gene activation requires the removal of the H3K27 mark and placement of the H3K4me modification at gene promoters and enhancers. This is accomplished by a multi-protein complex containing the H3K27- specific histone demethylase UTX, (Ubiquitously transcribed Tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome), members of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) family of HMTs (including MLL2 and MLL3), histone acetyltransferases p300 and CREBBP, and members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling machinery. Almost all members of these complexes can be mutated in lymphoid malignancies. Specifically, UTX (Official gene name KDM6A) is mutated or deleted in up to 30% of MM. Moreover, MLL2 and especially MLL3 display inactivating mutations in MM. We hypothesize that UTX and MLL3 mutations have a similar function in MM pathogenesis to cause an aberrant imbalance of H3K27me/H3K4me and suppression of critical target genes. Accordingly, an EZH2 inhibitor that decreases H3K27 methylation is in preclinical and early clinical development may be able to rebalance chromatin modifications and offer a new therapeutic approach. To test these ideas we propose the following specific Aims: 1) Determine the Importance of UTX and MLL3 in the Control of Chromatin Structure, Cell Growth and Homeostasis of MM and Lymphoid Cells 2) Determine the Genetic Targets and Pathways Affected by Loss of UTX and MLL3 in MM 3) Determine the Importance of UTX in B Cell Maturation and in the Development of MM"
"9428903","PROJECT SUMMARY All domains of life produce peptidic natural products that play roles as diverse as quorum sensing molecules and redox cofactors. The ability of these peptides to function as antibacterial, antiviral, or anticancer agents makes understanding their biosynthesis an important area of contemporary research. Peptide-based secondary metabolites are produced by distinct biosynthetic pathways that differ in whether the peptide is synthesized by the action of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), or ribosomally produced from a genomically encoded orf. These peptides are often extensively modified. While in the NRPS systems many of the modifications occur concurrently with peptide synthesis, the ribosomally encoded peptides undergo posttranslational modification. These so-called ribosomally encoded posttranslationally modified polypeptides (RiPP) are a new emerging class of polypeptides that have extensive modifications that are introduced by mechansims that are mostly poorly understood. This application will focus on enzymes introduce sulfur-to-alpha carbon thioether crosslinks into ribosomally encoded peptides to produce sactipeptides. These linkages are distinct from the well-studied lanthipeptide, where thioether crosslinks form between a Cys residue and a dehydrated Thr/Ser. The sactipeptide maturases are members of the radical SAM family of enzymes and catalyze thioether crosslinks by a radical- mediated reaction that is not understood. While The biochemical, spectroscopic, and structural studies in this application will lead to a mechanistic paradigm for this important class of enzymes. While sactipeptides themselves have various therapeutic uses, understanding the substrate profiles and mechanisms of these enzymes would provide a tool for synthesis of crosslinked peptides, which are increasing finding utility in the clinic. "
"9294151","Project Summary (Project 2)  Cellular therapy, including hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) transplant, is a critical part of transfusion medicine practice. Umbilical cord blood can be an excellent alternative HSPC donor source; however its use is severely constrained by the limited HSPC numbers in one single cord blood unit. Despite our progress in understanding the molecular factors that support the self-renewal and differentiation of the hematopoietic system in vivo, less is known on how to modulate the factors that govern the self-renewal of HSPCs ex vivo. Unlike in the case of embryonic stem (ES) cells, expansion of HSPC in culture in general is at the expense of ?stemness?. We hypothesize that the HSPC fate is governed by key transcription factors, which are down-regulated during HSPC ex vivo expansion. Transcription factors maintain the HSPC identity by bookmarking the epigenetic memories during cell division. Identifying these transcription factor(s) is critical for the development of ex vivo HSPC expansion technology. ES cell gene SALL4 is a zinc finger transcription factor. It plays vital roles in the maintenance of ES cell properties. SALL4 is also a key factor in regulating human normal hematopoiesis, and can be used to expand cord blood HSPC population. The mechanism(s) of SALL4 in normal hematopoiesis, at least in part, is through its transcription activation domain and its interaction with the MLL epigenetic complex. Based on our preliminary studies, we propose the SALL4 transcription activation function is important for CD34+ HSPC expansion, and discovery of novel pharmacological tools to enhance its transcription activation property could potentially lead to new HSPC expansion technology. We have proposed the following specific aims: Specific Aim I: Characterize the functional role(s) of SALL4 transcription activation domain in HSPC expansion. Specific Aim II: Determine the molecular mechanism of SALL4 transcription activation domain in HSPC expansion. Specific Aim III: Screen and identify small molecule compounds to enhance SALL4 mediated HSPC expansion. Our proposed experiments, once completed, not only can offer us insights on HSPC biology, but also provide us with novel small molecule drugs for the purpose of HSPC expansion."
"9248446","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a major public health problem with the highest mortality rate of all stroke subtypes. ICH is one of the leading causes of long-term disability. Since there are no available FDA- approved therapies for ICH, it is of vast importance to search for new approaches in treatment for this devastating medical condition.  Lactoferrin (LTF) is a well-known endogenous glycoprotein with anti-microbial and immunoregulatory functions, in part through its effective sequestration of free iron. In our ongoing research, using different in vitro cell-culture systems (to model ICH pathogenesis) and clinically relevant rodent models of ICH, we discovered that lactoferrin (LTF) has unique pleiotropic activities. This makes this endogenous protein highly attractive as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ICH. Because LTF is rapidly removed from the circulation (T1/2 ~45 min), we developed a novel fusion protein based on recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLTF) and Fc domain of IgG for neonatal Fc receptor (PRC14). This novel molecule has indeed a significantly extended half- life (5.8 fold) over native LTF. We successfully accomplished the objectives of Phase I by defining the optimal therapeutic dose of PRC14 and showing extraordinary therapeutic window (24h) in a mouse model of ICH. The primary objective of this Phase II is: (i) to validate the safety of PRC14 as a potential therapeutic expressed in stable CHO (DG44) cells according to GMP standards (Aim 1), and (ii) to further characterize the therapeutic utility of PRC14 in treatment for ICH, using animal models that simulate clinical risk factors and known determinants of poor outcome after ICH (Aim 2).  Further commercialization of PRC14 will require a robust, scalable procedure where the final material retains activity and meets compliance requirements for pre-clinical safety and toxicology in animals. We will accomplish this goal with PRC14 being produced in stable CHO cells under GMP protocols and tested according to GLP protocols for: (i) pharmacokinetics; (ii) single dose safety studies (toxicity); and (iii) repeat dose, 7-day safety studies (toxicity) in rats. The PRC14 obtained from scale-up production (25g) will be used to assess early edema and long-term neurological deficit: (i) in aged female and male mice, (ii) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and (iii) in a pig model allowing for larger hematoma size. This design should provide the strong foundation for future clinical studies."
"9254471","03 EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS (ET) PROGRAM ABSTRACT The Experimental Therapeutics (ET) Program is the major translational/clinical research engine of the UAB CCC. The main objective of the ET Program is to develop novel therapeutic strategies that will provide cancer patients with an enhanced opportunity for cure and, if not cured, with an improved survival time, increased freedom from disease progression, and an improvement and relief of cancer-associated symptoms (improved quality of life). The pursuit of this overall objective involves three scientific aims: (1) to promote and implement translational clinical trials and preclinical research involving basic scientists and clinical faculty, (2) to promote discovery and validation of biomarkers that can aid in cancer diagnosis/prognosis, prediction of therapeutic response and selection of populations most likely to benefit from treatment modalities, and (3) to promote development of novel imaging technology that can be integrated into pre-clinical and translational clinical studies. These scientific goals have been enhanced by active SPORE funding (Brain, Breast, Pancreas, and Cervical cancers) and The Susan G. Komen for the Cure Promise Grant. In addition, there has been a significant expansion in scientific collaborations with Southern Research (SR) for drug discovery and development and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology for high-throughput genetic sequencing. The drug discovery efforts of the ET Program have been enhanced by the formalization of the Phase I Clinical trials Program, and the implementation of the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance (ADDA). Strong collaborations with other national research groups have been established including the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) and the National Cooperative Groups through the NCI U10-NCTC Lead Academic Partnership Site grant. The acquisition and implementation of the cyclotron has added major pre-clinical and clinical PET research capabilities to the program. Recent key recruitments have significantly enhanced clinical trial implementation and accrual over the last two years. The ET program has continued to grow in membership, research budget, and accrual to therapeutic trials. Primary faculty in the ET Program represent 13 departments, 4 schools, SR and HudsonAlpha, with total membership increasing from 62 faculty in 2011 to 69 in 2015. The overall research budget has increased from $10,994,390 annual direct costs in 2011 to $11,222,026 annual direct costs in 2015 ($2,450,158 from the National Cancer Institute [NCI], $3,473,522 of other peer-reviewed, and $4,588,101 million in Industry annual direct research support). Patient accrual to therapeutic trials over the past four year funding period was 1,717 patients, including 32% accrual to investigator-initiated trials, 28% to pilot/phase I studies, and 33% to phase II trials. The program had 426 publications over the past five year funding period including 27% inter-programmatic and 29% intra- programmatic authorship."
"9254473","04 NEURO-ONCOLOGY (NO) PROGRAM ABSTRACT The Neuro-Oncology Program (04) has been a multidsciplinary, vertically integrated, basic, translational and clinical research program in the Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC) since 1986. Its primary cancer focus includes molecular, cellular and systems biology of malignant glial tumors with a secondary emphasis on metastatic tumors to the brain and on malignant peripheral neuroglial tumors. The Neuro-Oncology Program membership has a strong presence in the UAB Comprehensive Neuroscience Center. The CCC Neuro- Oncology program serves a 5-state, Deep South region as a major, tertiary care referral center for patients with malignant and benign brain tumors and achieves its objectives through the support of the CCC and its shared facilities. The Neuro-Oncology Program is distinguished by: 1) A large number of patients with primary brain tumors and a mature 5-state referral network; 2) An active brain tumor-dedicated inter-disciplinary clinical team; 3) Extensive clinical and laboratory resources; 4) Significant extramural support for basic, translational, and clinical research, as well as a number of pharmaceutical industry-academia contracts for support of Neuro- Oncology research on campus; and 5) Nationally recognized expertise in conducting institutional and cooperative Phase I and II clinical trials utilizing agents developed through translational activities of the program. This program is a charter member of the Adult Brain Tumor Consortium (ABTC), the only NCI-funded adult brain tumor clinical consortium, and program members hold leadership positions in the Pediatric Brain Tumor Committee of the Children's Oncology Group. The Neuro-Oncology Program is multi-disciplinary with 20 primary members from 9 departments and 2 schools. Our members currently hold 28 active research grants, totaling $6,990,899 in direct costs annually, with 10 of those grants from the NCI totaling $680,818 annually in direct costs. During the current funding period, the membership published 169 peer-reviewed scientific papers, of which 32% were intra-programmatic and 29% were inter-progammatic brain tumor research. We conducted 66 interventional and 7 non-interventional IRB-approved clinical trials accruing 221 patients and 366 patients, respectively. In the current funding period, the Program has effectively harnesssed the CCC development of infrastructure and expertise to support systems biomedicine, bioenergetics, imaging and drug development. This has led to highly innovative research that has resulted in several seminal publications by the members of this program. The Neuro-Oncology Program will continue to advance basic and translational findings of its members' research to investigator-initiated Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for adult and pediatric patients with brain tumors."
"9246584","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic form of hydrocephalus in older adults which is thought to be caused by obstruction of the normal flow of CSF. NPH typically presents with cognitive impairment, gait dysfunction, and urinary incontinence, and may ultimately lead to permanent brain damage. NPH may account for more than five percent of all cases of dementia; but unlike most other causes of dementia, NPH can sometimes be reversed by shunt surgery or endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) which allow excess CSF to drain. But not all shunt surgeries and ETVs are successful and presently it is not known why some respond and others do not. Screening prior to surgery is often performed by a trial of CSF diversion via a lumbar puncture. If the patient responds by showing improvement in gait, then it is thought (and usually found) that shunt surgery or ETV will improve their condition on an ongoing basis. It has also been found that for patients that do not respond favorably to the lumbar puncture, shunt surgery or ETV may still help their condition. Since shunt surgery and ETV are not without risk, it is a major diagnostic obstacle to determine by some objective measure the likelihood of a positive response to therapy after a negative response to lumbar puncture screening. The proposed research will develop a new method to segment and label the ventricles and their connecting pathways from magnetic resonance images. While this task is generally straightforward in normal subjects, it represents a significant challenge in patients with enlarged and/or deformed ventricles. Segmenting and labeling the ventricles in NPH patients is the major challenge of the proposed work and it is where our major innovation arises. We will combine a patch-based tissue classification method with a registration-based multi-atlas labeling method to generate the novel algorithm. The result will be a labeling of the lateral ventricles (body and anterior, posterior, and inferior horns), the third and fourth ventricles, the cerebral aqueduct, the interventricular foramina, and the subarachnoid space. The relative volumes of these spaces will be used to evaluate where the likely blockage in CSF flow is occurring and whether shunt surgery or ETV is therefore likely to be successful, providing a potential alternative assessment to lumbar puncture. Specifically, we will 1) Develop a detailed manual delineation protocol for labeling the ventricular system; 2) Develop and evaluate an automatic ventricular segmentation and labeling algorithm; and 3) Carry out a retrospective study on NPH patients to model the ventricular system together with shunt or ETV responsiveness. This research will yield open-source software for segmentation and labeling enlarged ventricles and will provide the first image-based metrics to assist in the evaluation of potential efficacy of shunt surgery or ETV in NPH patients. Our research will also provide other researchers with the means to study ventricular enlargement in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as in normal aging, conditions which are considered in the differential diagnosis of NPH."
"9302767","ABSTRACT (Community Outreach and Engagement Core) Consistent with the Michigan Center on Lifestage Environmental Exposures and Disease (M-LEEaD) theme, Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) activities focus on dissemination of research on environmental exposure health impacts during vulnerable stages of life. The overarching vision of the COEC is to: foster enhanced understanding among community members, policy makers, and public health decision- makers concerning the role of environmental exposures in disease; promote multidirectional dialogue between community members, policy makers, public health decision makers, and M-LEEaD researchers to inform the center's research activities; and promote scientific understanding of effective strategies to assure multidirectional communication and effective engagement. Specifically, we seek to increase awareness and understanding of environmental exposures and disease through translation and dissemination of environmental health research (from both our center researchers and from other researchers), and to increase understanding among M-LEEaD researchers of environmental health concerns among community members and policy makers. COEC activities focus on two primary audiences: organizations and community leaders with capacity to reach residents in Southeast Michigan, particularly Detroit; and policy and public health decision makers in Detroit, Michigan, regional, and national levels. We will accomplish this vision by: 1) enhancing, expanding, and sustaining partnerships with stakeholders; 2) increasing awareness and understanding of environmental public health among community members, policy makers, and decision makers at local, regional, state, and national levels to enhance capacity to improve environmental decision making; 3) communicating issues, needs, and concerns of community members and of policy and public health decision makers to M-LEEaD scientists to promote multidirectional dialogue to inform and guide M- LEEaD research that address expressed needs of these audiences; and 4) advancing the field of community engagement through evaluation of COEC process and outcomes, dissemination of results locally and nationally, and promotion of engagement models for national implementation. The COEC encompasses rigorous evaluation methodology to further the science of community engagement and research translation. The proposed vision and activities maintain and strengthen multidirectional dialogue across investigators with expertise in physical and social environments and health with representatives from community-based organizations, policy makers and public health and environmental decision makers. This dialogue will inform environmental health research and improve its translation to inform intervention and policy decisions with implications for environmental health."
"9302763","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (Integrated Health Sciences Core) M-LEEaD?s mission is to accelerate research that defines the impact of environmental exposures during vulnerable life stages and to promote translation of research findings to interventions that mitigate chronic disease. In support of this mission, the M-LEEaD Integrated Health Sciences Core (IHSC) promotes multi-directional translational research using integrated multi-disciplinary approaches with the goal of advancing understanding of the impact of environmental exposures across the life- course on risk of chronic disease. In this competing renewal, we have restructured the IHSC and have incorporated the former Environmental Statistics Core in order to maximize efficiency and integrate overlapping functions. A new component of the IHSC is the environmental health practice team in charge of overseeing outreach to the state and regional professional practice. The IHSC specific objectives are: 1) to facilitate interaction between basic, mechanistic and toxicological science, population sciences, clinical research and practice professionals through the searchable, web-based information kiosk (the M-LEEaD Repository Kiosk), annual workshops and weekly seminars; 2) to optimize the value and utilization of our large human and animal specimen and data resources for environmental health research through the M-LEEaD Repository Kiosk; and 3) to promote sound study design, quality specimen collection, and rigorous statistical analysis, as well as the development of statistical methods and collaborations to advance environmental research through our consultation services, seminars, and workshops. A distinctive feature of the IHSC core is that our services are not related to a specific technology. Rather, the IHSC provides a critical linkage function promoting translational scholarship and multi-directional stakeholder partnerships. We provide consulting services to ensure quality of research designs, exposure assessment, laboratory analyses, and analytic methods, with specific guidance on establishing and maximizing utilization of human and animal biobanks. We capitalize on the rich set of NIH supported studies led by center members that encompass a wide range of exposures and life-stages through the M-LEEaD Repository Kiosk providing information about research opportunities within these well-defined human population and animal studies, and their associated data and bio-repositories. On the statistical front, the IHSC develops and consults on cutting-edge statistical methods to advance environmental health. The IHSC aims to facilitate translation to practice and policy by hosting two annual workshops, one focused on environmental statistics and one focused on Environmental Health Practice."

"9252602","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The studies of this application ask how gene expression controls neuronal connectivity and, thereby, brain function. This question is of general importance if one wants to understand, and (therapeutically) manipulate brain circuitry. We use the model system Drosophila, where virtually every gene can be targeted for knock-out or activation in a cell type selective manner Drosophila also offers the advantage that its brain i composed of a relatively small number of stereotyped neuronal lineages, groups of neurons descended from individual embryonic stem cells, called neuroblasts. During the course of its proliferation, each neuroblast expresses characteristic sets of regulatory genes. These genes control the differentiation of the neurons born from that particular neuroblast during a particular time interval. Through this mechanism, a lineage, or smaller subdivision of a lineage called sublineage, develops into a specific class of neurons which share common wiring properties, including the projection of their axons, branching pattern, and placement of synapses. Several discrete neuronal classes/lineages are put together into a neuronal circuit. We have identified a circuit, called the anterior visual pathway (AVP), which conducts input form the eye to a brain center, the central complex, known to process and store visual information in order to control fly locomotion (walking, flight). The central part of this circuit is formed by three lineages, whose neurons form several classes of highly ordered parallel and sequential elements.  In our first aim we will investigate the function of the neuronal classes of the AVP, by recording their activity in response to defined visual stimuli. We will also demonstrate experimentally that these classes of neurons are directly connected by synapses.  The second aim addresses the question how the developmental history of a neuron (time of birth, placement within the spatial framework of the developing brain) relates to its later connectivity within the AVP circuit. Furthermore, by genetically ablating specific classes of AVP neurons and monitoring the response of their normal synaptic partners, we will obtain important clues towards the role of specific cell interactions ordering connectivity.  Thirdly, using high throughput RNAseq, we will analyze the complete assortment of genes (transcriptome) expressed differentially in two particular AVP sublineages, R3 and R2. These two classes are distinguished from each other by very few structural criteria, and we will screen for and then analyze genes responsible for their differences in wiring. We expect to identify genes which play a general role in controlling pathway choices and connectivity in the nervous system."
"9442280","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a competing continuation of a currently funded Kirschstein-NRSA T-32 training award in Tissue Engineering and Regeneration (DE07057-35). A primary goal of modern dentistry and medicine is to predictably restore tissues and organs that have been lost due to pathology, trauma, or congenital abnormalities. Recent advances in understanding the factors, cells and mechanisms regulating tissue function, coupled with the new materials science and other engineering technologies available for delivery of agents to sites of repair have provided the tools required for researchers to focus on designing tissue engineered products for therapeutic use. These efforts require an interdisciplinary approach, with involvement of biomedical scientists, engineers, and clinical researchers. TEAM (Tissue Engineering at Michigan) a Training Program in tissue engineering and regeneration was developed with recognition of the need to train individuals in these various disciplines and of the need to ensure active exchange of ideas between individuals across disciplines. The primary objective of this training program is to provide an interdisciplinary research-intensive environment for individuals who wish to pursue careers in the Oral Sciences, with a focus in the area of restoration of oral-craniofacial tissues. This comprehensive Program has built-in flexibility, providing intensive training opportunities in both basic biomedical and clinical science. Moreover, through Core programs opportunities are available for cross- disciplinary and interprofessional research interactions. Specific trainee programs planned include: 1). DSTP; 2) traditional Ph.D.; and 3) Post-doctoral Fellow. Trainees will be selected based on strong academic records, recommendation letters, and commitment to a research career focused in oral science, with an emphasis on tissue engineering and regeneration. Specific efforts will be made to recruit individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds. This is a multidisciplinary program that spans across departmental and school boundaries, thus providing the student the flexibility to choose mentors across departments and campuses. TEAM involves three schools on campus, the School of Dentistry, Medical School, and College of Engineering, where in addition to the Core curriculum in Tissue Engineering and Regeneration, didactic training will be provided through departments at these schools. All trainees will receive formal instruction in responsible conduct of research. The University of Michigan recognizes the importance of quality training programs and is committed to training oral scientists as independent researchers and life-long learners."
"9260963","The broad goal of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) training program is to provide trainees with immersion in research, flexible learning, and opportunities for experiences in health technology as practiced not only in academia but in the community as well. Our program integrates NRSA trainees into all activities at our Hub, ranging from community engagement and outreach, to mastering best practices of clinical trials in the age of the EHR. UCI?s talented team science faculty provides every trainee with necessary tools for successful collaboration in translational science. We coalesced the NRSA and Mentored Career Development programs so that training resources are used efficiently. The integration has built a community of trainees which challenges and stimulates faculty and staff across the institution. The integrated program has four prime objectives. 1) Recruit a widely diverse pool of trainees. ICTS commitment to crossing academic boundaries is evidenced by our own ICTS leadership, encompassing nursing scientists and engineers, and this attracts trainees from a wide variety of career pathways and scientific disciplines. We partner with regional middle and high schools, particularly from neighborhoods with large numbers of underrepresented minorities, in programs that excite young students about health science and careers in research, an investment that will pay off in the years to come with a more diverse pool of trainees. 2) Offer both core and advanced curricula in clinical and translational science that are flexible and streamlined. We created a series of immersive-learning workshops spanning systems biology to community-based participatory research. These workshops are designed to shorten the didactic training components without disrupting research productivity. Working in partnership with UCI?s NIH BEST award (Broadening Experience in Scientific Training), varied health and technology experiences are available, from working with judges in Orange County domestic violence courts to externships in pharma startups. 3) Provide leadership and mentoring that champion our trainees. Our College of Mentors includes UCI?s most productive translational scientists who are selected because of their dedication to mentoring, and who are willing to undergo continuous training and evaluation themselves. The Survey, Evaluation, and Tracking (SET) Unit monitors individual development plans. SET is transparent and includes both faculty and trainees. 4) Collaborate with CTSAs across the network to improve training. We recently created a Southern California CTSA boot camp consortium with UCLA, UC San Diego, and USC. Trainees from all sites will be encouraged to build collaborations and participate in these workshops in topics ranging from biomedical informatics to therapeutic discovery and development. UCI is part of a statewide CTSA consortium, which is developing and evaluating web-based learning modules in translational science. In sum, our Hub will train a generation of researchers poised to transform the translational science process so that new prevention, treatments, and cures for disease can be delivered to the public faster."
"9234085","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH)-intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major complication of premature infants that results in cerebral palsy, mental retardation, learning disabilities, neurodevelopmental delay, and reduced cortical growth. Glutamatergic neurogenesis-formation of glutamatergic neurons-is orchestrated in the dorsal ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zones (SVZ) of the cerebral cortex, and continues until 28 weeks of gestational age. As IVH typically initiates in the periventricular germinal zone, this might hamper glutamatergic neurogenesis. Therefore, we ask whether IVH disrupts glutamatergic neurogenesis and the organization of the upper cortical layers (2-4) and if so, how this can be restored.  During the development of the cerebral cortex, glutamatergic neurons develop from radial glia (Sox2+) of the VZ, which undergo asymmetric division to generate intermediate progenitors (IPC). IPC migrate to the SVZ to further proliferate and mature into pyramidal neurons that form the layers of cortex. Glutamatergic neurogenesis in the dorsal SVZ is orchestrated under the influence of graded expression of transcription factors including Pax6, Ngn1/2, Emx1/2, and Insm1, while neuronal specification of upper cortical layers is regulated by Cux1, Brn2, and Satb2. These transcription factors are controlled by Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. These signaling cascades are the central regulators of proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells; and these morphogens determine the transcriptional activity that modifies cell fate. Our preliminary data revealed that IVH suppressed glutamatergic neurogenesis, activated Notch, and downregulated Wnt signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that i) IVH will disrupt glutamatergic neurogenesis and the growth of the upper cortical layers, and that ii) modulation of the Wnt or Notch pathway will restore the development of glutamatergic neurons and cortical layers in preterm pups with IVH. Our approach is to employ our preterm rabbit model of glycerol-induced IVH and use autopsy materials from preterm infants. Aim #1: Evaluate a) the density, proliferation, and apoptosis of radial glia (Sox2+) and IPC (Tbr2+) in the cortical VZ and SVZ, b) the abundance of pyramidal neurons (Cux1+, Brn2+) in cortical layers 2-4, and c) neurological function in premature rabbit pups with IVH vs. pups without IVH. Validate rabbit data in humans by performing parallel experiments in human premature infants (autopsy materials) with and without IVH. Aim #2: Determine the effect of activating Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways on a) the density, proliferation, and apoptosis of radial glia and IPC, b) neuronal density in cortical layers 2-4, and c) proneural transcription factors--Pax6, Ngn1/2, Emx1/2 and Insm1, and d) neurological function in treated pups with IVH vs. controls. Aim #3: Determine the effect of Notch inhibition on a) the density, proliferation, an apoptosis of radial glia and IPC of the VZ and SVZ, b) the density of neurons in cortical layers 2-4, c) proneural transcription factors-- Hes1/5, Pax6, Ngn1/2, and Insm1, and d) neurological function in treated pups with IVH vs. vehicle controls."
"9462455","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Abstract:  Our overall goal is to develop new clinical approaches to restore upper-limb function after incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Corticospinal tract (CST) axons are involved in  controlling upper-limb function. Paired-pulse induced spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) enhances synaptic strength between residual CST axons and spinal motoneurons (SMNs) resulting in temporary improvements in upper-limb function in humans with incomplete cervical SCI. Our specific goals are to: 1) develop methodologies to maximize STDP-induced aftereffects in an adult rat model of incomplete SCI and 2) translate this knowledge to humans to maximize STDP-mediated motor function recovery after incomplete cervical SCI. STDP aftereffects depend on the parameters of stimulation and the activation of postsynaptic glutamate NMDA and AMPA receptors causing increased synaptic transmission. In Aim 1, we will use an adult rat model of incomplete cervical SCI to examine the effects of increasing paired-pulse frequencies and duration, and extended use of clinically-relevant NMDA and AMPA receptor agonists on the strength of electrophysiological and forelimb functional STDP aftereffects. Motor training will be combined with paired-pulse STDP stimulation to further enhance plasticity and behavioral recovery. Comprehensive assessment of cellular and molecular plasticity in the brain and spinal cord will be used to study neuronal mechanisms underlying the effects of our approaches. In Aim 2, we will translate the knowledge from Aim 1 to humans with incomplete cervical SCI. The most effective stimulation parameters and pharmacological agent will be used in humans during functionally relevant reach to grasp motor tasks. Motor training of reach and grasp movements will be combined with STDP-paradigms to further enhance behaviorally relevant plasticity and recovery of function. Our experiments will provide new knowledge on STDP-mediated aftereffect mechanisms in an adult rat model of incomplete cervical SCI (Aim 1) which will be used to maximize STDP aftereffects in humans with incomplete cervical SCI (Aim 2). The results may support the development of more effective clinically-relevant STDP protocols to improve daily use of upper-limb function in humans with SCI. The relevance of this proposal is highlighted by the restricted efficacy of current strategies to improve hand function after SCI."
"9362282","The Veterinary Medical Unit (VMU) at the SFVAMC is requesting equipment items through the VA Laboratory Animal Major Equipment Program (LAMb). The SFVAMC VMU is currently utilizing both rodent and large animal vivarium space in an older vivarium, while a replacement rodent vivarium (not including large animal housing, procedure, or surgical areas) is nearly completed on site. The VMU desperately needs replacement surgical lighting for our large animal operating suite/room (LA-OR) core, including required turn-key installation costs. Without the requested equipment purchase/upgrade, the entire large animal research program at the SFVAMC will be significantly and negatively impacted. The requested Berchtold LED F 628 Surgical lights are needed for surgical procedures involving the use of both USDA-covered and non-covered (rodent) species. The SFVAMC Biomedical Engineers are knowledgeable of these lighting units, as the same lights are installed in the SFVAMC Hospital (human) OR's, and all of these are maintained by the in-house Biomedical Engineering Team. The SFVAMC VMU currently facilitates the work of 50 Principal Investigators (22 Major Users, 18 Minor Users) and their Research Staff Members, with 147 active animal care and use protocols (ACORPs). The requested equipment will benefit all of the research groups that utilize large animal species, but also will be utilized by the rodent research programs when procedures dictate enhanced surgical field requirements; currently, lighting deficit excludes use of the LA-OR for rodent surgical procedures. As such, a fully-functional, state-of-the-art animal operating suite will further enhance the productivity and effectiveness of the animal research endeavor here at the SFVAMC, as well as allow for successful recruitment of Research Principal Investigators who utilize laboratory animals. In short, 100% use of the above equipment will benefit all Research personnel working with research animals. The VMU strives for the best care and welfare of the research animals, and improving the facilities will greatly improve the care and utilization of Research animals."
"9312411","Core B ? Summary Core B will utilize the improvements developed for the 3D intestinal systems to support the preparation and utility of the tissue models, including generating the scaffolds and seeded scaffolds/tissues for all projects. The plans are based on our extensive preliminary data where we have demonstrated structurally- and functionally- relevant 3D human intestinal tissues for the study of infectious diseases. The intestinal systems include enteroid primary cell sources, a 3D porous protein scaffolding system with a geometrically-engineered hollow lumen with adaptability to both large and small intestinal tissues. In Aim #1 the focus will be on the preparation of scaffolds and 3D intestinal systems for the three research projects. Here the goal is to provide intestinal tissues to support the three research projects (60 systems per week), obtain primary tissue samples from the clinic, establish early passage organoid material from both the small intestine and the colon, and train individuals in the various projects. In addition, a focus will be on documenting all materials for validation and quality control to assure reproducibility. In Aim #2 the focus will be on optimization of the 3D intestinal tissues. Here the goal is to continue to optimize the currently developed 3D human intestinal tissues generated from organoids for physiological relevance, and develop increasingly complex features to facilitate analysis of intestinal pathogens. These activities will include the incorporation of additional cell types, supplementation of the scaffolds with ECM components, and further development of a bioreactor system to control flow, peristalsis and oxygen levels. A team of faculty, post doctoral fellows and a technician will support the needs of Core B and work closely with the research teams on all phases of the plans."
"9249000","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that cancer prevention efforts have the potential to reduce cancer incidence and cancer- related mortality by over 50% and 30% percent, respectively. Although many avoidable exposures are etiologically related to cancer, effective interventions have proven difficult to implement globally. Screening continues to be based primarily on clinical examination followed by histologic assessment of biopsies, perhaps followed by removal of preneoplastic lesions when they exist. However, unlike for advanced disease, effective molecularly driven interventions and risk assessment are not available for clinically normal tissues that may be have been exposed to carcinogens or for preneoplastic lesions. This is because we have not identified the key genomic drivers of progression from normal tissue to preneoplastic lesion to invasive cancer. The long-term goal of this project is use knowledge of key genomic changes that drive early cancer progression to identify and validate novel molecular targets for chemoprevention and risk assessment so that cancer incidences may be decreased.  Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) arising in various organ sites cause over 900,000 deaths worldwide annually. Because stratified squamous epithelia form environmental barriers in the airways, gastrointestinal / genitourinary tracts, and skin, the majority are drivenby carcinogenic exposures such as tobacco and solar radiation. Importantly, previous results and our own data show that SCCs from diverse sites share deep molecular commonalities including alterations in global gene expression and in TP53, TP63, NOTCH, and SOX2 signaling. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) has the most accessible and clinically well-characterized progression sequence of any human cancer, from a distinct precancerous lesion, the actinic keratosis (AK), to invasive carcinoma. Therefore, it is an ideal model for establishing a paradigm of molecularly targeted cancer chemoprevention for SCC.  Our central hypothesis is that specific microRNA-mRNA functional pairs and mutational events are key properties of clinically normal, but carcinogen (UV, tobacco) -exposed tissue, and that these are effective chemoprevention targets because they are early drivers of cuSCC development. To test this hypothesis, we have used next generation sequencing to bear on a clinic-pathologically well-defined development sequence that is both accessible and common. Our proposal contains significant innovation in its use of (1) matched isogenic normal skin, AK, and cuSCC from patients to minimize inter-individual variability, (2) a well- characterized UV-driven cuSCC mouse model for comparative and functional analysis, (3) cross-species genomic analysis, and (4) a novel surfactant-based non-invasive skin sampling technology to measure RNA expression and DNA mutations in-vivo. Our team includes expertise in dermatology, dermatopathology, chemical engineering, mouse cancer models, miRNA biology, and bioinformatics."

"9257206","The Education and Outreach Core of the SCCPIR Center for Reproductive Health After Disease will provide Reproductive and Endocrine Awareness to Diverse Communities. It will create a process to communicate the research activities and emerging data of the Center to two important audiences: (1) the clinicians who treat patients diagnosed with diseases or undergoing treatments that threaten their future reproductive health, and (2) the public, who should have a general understanding of their own reproductive and endocrine health and the risk of disease-related or iatrogenic reproductive dysfunction. The Education and Outreach Core will convey information to the clinical community regarding the reproductive and endocrine damage caused by specific diseases and treatments. To disseminate clinical information and emerging Center research findings to providers across the United States, the Core will host quarterly Telesynergy Grand Rounds, through which attendees can view and listen to experts in the fields of disease, reproduction, endocrinology, and fertility preservation and interact with presenters in real time. Many fertility providers and health care clinicians have detailed questions regarding how to implement a comprehensive fertility preservation program, thus the Core will work with Core C to provide an annual small-group training course to give providers the resources and tools to develop their own fertility preservation and endocrine health program or to strengthen their existing program. The Core will also disseminate educational materials and informational patient brochures to clinicians in order to facilitate provider-patient discussions in disease specific contexts. Input from the clinical community (e.g., via Center Co-director Dr. Jeruss, Project IV  findings, and Core C) will guide the content and implementation of these professional educational programs. A solid understanding of reproductive biology is important to ensure that all people can make fully informed decisions about their future reproductive health. Thus, public education will also be a critical function of the Core. Building on the web-based resources of the formerly funded Oncofertility Consortium, we will expand them to disseminate information to male and female patients, their partners, and their parents. In addition, outreach to children and teenagers is necessary to provide them with a basic understanding of reproductive biology, and a basis for conceptualizing advanced reproductive and endocrine concepts as the future researchers, clinicians, and patients of tomorrow. To ensure these concepts are taught to young people. Core B will develop and implement animated video training modules targeted to young boys and girls, with content input from Center researchers (Projects l-IV). By providing reproductive education and outreach to this diverse set of stakeholders providers, patients, partners, parents, and the public we can be assured that, together with their physicians, patients and the public will have the ability to make complex decisions about their reproductive and endocrine health that will affect the rest of their lives."
"9242064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sudden death in the young (SDY) is a tragic event, with devastating consequences for the family who must endure both the unexpected loss of their child and the possibility of harboring a familial disorder that threatens the health and survival of the remaining members. Due to lack of evidence, there is little consensus within the scientific community around the best method for preventing SDY. Thus, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have invested extensively in the SDY Case Registry by acquiring detailed clinical information and archiving DNA samples from SDY cases across the United States, with the goal of defining the genomic and mechanistic basis for SDY. We propose to establish the Utah SDY Center as an integral partner of the SDY Registry, by providing unparalleled bioinformatics, genomics and clinical expertise, resources, and an infrastructure for collaboration to accomplish the Registry's goals. Our proposal addresses several critical barriers in the field of SDY research: 1) standard genetic testing fails to identify a molecular cause in the majority of autopsy-negative SDY; 2) current strategies do not validate the functionality of identified variants; and 3) a comprehensive family cardiac evaluation is inconsistently performed despite Class I expert consensus recommendations. We propose to overcome these barriers by achieving the following Aims: Specific Aim 1: Provide the SDY Case Registry with the bioinformatics expertise that will enable the discovery of the genomic basis for autopsy-negative SDY, using whole-exome/genome sequencing. Specific Aim 2: Characterize novel SDY disease genes, alleles and disease mechanisms, using cell- and model organism-based assays. Specific Aim 3: Integrate our clinical expertise in SDY to phenotype, genotype, risk-stratify and counsel surviving family members. The Utah SDY Center's multi-disciplinary research plan will allow us to discover, validate and characterize new sudden death genes, alleles and mechanisms at a scale and resolution not previously possible. By partnering with other SDY Case Registry Centers, the Utah Center will promote a mechanistic understanding of SDY and thus establish the foundation for future screening strategies and preventative measures."
"9247841","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the previous funding period we investigated the mechanism of rapid antidepressant activity of ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. We demonstrated that Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is required for the fast acting antidepressant effects of ketamine as these effects are lost in forebrain specific BDNF knockout mice. We found that the antidepressant effects of ketamine require protein translation, but not transcription, resulting in increases in BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus that are important for the behavioral effect. Recent work has suggested a strong causal link between blockade of resting NMDA receptor activation and rapid increases in local dendritic protein translation. Blockade of NMDA receptor activation by spontaneous glutamate release has been shown to inactive eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase resulting in dephosphorylation of its only known substrate, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), thereby increasing protein translation of target transcripts. We showed that ketamine causes a decrease in phosphorylation of eEF2, which normally impedes translation in its phosphorylated state, suggesting translational de-repression of BDNF mRNA. Moreover, inhibitors of eEF2 kinase trigger a rapid antidepressant-like effect in mice and ketamine does not elicit an antidepressant effect in eEF2 kinase null mice. These data provide the basis for the novel hypothesis that ketamine, by blocking NMDA receptors at rest, inhibits the phosphorylation of eEF2 and augments subsequent expression of BDNF, critical determinants of ketamine-mediated antidepressant efficacy. The objective of this renewal is to delineate the role of BDNF-TrkB signaling in the hippocampus in ketamine-mediated antidepressant effects, as well as how eEF2 kinase acts as a transducer between NMDA receptor activity and BDNF regulation. Collectively, this information will provide novel information on the synaptic locus, as well as the key molecules, necessary for ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects."
"9312322","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a significant public health problem worldwide. However, despite the availability of medication and psychotherapeutic treatments for MDD, fewer than 40% of patients achieve remission after initial treatment. It would represent a major advance for Precision Medicine if we were able to individualize the therapy of MDD. Recent advances in analytical chemistry have led to the emergence of Metabolomics, a discipline that allows the simultaneous measurement of 100's to 1000's of metabolites to map perturbations in metabolic pathways and networks, thus potentially enabling a systems approach to the study of MDD and its treatment. Our work over the past decade has pioneered the application of metabolomics to study selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We have mapped metabolic pathways implicated in SSRI response and discovered novel mechanisms associated with that response. In this proposal, we set out to apply metabolomics to greatly expand our knowledge of MDD treatment response by the use of previously collected samples and comprehensive clinical data from two large studies, the Emory PReDICT and the Mayo Pharmacogenomics Research Network (PGRN) trials. Both of these independent studies used the SSRI escitalopram and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine as treatments. The PReDICT study also included a non-pharmacologic treatment arm, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Our goal is to leverage these large investments made by the NIH by applying an integrated metabolomics- genomics- neuroimaging approach to characterize and functionally validate the biological systems predictive of MDD treatment outcomes. In Specific Aim 1, we will define metabolomic signatures of exposure to the 3 therapies in the treatment-naïve MDD patients from the PReDICT study. In Aim 2, we will evaluate and model the metabolomic signatures associated with improvement during treatment with escitalopram, duloxetine, and CBT, and then replicate our findings in the Mayo study. In Aim 3 we will use pharmacometabolomics-informed pharmacogenomics both to compare the biomarkers discovered in the Mayo study with those identified in PReDICT, and to identify the metabolite-associated genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in mechanisms associated with variation in treatment response using cell-line based systems. Finally, our Exploratory Aim will examine linkages between central nervous system function and peripheral metabolomic signatures. This proposal is innovative because it applies the novel tool of metabolomics to the question of treatment selection in MDD, and because it integrates metabolomics with genomics and neuroimaging data to enable a deeper understanding of therapeutic mechanisms of action. It is also highly significant because it will add to evidence-based methods for the selection of optimal treatments for individual MDD patients and will expand our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying response to the therapy for this major disease."
"9198241","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) affects an estimated 4.7 million Americans, with approximately 550,000 new cases diagnosed annually and estimated annual costs ranging from $10 to $40 billion. One of the characteristics of progression to heart failure i reduced cardiac output due to decreased contractility and cardiac hypertrophy. We have discovered novel and exciting roles for phospholipase C (PLC) scaffolding in regulation of cardiac function and disease. Our overall model is that PLCs localized in different compartments in the cell cooperate to generate signals required for cardiac contraction and hypertrophy. We have shown that PLCe scaffolded at the nuclear envelope (NE) hydrolyses the novel substrate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi apparatus to generate local diacylglycerol (DAG) required for activation of PKD in the nucleus and activation of hypertrophic gene expression. Our major focus will be to understand this mechanism at a more detailed level and to understand how compartmentalized PLCs specify different aspects of cardiac cell function in the following specific aims. Aim 1. Subcellular compartmentation of PLCe in cardiac cells. We propose that scaffolding of PLCe to either the type 2 ryanodine receptor (Ryr2) or mAKAP specifies distinct subcellular functions in cardiac cells. We have shown that PLCe binds to mAKAP and have extensively characterized this complex. Here we will examine the scaffolding to Ryr2. Aim 2. Subcellular Signaling pathway networks that control PLC-dependent cardiac hypertrophy. Here we will identify the mechanisms involved in communicating signals from cell surface GPCRs to perinuclear PI4P hydrolysis, and we will identify GPCR driven pathways that cooperate with perinuclear PLCe to regulate hypertrophy. I. We propose that signals generated at the plasma membrane cooperate with perinuclear PI4P hydrolysis. II. To examine signals that regulate nuclear we will monitor perinuclear PI4P hydrolysis, PKD activation and myocyte hypertrophy in the presence of various targeted G protein inhibitors. III. We will examine the role of Golgi and PM G?y signaling in an in vivo model of heart failure. Aim 3. Understanding how Nuclear Envelope-scaffolded PLCe accesses PI4P in the Golgi Apparatus. PLCe bound to mAKAP at the nuclear envelope hydrolyzes PI4P in the closely associated Golgi apparatus in cardiac myocytes. We will use a combination of high resolution transmission electron microscopy and super resolution Stochastic Optical Reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to localize the key components in primary myocytes and heart tissue. We will use both STORM imaging and Immuno-localization EM to localize these components. Understanding the topological organization of these components at the cis-Golgi-nuclear envelope interface to develop a detailed model of how PLCe at the nuclear envelope hydrolyzes Golgi PI4P to lead to nuclear PKD activation."
"9244089","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Data collection for clinical, behavioral, and social research has traditionally been accomplished via paper-and-pencil forms collected in-person, by telephone, or through the mail; however, recent technological advances have resulted in a multitude of online data collection systems (DCS) that deploy measures and collect data online. More than 35% of all data collection is now being conducted through online surveys. Furthermore, evidence indicates online data collection offers higher response rates, higher quality data, and substantial cost savings over traditional methods. Unfortunately, however, none of the current technology products offer developmentally appropriate tools specifically designed for collecting data with children younger than 12. This Phase II SBIR project will continue development and testing of a child-friendly data collection system, Quest, providing game-like user interfaces with built-in accessibility tools to maximize both engagement and usability for children and enabling researchers to design, build, and deploy developmentally appropriate surveys for children (ages 6-12). This Phase II SBIR project will build on positive Phase I feedback and support to accomplish three specific aims: (1) Fully develop Quest software by finalizing user flows and interfaces, embedding recommended software features and functions, and integrating researcher and child portal components. To ensure maximum usability, we will employ an iterative development model incorporating continuous feedback from children and researchers during development of the full product. (2) Conduct usability testing with children ages 6-12 who will be randomly assigned to complete pediatric self-report social behavioral measures using one of three data collection methods: (a) paper-and-pencil, (b) online survey, or (c) Quest. Observational data and ratings will be gathered for each method to assess participant engagement, motivation, attention, and usability. (3) Conduct pilot testing with pediatric clinical, social, and behavioral researchers randomly assigned to (a) Quest or (b) data collection as usual (DCU) conditions. Researchers will complete ratings of their data collection experience with children over a 3-month period. We expect researchers in the Quest condition to report significantly greater (a) ease of use, (b) data quality, (c) participant engagement, (d) cost savings, and (e) method satisfaction compared to researchers in the DCU condition. We also expect them to report the Quest software is (a) highly innovative, (b) feasible, and (c) valuable for conducting research with children. This project will yield a highly innovative affordable product that can be broadly applied in the service of clinical, behavioral, and social research and for which there is a demonstrated market need. In effect, this work will support NCATS's Strategic Priorities to build research capacity by addressing the developmental challenges of data collection with children and supporting researchers' capacity to collect high quality survey data with children, which in turn, would support efforts to translate research findings into clinical practice so that health outcomes for children can be enhanced."

"9309086","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (http://pgc.unc.edu), now in its eighth year, is one of the most innovative experiments in the history of psychiatry. We have unified much of the field to enable rapid progress in elucidating the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders. We have 800+ investigators from 36 countries and >400K subjects. The PGC has attracted a cadre of outstanding scientists whose careers center on our work. The PGC has published 17 main papers plus 31 secondary analysis/methods development papers. The most important was the landmark Nature paper identifying 108 loci for schizophrenia (SCZ). Due to our open-source approach, there are 75+ papers that use PGC results, and we know of numerous groups that are using our findings to direct basic and applied research (including therapeutic development). More work is needed. Large amounts of new data will be available to the PGC in the next five years (largely without NIMH funding). We have developed a rigorous set of approaches that are yielding discoveries for all of the initial five disorders (which led to adding four new disorders). We thus have the unique opportunity to rapidly and efficiently increase our knowledge of common and rare variation in order to understand the causes and comorbidities of major psychiatric disorders. Our overarching goal is to identify actionable variation via the empirical evaluation of the etiological, clinical, nosological, therapeutic, and biological significance of our genomic findings. We will continue the highly successful work of the PGC in understanding the roles of common genetic variation by: (a) comprehensively analyzing historically large GWA samples for nine major psychiatric disorders; (b) evaluating how genetic risk scores impact development and clinical symptom patterns; (c) understand the genetic relationship among psychiatric disorders and across psychiatric disorders and many other CNS diseases. We will enhance our work on the discovery of rare variation by: (d) conducting mega-analyses of copy number variation across nine psychiatric disorders; (e) efficiently and inexpensively re-sequencing regions implicated by GWAS (200 candidate genes in 20,000 subjects); and (f) using the hundreds of clinicians in the PGC, identify rare densely affected pedigrees to enable searches for rare variants of strong effect. Successful completion of this body of work will advance knowledge of the genetic basis of multiple psychiatric disorders. Our goal is to deliver actionable findings, genomic results tht (a) reveal the fundamental biology, (b) inform clinical practice, and (c) deliver new therapeutic targets. This is the central idea of the PGC: to convert the family history risk factor into biologically, clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights. We have leveraged external funding from multiple sources to minimize NIMH budgetary requests."
"9446075","Project Summary The long-term goal of this dissertation research study is to help public and private payers build their own budget impact models, to better inform their formulary decisions, and ultimately maximize efficiency in their health care systems. We will achieve this goal by collaborating with the national TRICARE payer, which serves the military and their dependents, to develop a budget impact model for their recent formulary changes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the budget impact of TRICARE?s recent antidiabetic drug formulary changes. The specific aims of the project are: i) develop a model to predict the budgetary impact of TRICARE?s antidiabetic drug formulary changes, ii) calculate the actual empirical budget impact one year after implementation of the formulary changes, and iii) identify, compare, and contrast the cost drivers in the budget impact model versus empirical analysis. Both the budget impact model and empirical analysis will use existing TRICARE pharmacy and medical claims data. To successfully conduct this research, the principal investigator will attend International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research short-course programs in topics such as budget impact analyses, modeling, advanced decision modeling, and statistical methods in economic evaluations, as well as University of Maryland, Baltimore professional development workshops and responsible conduct of research courses.

"9310521","PROJECT ABSTRACT For over 4 decades, studies identify Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN) as a leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). Following exponential increases in CT imaging, exposures to contrast media are a major public health problem, especially in the emergency care setting: >10% of patients with chest symptoms undergo CT of the pulmonary arteries (CTPA) for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). However, recent studies question whether contrast media exposure actually contributes to overall AKI-risk, even in patients with renal dysfunction. Without prospective validation of either conclusion, physicians are unable to accurately identify high risk patients and are left with current practices that delay or forgo contrast-enhanced imaging, but may not actually reduce AKI-risk. Preliminary data from the PI underscores the significance of the problem perpetuated by this knowledge gap: 1) >15% of patients develop AKI after CTPA; 2) AKI is associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of subsequent death, renal failure and major cardiovascular events; and 3) Serum creatinine screening (and GFR estimation) has unacceptable sensitivity (13%) in the heterogeneous emergency care setting. In response, the applicant derived a clinical decision rule, the AKIrisk Score. The long-term goal is to identify causes of (such as CIN), and, ultimately, prevent AKI in the emergency care setting. The immediate objectives are to 1) Validate risk-stratification methods in the emergency care setting and 2) Test if contrast media exposure, as a result of CTPA for PE, increases the risk of AKI and subsequent severe outcomes. The central hypothesis is that while a clinical decision rule more accurately risk-stratifies patients for AKI than serum creatinine screening, subsequent avoidance of exposure to contemporary contrast media agents does NOT alter overall AKI-risk, and will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Determine if an AKIrisk score <2 points predicts <10% AKI; 2) Test if cystatin-C and/or NGAL improve AKIrisk score accuracy; and 3) Compare the incidence of AKI and long-term outcomes in 600 patients with an AKIrisk score ?2 points, randomized to CTPA (contrast media exposure) or ventilation scintigraphy (VQ, unexposed control). The first aim will validate the AKIrisk score, which has previously demonstrated improved accuracy over serum creatinine screening in a large prospective cohort (633 patients). The second aim will also validate the applicant?s prior work demonstrating the additional benefit of acute-phase biomarkers of renal dysfunction. In the third aim, patients will be randomized to contrast media exposure with one of two standard-of-care PE imaging studies and followed for AKI and long-term outcomes. This innovative approach departs from serum creatinine screening, which is outdated and ineffective in the undifferentiated, acutely ill population characteristic of the emergency care setting, and is the first truly feasible trial of AKI-risk that addresses the challenge of prospectively randomizing contrast media exposure. The proposed work will significantly impact real-world imaging practices."
"9244864","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A better understanding of the mammalian thermoregulatory system may lead to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of conditions associated with hyperthermia such as infection, drug abuse, and stroke. Classical studies identified the preoptic area (POA) of the anterior hypothalamus as the principal site of mammalian thermoregulation. This region is postulated to contain warm-sensitive neurons that are activated by environmental heat and in response trigger an array of autonomic and behavioral responses that restore temperature homeostasis. An extensive scientific literature accumulated over the past 75 years has supported the existence and importance of these warm-sensitive cells, yet their neurochemical identity remains unknown. For this reason key components of the mammalian thermoregulatory circuit have remained inaccessible to modern genetically-targeted approaches in neuroscience. Recently we have used an approach for activity- based RNA sequencing to identify molecular markers that selectively label these long-sought warm-sensitive cells. We have shown using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations that activation of these neurons inhibits brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and lowers body temperature. We have also recorded the activity of these neurons in awake behaving mice and shown that they are activated by ambient heat and inhibited by ambient cold. Thus we have identified a novel, molecularly-defined neural population that functionally resembles the long-sought warm-sensitive cells of the POA. We propose here to apply approaches for genetic and projection-targeted neural manipulation and recording to elucidate the downstream circuit by which these cells control behavioral and autonomic thermoregulation."
"9241457","Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as the unpleasant sensation that elicits the desire or reflex to scratch. Persistent itching is an important component of many cutaneous diseases or system disorders such as contact dermatitis, chronic renal insufficiency and cholestatic liver diseases. The chronic itching can be very devastating and significantly affect the patients? quality of life. Since the molecular and cellular mechanisms of itch sensation are largely unknown, there are only limited treatments for most of the patients. Recent studies have shown that members of the Mrgprs family serve as new itch receptors mediating the itch sensation elicited by multiple pruritogens. In this proposal, I will use molecular, genetic, behavioral and pharmacological approaches to investigate the role of Mrgprs in mediating different types of itch sensation. This proposal consists of 3 specific aims. Specific aim 1 will determine whether Mrgprs are involved in mosquito bite-induced itch. In this aim, I will isolate the pruriceptive component in mosquito saliva and test the hypothesis that it activates Mrgprs directly. Specific aim 2 will test whether antagonizing Mrgprs has an antipruritic effect in chronic itch conditions. For this purpose, I have established a humanized mouse itch model. I will use this model to examine whether the treatment with Mrgprs antagonist can block the chronic itch sensation. Specific aim 3 will test the idea that Mrgprs not only mediate the itch sensation in the skin, but also in the airway. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide insight into the periphery mechanisms underlying itch sensation and new therapeutic strategies to treat chronic itch."
"9318815","ABSTRACT Under the support of the previous grant, we tested the hypothesis that PKC?, an important stress regulator, contributes to smooth muscle cell depletion and vascular inflammation during aneurysm development. Using a combination of genetic, molecular, and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrated the essential role of PKC? in regulating vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis in aneurysm. Unexpectedly, we also discovered a novel connection between PKC? and necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis first described a decade ago. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) and its partner RIP1 are among the few identified mediators of necroptosis, underscoring the significance of positioning PKC? within this pathway. We demonstrated that in human aneurysm tissue, SMC levels of both PKC? and RIP3 was upregulated. In mice, gene deletion of either PKC? (Prkcd-/-) or RIP3 (Rip3-/-) produced an aneurysm-resistant phenotype associated with preserved SMCs and diminished inflammation. In preliminary studies, we showed that PKC? regulates Rip3 gene transcription in aortic SMCs, a novel finding highly expected to advance RIP3 biology. The robust aneurysm-protective phenotype of Rip3-/- and Rip3+/- motivated a chemical library screening which led to the discovery of a class of potent and safe RIP3 inhibitors. In this renewal application, we hypothesize that PKC?- STAT3 signaling is a determinant of SMC Rip3 expression and that inhibition of RIP3 may attenuate growth of pre-existing aneurysms. Our objectives for the next 5 years include 1) to determine the molecular mechanism underlying PKC?-mediated Rip3 gene expression in aneurysmal aortic wall, 2) to establish a more comprehensive necroptosis signaling network in aortic SMCs, and 3) to use the new RIP3 inhibitor to block disease progression of pre-existing aneurysms in mice. Two independent specific aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we plan to prove the critical role of STAT3 in PKC?'s regulation of Rip3 by rescuing Prkcd-/- SMCs with a constitutively active STAT3. Next, we will determine whether STAT3 Serine727, a less studied regulatory mechanism, is phosphorylated in aneurysm tissue via a PKC?-dependent mechanism. Mechanistically, we postulate that STAT3 regulates Rip3 gene transcription through a downstream cis-element. We will test this hypothesis using cutting edge technologies such as Chip-sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Specific Aim 2 is both basic and translational, with a goal to address the current knowledge gaps in necroptosis biology and to advance therapeutic development for aneurysm. We will utilize the new RIP3 inhibitors to study necroptosis, addressing the relationship between RIP3 kinase inhibition and apoptosis induction and identifying new RIP3 substrates specific to SMCs. In addition to hypothesis-driven approaches, we will employ phospho- proteomics to unbiasedly identify new components of the necroptosis pathway unique to SMCs. Finally, we will prove in vivo that the new RIP3 inhibitors can reverse SMC depletion, tissue destruction and inflammation when administered to mice with pre-existing aneurysmal dilations. Information produced by the proposed studies is likely to have a high impact on the understanding of programmed necrosis as well as aneurysm therapeutic development."
"9450774","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite growing evidence of its effectiveness in protecting against sexually transmitted infection (STI) and certain cancers, vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) in the United States has stalled. HPV vaccination completion among females was actually lower in 2012 than in 2011. HPV is the most common STI in the US, causes genital warts, and is associated with cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and throat cancers. HPV vaccine is most effective when given before exposure to the virus, and is recommended for routine administration to 11-12 year old females and males. Health care providers play the primary influential role in parents' decisions to vaccinate, yet too often provie weak recommendations for HPV vaccination. Many parents think their preteens are too young for HPV vaccination and teens are not routinely included in the decision to vaccinate. Missed opportunities to vaccinate against HPV at the same clinical visit with other preteen vaccines are far too frequent. Among unvaccinated girls in 2012, 84% had a health-care encounter where they received another adolescent age vaccine but not HPV vaccine. This research aims to eliminate this gap by transforming clinical care through an improved communication system and ultimately normalizing HPV vaccination at the optimal ages of 11-12. Principles of dissemination (conscious effort to spread an evidence- based innovation, the HPV vaccine) and implementation (adoption of an innovation in specific settings) science are used. The multiple baseline design will include an intervention with communication strategies adapted to rolling groups of practices (n=48) that (1) report to the North Carolina Immunization Registry (NCIR); and (2) agree to use mobile devices and web-based modalities to keep up to date on HPV vaccine and to educate parents and preteens about HPV vaccination. The overall objective is to assess the extent to which providers, parents and preteens respond to these proactive communication strategies by vaccinating preteen girls and boys. The long term goal is to prevent HPV-related disease through early intervention and protection against this STI. The central hypothesis is that providers, parents and preteens are relevant decision makers who can be motivated to complete the HPV vaccination series according to public health recommendations. The aims are to (1) Develop new and adapt existing theory-driven dissemination and implementation strategies to motivate providers, parents and preteens to initiate and complete the HPV vaccine series; (2) Evaluate theory driven dissemination and implementation strategies to stimulate communication among providers, parents and preteens to motivate HPV vaccination and completion of the series; and (3) Determine practice characteristics related to adoption, implementation, and maintenance of these dissemination and implementation strategies to motivate HPV vaccination of preteens. The positive impact is that effective HPV vaccination dissemination and implementation strategies will be available for use in practices to reduce HPV infection and related diseases."
"9331985","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fragile X Syndrome is the most common heritable form of intellectual disability and leading monogenetic cause of autism. It has been estimated that 1 in 5,000 males are born with Fragile X Syndrome. This disease is caused by loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a repressor of mRNA translation into protein products. In addition to protein synthesis, FMRP has been observed to affect dendritic spine development. Few studies have demonstrated how the repressive activity of FMRP itself is regulated. FMRP is ubiquitinated in response to glutamate receptor stimulation, providing a potential mechanism to dynamically remove translational repression. The researchers propose that ubiquitination may be a regulatory mechanism to reverse FMRP's repression of protein synthesis. The effects of FMRP ubiquitination on global protein synthesis and downstream pathways are unknown. Recently, the E3 ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and its regulatory subunit Cdh1 were shown to ubiquitinate FMRP. Preliminary evidence suggests that ubiquitination of FMRP contributes to the disassociation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) from target mRNA and subsequent protein synthesis. These data suggest that activity of FMRP and its role as a repressor of translation may be modulated by ubiquitination. Given that FMRP regulates the synthesis of a large and diverse set of proteins that are critical for signaling and synaptic development, ubiquitination of FMRP may drive differential dendritic spine morphology. The central hypothesis is that Cdh1-APC mediated ubiquitination of FMRP regulates protein synthesis and dendritic spine morphology through the disassociation of RISC from targeted mRNA. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that ubiquitination of FMRP leads to increased protein synthesis and more immature spines. Aim 2 will investigate the role of a specific E3 ligase, Cdh1-APC, in downstream FMRP-dependent effects, including protein synthesis and dendritic morphology. Ubiquitination- resistant mutants and Cdh1 shRNA will be utilized to study these mechanisms. The trainee will master a wide range of molecular and cellular biology techniques including cloning, AHA pulse labeling, proximity-ligation assays, immunofluorescence, and automated spine morphology analysis. The proposed research will provide insight into the currently unknown regulation of mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins targeted by FMRP, and will elucidate novel mechanisms underlying translational regulation. This research will provide a foundation for future development of disease mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for FXS and other neurodevelopmental disorders."

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method."

"9222653","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      There is a very substantial need, both within the VA, and within the U.S. population, for more effective treatments for pain associated with burn injury. Our laboratory possesses unique expertise in the study of sodium channels and their binding partners as related to pain, and in dendritic spine dysgenesis as related to pain. We have developed and calibrated burn injury pain models in rodents, and have unequivocally indicted sodium channel Nav1.7 as playing a major role in pain after burn injury. We also have developed a unique gene therapy platform and have shown that we can knockdown specific sodium channel subtypes and ameliorate pain after nerve injury. Targeting of novel molecules identified in our pre-clinical burn injury studies usinga gene therapy approach, and a small molecule compound already approved for human use for other neurological indications, holds promise for more effective treatment options for Veterans with burn injuries. In this study:  We will assess the therapeutic potential of gene therapy knockdown of Nav1.3 in burn injury by building  upon our previous findings that Nav1.3 up-regulation in DRG and spinal cord dorsal horn contributes to  neuropathic pain, and that knockdown of Nav1.3 results in attenuation of pain due to traumatic nerve injury.  We will examine whether disruption of contactin trafficking attenuates pain after burn injury by building  upon our demonstration that: a) contactin-1 forms a complex with Nav1.3 sodium channels and  facilitates insertion of functional channels within the cell membrane; and b) contactin-1 is up-regulated  following axotomy and co-localizes with this channel in axonal tips within neuromas.  We will explore the therapeutic potential of Nav1.6 knockdown in the treatment of pain via Nav1.6-  siRNA in our burn injury model as a follow up to our findings that afferent signal transmission of  mechanical pain after burn injury is not critically dependent on Nav1.8 or Nav1.7, and that Nav1.6 is not  only expressed in DRG neurons but also has biophysical attributes that poise it to contribute to  repetitive action potential firing.  We will test whethe targeting the Rac1 pathway through systemic administration of FDA-approved PAK1 inhibitor FK228, can block dendritic spine dysgenesis on dorsal horn neurons and ameliorate  neuropathic pain after burn injury as a follow up to our demonstration that Rac1-mediated spine  dysgenesis contributes to neuropathic pain following second-degree burn injury. All of our studies are aimed at development of new therapies for chronic pain associated with burn injury."
"9346842","Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a disease of growing incidence globally, including in the US (by 3% per year). With the recent success of anti-viral therapies, the etiology of HCC in the American population is projected to shift from viral (HBV, HCV) hepatitis to primarily fatty liver disease in the near future. Currently, only one effective systemic therapy has been developed for HCC ? the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib. The development of more selective molecularly targeted therapies has so far been unsuccessful in this disease. This failure is due in part to the lack of a preclinical, patient-derived xenograft (PDX)- enabling HCC tumor bank drawn from an American HCC patient population to help patient selection and model new therapies. In addition, modeling underlying liver disease has rarely been pursued in preclinical drug development. PDX-enabling tumor banks exist in Asia, but tend to be from viral and alcohol-driven disease, as opposed to obesity, which is the driver of growing incidence in the West. Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) has begun collecting primary patient HCC tumors from surgeries performed in Boston and will partner with Woodland Pharmaceuticals, the applicant, to expand these into a PDX resource better enabling new HCC therapy development. Woodland will expand the tumors to up to five passages in mice and then characterize the passages for drug sensitivity, both in vitro and in vivo to a panel of drugs. Demonstration of stable expansion will lead to a phase 2 application to further expand and characterize the HCC tumor bank (including tracking of patient treatment and outcomes at the academic site), in models with underlying liver disease, in readiness for PDX service commercialization in the USA."
"9257200","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Life-preserving strategies in the face of a cancer diagnosis, including radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy, can compromise nearly all aspects of the female reproductive axis resulting in infertility, subfertility, or premature menopause. In addition, several conditions and disease states can have a similar consequence. Fortunately for females, the ovary has the potential for diverse fertility preservation options ranging from standard (i.e. IVF, ICSI, embryo banking) to investigational (ovarian tissue cryopreservation, ovarian transplant). In vitro follicle growth is another emerging technology that has tremendous promise for a subset of individuals who have blood-borne malignancies, cannot tolerate supraphysiological hormone levels, cannot delay treatment, or do not have a sperm donor. Tremendous success has been achieved in performing IVFG in the mouse to the degree that live births have been achieved using gametes derived from nearly all methods attempted to date. The translation of this technology to large mammalian species, however, has not been trivial due to significant differences in factors such as follicle size, development, metabolic requirements, and physical niche. In this project, we will develop smart biomaterials that will provide human follicles with the ability to self-regulate their physical environment as they grow to terminal stages of development. We anticipate that such an environment will maintain the coordinated growth of the oocyte and its companion granulosa cells, which is required for optimal endocrine function and gamete quality. We will also develop new non-invasive endocrine measures of follicle health that, through a precise algorithm, could be used in association with conventional steroid and peptide assays to predict the maturity of individual follicles. Follicles developed to the right stage of maturity will contain the highest quality gamete, and we will use innovative nanonewton force measurements to quantitatively understand the mechanisms by which a chromosomally normal egg is generated both in vivo and in vitro during meiosis These experiments have broad implications on human health as a chromosomally normal egg is a fundamental pre-requisite to create a healthy offspring. Our aims are based on experiments that integrate three model organisms - mouse, cow, and human - and span multiple disciplines - reproductive medicine, cell and molecular biology, bioengineering, and biophysics. This union will allow us to advance our understanding of human reproductive biology in a quantitative way, and at the same time provide key insights into the possible clinical translation of in vitro follicle culture systems to preserve fertility in young patients with cancer or other reproductive disorders."
"9238795","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis, the hardening and narrowing of arteries leads to coronary artery disease, a leading cause of death. The progression of atherosclerosis is accelerated by low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), which is responsible for transporting cholesterol from the bloodstream back to the liver. HDL-C levels are influenced by numerous environmental and genetic factors. Large human genome- wide association studies (GWAS) provide new opportunities to identify novel DNA variants and genes that influence HDL-C and risk of disease. A recent GWAS identified four variants (r2 > 0.75, rs737337) located less than 5 kb upstream of ANGPTL8 that are strongly associated (n~185,000, P=4.6x10-17) with HDL-C. Bioinformatic predictions and experimental data including epigenetic marks, transcription factor binding, and open chromatin sites that correlate with ANGPTL8 expression suggest a regulatory role for these variants acting on ANGPTL8. Studying these variants will help reveal the mechanisms by which ANGPTL8 influences HDL-C levels. Circulating ANGPTL8, also named Betatrophin, is correlated with atherogenic lipid profiles in insulin resistant individuals, and is increased following a meal, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism. ANGPTL8 expression is limited to the liver and adipose tissues despite being entirely contained within one intron of the ubiquitously expressed DOCK6 gene. Given that the liver plays a critical role in the regulation of HDL-C, the expression pattern provides further support that the HDL-associated variants act on ANGPTL8 rather than DOCK6 or other nearby genes. Our goal is to identify the functional molecular mechanism(s) underlying association of this GWAS locus with HDL-C and the allele-specific effects of metabolic perturbations on ANGPTL8 expression. We hypothesize that the tissue-specific expression of ANGPTL8 is mediated by promoter, enhancer, and/or repressor interactions, and that these interactions can be influenced both by HDL-associated genetic variants and by specific metabolic stimuli. We will determine the tissue specificity of the ANGPTL8 promoter and regulatory elements using reporter assays, and we will investigate allelic differences in transcriptional activity and protei binding of HDL-C- associated variants to determine the molecular mechanism at this locus. By engineering cell lines containing the alternate HDL-C-associated alleles, we will evaluate the effects of the variants in a genomic context. To determine the metabolic stimuli that alter cell autonomous expression of ANGPTL8, we will treat the cell lines containing each haplotype with glucose, insulin, and other stimuli suggested to regulate ANGPTL8. Taken together, these experiments will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ANGPTL8 is activated, how HDL-C-associated DNA variant(s) in distinct regulatory elements interact, and how metabolic perturbations influence these processes. Studying the human variants and their interaction with metabolic factors will pave the way for developing novel therapies based on this new target gene."
"9247814","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Estrogens are a class of steroid hormones that can aid recovery from brain injury and reduce the impact of certain neurological disorders. Recently, the central nervous system of humans and other animals has been shown capable of generating its own local supply of estrogens, providing new opportunities for the targeted treatment of brain diseases. Historically, the clinical use of estrogens has produced mixed success, possibly because estrogenic drug treatments are designed to mimic long term actions of estrogens (days-weeks) whereas cognitive function may depend critically on the short-term actions of estrogens (seconds-minutes). Indeed, treating neurological disorders with systemic doses of estrogens is associated with adverse side effects and reduced patient compliance. The goal of this research program is to characterize the mechanisms for rapid estrogen production and action ('rapid estrogen signaling') within discrete brain regions, and to understand the consequences of these events for sensorimotor integration and behavior. Taking advantage of recent methodological advances, these studies will combine sensitive real-time measures of brain estrogen concentrations, acute recordings of identified neurons, and contemporary behavioral assessments to understand the functional significance of rapid estrogen signaling in brain circuits. This work will address a fundamental gap in our understanding of how estrogen production within the brain guides complex behavior, and will ultimately inform the development of highly-targeted estrogen therapies for cognitive and neurological disorders."

The strategy of multiple infusions to increase efficacy and sustain antidepressant effects has not yet been systematically evaluated in an RCT. The proposed study is a one-center, interventional, efficacy study designed to determine antidepressant outcomes of serial ketamine infusions compared to a single ketamine infusion among veterans with TRD. We have hypothesized that six infusions will be superior to a single infusion of ketamine in both decreasing severity of depressive symptoms and maintaining response. Participants will be male/female veterans (18 to 75 years old) of any era or military background who suffer from TRD defined as failure to achieve remission from at least 2 antidepressant trials of different pharmacological classes. Potential participants will be recruited from Mental Health clinics and screened for eligibility using a two stage process (phone/chart review, followed by interview). Exclusion criteria includes post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis-related disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol/substance use disorder 6 months prior to screening; unstable medical illness; serious/imminent suicidal/homicidal risk; Parkinson's disease, dementia, seizures; traumatic brain injury; contraindicated medications (e.g., MAO inhibitors, barbiturates); received ECT during current episode; pregnancy/nursing. Baseline assessments will be completed 1-2 weeks prior to starting treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two parallel treatment conditions: 1) six ketamine infusions at 0.5 mg/kg or 2) single ketamine infusion at 0.5 mg/kg preceded by five midazolam infusions at 0.045 mg/kg. Midazolam was chosen as an active placebo given similar pharmacokinetics and dissociative effect profile to ketamine. Each intervention will be provided for a total of 12-day infusion-phase on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule. The, follow-up visits will occur at weekly intervals for the first 4 weeks, at 2-week intervals for the next 8 weeks, and at 4-week intervals for the remaining 12 weeks or until relapse. The primary end point is the Montgomery- ?sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score 24 hours following the last infusion where the peak antidepressant effects of ketamine occur. Secondary outcomes for the treatment phase include remission defined by MADRS<10, and response defined as a reduction in the baseline MADRS score e 50%. For the follow-up period, durability of antidepressant response will be defined by time to relapse to a MADRS score <50% of baseline at that visit. Independent evaluation of depressive symptom severity and potential covariates of antidepressant effect (e.g., pain intensity, level of anxiety) will be ascertained at baseline, at several time points during infusion period, and at follow-up. On the day of infusion, subjects will arrive in the morning after an overnight fast. Hemodynamic measures will be recorded every 10 min for 1 hour beginning 10 min before infusion. Subjects will then receive IV infusion over 40 minutes. Severity of depressive symptoms, pain intensity, level of anxiety will be obtained before and 24 hours after infusion. Acute dissociative effects, manic/hypomanic symptoms, and psychotomimetic effects will be measured 30 minutes before the start of each infusion and at the end of infusion (t0+40 mins) and again at t0+120mins and t0+180mins. The infusion will be discontinued in the event of significant adverse events. Procedures for the subsequent infusions at days 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 will be identical to those of the first infusion."
"9385084","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Developmental Neurology Training Program at Boston Children's Hospital is designed to produce trainees who are equipped for and deeply engaged in state-of-the-art research in developmental neuroscience from a detailed and mechanistic perspective, while also cognizant of the clinical importance of their field and the clinical challenges and opportunities today. We take advantage of the presence of an extraordinary community of basic neuroscientists at Children's Hospital and its affiliated institutions, embedded in a world-class clinical setting. We select outstanding candidates who will work in one of 30 mentor laboratories and engage in fundamental research into the mechanisms that guide the development of the nervous system. These highly interactive laboratories employ genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, electrophysiology, anatomy and behavior and use systems ranging from Drosophila to mouse, rat, and human cells. Consequently, our trainees are exposed to the full breadth of the field and are prepared to make informed strategic decisions. It is a special feature of this training program that each trainee wil be paired with a clinician or clinician-scientist as a co-mentor with the goal of helping trainees o understand the relationship of basic research to health and disease. This co-mentoring relationship will take advantage of the hospital setting and augment the rich opportunities for learning about translational research. The goal of the program is not to distract from an intensive research experience in fundamental molecular mechanisms of neurodevelopment, but rather to inform the trainee of its context in human health. The research experience of the trainee is also enhanced by an unusually extensive mentoring relationship with the Director of the Training Program, Prof. Thomas Schwarz, who meets with and advises all the trainees to offer feedback and career guidance. The training experience is also supplemented by a wealth of career-guidance instruction, including presentations skills, job- seeking skills, information about diverse career options, and of course the responsible conduct of research. All of this is situated within an environment of extraordinary resources and intellectual life. We have recruited a racially and ethnically diverse faculty of mentors and are committed to enhancing the diversity of the community of neuroscientists through our Training Program. The program thus seeks to enhance the experience of trainees beyond the opportunity to work with superb scientists tackling essential questions. There are few challenges in neuroscience as great as understanding the processes that result in neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disabilities and there is a growing awareness that many affective disorders arise from errors in development. Without deeper mechanistic understanding of these processes, the clinical challenges will remain. Training the next generation for this task is imperative."
"9237322","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The zebra fish has emerged as a powerful model system to study neural development, physiology, and disease. It is ideal for this particular purpose since it is a small and translucent vertebrate with a wide behavioral repertoire. Despite this progress, there are still comparatively few transgenic lines that allow the full exploitation f optogenetic approaches. For example, the field still lacks specific drivers and reporters for most neurotransmitters or peptides, and existing lines that mark specific brain regions or nuclei often lack the necessary specificity. The zebra fish as a model system is thus still lacking the essential tool set that the Drosophila community has built in the last decade. To overcome these limitations, we propose to generate transgenic lines that allow the specific expression of proteins of interest in restricted subpopulations of neurons that are specified by brain region and/or by neurotransmitter subtype. We will use enhancer trapping to generate 240 lines that drive region- and cell- type specific neural expression via a modified Gal4 vector (Aim 1), and we will use genome engineering to generate 12 lines that drive expression in neurons producing the major classes of neurotransmitters (Aim 2). An essential component of the enterprise will be the design and establishment of an online interface that will provide details of each transgenic line. Researchers will be provided with extensive details of each line's characteristics and well-annotated image datasets. The Engert and Schier lab have extensive expertise in anatomical and functional imaging of the zebra fish nervous system as well as the molecular and genetic toolbox that is necessary for the proposed project. The project will be further supported by an advisory committee consisting of leaders in the field of zebra fish neurobiology."
"9272875","ABSTRACT CORE A: Vector Core Core Director: Julie Johnston, Ph.D. The Vector Core is a critical resource for University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and other investigators requiring viral based vectors for basic and translational studies for the development of gene therapies for acquired and inherited disease. Since its establishment, one of the main objectives of the Core has been to provide advanced vector technologies to facilitate the translation of gene therapy research into clinical treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF). The Vector Core has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the CF research community, providing services to NIDDK P30 Molecular Therapy and CF center members for over 20 years (1993?present), supporting CF Foundation researchers for 18 years (1992?2011) and serving as the NHLBI Gene Therapy Resource Program (GTRP) Preclinical Core since its inception in 2007. During this time, the Core has offered novel serotype AAV vectors, variously pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and adenoviral vectors for the development of gene therapies for CF and other lung disorders. The Core has also maintained close ties to key laboratories involved in the development of next generation vectors and acts as the distribution center for novel materials to the research community. In support of this RFA, the Core will generate research grade, GMP process comparable grade and GMP/clinical grade vectors (the latter to be offered in May 2015) to support basic and clinical CF research by center members located in one of 3 institutions/1 consortium (University of Pennsylvania, University of Massachusetts, Johns Hopkins, UK Gene Therapy CF Consortium) comprising our multi-site CF center."
"9253210","Radikal Therapeutics (RTX) is developing a first-in-class cytoprotective small molecule agent (R-801) intended for the acute resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock (HS), the leading cause of death in trauma patients worldwide. Narrowly-directed therapies for HS have fared poorly in the clinic, suggesting that the pathogenesis of clinical HS is complex and arguing that a broader multi-faceted approach may be required. To this end, RTX is testing the utility of combining 2 classic approaches into a new single molecular entity. R-801 is a both: 1) a broad-spectrum catalytic antioxidant that removes intracellular redox stress, and 2) a selective pharmacological activator of the ischemic preconditioning (IPC) response. We hypothesize that this combination will provide at least additive and potentially synergistic reduction in HS-associated tissue injury and dysfunction. In rats subjected to lethal hemorrhage and resuscitation, R-801 administered 5 min before resuscitation reduced the fall in mean arterial pressure by 28% and attenuated the elevations in serum AST, creatinine, and pancreatic lipase by 72%, 62%, and 84%, respectively (p<0.002). Aim #1: Scale-up R-801 synthesis to multi-kg level production. In order to reduce manufacturing cost of goods and thereby strengthen our competitive position, RTX will carry out process research in order to minimize column chromatography steps in the manufacturing of R-801 and lessen manufacturing safety concerns related to the use of tetrazole catalysis. Aim #2: Establish the pharmacodynamics of R-801 in an ovine model of HS. In order to test the efficacy of R-801 in a large animal system, we have selected a classic HS model in sheep created by the rapid withdrawal of blood to achieve a fixed level of hypotensive MAP. We will utilize anesthetized female Merino sheep subjected to fixed-pressure hypotension for 90 min via a 10 min withdrawal of blood to an MAP of 40 mmHg. 5 min prior to reperfusion with shed blood, sheep will receive R-801 (0, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg IV). A sham group will not undergo HS nor receive R-801. In addition to hemodynamic and respiratory measurements, terminal outcome endpoints at 24 h will include markers of tissue injury and inflammation. Each of the measures has been carefully selected so as to reveal a critical feature of organ injury. Aim #3: Transfer manufacturing technology to a GMP toll manufacturer to support Phase 1 clinical trials. In order to prepare R-801 drug product suitable for an IND submission, RTX will transfer its manufacturing methodology to a toll manufacturing firm, Regis Technologies (Morten Grove, IL), where a multi-kg GMP-grade batch will be produced to support clinical investigations. Aim #4: Prepare IND documentation to support an FDA-regulated study of the acute safety, tolerance, PK, metabolism, and excretion profile of an IV bolus infusion of R-801 in healthy human volunteers. In order to position RTX to carry out clinical first-in-man safety and PK investigations, we will submit to the FDA a full IND application in support of the Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic studies."
"9245711","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is focused on the development of new enantioselective chiral catalyst-controlled approaches to bioactive steroids and diterpenes. Due to the importance of steroidal hormones for the regulation of vital biological processes in the human body, a significant portion of natural product-based drugs are derived from various natural or unnatural steroids. Steroid-based drugs are utilized for the treatment of inflammation, allergic reactions, heart diseases, cancer, metabolic diseases, and in important health-related areas such as contraception and fitness. The majority of steroid-based drugs are obtained by semi-synthesis using feedstock isolated from plant or animal sources. While nowadays such processes could be conducted on an industrial scale, the reliance on semi-synthetic methods significantly limits the structural diversity of the steroid-based small molecules available for biological evaluation. In contrast, fully synthetic approaches could significantly improve the availability of otherwise difficult-to-prepare stereoisomeric steroidal scaffolds with unusual substitution or oxidation patterns. The objective of the proposed research is to develop stereoselective Michael/double aldol cascade reactions and apply them to the rapid assembly of cardiac steroids and diterpenes of the isopimarane family. To achieve this objective, we propose the following specific aims: (1) to develop new stereoselective catalytic Michael/double aldol cascade reactions for the stereoselective synthesis of cardenolides and bufadienolides; (2) to develop chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)-controlled regioselective and stereoselective glycosylation of cardenolide-based polyols; (3) To develop an asymmetric approach to bioactive isopimaranes."
"9308119","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutant hemoglobin (Hb) molecule that polymerizes in hypoxia, leading to vaso-occlusion and hemolysis. Pulmonary Hypertension (PH), characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure and endothelial dysfunction, is a leading cause of death in adult SCD patients and is strongly associated with hemolysis and platelet activation. Notably, we and others have shown that hemolysis directly activates platelets, and activated platelets are known to secrete vasoactive substances, such as the glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), which promotes endothelial dysfunction and vascular injury. While prior studies link hemolysis and platelet activation to vascular injury, the mechanism by which hemolysis induces platelet activation, and the mediators linking platelet activation to endothelial dysfunction and PH are unknown. We recently discovered a novel mechanism of hemolysis-induced platelet activation in which Hb (released via hemolysis) inhibits platelet mitochondrial complex V, leading to the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), which activate platelets. Preliminary data now suggest a novel receptor mediated pathway in which Hb activates platelet toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) to inhibit complex V. Further, we show ADP also inhibits complex V and generates mtROS to activate platelets and release platelet TSP1. Importantly, circulating TSP1 is elevated in SCD patients. Based on these data, we hypothesize that hemolysis-induced platelet mtROS cause TSP1 release from platelets, which promotes downstream endothelial dysfunction and PH in SCD. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims that integrate in vitro experiments in healthy and SCD human platelets, ex vivo microfluidic vessel studies, and in vivo murine models. Aim 1 will elucidate the signaling pathway by which Hb and ADP activate TLR4 and purinergic signaling to post-translationally modify platelet mitochondrial complex V, leading to mtROS-dependent platelet activation. Aim 2 will utilize bone marrow chimeric mice to determine whether TSP1 released from the platelet promotes vascular injury through interaction with its endothelial cognate receptor CD47. Aim 3 will determine whether pharmacological scavenging of mtROS or blocking of TSP1 or CD47 function attenuates PH pathogenesis in a SCD murine model. Transgenic SCD mice will be chronically treated with MitoQ (a mitochondrial targeted antioxidant), TSP1 blocking antibody, or anti-CD47 blocking antibody and markers of endothelial dysfunction and PH assessed. Ex vivo microfluidics will be used to dissect the effects of MitoQ on platelets versus the endothelium. This project will elucidate a novel receptor-mediated signaling axis by which hemolysis induces vascular injury and PH. Further, pre-clinical testing will establish mtROS and the TSP1- CD47 axis as viable therapeutic targets in SCD-PH and lay the groundwork for future clinical trials to repurpose MitoQ and anti-CD47 antibody (both currently in Phase II clinical trials for indications) for SCD-PH."

"9254458","IMAGING GROUP HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING SHARED FACILITY (HRISF) ABSTRACT The detection and imaging of molecules in biological systems is a vitally important tool in cancer research. As the genetic basis for cancers are identified, the subsequent objectives are to identify the localization, functions, and interactions of gene products and to determine their role in the initiation and progression of disease. These objectives require highly sophisticated methodologies for the analysis of molecular events in vitro, in live cells, and in animal models of disease. Therefore, the High Resolution Imaging Shared Facility (HRISF) provides Comprehensive Cancer Center investigators with access to complex instrumentation required for the detailed microscopic analysis of cells and tissues and the expertise to use it productively. The imaging resources available include: 1) digital imaging; 2) Ca2+ imaging; 3) a FRET system; 4) a Zeiss LSM 710 equipped for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM); 5) a Nikon A1R high speed confocal system optimized for live cell and tissue imaging; and 6) a Nikon A1R Multiphoton system optimized for intravital imaging with a Coherent Chameleon Vision II ultrafast laser. In addition, the Nikon A1R Multiphoton system is mounted on a vibration isolation table and has all of the equipment required for long-term animal anesthesia, respiration, and body temperature maintenance.

"9037012","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge facing cell replacement and regenerative therapies for retinal diseases is generating retinal cells or tissue at the quality an scale necessary to be therapeutically relevant. To meet this challenge, we need to be able to control the growth and developmental potential of progenitor/stem cells such that certain fates can be selected over others and differentiation programs are robust enough to impart desired functions. Key insights into this come from studying how the retina develops using various genetically tractable animal model systems ranging from Drosophila to mouse. In this project, we examine the question of how key developmental transcription factors regulate the neurogenic properties of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), from the perspectives of promoting neurogenesis, maintaining progenitors in a neurogenic environment, and generating neuronal diversity. In the first aim, we test the hypothesis that the homeodomain protein Vsx2 (formerly Chx10) controls the timing of onset of neurogenesis in the embryonic retina through a cell-autonomous circuit that sets the proper expression levels/activities of a minimum of four other transcription factors in pre-neurogenic RPCs; Mitf, p27Kip1, Pax6, and Sox2. We also test the hypothesis that the acquisition of a dependence on Notch signaling as a mechanism for progenitor cell maintenance is linked to this timing. In the second aim, we address the hypothesis that the homeodomain protein Lhx2 is a key regulator of progenitor cell maintenance, neurogenic output, and progenitor competence during retinal neurogenesis. Using conditional inactivation genetics to bypass Lhx2's early and essential role in optic vesicle patterning and optic cup morphogenesis, we will test the model that Lhx2 maintains RPCs with high neurogenic potential, and by doing so, establishes a dynamic balance with other RPCs such that they persist through the entire interval of retinal development. Second, we will test the model that Lhx2 is required in select RPCs to respond to negative feedback signals from postmitotic, differentiating retinal precursors, and by doing so, limits the production of specific cell types and contributes to the generation of neuronal diversity in the retina. Third, we've identified a critical window during early retinal development Lhx2 is required for RPCs to transition into another competence state necessary for production of later cell types. Only a couple of other factors have been proposed to regulate early versus late competence, and a potential relationship with Lhx2 will be tested. We will also adapt the newly described HA-tagging method with transcriptome profiling to discover new genes regulated by Lhx2 that promote the transition in competence. Completion of these studies will provide new insight into how RPC maintenance and neurogenic potential is controlled during embryogenesis, information that can be applied to stem cell engineering and regenerative medicine."
"9302768","Summary/Abstract (Pilot Project Program) The Pilot Project Program (PPP) contributes to the mission of the M-LEEaD Center by supporting pilot projects that encourage innovation, creativity, and multidisciplinary collaborations, especially among basic scientists, clinical researchers, and community and regulatory stakeholders. The Pilot Project Program is an important mechanism for attracting new individuals to our center and for providing support to generate preliminary data to compete for external funding. The aims of the Pilot Project Program are to: 1) attract established investigators new to our center who can provide new insights and approaches to questions regarding the relationships between lifestage environmental exposures and disease; 2) encourage innovation, creativity, and multidisciplinary collaborations, especially between basic scientists, clinical researchers, and community and regulatory stakeholders; 3) facilitate our center members? ability to respond quickly and effectively to new and quick-turnaround research opportunities, especially those from NIEHS; and 4) provide important support for early-stage investigators to generate preliminary data for developing independent research projects and compete for independent funding. This approach was successful in our initial funding period as evidenced by the number of junior faculty supported, the new collaborations that were formed, the participation of scientists new to environmental health research that participated the center activities as a result of the Pilot Project Program, the number of external grant applications submitted, the number of resulting publications, and career advancement, all as summarized in the progress report. Important advances in the administration of the Pilot Project Program during the last cycle include the formation of a reviewer consortium with other P30 centers to help improve objectivity of the reviews as well as avoid conflicts of interest that can result from reviews by others in the same institution. In the next cycle of the Pilot Project Program will build on the momentum generated in the first four years by continuing the wide distribution of the Request for Applications throughout the School of Public Health and the Medicial School, continuing the Reviewer consortium and continuing the Core facilities. We will also continue our practice of including a COEC member on the review committee responsible for ranking of the proposals to assure their input. Together, these practices will continue the groundbreaking work started in the first cycle of the Pilot Project Program."
"9251036","F7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Infertility affects 10-15% of couples, making it one of the more common disorders for people of reproductive age. Over 20% of cases are idiopathic in nature, and it is commonly thought that many of these have an underlying genetic etiology. Identifying genes involved in unexplained infertility not only informs an understanding of the mechanisms regulating fertility, but also provides clinical information to support diagnosis, genetic counseling, and eventual therapeutic intervention. One approach to identifying genes involved in infertility is to examine the phenotype-genotype correlation in subjects with a clinical phenotype (e.g., unexplained infertility) accompanied with a de novo balanced chromosomal rearrangement, as is the foundation of the Developmental Genome Anatomy Project (DGAP, dgap.harvard.edu). One subject in this study, designated DGAP230, has oligospermia and a balanced translocation, 46,XY,t(20;22)(q13.3;q11.2). We hypothesize that the translocation breakpoints disrupt or dysregulate genes important in fertility.  The goal of this proposal is to identify the gene(s) causing DGAP230's infertility, and to train a graduate student in the fields of reproductive biology and clinical genetics. We will characterize the translocation to nucleotide resolution, directing an investigation of candidate genes. We will evaluate whether any candidate genes are dysregulated and determine if altered gene expression is specifically mediated by the translocation. In order to implicate the dysregulated gene(s) in infertility, we will use mice and yeast as model organisms to determine causality of the dysregulated gene(s) in infertility and investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this phenotype. The proposed study should allow us to identify novel genes implicated in infertility, uncover mechanisms underlying its pathology, and establish a reproductive biology and clinical genetics research background in a graduate student who would like one day to establish a laboratory that further studies this clinical population."
"9346979","PROJECT SUMMARY PROBLEM: Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder in human populations across the globe, affecting an estimated 50 million people in the United States and 360 million people worldwide. As a primary means of interpersonal communication, hearing is central to daily life and its loss can have dramatic impact on cognitive development in children, mental health in adolescents and adults, contribute to dementia in the elderly, and can result in an overall increase in mortality. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of hearing loss caused by damage to the sensory cells of the cochlea or to the auditory nerve (sensorineural hearing loss). A major barrier to the development and evaluation of promising new therapies is the inability to deliver macromolecules or complex regimen of small molecules to the sensory cells of the cochlea. NEED: There is a pressing need for a delivery system that can safely and reliably distribute a range of therapeutic modalities to the sensory epithelium along the length of the cochlea. GOAL: The goal of the proposed studies is to develop a novel cochlear delivery system and quantify its distribution and safety profile in a large animal model. COMPANY?S TECHNOLOGY/PRELIMINARY DATA: Akouos is building off of a decade of work studying drug distribution in the cochlea. This work has informed key design parameters of a robust delivery system, including infusion volumes and flow rates that can be safely tolerated, and have uncovered unanticipated barriers to broad distribution in vivo. Based on these prior studies, we have designed and built an acute delivery system capable of delivering a wide range of molecules, including macromolecules and nanoparticles, directly to the cochlea via the round window membrane. AIMS: Here, we propose studies to refine key device parameters and a surgical procedure for application in a sheep model that closely resembles human middle and inner ear anatomy. Further, we propose a distribution and safety study of the delivery system to demonstrate effective distribution of adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles along the basal-apical axis of the cochlea in the sheep model. The proposed project will demonstrate that an acute delivery system can safely and reliably deliver macromolecules throughout the cochlea, and thereby provide a means to test novel therapies that have the potential to prevent and reverse hearing loss due to multiple causes . MILESTONE: A delivery system that can distribute AAV particles to achieve transgene expression that differs no more than 50% from cochlear base to apex in a large animal model, without significantly increasing hearing thresholds. WHAT?S NEXT: At the successful conclusion of this Phase I SBIR, we will be poised to move forward into IND-enabling studies with a gene therapy candidate to support human clinical trials for a form of monogenic deafness. Phase II of the SBIR proposal will fund a confirmation proof of concept study in a transgenic disease model, as well as a GLP toxicity study in a large animal model."
"9278868","Abstract:  Over the last five years, the characterization of the pluripotent state and its differentiated progeny has made  remarkable progress. Previous studies have identified most of the building blocks participating in the  establishment, maintenance and differentiation of the pluripotent state. However, most studies so far relied on  correlation based evidence and inference, and did not yet obtain a functionally validated picture of its  regulatory foundation. Here, we propose to overcome parts of this problem by addressing the following  questions:  Aim 1: What are the functionally relevant cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and gene regulatory networks  (GRNs) for pluripotency and differentiation initiation? Previous work has mapped the epigenetic state,  transcription factor binding and RNA expression in pluripotent, reprogramming and differentiating cells, yielding  a list of putative gene regulatory elements (GREs). Here, we will define the subset of functionally relevant  GREs and CRMs for these cell types. To that end, we will employ massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA)  to assess the functionality of thousands of GREs in parallel, identify their upstream transcriptional regulators  through targeted motif mutagenesis and define their phenotypic relevance through epigenome editing  mediated loss of function experiments for hundreds of GREs.  Aim 2: What functional role does DNA methylation play in the regulation of CRMs in pluripotency and  differentiation? While it is well established that changes in the DNA methylation patterns can demarcate GREs,  it is less clear whether these changes are functionally relevant for the proper operation of the corresponding  CRMs. To investigate the contextual relevance of DNA methylation changes, we will employ a modified version  of our MPRA that allows for the identification of those GREs that operate in a methylation sensitive fashion.  These experiments will yield insights into context specific role of DNA methylation in the control of cell type  specific GRNs.  Aim 3: What is the cis-regulatory code controlling long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) activity and localization in  pluripotency and differentiation? Recent findings from the Project II of this proposal identified a set of lncRNAs  critical for pluripotency and differentiation. However, their regulation on the DNA and RNA level remains  elusive. In order to address this question, we will employ two distinct novel MPRA designs, one for DNA  elements and one adapted to RNA elements. These experiments will define the cis-regulatory landscape of  lncRNA regulation on the DNA and RNA level in pluripotency and differentiation."
"9251860","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is focused on understanding the physical and mechanistic properties of enzymes that underlie their exquisite function. In recent years, protein motions have been implicated as essential to achieve an extremely rapid catalysis of bond cleavage events. A spatial and temporal resolution of such protein motions is being pursued using enzyme prototypes that catalyze hydrogen and methyl transfer reactions. A description of the hierarchy and range of the requisite protein motions (covering time scales that can differ by ca. 1015 fold) will take place utilizing highly developed kinetic and biophysical probes. A second emerging area in biological catalysis concerns the post-translational modification of peptides that have been synthesized at the ribosome. A combination of structural and biochemical probes is addressing the enigmatic pathway that produces the bacterial cofactor and vitamin, pyrroloquinoline quinone. As the result of a number of recent breakthrough observations, it appears that resolution of this long-standing problem is now within reach."
"9267506","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radioluminescence microscopy (RLM) is a newly developed method for imaging radionuclide uptake in live single cells. Current methods of radiotracer imaging are limited to measuring the average radiotracer uptake in large cell populations and, as a result, lack the ability to quantify cell-to-cell variations. With the new raio- luminescence microscopy technique, however, it is possible to visualize radiotracer uptake within individual cells in a fluorescence microscope environment. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary innovation in a key component used in this technique. This key part in the radioluminescence microscopy imaging system is the scintillator that converts ionizing beta radiation into optical photons that are imaged with a CCD camera. In this work, an improved scintillator will be developed, specifically for use in a radioluminescence microscopy system that will offer unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution. Such a technological advance has the potential for widespread use in research and in hospitals, providing a means to characterize how properties specific to individual cells (e.g. gene expression, cell cycle, cell damage, and cel morphology) affect the uptake and retention of radiotracers. Higher spatial resolution will allow single cells to be probed in situ, in dense tissue sections, and will dramatically improve the throughput of the instruments, allowing thousands of cells to be imaged at once. These new capabilities will be critical to help researchers better understand the behavior of rare single cels such as stem cells or drug-resistant cells.  The work during Phase I was successful in demonstrating the significant RLM performance improvements with thin films of a new highly dense transparent scintillator, europium-activated lutetium oxide (Lu2O3:Eu). This material has the highest density (9.5 g/cm3) of any known scintillator, high effective atomic number (67.3), excellent light output, and an emission wavelength (610 nm) for which Si sensors have a very high quantum efficiency. Scintillator specimens were integrated into a radioluminescence microscope demonstrating improved performance and the feasibility of our approach.  Our ultimate goal is to commercialize this technology as a radioluminescence-enabled imaging dish, which will have a standard form factor but will include a thin coating of the Lu2O3:Eu scintillator at the bottom. As such, the technological innovation will provide a valuable new tool to researchers allowing unprecedented localization of radiotracer uptake down to single living cells. This new innovative technology will have widespread use as an addition to current fluorescence microscope instruments in use today and thus will have great commercial potential."
"9247927","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic proteins, such as histone methyltransferases represent important potential drug targets for indications like cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. At Reaction Biology Corporation (RBC), we are working toward the complete coverage of all epigenetic targets, including HMTs, to identify and improve epigenetic modulators that can be used in research and drug discovery. In this Phase II application, we have proposed three aims following successful Phase I studies to continue the understanding of HMTs' biological functions and as new drug targets. The aims include 1) Complete the screening of HMTs for identifying new probes and building the chemical-epigenetic data base; 2) Broader HTS and Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) study to identify and increase the potency of NSD inhibitors; and 3) Evaluating NSD inhibitors' efficacy in cell based assays, and determining their kinetic MOAs and early DMPK/tox profiles. We'll meet the following milestones: (1) Develop and commercialize 10 or more HMT probes as general research tools for at least 5 HMTs; 2) Improve at least 2 lead compounds' potency into the nanomolar range against NSDs that have different structure scaffolds, with good cell based activity and DMPK profiles; and (3) we will be able to launch one of the largest publicly available chemical-epigenetic data bases built on the screening activities from the compound collections that include most of the FDA approved drugs, clinical trial agents, diversified libraries, and natural products."
"9452717","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition that results in significant loss of motor function and reduction in quality of life for the approximatel 265,000 Americans affected.  For many years, a dogma held by those studying SCI was that long-range regeneration of descending tracts was the key to regaining function.  However, more recent research has shown that functional recovery is due to local rewiring of these tracts to propriospinal neurons and plasticity of spared neural tissue within the spinal cord.  To better understand how this regeneration occurs, we need to identify which neuronal populations are involved in these local rewiring events after SCI.  While the local circuitry that contributes to locomotion via central pattern generators is well defined in model organisms, the full details of the interneuron (IN) circuitry contributing to rhythm generation and frequency modulation are still being defined in mammals.  Currently, very few examples exist with firm links between developmental identity, as assessed by molecular and/or transcription factor profiles, and functional identity, as assessed by electrophysiology and/or connectivity patterns.  New tools are needed to better understand the role of different spinal INs populations in functional recovery after SCI and to develop potential interventions to target these populations.  This project will develop tools to isolate and culture ventral spinal neuron populations.  We will develop an in vitro platform that will allow us to study connectivity between INs, motoneurons (MNs), and cortical neurons in a model system and to define cues that promote functional connectivity of these networks.  Finally, we will examine the contributions of transplanted spinal MN and IN populations to functional recovery in a rat model of spinal cord injury."
"9349907","The population over 65 will increase to ~87 million by 2050. [Age alone is the greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of neurodegeneration such as Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or depression.] With no prevention or treatment, aged-related neurodegeneration could reach 11-16 million by 2050. In 2035, today's Veterans will be middle-aged, with health issues like those seen in aging Vietnam Veterans, complicated by comorbidities of posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and polytrauma. During neurodegeneration, the brain demonstrates region- specific alterations in neuronal morphology, reduced structural plasticity and dendritic branching, and a decreased capacity to regenerate. Brain function is underpinned by both electrical activity and chemical communication between neurons; this communication between cells is necessary for re-establishing normal brain function in the AD brain. In addition to genetic modulation that initiate neuronal growth, other interventions such as 1) selective serotonin and dopamine reuptake inhibition (SDRI) to promote cAMP, or 2) [neurotrophin receptor agonism] may promote structural and functional plasticity and improve behavior in individuals afflicted with AD. Proper neuronal growth and guidance is dependent upon communication from extracellular signals (i.e., spatial information) through the plasma membrane. A key plasmalemmal `hub' that transduces the extracellular cues to the underlying cytoskeletal machinery are membrane/lipid rafts (MLR), discrete microdomains enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, and scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Neuronal polarization and motility is dependent upon MLR localized in its leading edge. We have previously demonstrated that neuron-targeted Cav-1 over-expression (achieved by linking it to a neuron-specific synapsin promoter [SynCav1]): 1) enhances membrane cholesterol, MLR formation, and synaptic receptor expression and signaling (TrkB); 2) increases serotonin receptor (5-HT6) and dopamine receptor-mediated (D1R) cAMP formation; 3) promotes dendritic sprouting and arborization even in the presence of growth inhibitors. A recent seminal publication from our group demonstrates that direct delivery of SynCav1 into the brain augments structural and functional hippocampal neuroplasticity in adult mice (6 mo) and aged mice (20 mo) and improves hippocampal-dependent contextual fear learning and memory in both adult and aged mice. These results provide proof-of-concept evidence that by increasing expression of Cav-1 specifically in neurons, one can improve structural and functional neuroplasticity with positive behavioral outcome. This application seeks to determine whether SynCav1 can induce similar neuroplastic changes in differentiated human neuronal stem cells (NSCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then to use SynCav1 in combination with SSRIs, SDRIs, or TrkB agonism to significantly augment the rate of behavioral improvement in AD mice. Our study will utilize a novel in vitro model of adult human differentiated neuronal stem cells (NSCs) derived form induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) combined with quantum dot axonal transport time- lapse imaging to assess neuronal function, and in vivo genetic interventions, pharmacological, and exercise therapeutic techniques, electrophysiology, confocal and scanning electron microscopy, and motor and cognitive batteries. Completion of the proposed experiments could lead to the justification of using novel therapeutic interventions (small molecules, peptides, gene manipulation) that target Cav-1 and MLR for the purpose of combating AD-associated neurodegeneration or nerve trauma in the Veteran population."
"9242691","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently used X-ray imaging contrast agents are primarily iodinated small molecules. These iodinated small molecule agents are used in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease, among other conditions. However, they frequently cause a condition known as contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with poor kidney function. This condition results in higher morbidity, mortality and costs. More than 10% of American adults have poor kidney function, and that proportion is rapidly increasing, due to the rise in prevalence of diabetes, a complication of which is reduced kidney function. In addition, the risk of cardiovascular disease for diabetics is trebled and it is predicted that 30% of the US population will be diabetic by 2050. Therefore there is an increasing number of patients who will suffer from cardiovascular disease, will need to receive current agents for diagnosis and treatment, but will suffer increased morbidity and mortality as a result. Gold nanoparticles are biocompatible, more strongly attenuating, long-circulating alternatives to iodinated agents. However, these nanoparticles suffer from poor excretion and are expensive. To address these issues, we propose to develop novel, small (<5 nm) metal nanoparticles that can be easily excreted, made from lanthanum, tantalum and gold. We have found that combining several elements further increases contrast in CT, compared with gold alone, as the k-edges of the elements are spread over the diagnostic X-ray spectrum. As lanthanum and tantalum are more than tenfold cheaper than gold, this reduces the cost of the agent. In addition, the risk of toxiciy is decreased as the dose of the nanoparticles formed from each element is lowered by a factor of three. We will then encapsulate these small nanoparticles into hydrophilic polyphosphazene nanospheres to create polymetal nanoparticles. These nanospheres are a novel contrast agent delivery platform, are biodegradable and coated with polyethylene glycol to promote long circulation. These larger nanostructures are designed to break down into harmless byproducts and release the small nanoparticles for swift excretion when applied in vivo. We hypothesize that nanoparticles, having a much lower surface to volume to ratio than small molecules, will prove less toxic than iodinated small molecules. Furthermore, encapsulation in a slow-releasing polymer matrix should result in a low dose of agent reaching the kidneys at any time, additionally reducing the potential for toxicity. Both smaller and larger nanoparticles will be characterized, tested for biocompatibility in vitro and selected formulations will be probed for their excretion and effectiveness as contrast agents in blood vessel imaging with CT. We will use a model of kidney disease and compare the novel agents to clinically approved agents. Thorough toxicological assessments will be performed, with the goal of identifying highly biocompatible agents to be moved towards the clinic."
"9322885","Project 3 Abstract Expanded genotyping and next generation sequencing in ever-larger disease cohorts has been remarkably successful in identifying novel loci, genes and alleles that drive pathology and/or confer susceptibility. However, these efforts have encountered three major obstacles. First, association studies with some notable examples have been hampered by the difficulty in transitioning efficiently from mapping loci to identifying contributory genes and alleles. Second, ultra-rare or private Mendelian mutations have been challenging to identify in sufficient numbers to link them robustly to phenotype. Third, an overwhelming majority of variation identified in the genetically heterogeneous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) disorders are non- synonymous changes for which allele pathogenicity is difficult to infer using genetic arguments alone. One reason for these impediments is the presence of the large amount of rare variation that exists in human populations and the current bioinformatic tools remain limited in predicting with accuracy which fraction of this variation is functional and phenotypically relevant, Together with our colleagues in Projects 1 and 2, we have intersected genetic, genomic and functional tools to overcome some of these challenges and have begun to inform the genetic architecture of disorders of reproductive development. Our past synergistic efforts led to the identification of RNF216 and OTUD4 as the first genes mutated in isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IGD) in individuals with Gordon-Holmes syndrome establishing a ?module? of dysfunction, namely the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in this disorder. Complementary to this work, systematic in vivo functional assessment of an allelic series in CHD7 allowed us to isolate the non-Mendelian contribution of this locus to reproductive disorders of the GnRH axis under a mutational burden hypothesis that was otherwise refractory to classical statistical tools. In the next phase of these investigations, Project 3 will expand its role as a bridge between the ongoing and successful Mendelian gene discovery efforts (Project 1) and the state-of-the-art complex trait association approaches (Project 2). Project 3 will assess the pathogenicity of novel candidate genes and loci from Projects 2 and 3 respectively. It will also annotate non-synonymous coding variants discovered as part of this process in IGD patients and large populations as a means of determining the mutational burden in affected individuals. We will also utilize the in vivo models we generate to model oligogenic phenomena observed in patient cohorts. In parallel, Project 3 will isolate pure cellular populations relevant to GnRH biology from zebrafish models to generate transcriptional networks that will inform the studies of the overall Center."
"9246473","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanical ventilation (MV) is used clinically to sustain pulmonary gas exchange in patients that are incapable of maintaining adequate alveolar ventilation. Although MV is often a life- saving intervention, prolonged MV gives rise to problems in weaning patients from the ventilator. Although several factors can contribute to difficult weaning, weak inspiratory muscles (i.e., diaphragm) are a major factor. In this regard, MV results in diaphragmatic inactivity which promotes the rapid development of diaphragmatic atrophy and contractile dysfunction which is known as ventilator- induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD). At present, the mechanism(s) responsible for VIDD are poorly understood and thus, no clinical therapy exists. We recently discovered that endurance exercise training results in diaphragmatic adaptations and a diaphragm phenotype that is protected against VIDD. The cellular mechanism(s) responsible for this exercise-induced protection against VIDD remain unknown and are the focus of this application. HYPOTHESIS: Guided by our preliminary experiments, we will test the hypothesis that exercise- induced protection of the diaphragm against VIDD is dependent on increased diaphragmatic levels of: 1) mitochondrial antioxidants (i.e., manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and glutathione) and/or 2) heat shock protein 72 (HSP72). APPROACH: Our hypothesis will be tested using an established animal model of MV. Cause and effect will be determined using innovative molecular and pharmacological tools to manipulate SOD2, GSH, and HSP72 within the diaphragm. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) To determine if exercise-induced protection against VIDD requires increased levels of SOD2 and/or glutathione within mitochondria of diaphragm muscle fibers; and 2) To establish if overexpression of HSP72 in the diaphragm is necessary and sufficient for exercise-induced protection against VIDD. SIGNIFICANCE: Determining the mechanism(s) responsible for exercise-induced protection of the diaphragm will identify novel molecular targets that can be manipulated pharmacologically, leading to new approaches to prevent VIDD and reduce problems in weaning patients from MV. 1"
"9326511","ABSTRACT: Over two-thirds of children and nearly all adults worldwide are affected by oral biofilm diseases, such as dental caries (i.e. tooth decay), resulting in billions of dollars of healthcare costs annually. The main microbial pathogen associated with this disease, Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), forms biofilms (i.e. dental plaque) containing an exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix and acidic microenvironments capable of dissolving enamel at the tooth surface. Current treatments exhibit a technological gap because they are poorly retained within EPS due to salivary clearance. To overcome this gap, the long-term goal of this research is to develop anti-biofilm drug delivery approaches. Specifically, these approaches will be capable of enhanced drug retention within oral biofilms and pH-responsive drug release within acidic microenvironments where enamel dissolution and cavity development occur. Prior collaborative work between the Sponsor?s and Co-sponsor?s labs has created polymer nanoparticle carriers (NPCs) that enhance the anti-biofilm effects of farnesol in vitro and in vivo. However, the current approach has limitations: 1) the pKa value of the existing NPC (? 6) is poorly aligned with biofilm pH values (? 5.5), so drug release begins at pH ~6, which may lead to premature release due to common oral pH variability; 2) the NPC exhibits modest control over pH-responsive drug release kinetics in pathogenic, acidic microenvironments (pH ? 5.5) versus normal oral pH (~7.2); and 3) NPC anti-biofilm efficacy has only been shown using farnesol although multiple drugs, including myricetin and apigenin, synergistically disrupt biofilms when combined with farnesol. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that modifying the NPC polymer composition and establishing the NPC capability to simultaneously load multiple synergistic drugs will improve anti-biofilm effectiveness in vitro and in vivo. Two aims will be developed. Aim 1 is to modify NPC polymer composition to control the pH at which drug release occurs to improve biofilm disruption in vitro and in vivo. For Aim 1, we will modify the NPC polymer composition using different monomers with pKa values more closely aligned with oral biofilm pH values (pH ?5.5) and incorporate an acid-degradable crosslinker to create a physical barrier for drug release at neutral pH. Anti-biofilm effectiveness of NPCs with the greatest pH-responsive characteristics will be tested using established in vitro and in vivo oral biofilm models. Aim 2 is to establish NPC capability to load and release multiple synergistic anti-biofilm drugs and that co-loading NPCs improves biofilm disruption in vitro and in vivo. For Aim 2, we will investigate molecular interactions indicative of loading and release between known anti- biofilm drugs (e.g. myricetin, apigenin, and farnesol) and the existing NPC to characterize which drug classes load and release successfully. The anti-biofilm efficacy of successfully co-loaded drugs will be investigated using in vitro and in vivo models. This work is significant because it will move this approach closer to a promising, clinically relevant therapeutic platform to prevent dental caries and other oral diseases."

"9238782","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular O2 sensing is an important biological process in health and disease. The ability to detect and respond to hypoxia is required for embryonic development, for transition from placental to lung respiration at birth, and for systemic oxygen homeostasis throughout life. In previous funding cycles we discovered that mitochondria regulate the signaling of hypoxia to the cell through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from complex III, which then activate cellular protective and adaptive responses. We also developed genetic tools for assessing subcellular redox signaling and for modifying ROS generation from complex III. Inhibition of hypoxia-induced mitochondrial ROS signals by genetic deletion of the Risked Iron-Sulfur Protein (RISP) or expression of an H2O2 scavenger in the mitochondrial intermembrane space abrogated hypoxia responses in diverse cell types. Unexpectedly, deletion of RISP in the adult mouse heart induced profound remodeling characterized by a ~2.5-fold increase in heart weight and thickening of the ventricular walls, with no evidence of cellular hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte diameter, cell morphology, and mitochondrial ultrastructure were unchanged, while immunostaining for markers of cellular proliferation (Ki67) revealed profuse distributions of labeled cells, consistent with the generatio of new cardiomyocytes. Gene array analysis during remodeling identified activation of pathways involving cytoskeletal reorganization but no signature characteristic of cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesize that ROS signals are generated by cardiac mitochondria in response to the decrease in myocardial PO2 that occurs as the neonatal heart transitions from a fetal glycolytic program into the adult oxidative phenotype. We postulate that these ROS signals trigger the cell cycle arrest that develops by postnatal day 7. Deletion of RISP, which is required for hypoxia-induced ROS signaling, abrogates the ROS signaling and permits adult cardiomyocytes to re-enter the cell cycle. We will test these hypotheses using genetic models to manipulate mitochondrial ROS generation and signaling, identify early genes involved in the activation of this response, and determine the cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of proliferative arrest by heart mitochondria. Finally, we will test whether reactivation of proliferation in hearts damaged by ischemia-reperfusion can be induced by modulating complex III function, allowing rescue of function through the generation of new cardiomyocytes. The results of these studies could provide a major advance in our understanding of how cell proliferation in the heart is controlled, and carry profound potential clinical significance in terms of the treatment of ischemi injury in the heart."
"9285399","Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is prevalent in over 70% of the obese and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and is a leading cause of liver transplantation. Hepatic insulin resistance and inflammation mirror alterations in mitochondrial oxidative flux (beta-oxidation, tri-carboxylic acid [TCA] cycle and mitochondrial respiration), in rodent models and humans with simple steatosis. This proposal will identify new mechanisms leading to dysfunctional mitochondrial oxidative flux and development of NASH. The proposal will test the hypothesis that the severity of hepatocyte inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation will be proportional to the rates of mitochondrial oxidative flux. Thus, attenuation of oxidative flux will provide a promising strategy to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress in NASH and T2DM. Aim 1 will test whether altered mitochondrial oxidative flux during the transition from simple steatosis to NASH parallel an increase in ROS production, inflammation and oxidative stress. This will be tested in a mouse model fed high fructose, high trans-fat diet which gradually transitions from simple steatosis to NASH, closely resembling human disease. Aim 2 will investigate a novel mechanism by which chronic elevation of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) during hepatic insulin resistance will disrupt mitochondrial oxidative flux and sustain lipogenesis. Aim 3 will utilize a novel mouse model with a clinically relevant polymorphism in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (mt-Nd2A) allele. This unique animal model will help identify whether the upregulated antioxidant defense resulting from the beneficial effects of the mt-Nd2A allele will attenuate mitochondrial oxidative dysfunction in NASH. State-of-the-art metabolic profiling techniques in nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry will be combined with measures of ROS production and oxidative stress in liver. Direct measurements of oxidative flux through the TCA cycle relative to ATP turnover in the liver will result in a novel index of mitochondrial coupling efficiency, which will have high translational value for human studies. In conclusion, identifying key mechanisms to attenuate mitochondrial oxidative flux will provide a better paradigm to treat NASH and decrease unregulated gluconeogenesis in T2DM."

"9234418","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prognosis for patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is very poor, with a mean survival time of only 35.2 months. IPF now affects more than 100,000 US residents and is characterized by thickening of the pulmonary blood-gas barrier and impaired gas exchange. Unfortunately, even as efforts to develop therapies for IPF accelerate, most clinical trials are stymied by the inability to adequately characterize the disease, its progression, and its therapeutic response. Existing biomarkers are either too insensitive or too invasive for repeat use. We intend to address this problem by introducing a comprehensive MRI-based 3D imaging approach to not only identify regional disease, but to predict and observe regional therapeutic response. Our long-term goal is to broadly deploy non-invasive, high-resolution, quantitative MR imaging of all aspects of cardiopulmonary function to change the way IPF is managed. Our approach exploits the converging progress in 1H MR imaging of structure and perfusion, with hyperpolarized 129Xe MR imaging of ventilation and gas exchange. The objective of this study is to integrate and optimize these structural and functional MRI approaches and use them to identify regional diffusion limitation, and predict and observe therapeutic response 4 times earlier than standard methods can. Our central hypothesis is that combined imaging of structure, ventilation, perfusion and gas exchange, will provide the means to identify the leading edge of disease, where recovery of lung function remains possible. The rationale for the proposed research is that therapeutic response is difficult if not impossible to detect using global metrics and thus, 3 non-invasive imaging is needed to visualize recoverable areas. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to that part of the NIH Mission that pertains to improving health by developing and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies. Guided by strong preliminary data, our approach is based on three Specific Aims: 1) Establish a comprehensive, quantitative structure/function MRI Protocol for IPF at two centers, 2) Identify regional early- stage disease by combining Gd perfusion and 129Xe exchange MRI, and 3) Use structure/function MRI to monitor progression and response to therapy in IPF. Completion of these aims will 1) set up 2-leading centers with an optimized protocol for imaging IPF, 2) establish the ability to visualize regions of diffusion impairment that can still respond to therapy, 3) observe therapeutic response within 3 months instead of 1 year, and 4) predict outcomes at 12 months post therapy as seen by conventional tests. The proposed approach is innovative because it uses a comprehensive protocol to measure what cannot be measured by any one technique in isolation, and exploits the expertise of 2 centers to accelerate development and expand the recruitment pool for this rare disease. The proposed research is significant because it has the potential to develop the key noninvasive functional imaging biomarkers that can enable IPF trials to be conducted faster, with fewer patients, at lower cost and with greater likelihood for success."
"9247853","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human neuroanatomy is enormously variable across subjects - a factor that limits the power of brain studies to detect effects of interest. While degeneration in subcortical structures and cortical gray matter is manifest in many conditions such as aging, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, large studies are needed in order to find robust and stable effects that separate groups. Furthermore drug development becomes highly costly as detecting small reductions in atrophy can take years and hundreds or thousands of subjects. These factors raise the importance of longitudinal studies, in which one acquires data at multiple time points and examines the differences in temporal trajectories. Compared to a cross-sectional approach, the longitudinal design can provide more sensitivity and specificity for examining subtle associations by reducing the confounding effect of between-subject variability. Moreover, a serial assessment can be the only way to unambiguously characterize the effect of interest in a randomized experiment, such as a drug trial. Finally, longitudinal studies provide unique insights into the temporal dynamics of the underlying biological process, such as disease progression. Taking full advantage of a longitudinal design requires the optimization of the computational tools that perform image processing and hypothesis testing. In this project, we propose to design, develop and distribute intrinsically longitudinal image processing and hypothesis testing tools and validate them in the study of a set of neurodegenerative diseases."
"9248376","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to understand the function of a small photoreceptor disc protein called PRCD. Progressive rod-cone degeneration (prcd) is an autosomal recessive retinal disease first discovered in dog and caused by a single point mutation in the PRCD gene. Mutations in the PRCD gene have been identified in human patients diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, including the exact mutation that causes disease in dogs. Our laboratory discovered that PRCD is uniquely localized to the light-sensitive outer segment compartment of photoreceptor cells. My preliminary data indicate that PRCD is a binding partner of rhodopsin, and that photoreceptors degenerate in the absence of PRCD in a similar manner to that seen in dogs containing a mutation in the protein. The first aim of this proposal is to complete the characterization of the PRCD- rhodopsin interaction, and to identify additional binding partners. The second aim is a complete functional analysis of the PRCD knockout mouse. These specific aims test the hypothesis that PRCD is essential for rhodopsin signaling in addition to elucidating any other functions or pathways PRCD may be involved in in photoreceptors. The importance of this work is emphasized by the fact that mutations in the protein cause blindness in both human and veterinary patients."

For so many lines of research, disease modeling and experimental therapeutics have been revolutionized by the development of imaging systems that allow for the tracking of cells in vivo in living animals over time. This approach has been used extensively at VAPAHCS for the past 10 years for the analysis of such processes as non-invasive disease monitoring, stem cell therapies, cell transplantation, tumor growth, in vivo gene expression analysis, immune cell tracking, and neurogenesis, and remains a critical element of our research program.  The Perkin/Elmer IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System is a top-level research instrument that combines cutting edge technology with quality and exceptional ease of operation. This instrument will replace an outdated version that is almost ten years old and failing regularly despite routine maintenance. Furthermore, the new system features includes a camera of enhanced sensitivity providing increased spatial resolution and software that provides more powerful image processing and analysis for the key functionalities of Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI), Fluorescent Light Imaging (FLI), Cherenkov light, 3D tomography, and Spectral Unmixing. The current, outdated equipment is used up to 10 hours a day, including weekends, by investigators at VAPAHCS. The ability to replace our outdated and failing system with a new and updated system would greatly facilitate and accelerate the research program at VAPAHCS. We have outlined an administrative process to oversee the use and maintenance of the new equipment, and we outline a plan for institutional support to provide the resources for equipment service over the next ten years.

"9260041","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Echocardiographic techniques for the assessment of cardiac function have been limited by an inability to consistently measure intracardiac pressures noninvasively. If we can establish that insonation of contrast microbubbles and analysis of their subharmonic oscillations can accurately and continuously measure intracardiac pressures, many of the physical limitations of echocardiography would be overcome. Our group has demonstrated that the nonlinearly generated, subharmonic signal components from microbubble- based ultrasound contrast agents can provide an excellent indication of the hydrostatic pressure variation (from 0 to 200 mmHg). Based on these results, a quantitative technique called SubHarmonic-Aided Pressure Estimation (SHAPE) was proposed and investigated. SHAPE estimates internal pressure variations by transmitting at one frequency, but measuring signal response only at the subharmonic frequency. This technique has the potential to noninvasively measure changes in pressure and has been validated in animals. Our ongoing feasibility study provides proof-of-concept for SHAPE in humans. The fundamental hypothesis of this project is that intracardiac pressure changes in patients scheduled for a left and/or right heart catheterization can be measured using SHAPE in real-time and that results will compare favorably with catheter based pressure measurements. Thus, essential information regarding the functional integrity of the cardiovascular system can be provided noninvasively in real-time, which will fundamentally alter the clinical management of such patients. Initially, the SHAPE algorithm incorporating optimum incident acoustic pressure selection and processing of the subharmonic signals will be implemented on a state-of-the-art ultrasound scanner (SonixTablet, Analogic Corporation, Peabody, MA) for real-time SHAPE pressure measurements, which will be verified in vitro (Specific Aim 1). Next, we will study cardiac pressure changes in patients scheduled for a left and/or right heart catheterization using SHAPE and correlate results to catheter based pressure measurements and establish if the errors in pressure measurements using SHAPE are within 5 mmHg of the catheter-based pressure data (Specific Aim 2). Finally for a set of patients referred for clinically indicated left heart catheterization, we will compare the ventricular relaxation rate (peak isovolumic -dP/dt) and relaxation time constant (tau or ?) in addition to the clinically important ventricular systolic ad diastolic pressures obtained using SHAPE and high fidelity micromanometer-tipped catheters (Mikro-Cath, Millar, Inc. Houston, TX) (Specific Aim 3). In conclusion, this study aims to provide an improved and clinically useful, real-time implementation of the innovative SHAPE algorithm on a state-of- the-art, commercial ultrasound scanner and to challenge the clinical paradigm of invasively-determined, pressure measurements in patients scheduled for cardiac catheterization by noninvasively evaluating intracardiac pressures in humans."
"9302070","Abstract Lung cancer screening is a recent recommendation and new screening programs are currently being implemented. However, we do not yet know what factors influence screening-eligible smokers to screen. Smokers are a unique population and psychological variables (stigma, medical mistrust, cancer fatalism, worry, and fear) may be important and have very different relationships in lung cancer screening participation than participation in other types of cancer screening. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to develop an explanatory framework for lung cancer screening participation from the perspective of the individual to inform future patient-level tailored interventions through testing a model of factors related to screening. Specific aims include: 1) test the relationships among variables depicted in the conceptual model for lung cancer screening participation using structural equation modeling including mediation effects in a sample of screening-eligible long-term current and former smokers; 2) provide robust descriptions of factors that influence lung cancer screening and elucidate the relationships among the factors based on in-depth narratives of screening-eligible smokers; and 3) integrate findings drawn from both survey and narrative data to inform patient-level tailored intervention development. Study design: Sequential explanatory mixed methods design using survey methods and individual interviews. Measures: Quantitative self-reported data will be collected via a web-based survey comprised of the following elements: Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Smoking Subscale, Patient Trust in the Medical Profession Scale, Revised Powe Fatalism Scale, Lung Cancer Worry Scale, Lung Cancer Fear Scale, Demographic and Health Status Characteristics Questionnaire (including healthcare provider recommendation, media exposure, and lung cancer screening participation), Knowledge: Lung Cancer and Lung Cancer Screening Scale, Social Influence Scale, and Lung Cancer Screening Health Beliefs Scales. Qualitative data will be collected via audio- taped individual in-depth interviews. Data analysis: Quantitative data will be analyzed using bivariate analyses between variables in the conceptual model including t-tests, analysis of variance, linear regression, and logistic regression. The entire conceptual model will then be analyzed using path analysis via structural equation modeling. Content analysis and a series of data display tables will be used to analyze data from the in-depth interviews. The integration of qualitative and quantatitive will occur at two time points: (1) quantitative data will be used to develop individual participant profiles in order to selectively sample participants and design interview guides for the in-depth interviews; and (2) the quantitative and qualitative findings will be integrated at the stage of data interpretation. By augmenting quantitative findings with qualitative data, we will generate new knowledge to inform future tailored interventions."
"9290440","ABSTRACT Stroke is among the understudied disorders despite its high burden to morbidity and mortality in the US. Ischemic stroke, which is due to cerebral vessel occlusion, accounts for 80% of cases. Ischemic stroke is a complex, multi-factorial disease, with heterogeneity by age, sex, and stroke subtype. A substantial proportion of stroke risk remains unexplained. The relatively low yield of stroke genetic studies to date may reflect the heterogeneous causes and clinical presentations of the various subtypes. Many of the studies participating in stroke GWAS have included have had little or no data available on stroke-specific risk factors or other CVD outcomes, which are key to understanding causal mechanisms and potential gene?environment interactions. Next generation sequencing (NGS) and multi-omics integrative biology research offer new opportunities in the way we research and understand stroke. Whole genome sequence (WGS) data, including both coding and functional non-coding variants, are required to identify the full spectrum of contributions of uncommon variants to stroke risk. Deep WGS data are currently being generated in over 11,000 WHI participants through the NHLBI TOPMed project, including over 4,000 ischemic stroke cases. Here we propose to apply innovative statistical approaches to perform a well-powered analysis to discover, replicate, and functionally characterize new loci (particularly rare or low frequency coding and non-coding regulatory variants) for ischemic stroke (and its subtypes) using WGS and imputation. Discovery will be performed in ~4,000 incident ischemic stroke cases and over 5,000 controls from WHI with WGS through TOPMed. Single variant and gene-based tests will be performed, prioritizing ~100 genomic regions based on prior GWAS and current epigenomic and proteomic analyses. Replication will be performed through state-of-the art WGS-based exome and GWAS imputation in up to ~77,000 additional ischemic stroke cases (and controls) obtained through UKBiobank, Million Veteran Program, and the SiGN and METASTROKE stroke genomics consortia. To assess the biologic mechanism of stroke-associated genetic loci, we will further test any newly identified stroke loci for association with: (1) a rich set of CVD risk factors and ~40 plasma biomarkers related to atherosclerosis, thrombosis, inflammation, and hormones available in WHI; (2) a new, commercial panel of 184 emerging biomarkers related to neurovascular disease and CVD in 2000 WHI TOPMed samples selected on the basis of genotype. Using casual inference methodology, we will perform mediation analyses to determine mechanistic relationships between genotype, intermediate biomarker phenotype, and stroke outcome."

"9347537","PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer screening using mammograms and other imaging techniques are the first line of defense against the disease as a means to detect pre-cancerous lesions. The diagnostic power of advanced imaging techniques could benefit tremendously from improved contrast agents that rapidly and selectively accumulate in the tumor lesions and provide high tumor-to-normal tissue ratios, as well as minimizing exposure of patients to radiation by lowering injected activity of the reagents. We propose to develop novel contrast agents for use in breast cancer imaging that can enhance image resolution by selectively targeting and delivering imaging probes directly into tumor lesions with little or no accumulation in the surrounding normal tissue. We have developed an antibody-based delivery platform that exploits a caveloae-mediated transvascular transport pathway to target and rapidly deliver cargo across the restrictive vascular endothelium directly into tumor lesions following intravenous injection. We propose to conjugate 99mTc via a chelating moiety to the targeting antibody (mAnnA1) and to test the resulting imaging probe in rodent models that will include induced metastatic and spontaneous breast tumors. We will optimize the imaging protocol by studying biodistribution of the reagent and determine key parameters in order to characterize selectivity and targeting specificity of the novel reagent."
"9233080","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Applications of ceramics in dentistry are steadily expanding due to outstanding progress in the development and control of materials microstructures, chemistry and processing techniques. Meanwhile, the use of ceramic parts in orthopedic joint replacement procedures remains widespread. Ceramic surfaces are attractive for joint replacement because of low wear rates but they are inherently brittle. As a consequence, even if success rates are generally high, in vivo failures do occur, both in orthopedics and in dentistry. There is a need for reliable, high strength bioceramics with low abrasiveness for use in both orthopedics and dentistry. Our goal is to develop ultrafine-grained zirconia/spinel ceramics with synergistic phase combination leading to high grain boundary stability, high reliability and fracture toughness. This project presents a major technological innovation that relies on 1) the combination of synergistic microstructural and thermal properties between zirconia (3Y-TZP) and ultrafine-grained nanospinel (MgAl2O4) in dual phase bioceramics and 2) the creation of a controlled ultrafine-grained surface inhibiting hydrolytic degradation and reducing abrasiveness. These dual-phase materials will advance the field of bioceramics by ensuring longer life performance in orthopedic and dental applications. In specific Aim 1, zirconia-spinel ceramics (3Y- TZP/nS) will be synthesized and characterized. In specific Aim 2, conditions for grain size refinement will be established and resistance to low temperature degradation (LTD), wear characteristics and mechanical properties of ultrafine-grained 3Y-TZP and 3Y- TZP/nS ceramics will be measured. Expected outcomes of the proposed work are the development and production of novel bioceramics with high strength, high reliability, low abrasiveness while offering excellent esthetics when needed, from the presence of the nanospinel phase. The projected significant reduction in abrasiveness of current zirconia ceramics and novel zirconia-nanospinel bioceramics by developing an innovative grain refinement process constitutes another important translational outcome. The impact of the proposed work will originate from the development of new materials and technology and may extend well beyond orthopedic and dental fields if, as we anticipate, these novel bioceramics exhibit superplasticity, which would greatly facilitate processing at high temperature."
"9230807","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This project will test the effect of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, to mitigate radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis in veterans undergoing radiation therapy for lung cancer. It is based on the hypothesis that human normal tissue radiation injury can be safely and effectively mitigated, and on our extensive studies of radiomitigation in experimental animals. Lung cancer is more common in veterans than in the general population; this project is highly relevant to the medical care of veterans.  The specific aims are:  1. To test the benefit of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitor, to mitigate radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis in humans.   a. Enalapril or placebo will commence right after the start of irradiation in patients undergoing radiation   therapy for lung cancer, and their effects on radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis will be compared.   Enalapril will be used rather than captopril, because enalapril is given in single daily doses.  2. To test the mechanism of mitigation of radiation lung injury by enalapril.   a. Angiotensinogen, plasma renin activity, and angiotensin II will be measured as renin-angiotensin system markers in all subjects.   b. The effect of enalapril on each marker will be assessed, as compared to placebo.  3. To confirm that enalapril in this use does not adversely affect cancer treatment outcomes.   a. Cancer recurrence and death from cancer will be compared for the enalapril and placebo groups.  These studies will be done in men and women undergoing radiation therapy for lung cancer. Enalapril, or identical-appearing placebo, will be started at the beginning of the radiation treatments. The effect of the enalapril or placebo will be tested by their effect on grade 2 or greater clinical radiation pneumonitis, by their effect on the renin-angiotensin system markers angiotensinogen, plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, and their effect on radiographic evidence of pneumonitis and fibrosis.  The broad, long-term objective of our work is to achieve effective and safe mitigation o normal tissue radiation injuries for any tissue type. We and others have successfully mitigated normal tissue radiation injury (NTRI) of kidneys, lungs, skin, and brain, using laboratory rat models. The success of these human studies will have a high impact for subjects at risk of NTRI to the lungs. This will improve the health of veterans with lung cancer, which is highly relevant t the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs. That success will be a significant impetus to extend the radiomitigation concept to other normal tissues at risk during radiation therapy, such as spinal cord or brain."
"9242708","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concept of a transition from acute to chronic pain that recognizes the difficulty to reverse plasticity in pain mechanisms, has provided the impetus for the development of preclinical models to evaluate neuroplasticity in elements of pain circuits, including in the primary afferent nociceptor. We propose to test the hypothesis that neuroplastic changes in a model of the transition from acute to chronic pain, hyperalgesic priming, involves translation of new protein from dormant mRNA in the peripheral terminal of the nociceptor. Importantly, in preliminary studies we have found that translation inhibitors are able to reverse the neuroplastic changes underlying hyperalgesic priming. To investigate this mechanism, we will evaluate whether cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB), a regulator of protein translation in axons that has been implicated in neuroplasticity, orchestrates the effects of protein kinase C? (PKC?) on a downstream protein, calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII), and the ryanodine receptor activation of which releases Ca2+ which can activate CaMKII, which has been implicated in neuroplasticity in high threshold Aplysia sensory neurons. Importantly the proposed experiments will distinguish between the peripheral protein translation dependent neuroplastic changes, and how it might be reversed. Finally, we also propose to investigate the hypothesis that a cAMP-dependent autocrine mechanism of hyperalgesia is upstream of PKC? in the expression of the prolongation of hyperalgesia characteristic of the primed nociceptor, and also identify the second messengers that are downstream of PKC?. The results of these studies could guide the rational design of entirely new classes of therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes, and the signaling pathways downstream of PKC? that mediate the prolonged hyperalgesia."
"9259734","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uncharacterized locus C15orf65, which we previously identified as part of a translocation in Hodgkins lymphoma, encodes a small, highly conserved, 15kDa protein of completely unknown function. We generated a monoclonal antibody against the C terminus of C15orf65 and demonstrated that the protein is expressed in a cell-cycle-dependent fashion, with levels peaking in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. Overexpression of the C15orf65 protein resulted in increased cell cycling, whereas knockdown decreased cell cycling and ablated the ability of myeloid cells to form tumors upon xenotransplantation. In myeloid and kidney cell lines, C15orf65 localized to the nucleus and to the chromatin fraction in particular, raising the consideration that it may participate in a histon-binding complex. However, its mechanism of action remains unexplored. Analysis of public microarray datasets showed C15orf65 mRNA expression in many tissues, with particularly high expression in the breast, trabecular bone osteoblasts, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. C15orf65 mRNA levels are significantly upregulated in the PML-RAR? subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the RARS subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), indicating a potential role in malignant as well as normal hematopoiesis. C15orf65 is highly conserved across the animal kingdom, especially within the vertebrate lineage, and has additional homologs outside of the animal kingdom. This degree of conservation indicates selective pressure for a conserved function, which we postulate is mediated by C15orf65's principal domain, DUF4490. The closest relative of DUF4490 for which both structure and function have been determined is the histone-binding Tudor domain of Sgf29. However, the structure and function of DUF4490 are as yet completely uncharacterized and thus represent a potentially informative target for structural determination. The combination of C15orf65's conservation and localization with a cell cycling phenotype and involvement in multiple hematopoietic malignancies suggests that C15orf65 may be a previously undescribed epigenetic regulator with a particular role in governing cell cycling in hematopoietic cells. We propose to 1) Identify binding partners for C15orf65 to characterize its pathway interactions; 2) Determine crystal and NMR structures for C15orf65; and 3) Delineate the functional role of C15orf65 in hematopoiesis using a newly generated conditional knockout model for the murine homolog of C15orf65, Gm5918. Our investigation of C15orf65 will provide insight into the biophysical, biochemical, and functional properties of this novel gene, and may also lead us to a new pathway for cell cycle regulation and identification of a novel histone binding domain."
"9457189","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposed experiments will identify mechanisms that cause mis-expression of DUX4 and lead to pathogenesis in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). FSHD is the most prevalent myopathy afflicting both children and adults, but no therapy is known. However, FSHD research has now entered an important new stage as DUX4 has emerged from studies in multiple laboratories, including our own, as the consensus FSHD candidate gene. Current evidence supports a model for FSHD pathology in which stable expression of a polyadenylated DUX4 mRNA splicing variant, termed DUX4-fl (fl = full-length), leads to production of a pathogenic DUX4-FL protein. This model is compatible with our finding, based on analysis of a large new library of myogenic cells and biopsies, that DUX4-fl mRNA and DUX4-FL protein are expressed at a much higher level and in a much higher fraction of myonuclei in FSHD than in healthy control muscle cells. Thus, in FSHD patients, clinically apparent muscle weakness may develop as DUX4-FL-induced pathological changes accumulate over time, whereas in healthy control muscles, the extremely low level of DUX4- FL is apparently insufficient to induce overt pathology. Although the FSHD-associated genetic lesion does not obviously alter protein coding or mRNA sequences, there is strong evidence that aberrant epigenetic regulation underlies DUX4 mis-expression. Our preliminary studies, for example, showed that DUX4-fl expression levels in FSHD myogenic cells could indeed be altered by manipulations of epigenetic status, e.g., DNA methlyation. Based on these epigenetic studies and our complementary analyses of DUX4-FL expression, we propose and will test the hypothesis that epigenetic dysregulation leads to aberrantly increased expression of DUX4-fl in FSHD vs. unaffected myogenic cells and thus to pathology. In Specific Aim 1, we wil identify epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms that regulate DUX4-fl mRNA expression levels in skeletal muscle cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will analyze DUX4-FL expression in biopsies and also use single cell analyses to determine how DUX4-FL expression alters the fate of FSHD vs. unaffected cels. In Specific Aim 3, we will identify gene networks that are differentially regulate by the DUX4 protein isoforms and determine if they are disrupted in DUX4-fl-expressing FSHD cells. The results of our studies, in which we will systematically investigate the expression, regulation, and function of DUX4 isoforms in FSHD and control muscle cells, will provide the vital information needed to guide development of FSHD therapies specifically targeted to DUX4."
"9307461","Project Summary  Large randomized trials have found that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) and metformin are safe and effective treatment options for preventing diabetes among adults with prediabetes. However, these treatments are rarely used, and little existing research has focused on patient-centered approaches for promoting their use. A large body of evidence suggests that risk communication interventions are a promising method for motivating patients to adopt diverse preventive health behaviors. But this approach has not been definitively studied in the context of diabetes prevention. Therefore, the content, structure, and process for communicating diabetes risk to adults with prediabetes is not known. We plan to address this critical knowledge gap by developing and pilot testing the Diabetes Risk Education and Communication Trial (DiRECT) intervention among primary care patients with prediabetes. This novel intervention, delivered by medical assistants before patients? routinely scheduled office visits, consists of the following 3 components intended to promote initiation of ILI and metformin: 1) a prediabetes decision aid focused on diabetes risk and treatment options for preventing diabetes; 2) a ?think aloud? exercise; and 3) formulating a preliminary treatment plan. Previous studies report that medical assistants can improve uptake of some preventive health services in primary care, which may also be true for ILI and metformin. We will test this hypothesis by completing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop the DiRECT intervention using materials that our group has created and pilot tested in the target population. We will engage an Expert Advisory Panel of stakeholders in diabetes prevention, who will help develop the intervention so that can be widely disseminated if found to be effective. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of the DiRECT intervention on patients? perceived risk of developing diabetes and their intention to adopt treatment, in addition to other factors that may impact treatment decisions. Aim 3 is a pilot randomized trial of DiRECT vs. usual care in 80 primary care patients with prediabetes (40 in each arm). This pilot pragmatic trial will estimate the preliminary effects of DiRECT on the following 3-month outcomes: initiation of ILI and/or metformin (primary); adherence to these treatment(s); and weight loss. We will also examine the intervention?s acceptability, impact on clinical workflows, and costs. We hypothesize that the empirically developed DiRECT intervention will improve the accuracy of participants? risk perceptions and increase their initiation of treatments to prevent diabetes. This study will be conducted in a large community health center, in which 90% of patients with prediabetes are racial/ethnic minorities and 83% live in poverty. Our proposal is responsive to PAR-15-158 by: 1) including a low- income, diverse population; 2) using medical assistants, a workforce that is ubiquitous and therefore scalable to most primary care settings; and 3) leveraging an existing data infrastructure to pragmatically assess participants? eligibility and collect their clinical data."
"9307162","Project Summary/Abstract Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children and is a highly aggressive form of cancer. Children with high-risk disease suffer from a 3-year survival of only 20% despite very aggressive therapy with chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. Despite rigorous clinical trials, the survival of children suffering from high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma has not significantly changed over the last three decades. RMS can occur at locations throughout the body with nearly 40% of tumors occurring in the head and neck. Tumor location and fusion status are key prognostic factors. RMS histology resembles developing skeletal muscle and has been speculated to originate from genetically compromised skeletal muscle progenitors. However, the genes that control RMS development and specify location remain elusive. RMS also occurs in tissues devoid of skeletal muscle such as the urinary bladder, prostate, and biliary tree suggesting the possibility of origins outside of the skeletal muscle lineage. Currently, the cell of origin and the factors that specify RMS location and thus prognosis are unknown. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that determine the basis for developmental arrest in RMS and design novel, directed drug therapies for RMS. Previously, we reported a novel genetically engineered mouse model of fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) resulting from activation of a conditional, constitutively active Smoothened (SmoM2) allele by Cre recombinase expressed from the adipose protein 2 (aP2) promoter. In our model, 50% of the mice develop visible tumors by 28 days of life that are anatomically restricted to the neck. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of our mouse FN-RMS model is the suggestion that RMS originates outside of the muscle, as aP2-Cre is not expressed in skeletal muscle. The objective of this proposal is to leverage the early onset and anatomic restriction to the neck to identify the cell of origin and factors that specify RMS location. To accomplish this objective we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine developmental timing and location for oncogenesis in Shh- driven FN-RMS. 2) Identify the cell of origin of FN-RMS in aP2-Cre;SmoM2 mice. 3) Define regional specificity of FN-RMS. Using transplantation, we will determine whether the location specificity is driven cell autonomously on non-cell autonomously. We will isolate aP2-labeled, early developmental cells from normal mice and tumor mice to define how gene expression, epigenetic and chromatin accessibility differences between these populations contribute to the location and timing specificity. We will leverage our unique FN- RMS mouse model to identify the cell of origin and provide insights into the developmental events promoting FN-RMS formation. This work will help illuminate how the major developmental Shh pathway contributes to the specificity of cell types in the head and neck allowing for FN-RMS. Given the wide spectrum of RMS tumor locations and how location dictates prognosis we speculate that the varied cell of origin will further refine prognosis along with histology and further genetic characterization."

The focus of the Program is directed toward synthetic retinoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and phytochemicals. However, the scope of the program and depth of expertise have been expanded by strategic recruitment and a mentoring program. Furthermore, transdisciplinary research is nurtured through focused working groups. This program is co- directed by Dr. Craig A. Elmets (Professor and Chair, Department of Dermatology and Director of the UAB Skin Diseases Research Center) and Dr. Clinton J. Grubbs (Professor, Department of Surgery and Director of the Chemoprevention Center). Currently, the program is comprised of 18 members from 10 departments and 5 schools. This program has $4,187,741 in annual direct cost funding, of which 76% is derived from the NCI. In addition to the traditional utilization of inter-programmatic teams and intra-programmatic collaborations, the capabilities of the program are greatly expanded by established extramural agreements: (1) Dr. Grubbs directs Task Order from the NCI PREVENT program which awards contracts to investigators both at UAB and other institutions, and (2) Dr. Elmets participates in an NCI-funded consortium of early phase human chemoprevention trials led by the University of Wisconsin. Over the past four years, the program has produced 206 publications, of which 35% % were intra-programmatic, 28%% were inter-programmatic, and 34% were inter-institutional. A vibrant communications component that includes a seminar series with lecturers from inside and outside the University supports collaborative research among program investigators. Major completed studies at UAB have moved chemopreventive agents from various classes (including rexinoids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and dietary polyphenols) to clinical trials during the last few years."
"9326696","PROJECT SUMMARY Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor and has a median survival of only 12- 15 months with the standard-of-care therapies including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Under physiological conditions, the immune system is intended to remove irregular cancerous cells; however, tumors have evolved mechanisms to halt the immune response. Our laboratory previously identified myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as an immune suppressive cell population in GBM peripheral blood and the tumor microenvironment that correlates with decreased survival and immune response. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was determined to be a GBM-derived factor that promoted MDSC activation. I hypothesize that MIF induces and activates MDSCs through activation of the CD74 and CXCR2 receptors, driving the immune suppressive phenotype in GBM. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that MIF signaling is critical for the induction and activation of MDSCs by the use of an in vitro co-culture system I have adapted for the study of GBM-derived MDSCs. This system allows for the rapid production of MDSCs in biological replicates to study the role of MIF and its receptors in enhancing MDSC proliferation and MDSC function. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that MIF receptors are essential for GBM immune suppression in vivo by analyzing survival along with immune cell infiltration in the GBM microenvironment. These results will identify whether these receptors are a target for future immune therapies aimed at reducing the MDSC population to enhance the immune response. Based on previous studies that identified the MIF signaling axis as a moderator of MDSC activation within the GBM microenvironment and with the in vitro co-culture system and a MIF-secreting mouse model of glioma, I am in an optimal position to investigate the MIF signaling axis and how it affects MDSC induction, activation, and immune suppression."
"9349692","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in the U.S. Among CVDs, heart failure (HF) is a sig- nificant public health burden contributing not only to human suffering, but also to increasing healthcare expend- itures. CVDs arise in the setting of complex gene-environment interactions; the underlying genetics within an in- dividual influences how environmental and hormonal stimuli and stresses affect cardiac function and cause path- ology. The cardiomyocyte circadian clock is a genetically-programmed intrinsic cell-autonomous molecular mechanism that allows the heart to anticipate environmental stimuli and stresses and subsequently facilitates responses essential for maintaining cardiac function. Disruption of the circadian clock mechanism in mice and humans (e.g., through genetic polymorphisms or environmental alterations such as shift work, sleep disturbance, or eating behavior modulation) negatively impact cardiometabolic health. Furthermore, germline deletion of BMAL1, a core transcription factor component of the clock mechanism, yields an age onset dilated cardiomyo- pathy and reduced lifespan. We recently found that BMAL1 deletion specifically from cardiomyocytes (CBK mouse) recapitulates this pathologic phenotype, exposing an essential role for the clock in the heart. However, the mechanism by which cardiomyocyte circadian clock disruption leads to cardiomyopathy is unknown. Multiple endocrine system components are circadian. Evidence is emerging that cell autonomous cir- cadian clocks not only drive the temporal secretion of hormones, but also modulate time-of-day-dependent target tissue sensitivity to these hormones. In doing so, circadian clocks add a new layer to homeostasis; not only do the level of, and the sensitivity to, a stimulus play an important role, but also the timing. Circulating levels of the pituitary hormone, growth hormone (GH), exhibit notable circadian rhythm in humans. In contrast, nothing is known about rhythms in GH sensitivity. Chronic GH elevation yields cardiomegaly and HF. GH exerts many of its biological actions by inducing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1); a mouse model of cardiomyocyte-specific IGF-1 overexpression results in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our recent preliminary data suggest time-of-day- dependent oscillation of GH sensitivity in the heart, which depends on the cardiomyocyte circadian clock. More- over, CBK hearts exhibit greater GH sensitivity, with elevated cardiac IGF-1 gene expression, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and HF. Together, these observations lead us to hypothesize that the cardiomyocyte circa- dian clock modulates GH sensitivity, and that disruption of this mechanism confers local IGF-1-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and HF via augmented GH sensitivity. Accordingly, we will test the hypotheses that: Aim 1. Cardiomyocyte circadian clock modulation of GH sensitivity is essential for maintenance of cardiac function. We will determine whether: 1A. The cardiomyocyte circadian clock modulates sensitivity of the heart to GH in a time-of-day-dependent manner (physiology); 1B. Genetic disruption of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock imbalances the GH/IGF-1 signaling axis, thereby precipitating cardiomyopathy (pathology). Aim 2. Disruption of circadian behaviors/environmental parameters (e.g., fasting/feeding and light/dark cycles) augments cardiac GH/IGF-1 signaling, thereby predisposing to contractile dysfunction. We will determine whether: 2A. Manipulation of circadian behavior (e.g., fasting/feeding cycles) or environment (e.g., light/dark cycle) impact GH sensitivity and GH/IGF-1 signaling in the heart; 2B. Restoration of GH/IGF-1 signaling in the heart following environmental/behavioral manipulations attenuates susceptibility to contractile dysfunction. Our studies will identify mechanisms linking cardiomyocyte circadian clock dysfunction to augmented cardiac GH/IGF-1 signaling. As age-associated CBK cardiomyopathy has similarity with that seen in GH excess, our studies may foster the novel concept that both GH excess and enhanced GH sensitivity un- derlie cardiac dysfunction induced by common circadian perturbations (e.g., diet, light exposure, sleep), and provide sound rationale for future therapeutic strategies targeting the GH/IGF-1 signaling axis in HF."

Childhood IPV exposure is a well-established risk factor for anxiety and other mental health problems across the lifespan. There is great variability among youth in the nature and timing of IPV exposure and considerable heterogeneity in mental health outcomes. Such heterogeneity in outcomes may be explained by various Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs, including Negative Valence Systems (NVS) involving responses to threat. That is, disruptions in the functioning and development of neural and physiological systems associated with threat processing may account for heightened anxiety symptoms commonly observed following IPV. A paucity of longitudinal studies assessing multiple threat-related mechanisms, across multiple units of analysis, and at key times in development has been a critical barrier to informing the design of personalized treatments to target root causes of post-IPV psychopathology. The overarching goal of this project is to examine developmental trajectories of threat-related NVS measures into adolescence, as a function of exposure to IPV, in an effort to better link IPV and anxiety through changes in these measures. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to identify threat-related NVS constructs that connect lifetime IPV to anxious symptoms in youth cross-sectionally; 2) to investigate longitudinally the degree to which IPV sensitizes trajectories of NVS measures over a two-year period across three age cohorts (grades 3, 6, 9 at baseline); and 3) to investigate the degree to which trajectories of NVS measures predict anxiety symptoms over a 2-year period after accounting for initial anxiety symptoms and IPV status. An exploratory aim is to examine how amygdala activity and ACC functioning at baseline and overtime predict changes in other threat- related NVS measures (ERP, startle, ERN, cortisol reactivity) over time. To accomplish the aims, the approach involves studying the contributions of three threat-related NVS constructs, including responses to acute threat, potential threat, and sustained threat. These constructs will be measured across multiple units of analysis (neural circuitry, physiology, behavior/self-report) and over time using a battery of well-validated translational neuroscience laboratory paradigms and assessment tools. An accelerated longitudinal cohort design will be used to test key developmental questions (e.g., whether pubertal status moderates the effect of IPV on potential threat or sustained threat). Three cohorts of children (total n=360) and their caregivers will be enrolled and prospectively across 3 annual in-person lab assessments, with phone-based assessments in between. A community sample representing a broad continuum of IPV experiences and a wide range of anxiety symptoms will be recruited. By studying multiple NVS constructs over time across multiple units of analysis, findings will clarify the timing and developmental course of psychobiological vulnerabilities to anxiety problems in IPV- exposed youth, and will impact clinical care and future clinical research classification.  "
"9312722","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed research program is to implement and evaluate complementary interventions designed to address underage alcohol, marijuana, tobacco and other drug use and abuse among Native American youth residing in and around nine contiguous Indian reservations in rural San Diego County. The application directly builds upon the successful collaboration between Indian Health Council, Inc., Prevention Research Center, and The Scripps Research Institute, with pilot and demonstration studies focusing on reducing the supply of and demand for alcohol by Native American youth through a series of environmental and individual interventions that have shown efficacy and have gained acceptability in the communities served by the clinics. The overall goal of the present proposal will be accomplished through two complementary efforts, one aimed at the community (supply) level and the other at the individual (demand) level. The community-based environmental prevention program will focus on (a) reducing underage access to alcohol and tobacco through a reward and reminder program for off-premise retail clerks and (b) tailoring, implementing and evaluating a community mobilization and awareness intervention aimed at reducing the social availability of alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, and other drugs from adults, including family members. These community-level programs will be complemented with interventions at the individual level, including implementing and evaluating a culturally tailored motivational interviewing brief intervention to reduce demand for alcohol and other drugs for American Indian youth 13-20 years of age who are substance users. We will evaluate the effectiveness of these programs by analyzing multiple data sources: (a) outcome data from a Motivational Interviewing-Psychoeducation trial among tribal youth, (b) data from school and community youth surveys on youths' self-reported substance use and related problems including driving under the influence, (c) anonymous norms and intervention awareness surveys from adults from each of the communities; and (d) law enforcement data on alcohol/drug-related events. For the purposes of evaluation, these data from the Indian Health Council catchment area will be compared to data from surveys of both non- Native and Native American youth who were not involved in the intervention activities. The research will continue to build cohorts of expert Natie American research staff and student interns for actualizing the proposed research and interventions. The team will create intervention workbooks for standardized application of the intervention techniques in other Native American communities."

"9348516","Project Summary Flow cytometry is a workhorse technique in research and development as well as in clinical laboratories for diagnosis and monitoring of disease. It is particularly useful in distinguishing between populations of immune cells based on their expressed cell surface antigens. Standard flow cytometers use fluorescent tags, often conjugated to monoclonal antibodies, to give qualitative and quantitative information about specific molecules in the cell. This molecular specificity, coupled with the fact that information is obtained on a cell-by-cell basis and that very high throughput is possible (30,000 cells per second can be analyzed), make this a powerful technique. The ability to multiplex (measure a variety of different molecular species in a single cell) further adds to its utility and to the complexity of the scientific questions that can be addressed using this technique. However, the level of multiplexing currently has limitations. Typically, flow cytometry analysis relies solely on spectral information of the fluorescent tags and is thus limited by the spectral overlap of fluorophore emissions. Currently, employing even moderate levels of multiplexing for the simultaneous interrogation of multiple parameters within a cell requires high levels of complexity in instrumentation and analysis, and careful design and execution of experiments. The related compensation problem (compensating for spillover of signal from a fluorophore into multiple channels?due to the broad spectrum of most fluorophores) also causes significant instrument complexity, cumbersome workflow, and inaccurate results. These factors put severe limits on the range of scientific questions that can be addressed using current technologies, deter novices in the technique from attempting more complex yet scientifically relevant experiments, and collectively are widely regarded as the major current bottleneck in flow cytometry. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an innovative approach that uses fluorescence lifetime as a separate, additional discriminating measurement parameter. Our scheme for using fluorescent lifetime for multiplexing is simple, scalable, and supported by preliminary data from our prototype instrument. The proposed project will establish the feasibility of lifetime-based multiplexing by modifying our experimental platform with key hardware and algorithm improvements, challenging the resulting prototype with a comprehensive set of verification and validation tests of increasing complexity, and culminating with a comparison of our technology to existing technology in a standard four-color cell-based assay. A successful outcome will lay the foundation for our planned development of commercial instruments (both analyzers and sorters) that offer two major benefits to end users: (a) simple, turnkey, compensation-free operation for instruments with low-to-medium levels of multiplexing; and (b) high-end instruments with two to three times the current maximum multiplexing capability."
"9309058","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human babesiosis is a malaria-like illness caused by infection of red blood cells by the protozoan parasite Babesia microti or related species, primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected deer ticks. Babesiosis can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, and is currently acknowledged as the foremost unaddressed infectious risk to the US blood supply. Blood donations from B. microti-endemic areas in the USA can exhibit up to 1% seropositivity, and the distribution of seropositivity is expanding rapidly into adjacent states. Babesiosis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation with serious to fatal outcome in immunocompromised individuals which includes many transfusion recipients. Undetected Babesia infection in blood donors has been recognized as a serious threat to transfusion safety, with transfusion responsible for over 150 cases since 1979 and a dozen fatalities since 2005. Babesiosis is a rare disease by numbers, but with potentially serious to fatal impact on those who acquire it, which significantly contributes to the health burden of this disease. In the absence of other interventions, the only viable strategy to prevent the transfusion of B. microti-contaminated blood units is to screen blood donors for the presence of the parasite. However, no test for Babesia is currently licensed for blood screening and commercially available. Hence there is an urgent and unmet need for blood donor screening to interdict B. microti - contaminated blood donations. This Phase IIb grant will support the development of a Babesia assay based on antigen detection, which will supplement the antibody detection ELISA previously developed under the Applicants' prior Phase II grant. Babesia parasites secrete antigens into the extracellular medium which may be detected in serum or plasma, thus providing a sensitive marker for detection of active infection. In collaboration with consortium partner Tufts University, applicants have identified immunodominant protein antigens which meet these criteria and have generated specific antibodies suitable for antigen capture immunoassay. The antigen capture assay will enable detection of potentially infectious blood donors in the window stage, when antibodies are not yet measurable. Furthermore, it will clear individuals with persistent antibody response due to a previous, resolved Babesia infection to donate blood, eliminating unnecessary and undesirable donor deferrals. The assay will be evaluated on gold standard babesiosis patient samples through collaboration with Yale University, and on 30,000 blood donors through a donor study carried out under IND with consortium partners Blood Systems Research Institute, Creative Testing Solutions and New York Blood Center. The donor study will support a licensure application to FDA for the Babesia test for blood screening. The overall goal is to provide an assay for Babesia microti suitable for high throughput donor screening which will offer the first cost-effective intervention to reduce or eliminate the risk of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis."
"9244075","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain injury is the main cause auf long-term disability in children and carries the greatest disease burden out of any pediatric condition. Children with brain injury often compensate remarkably well and can develop abilities typically supported by brain structures now damaged. It is thought that much of this recovery results from the use-driven reorganization of the brain's complex functional network architecture. A better understanding of the links between activity, network organization and functional recovery is paramount to developing much needed novel neurorehabilitative treatments and improving existing ones. Therefore, it is our long-term objective to uncover the systems-level fundamentals of use-driven functional network plasticity in children with brain injury. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), a treatment for hemiparesis, provides an excellent research model for studying use-driven brain reorganization. Patients treated with CIMT have their stronger upper extremity restrained in a cast for three weeks while practicing difficult tasks with the affected side. CIMT radically alters upper extremity use, thus lastingly improving function on the treated side. The objective of the current proposal is to learn how constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) improves motor function in children with chronic brain injury. The specific aims are to 1) identify those functional network changes most important for improved upper extremity use, 2) establish neuropsychometric markers that predict treatment response, and 3) investigate the effect of therapy dose on outcomes. This study will test our hypothesis that much of CIMTs benefit derives from a reweighting of functional connections between the brain's attention and motor networks towards the treated side and that these changes are modulated by attentional dysfunction and therapy dose. To achieve these aims we will repeatedly assess functional networks and motor behavior with multi-modal MRI (functional, functional connectivity) and wearable accelerometer biosensors, in children undergoing CIMT. A within-subject design and novel single-subject network analytics will for the first time allow us to factor out lesion inhomogeneity and extract commonalities of therapy-driven changes across patients. This study will strongly impact health-related research by identifying beneficial connections that should be targeted with brain stimulation and neurofeedback and potentially revealing modifiable patient (attentional dysfunction) and therapy factors (dose) critical to therapy success. Candidate: Dr. Nico Dosenbach, the candidate, is a systems neuroscientist and pediatric neurologist whose prior research using functional MRI (fMRI) and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has contributed significantly to the understanding of attentional control networks and functional network development. Driven by his clinical interest in advancing rehabilitative treatments for pediatric brain injury, Dr. Dosenbach is seeking additional training in movement science, developmental neuropsychology, biostatistics and clinical pediatric neurorehabilitation. Dr. Dosenbach's career goal is to improve the scientific understanding of functional network reorganization in pediatric brain injury in order to develop novel neurorehabilitative treatments, as well as to optimize current treatments. His career development plan includes training in movement science with Dr. Lang, developmental neuropsychology with Dr. Barch, biostatistics with Dr. Shannon and in clinical pediatric neurorehabilitation with Dr. Noetzel. Dr. Dosenbach's principal mentor, Dr. Bradley Schlaggar, a pediatric neurologist and developmental cognitive neuroscientist, will also provide training in movement science and developmental neuropsychology and convey the qualities and strategies of a successful, independent physician-scientist. Dr. Dosenbach will complete classes in movement science, neuropsychology, biostatistics and Research Ethics. Environment: Washington University's (WU) neuroimaging research community is one of the largest and most highly regarded and has a reputation for openness and strongly supporting young investigators. Many of the leading neuroscientists studying human functional networks, such as Drs. Marcus Raichle, Steven Petersen, Maurizio Corbetta and Bradley Schlaggar, work at WU. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) led by Dr. David Van Essen and Dr. Deanna Barch has brought even greater neuroimaging resources and expertise to WU. In addition, WU is nationally highly ranked (US News and World Report) in pediatric neurology (# 5), occupational therapy (#2) and physical therapy (#3). Overall, WU is the single best institution imaginable for Dr. Dosenbach's research career development and the success of the proposed project."
"9250649","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The main objective ofthe RNA Sequencing Core (RSC) is to provide users with efficient and high quality access to cutting-edge sequencing technologies. These sequencing technologies will be used by all members of this U54-proposal, and made available to other U54-centers. Importantly, all members of this U54 are relying on access to these technologies to achieve their project goals. By centralizing sequencing at the RSC, sequencing will be performed at a lower cost and with greater efficiency that would be possible for individual users. The RSC will use high-throughput next-generation sequencing in two different applications. The first application will be to quantify the abundance of all messenger RNAs (mRNA) in a sample, this information is useful in describing the overall physiological state of a cell because all proteins are encoded by mRNAs. The second application will be to identify all small RNAs in a sample; small RNAs regulate the production of proteins by interacting with mRNAs. RSC staff will validate RNA sample quality, convert the RNA into a form suitable for high-throughput sequencing, and either perform sequencing on instruments within the RSC or perform the sequencing at the Cornell Genomics Facility. Cornell University will provide space for the RSC in the Biotechnology building, which also houses the Cornell Genomics Facility. Dr. Grimson, the RSC director, has his office within the Biotechnology building. The computational analysis of sequencing data often represents a bottleneck for the adoption of these technologies by biologists and physician-scientists. The RSC will remove this impediment by providing professional computational support to users, and working with users to make optimal use of their data. The RSC will sequence human samples, including samples from patients with fertility problems, and from mouse samples, including those containing mutations that perturb germline and reproductive functions. Together, the sequencing data will generate critical insights into reproductive biology in mammals, with direct relevance to human reproductive health. As an additional benefit ofthe RSC, the centralizing of sequencing and analysis will further facilitate synergism between all members of this U54, and with other U54 centers ofthe SCCPIR."

"9255957","Healthcare organizations who treat mental health disorders face numerous challenges including identifying optimal first-­line treatments as well as utilizing proper recovery metrics in order to best assess progress. While promise has been demonstrated with the use of pharmaceuticals, individual differences in the response to these medications coupled with non-­adherence due to factors such as side effects and rising costs has capped the potential upside. These issues, while surmountable, are exasperated by the inability to provide the prescribing provider relevant information at the point of care within the customary workflow. For instance, advances in pharmacogenetics have produced assays analyzing the genetic code of specific patient enzymes that have proven to be effective in determining better precision choices for medications. These precise reports succeed by empowering the provider with patient-­specific information on which medications are most likely to succeed based on the pharmacodynamics of the medication as well as the pharmacokinetic interactions between the patient and drug therapies. However, these reports are most often stored in either paper hard copy or digital format sent via email, inaccessible to the prescribing provider during patient encounters. Similarly, any reliable pricing information is not available until the patient actually fills the prescription. If cost is an issue, at minimum this will result in lost time to the healthcare system and patient alike, and at worse will lead to non-­compliance by the patient. Clinical Decision Support (CDS) platforms have emerged as essential tools for addressing these kinds of problems. RxREVU?s RxCHECK platform is a CDS tool designed to empower the provider with the exact information they need for the specific patient they are treating in order to prescribe the best medication available. Hypothesis: Integrating RxCHECK directly into the provider?s clinical workflow via the EHR will allow vital evidence-­based information to be surfaced at the point of prescribing. This will lower overall costs to the patient while helping ensure the provider is selecting the best medication based on evidence-­based criteria within the clinical guidelines of the organization. Specific Aims: This project entails the integration of RxCHECK, a prescription focused CDS, into the Mental Health Center of Denver?s (MHCD) Netsmart EHR. The goal is to surface in an efficient, non-­disruptive manner, evidence based information including genetic profiles, pricing, and patient adherence metrics. Empowering the provider with the evidence needed in order to choose the best medication for their patient. The first aim is centered on converting genetic information from paper and PDF format into a format consumable by MHCD and their EHR. The second aim concerns the development of the RxCHECK module including the ability to surface this information as well as tracking and reporting of provider adoption of suggested medication changes. The third, and final aim is to integrate the RxCHECK module into MHCD?s Netsmart EHR platform."
"9253030","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale and Objectives: Approximately 5,800 infants and toddlers with developmental disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, complex chronic conditions) and delays access Early Intervention Colorado (EI-CO) annually. Primary goals of EI-CO is to help children optimally function at home and in the community in order to increase early skill acquisition and minimize future rehabilitation and special education service use, but the effects of EI-CO are poorly understood. This proposal addresses this need by 1) examining disparities in EI-CO service use (Aim 1) and 2) estimating the impact of EI-CO service use on EI outcomes (Aim 2). Methods: Secondary analyses of existing EI-CO data from a major EI-CO program between 2008-2013 (n=3,500) and primary data collection of enrolled families (n=832) are used. Primary dependent variables are 1) EI service use (Aim 1) and 2) EI outcomes (Aim 2). EI service use will be measured from program billing data and dosage of EI service use will be calculated based upon service frequency and duration. EI outcomes will be measured from online questionnaires addressing functional task performance (e.g., mobility) and activity participation (e.g., personal care management). Econometric models will be used to estimate each outcome conditional on child and family characteristics and, for functional outcomes, service use, and perceived environmental barriers. Project Impact and Relevance to NCMRR: There is critical need for robust research evidence about the adequacy of EI services relative to functional outcomes to improve EI service delivery. However, knowledge gaps about EI service use and outcomes have posed significant barriers to building and translating this knowledge. Project results will yield important new knowledge about disparities in EI-CO service use and how disparities in service use contribute to variability in functional outcomes. These deliverables will improve our chances of successfully competing for NIH R01 funds to conduct a scale-up multi-site EI-CO outcomes study."
"9361137","This application will support the purchase of a state-of-the-art microscopy system, a super resolution laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV3000). This system will enhance the research program of 7 VA investigators and enable them to obtain microscopy images of cellular and subcellular events with unprecedented resolution (up to 120 nanometers). There is no equipment available on our campus for this purpose. Although our academic affiliate has comparable microscopy systems in core facilities, our VA investigators face obstacles in using them due to limited availability in scheduling which often lead to significant delays, and cumbersome commute to/from our affiliate with biological samples. Having this technology available on our campus will represent a major benefit to our VA researchers, providing exceptional microscopy capabilities. For example, 4 of the users study platelets (cells with diameter of 2-3 micrometers) and typically rely on electron microscopy to study their cellular components. The super resolution system will enable these researchers to obtain microscopy images of platelet shape and structure with unprecedented capabilities. The system contains 7 lasers, which will facilitate simultaneous imaging of multiple cellular targets, including identify their interactions. Further, the system will be particularly helpful for studies on cultured cells, with its inverted microscope design with high numerical aperture silicone oil objectives and a temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide-controlled incubation chamber. This system will complement the existing core research equipment at our facility, and will provide a tremendous enhancement to our overall research program. This is expected to promote further collaboration among VA investigators as well as improve our efforts to recruit and retain talented investigators to our medical center."
"9303379","INTEGRATIVE HEALTH SCIENCES FACILITIES CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the CEHS Integrative Health Sciences Facilities Core (IHSFC) is to facilitate the translation of research findings of CEHS into clinical or public health applications. MIT does not have a Medical School or a School of Public Health, which typically would have built-in mechanisms to facilitate clinical translation. Nevertheless, we have an outstanding science and engineering portfolio that produces technology that continuously needs to be moved toward application. Our IHSFC performs that translational function. We address the need for a mechanism to enable clinical translation in five ways. First, we have a strong bidirectional connection with the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School through Center member and Harvard Dean, Prof. David Hunter, who acts as a formal conduit for information exchange and helps to establish collaborations with the medical community. Second, we are formally connected with the Harvard Catalyst via Dr. Catherine Ricciardi, who is employed by both CEHS and Harvard to facilitate clinical translation. The Harvard Catalyst (http://catalyst.harvard.edu), which has MIT as an active, financially supporting stakeholder, is a consortium of clinical expertise from across the Harvard hospital network designed to find paths to bring the benefits of new technology to people. The IHSFC promotes two-way interaction between CEHS members and the Catalyst clinical network. Third, CEHS has developed over the past decade a critical mass of clinician-scientists, and we have recently restructured our IHSFC management team to better utilize our impressive local assets; as described in the proposal, the new IHSFC Core is managed by two very active Center members, Michael Yaffe and James Fox, and they are assisted by two Hospital Liaison Program Directors and a seven person team of Clinical and Translational Consultants. Fourth, the IHSFC, via its interaction with the CEHS IAC, manages a set of ?Translational Pilot Projects.? These Pilot Projects facilitate the benchtop to bedside translation process. Fifth, the enrichment activities of the Administrative Core provide for frequent presentations of Center member research. Examples of these venues include the CEHS Friday Forums, the CEHS Poster Session, and our frequent research and mentoring seminars, all of which are well attended. At such events, our members are ever vigilant to recommend ways to connect what is heard and seen to our translational (IHSFC) as well as our community engagement (via our COE2C) agendas. This five- part program to support clinical translation has worked well for us and is noted as a critical and attractive feature by new members of CEHS."
"9294152","Project Summary Granulocyte transfusion (GTX) has been utilized as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections in severely neutropenic patients. However, its clinical outcome is often hampered by inefficiency of recruitment to sites of inflammation, rapid in vivo death, and poor pathogen killing capability of transplanted neutrophils. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize cellular and molecular events that can improve neutrophil performance during granulocyte transfusion. In the last funding period, we demonstrated that elevating intracellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling pathway by disrupting PTEN enhances neutrophil function, augments bacterial clearance, and reduces mortality rate in a murine model of neutropenia-associated pneumonia. We further revealed that PTEN disruption in transfused neutrophils significantly improves the efficacy of granulocyte transfusion. These findings confirm the validity of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 pathway as a therapeutic target for improving the clinical outcome of granulocyte transfusion. Nevertheless, PTEN is a well-known tumor suppressor and its disruption has been implicated in tumorigenesis of numerous solid and hematologic cancers, which renders it unsuitable as a therapeutic target. Recently, we reported that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signal in neutrophils can also be elevated by disrupting InsP6K1, an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of InsP7, a cytosolic molecule that negatively regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling. InsP6K1 deficient neutrophils possess an enhanced bacteria killing capability and their recruitment to the site of inflammation is augmented. Importantly, homozygous InsP6K1 KO mice are viable and do not display any gross physical or behavioral abnormalities. No tumors of any kind is discovered in these mice. Based on these intriguing results, we hypothesize that disruption of InsP6K1 should be a safer, yet equally effective therapeutic strategy for improving granulocyte transfusion. In this proposed study, we will use a mouse neutropenia-related pneumonia model to test this hypothesis. First, we will investigate whether disrupting InsP6K1 can elevate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signal and enhance the accumulation (including recruitment and survival) of transfused neutrophils in neutropenia-related E.coli pneumonia (Aim I). In addition, we will determine whether disrupting InsP6K1 in transfused neutrophils can ultimately enhance the host defense in (Aim II), and alleviate the severity of (Aim III) neutropenia-related bacterial and fungal pneumonia. Finally, for future clinical intervention, inhibition of InsP6K1 will most likely be achieved by using chemical compounds. Thus we will examine whether pre-treatment with an InsP6K inhibitor, TNP, can also augment the efficacy of granulocyte transfusion in neutropenia-related pneumonia (Aim IV). Thus, in accordance with the general theme of the PPG, this study will provide novel therapeutic targets and/or strategies for improving the performance of neutrophils in granulocyte transfusion and therefore alleviating the severity of neutropenia-related infection in the peri-transplant setting."
"9250646","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Micro RNAs (miRNA) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are considered key regulators of posttranslational mRNA modifications, capable of affecting the expression of multiple genes simultaneously . Small RNAs have been identified in human testis, and hold promise for identifying major breakthroughs in the understanding of human reproduction. Comparative analysis of sequencing of miRNA data (human testis) showed that 70 % of human miRNA is highly conserved between species, thus allowing for relatively easy study of the mechanism of action of candidate miRNA in animal models. The current proposal aims to use multiplexed deep sequencing to identify new small RNAs, and to employ qRT-PCR to identify miRNAs critical in male infertility. Cell isolation will be used to enrich the population of different cells, allowing increased sensitivity to detect specific miRNAs in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, Leydig cells, and Sertoli cells. Expression profiles from fertile male testes, men with Sertoli cell only syndrome and maturation arrest will be evaluated. Expression of sperm miRNA in normal men and men with severe oligospermia (density <1 mil/ml) will be analyzed to determine if the ejaculated sperm miRNA profiling may be useful in diagnosis of genetic reasons for male infertility. Subsequent experiments will focus on a subset of conserved and X-linked miRNA interacting with set of genes important in reproduction. TruSeq mRNA profiles obtained from fertile and infertile patients will be used to experimentaly identify critical miRNA:mRNA targets. Selected targets will be confirmed further in transgenic models as part of U54 center collaborative effort. At the end ofthe proposed funding period, this work will identify and confirm a set of approximately 20-30 miRNA:mRNA interactions that are critical in male infertility, verify their target specificity in vitro, delineate their mechanisms of action, and assign them to known regulatory pathways. This will lay a solid groundwork for the development of in vivo models. These models can then be used to test whether delivery of exogenous miRNAs, or their inhibitors, can rescue the infertile phenotype. This work will also provide insights for the development of RNA-based therapies for infertility and other testicular disorders."
"9253096","Project Summary/Abstract ? Project 1 Previous animal-based experiments in this Project focused on the impact of vascular capacitance (blood storage) on cardiovascular regulation. Because the splanchnic vasculature plays a large role in determining overall vascular capacitance, and the sympathetic nervous system is the major regulator of splanchnic vascular capacitance, we investigated the idea that the splanchnic sympathetic nerves may be important in hypertension. Obesity is now known to be the major cause of human hypertension and its accompanying morbidities, mortalities and increased health care costs. Furthermore, increased sympathetic nervous system activity is accepted as one critical link between obesity and hypertension. Although sympathetic control of the kidney is an established factor in obesity-related hypertension, there is substantial evidence that sympathetic activity to other targets also plays a part. Given the close association of obesity-related sympathetic overactivity and hypertension with accumulation of inflammed adipose tissue specifically in the splanchnic region (visceral adipose tissue), we hypothesize that splanchnic sympathetic activity is important in obesity- associated hypertension. We further propose that splanchnic sympathetic activity regulates arterial pressure in obesity not only by affecting the function of splanchnic blood vessels, but also by promoting and accelerating inflammation of the visceral adipose tissue surrounding those blood vessels. In this context, splanchnic sympathetic activity refers not only to effects of sympathetic nerves and circulating catecholamines, but also to norepinephrine released from a newly discovered adrenergic system intrinsic to visceral fat itself (described in Project 3).To test these hypotheses, experiments will be conducted in rats made obese by feeding them a high fat (HF) diet for up to 26 weeks, starting at 3 weeks of age. The rats will develop glucose intolerance, visceral obesity and hypertension starting between 12-18 weeks of the diet. At 6, 18 and 26 weeks of HF feeding we will estimate splanchnic nerve activity using norepinephrine spillover; measure vascular capacitance (mainly splanchnic), splanchnic vascular resistance and their dependence on adrenergic input; and evaluate the impact of chronic denervation of splanchnic blood vessels and visceral adipose tissue on hypertension development. Finally, we will determine if prostaglandin D2 in the brain contributes to sympathoexcitation in our rat model of obesity. It is anticipated that these studies could produce new approaches to managing obesity-related hypertension."
"9254469","02 CANCER CELL BIOLOGY (CCB) PROGRAM ABSTRACT Cancer Cell Biology (CCB) is a multidisciplinary program encompassing diverse scientific endeavors, which provide new discoveries with a focus on developing novel therapeutics and driving further clinical investigation through inter-programmatic collaborations. The overall goals of CCB investigators are to conduct the highest quality basic science research in the thematic focus areas of the program, to elucidate novel pathways and targets involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis, and to develop inhibitors that interfere with those pathways and targets. Three integrated thematic areas within CCB all have strong translational components, and include 1) Signal Transduction Pathways; 2) Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis; and 3) Gene Expression and Genome Instability. An emerging crosscutting theme in Mitochondria and Cancer Energetics within CCB is especially relevant to the overall CCC strategic plan, given the high rate of obesity within our catchment area, and the increased risk of cancer in this population, with disproportionate representation of African Americans. The CCB program has a strong cancer focus and is co-lead by Drs. Mary-Ann Bjornsti and Ralph Sanderson. There are 49 members from UAB (11 departments and 5 schools), Southern Research Institute and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, with annual direct research support in the amount of $9,642,338, which includes $6,628,357 in cancer related NIH funding. Major accomplishments during the last funding period include: 1) the enhanced translational cancer focus of CCB member science in three integrated thematic focus areas, 2) a robust pipeline of Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance Project, 3) development of a multi-investigator Multiple Myeloma focus group, 4) novel platforms in cancer genomics (HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology) and phenomics, and 5) programmatically aligned Faculty recruitment. Indeed, CCC- supported initiatives including the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, the consortium partnership with HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, and the development of new shared resources, facilities, pilot funds and model systems, have promoted the translational cancer focus of science investigations made by CCB investigators. The CCB program has also been highly productive, with 412 publications in the past five years of which 25% were inter-programmatic and 21% were intra-programmatic, and typifies the highly collaborative research programs of CCB members."

The requested funds are intended to help defray travel costs for 10 young investigators, selected for short talks from submitted abstracts, and housing costs for 20 invited speakers. Since 1972, the North American Testis Workshop has been the premiere international forum for basic and clinician-scientists to present and discuss their recent findings on testis regulation and function. The main goals for the Workshop are to: 1) facilitate solutions for the high incidence of male infertility and the need for a safe, reversible male contraceptive and 2) foster development of the field's future leaders, with emphasis on trainees, women and underrepresented minorities.!  The Workshop's theme is ?From Testis Differentiation to Sperm Production?. The program includes four major lectures (the keynote address and three benchmark lectures) and 16 invited talks that are grouped into six sessions as follows: Germline Establishment & Homeostasis (Session I), Germ cell Differentiation and Maintenance: Role of RNA & RBPs (Session II), Testis Development & Differentiation (Session III), Transcriptional & Endocrine Regulation in the Testis (Session IV), Sperm Development & Maturation (Session V), and Genetics & Epigenetics of Male Reproduction (Session VI). After invited talks, sessions will end with short talks selected from abstracts submitted by young investigators (trainees and Assistant Professors in rank for no more than 2 years). Two poster sessions, with all posters displayed throughout the meeting, are also planned.  The meeting will begin with the keynote address by Dr. Dirk de Rooij, from Utrecht University, The Netherlands. Dr. de Rooij is a longstanding leader in the field of testis biology who has contributed extensively to our understanding of the testis, by documenting fundamental characteristics of different testicular cell types and their relation to spermatogenesis and male fertility. His presentation will offer new insights on spermatogonial renewal and differentiation in humans and non-primates and provide a strong foundation for many subsequent presentations. Dr. Haifan Lin, from Yale University, will give the first benchmark lecture. Dr. Lin is internationally recognized for his research on germline self-renewal and development and the Piwi-piRNA pathway and its role in epigenetic programming and posttranscriptional regulation. His presentation will provide a strong foundation for Sessions I & II. Dr. John Aitken, from the University of Newcastle, Australia, will present the second benchmark lecture. Dr. Aitken is a leading authority on male infertility and his lecture is relevant to presentations throughout the meeting but mostly to those in Sessions V and VI. Dr. Oliver Rando, from the University of Massachusetts, will give the third benchmark lecturer. Dr. Rando is well known for his research on chromatin and epigenetic inheritance and his talk on the sperm epigenome, paternal inheritance and influences from diet and the environment merges nicely with topics in Sessions V and VI."
"9312413","ABSTRACT Enteric infections caused by bacterial pathogens are often debilitating and life-threatening, especially for young children. In vivo rodent models and in vitro intestinal epithelial cell monolayers, the most common models for studying these pathogens, often do not recapitulate the true outcomes of enteric infections that occur in the human intestine. Therefore, many aspects of the interactions between these pathogens and the human host remain unknown. This project aims to dissect the early events between cells in the human small-intestine and two important intestinal enteric pathogens, Vibrio cholerae and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, using a multicellular 3D in vitro human tissue model that incorporates flow, low 02 tension, immune cells and normal microbiota. Specifically, we will use silk proteins as scaffolds to develop a 3D multicellular matrix system to support human intestinal epithelium formation for sustained cultivation and for infection by enteric pathogens. These silk scaffolds will be seeded with cells from enteroids derived from children. Our preliminary data shows that these 3D silk scaffolds that are seeded with cells from ileal enteroids develop at least 4 major intestinal cell types when placed in differential medium. Building on these results, this project will continue to develop and study these intestinal tissues by sequentially introducing flow dynamics, physiological concentrations of 02 (5%), immune cells, and normal microbiota into these 3D ileal tissues scaffolds. Our goals are to understand (1) how, where and the consequences of V. cholerae and Y. pseudotuberculosis binding to and damaging the human intestine under conditions of flow and low 02; (2) the bacterial and host transcriptomes after infection of this human tissue model; (3) the impact of neutrophils on colonization, damage and host responses to infection; (4) the impact of specific Y. pseudotuberculosis adhesins and Yops on this human intestinal model; and (5) the impact of V. cholerae quorum sensing on its colonization; and (6) the impact of interspecies communication between V. cholerae or Y. pseudotuberculosis and normal microbiota on colonization and tissue damage. In addition, we will probe the utility of this model for assessing anti-infectives by testing a number of small molecules that disrupt quorum sensing or type 3 secretion systems on the colonization and damage caused by these pathogens. Establishing this tunable 3-D intestinal system will permit the development of methods that interrupt seeding, spread and/or damage by the pathogen by targeting specific bacterial mechanisms or by supplementing the host with specific microbiota or other factors that compete for the same niches, inhibit colonization, and/or reduce intestinal damage and inflammation."
"9282647","ABSTRACT: The endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeleton is a complex array of proteins intimately involved in the diverse cell shape changes critical to dynamic regulation of lung vascular barrier integrity, particularly in the pathobiology of and recovery from ARDS and VILI. Consistent with the thematic underpinnings of this PPG, Project #2 investigators have identified specific cytoskeletal effectors (cortactin, Ena/VASP-like protein or EVL, c-Abl) involved in the actin-based cytoskeletal remodeling that is spatially defined at the EC periphery and within lamellipodia protruding into the paracellular space. Complementing studies described in Project #1, Specific Aim #1 will focus on Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization dynamics in vitro and the effects of c-Abl-mediated post-translational modifications (PTMs, tyrosine phosphorylation) and cytoskeletal effector coding polymorphisms (SNPs) on rates of actin polymerization. Specific Aim #2 will next define the critical participation of key cytoskeletal effector proteins (cortactin, EVL, c-Abl) in regulation of peripheral actin cytoskeletal remodeling, and EC barrier responses (lamellipodia formation, paracellular gap closure, barrier restoration). In addition, the functional contribution of specific cytoskeletal effector PTMs, including c-Abl- mediated cytoskeletal protein tyrosine phosphorylation, will be assessed. These studies will employ Core D expertise and utilize mutant fusion proteins, live cell imaging with kymography, super resolution, atomic and traction force microscopy, protein-protein binding assays, and intercellular gap closure assays to visualize the contributions of these peripheral cytoskeletal effector proteins to EC barrier responses. Similarly, Project #2 investigators have preliminarily defined key non-synonymous coding SNPs that significantly influence protein functionality in peripheral remodeling and EC barrier restoration. Specific Aim #3 will interrogate the influence of cytoskeletal effector coding SNPs that we speculate affect cytoskeletal effector protein function either via altered protein-protein interactions (cortactin-EVL interaction) or altered kinase activity (c-Abl) within the peripheral actin network. These studies, designed to define the functional consequences of specific coding SNPs within each cytoskeletal effector protein, will use the array of biophysical and imaging modalities described for SA #2. Finally, utilizing preclinical models of ARDS and VILI (Core C), Specific Aim #4 will characterize the in vivo influence of cytoskeletal effector protein PTMs and SNPs that we have determined to be impactful in vitro. Based on our compelling published and preliminary data that strongly indicate that each cytoskeletal effector protein to be studied in Project #2 is required to produce agonist-induced lung EC barrier enhancement, Project #2 cytoskeletal effectors are attractive molecular targets for novel therapies and warrant intense structure/function investigation."
"9258481","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ultrasound (US) is used for a variety of therapeutic applications and has been proposed for increasing tissue perfusion in ischemic cardiovascular disease. The most important non- thermal bioeffect by which US can increase perfusion is convective motion which increases shear mechanotransduction. Microbubble (MB) contrast agents used in patients to enhance the blood pool can potentially augment shear through microstreaming during acoustic cavitation. We have recently demonstrated that US-mediated MB cavitation can augment limb tissue perfusion by up to 10-fold and that this effect can persist for greater than 24 hours. The overall aim of this proposal is to assemble a multidisciplinary team to optimize the technology of US- mediated MB cavitation and transition it from pre-clinical models to the treatment of patients with severe symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD). In Aim 1 preclinical small animal models will be used to define optimal conditions for augmenting limb perfusion with regards to acoustic pressure, frequency, MB concentration, and pulsing interval which governs the vascular level at which cavitation occurs. Contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging will be used to assess effect and the type of cavitation (stable versus inertial) will be determined from frequency-power spectra in order to understand the physical determinants for flow augmentation. In Aim 2 we will use large animal models of PAD to spatially characterize and quantify changes in limb perfusion in relation to the volume of tissue in which cavitation is produced. In both of the first two Aims, data will also be generated to define the safety profile for microbubble cavitation. Understanding the biologic determinants for acute and long-term (>24 hour) flow augmentation will be the subject of Aim 3 where we will examine the role of shear- and pressure-dependent mediators of vascular tone. Potential candidate mediators will include NO, adenosine, eicosanoids, and ATP. In Aim 4, an existing 3-D with optimized acoustic conditions for MB cavitation will be applied to evaluate limb tissue perfusion in (a) healthy human subjects, and (b) patients with PAD and critical limb ischemia. These studies represent the translational steps for development of a non-invasive therapy for severe PAD that can be used to achieve meaningful and immediate increases in perfusion, and that can maintain limb tissue viability in situations where immediate revascularization is either not immediately possible or available."
"9253097","Project Summary/Abstract - Project 2 The splanchnic circulation is supplied by sympathetic nerves which control resistance and capacitance. Elevated sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) increases resistance and decreases capacitance causing increased blood pressure. Dysregulation of SNA and dilator mechanisms contribute to obesity-related hypertension. We will study how obesity disrupts molecular control of norepinephrine (NE) and ATP release at the arterial and venous sympathetic neuroeffector junction. A novel concept guiding these studies is that mesenteric perivascular fat (mPVAT) is a source of inflammatory mediators and norepinephrine (NE) that can alter sympathetic function. Specific aim 1: Prejunctional alpha2 adrenergic receptors (alpha2ARs) regulate NE and ATP release from sympathetic nerves and alpha2AR function is impaired in obesity-associated hypertension. The mechanisms responsible for impairment are linked to inflammation. We will test the hypothesis that alpha2AR function is impaired due to the action of mPVAT-derived inflammatory mediators. Specific aim 2: NE and ATP constrict and NE and endothelial derived nitric oxide (NO) relax vascular smooth muscle. Pannexin-1 is a smooth muscle ATP permeable channel and ATP contributes to arterial constriction caused by NE. This conclusion is based only on studies of exogenously applied NE; pannexin-1 contributions to neurogenic arterial or venous constriction have not been established. These studies will test the hypothesis that pannexin-1 contributes to neurogenic constriction in mesenteric arteries and veins and that pannexin-1 expression and function and NE and NO dilator mechanisms are impaired in obesity-associated hypertension. Specific aim 3: This aim will focus on neurogenic constrictions and dilator mechanisms of human mesenteric arteries and veins obtained from obese patients undergoing gastric by-pass surgery and from non-obese patients undergoing intestinal or colonic resection. In addition to studies of basic mechanisms of sympathetic constriction of arteries and veins in the human splanchnic circulation, we will identify the mechanisms responsible for disruption of vascular tone and sympathetic neuroeffector transmission in obesity."
"9463066","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients (> 80%) present with an unresectable primary tumor with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis due to its asymptomatic nature and lack of methods for early detection. While the overall 5-year survival rate of PC is dismal, signi?cantly better outcomes have been reported for early stage smaller tumors. PC is believed to progress through a series of histological changes and recent estimates indicate that these changes require 15-20 years to develop into invasive metastatic disease, hence providing a window of opportunity to intervene. While early diagnosis is an obvious strategy to improve the survival of PC patients, lack of non-invasive biomarkers for risk prediction of precursor lesions or early stage invasive disease impedes our ability to diagnose PC during this window. Premalignant cystic lesions of the pancreas offer unique opportunity for early diagnosis. To meet the EDRN stated goal of performing a validation study for early cancer detection and risk assessment likely to yield meaningful results within 5 years, we propose an innovative approach that could lead to the development of a clinically useful biomarker in this time frame. Additionally, we propose to study cystic neoplasms since IPMN and MCN offer a unique opportunity to identify pancreatic premalignant lesions and serve as a target for early detection strategies. The candidate biomarkers studies in our application have been identified and evaluated over the past 5 years in EDRN-funded biomarker developmental laboratories (BDLs). Studies from the laboratories of participating investigators have conclusively established that mucin overexpression is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer and have identified biomarkers (MUC5AC and its 2 glycoforms, MUC4 and a glycoform of endorepellin) that can effectively distinguish a) patients with resectable PC patients from patients with benign pancreatic diseases; b) mucinous and non- mucinous cysts; c) high-grade from moderate- and low-grade mucinous cysts and d). high-risk intestinal type IPMNs and low risk gastric type IPMNs. The overall objective of this CVC proposal is to demonstrate the ability of the aforementioned biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP), and to identify those cysts with high malignant potential. We have a large number of high quality, well-characterized specimens from patients with pancreatic disease and diseased controls that were collected and processed following protocols developed through the EDRN. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will use available samples from our biospecimen repository to evaluate MUC5AC and MUC4 as biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, and from patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Aim 2 will determine if our biomarkers can identify those cysts with high lethal potential from those with a low risk for malignant transformation."
"9463153","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Meeting the current challenges of the US health care system for children will require novel and wide-ranging action-oriented research to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of health care. This renewal application harnesses the expertise of a dedicated, diverse, and experienced faculty with an 18-year history of leading successful AHRQ-funded post-doctoral NRSA training programs focused specifically on pediatric health services research. We now propose to substantially augment our current program (including its faculty, partnerships with families and health system stakeholders, and curriculum) to specifically focus on implementation science and reduction of health disparities. We will continue the core programmatic collaborations among Boston Children's Hospital, the Mass General Hospital for Children, and the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School. In addition, we will fully engage a new partner-the Institute of Healthcare Improvement-which will bring its internationally-recognized expertise in care improvement and implementation science to our trainees through curricular enhancements and research opportunities. Additional partnerships will include the National Institute for Children's Healthcar Quality for large-scale, ongoing projects dedicated to reducing health care disparities; diverse care delivery systems including local community health centers; the Harvard Medical School Center for Primary Care; and health insurers. We will also develop novel ways to include the voices of patients and parents in our training by incorporating them as program advisors and designing structured interactions of trainees with a newly formed parent resource group to ensure parent and patient perspectives in trainees' research. The program will support 7 stipends per year (4 first-year, and 3 second-year continuing postdoctoral fellows in the first year) to create a critical mass of trainees across subspecialties, areas of research, and methodological domains. In addition to participating in closely mentored research, each trainee will successfully complete the requirements of an MPH from the Harvard School of Public Health for core skills of biostatistics and epidemiology, and participate in advanced health services research methods training including a newly developed curriculum of improvement science and implementation science methods. An already well-developed program infrastructure and system for close tracking of trainees' progress will ensure the continuation of our record of graduating individuals who will lead relevant, applied health services research that translates into both improved care and health outcomes for the children we serve."
"9306583","Abstract  Lynch syndrome is an inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome caused by mutation in one of several DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, including MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2, and EPCAM. Women with Lynch syndrome are at high risk for endometrial (uterine) cancer, colon cancer, as well as other tumor types. While there has been significant progress in the understanding of Lynch syndrome associated colon cancer in terms of molecular pathogenesis and risk, Lynch syndrome associated endometrial cancer is less well understood. The lifetime risk of endometrial cancer in women with Lynch syndrome has been estimated near 54%, and may equal or exceed the risk of colorectal cancer. MSH2 is one of the most commonly mutated MMR genes (50- 66%) in Lynch syndrome associated endometrial cancer.  In addressing provocative question #2, we will evaluate mechanisms underlying how endometrial cancer penetrance associated with loss of MSH2 is influenced by patient natural history (exposure to natural or synthetic hormones) and obesity. We have developed a novel, uterine-targeted, MSH2 knockout mouse model of Lynch syndrome that closely mimics the progression to endometrial cancer observed in women. This model enables us to probe molecular mechanisms underlying how these environmental factors change the risk of endometrial cancer in women with Lynch syndrome.  Obesity and exposure to estrogen are associated with increased sporadic (not inherited) endometrial cancer risk and are known to alter endometrial cell growth, growth factor signaling, as well as the immune response and inflammation. We hypothesize that in the absence of MSH2, behaviors/factors that amplify these changes in the endometrium will increase the likelihood of acquiring oncogenic mutations. Conversely, we expect that environmental factors or behaviors that decrease endometrial cell growth and normalize growth factor signaling and immune response (by lowering exposure to detrimental hormones or by maintaining a lean weight and low insulin), will reduce the overall incidence and accumulation of oncogenic mutations, and decrease the penetrance of disease in women with Lynch syndrome.  We will evaluate the molecular changes that occur in the endometrium of normal mice and MSH2 knockout mice in response to hormone exposure and obesity using state-of-the-art tools for molecular profiling. We expect to identify a subset of genes that are targets for mutation in the absence of MSH2, which contribute to the development of endometrial cancer in Lynch Syndrome. We will further examine how changes in the local immune response is altered due to the loss of MSH2 and how this is impacted by hormones and obesity. These findings will be critical to developing effective prevention strategies (both behavioral and pharmaceutical), which can delay or prevent endometrial cancer in these women."
"9264962","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          This study aims to:  (1) develop new markers for response to tuberculosis (TB) treatment through expression profiling or analysis of patterns of RNA expression in human blood as quantified by microarray technology and (2) determine whether small regulatory RNA (sRNA) secreted by M tuberculosis act to suppress expression of host-protective genes in macrophages through RNA interference (RNAi). New markers for response to TB treatment. Specific disease states may produce signature RNA patterns not seen in other conditions and the pathogen-specific component of human expression may distinguish between infections. Identifying expression that is specific to TB requires a clinically-relevant comparison group. To avoid over-estimating test accuracy, biomarkers should be developed in the patients likely to be tested in practice with an intention-to-test approach. The first step of this project will identify and validate a TB expression panel by comparison with patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in cohorts of subjects in the U.S. and Uganda. The second step will test whether expression of the TB panel in blood resolves with successful treatment of active TB. We hypothesize that expression of genes in the TB panel will change to resemble expression in controls without pneumonia, reflecting resolving immune response as bacillary burden decreases. Finally, it is unclear whether blood is a surrogate for understanding TB-specific responses in the lung. Although blood expression may identify effective biomarkers even without recapitulating lung expression, interpretation of the pathobiological significance of blood expression demands understanding the relationship between blood and lung expression. To determine the extent to which TB-specific expression in blood reflects inflammatory pathways in the lung this study will compare expression in simultaneously collected blood and BAL while adjusting for the different cell types present in each specimen type. sRNA secreted by Mtb may subvert host-protective macrophage responses via RNAi. RNAi, the biological process in which endogenous non-coding sRNA molecules bind mRNA and inhibit gene expression, is a fundamental regulatory mechanism in both Mtb and humans. sRNA secreted by Mtb was recently shown to increase bacterial viability in macrophages. We hypothesize that the mechanism for this increased viability is Mtb-derived sRNA silencing of expression of important human host-protective genes. Specifically, through RNA sequencing we have identified Mtb-derived sRNA which are predicted to bind the 3' untranslated region of key host-protective human mRNA transcripts for IkB?, TRAF-3 and TRAF-5. We propose to validate this novel form of cross-species RNAi. If confirmed, this would represent a novel form of host-pathogen interaction that could offer new targets for anti-TB therapy."
"9412324","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is a very aggressive cancer that metastasizes early in disease progression and is highly resistant to present therapeutics. These characteristics of melanoma may be innate rather than acquired, since the source of this tumor, the melanocyte, has a high capacity to migrate and survive for relatively long periods. This parallelism between melanocytes and melanoma is most likely due to shared molecular pathways between both cell types. PAX3 is a transcription factor necessary for normal melanocyte development, growth, and migration. Due to these developmental roles, it is not surprising that we have found PAX3 also is aberrantly expressed in melanoma and promotes tumor growth and progression. PAX3 is a significant driver of melanoma since it actively promotes the expression of a number of genes involved in tumor growth, survival and migration. However, the factors that regulates and works with PAX3, and how can this knowledge be translated to new and effective therapeutic opportunities for melanoma patients, is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesize that maintained expression and function of the PAX3 protein is a key driver of melanoma, and disruption of PAX3 co-factors and upstream regulators will be deleterious to melanoma progression and survival. The major objectives of this application are to determine the mechanism of PAX3 maintenance of expression and function in melanoma, identify molecular members of the pathways that regulate PAX3, determine if these molecules will be good targets for melanoma therapy, and see if these candidates play a role in tumor initiation and/or progression. Our long-term goal is to identify small molecule therapeutics that will provide alternate or combination therapy in melanoma. We have already identified some of the factors that drive PAX3 gene expression through conserved enhancer elements, as well as proteins that directly bind to and enhance PAX3 function. Our general strategy is to determine if these molecules do indeed promote PAX3 function and melanoma progression on a molecular level and within cellulo models, and within relevant in vivo mouse melanoma models. This study is significant and impactful since it will uncover the mechanism of PAX3 maintenance and function in melanoma, identify co-factors, provide several new therapeutic options, and utilize small molecule inhibitors in a pre-clinical murine model of melanoma. This work is innovative because it will identify novel molecular pathways in melanoma and test new uses for small-molecule inhibitors for melanoma either singularly or in combination. The completion of this work will reveal novel components of molecular pathways driving melanoma. Elucidation of these pathways will provide translational impact through the identification of unique therapeutic targets for a disease with few treatment options."
"9269581","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum mood disorders (PMD) are the most common complication of childbirth and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Postpartum depression (PPD) has a prevalence of 10-15% and is the most frequent type of PMD. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a rare but severe form of PMD that can result in tragic consequences including suicide and infanticide. The relationship between PPD and PP is uncertain, as is their relationship to major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BIP). PPD may or may not be a variant of MDD, and PP may or may not be a variant of BIP. We propose here a rigorous investigation of the epidemiology and genetic epidemiology of PPD and PP using Danish national population registers. Moreover, in contrast to BIP or schizophrenia, efforts to identify the genetic basis of MDD have been complicated by etiological heterogeneity, and genetic studies of PPD may advance these efforts, as PPD may be a more homogenous phenotype involving exposure to a similar biopsychosocial stressor. A robustly replicable finding in psychiatric genomics has been risk profile scores (RPS-polygene scores). There is now strong evidence that RPS measure genetic liability to a psychiatric disorder. We propose to add RPS to our evaluation of the epidemiology and genetic epidemiology of PPD and PP as a critical mechanistic element. The Danish registers form the basis of a longitudinal study of nearly all health care contacts since 1968 and include 4.5 million women plus data on their partners, family members, and offspring. Moreover, at no cost to this study, we will be able to use individual genotypes from a large cohort. We propose: (1) to conduct a cohort study of risk factors of PPD and PP in Danish national registers to examine pre-pregnancy, pregnancy/puerperal and postnatal risk factors, (2) assess the genetic epidemiology using the Danish registers to aggregate the populace into pedigrees and estimate a) familiarity of PPD and PP, b) familial coaggregation of PPD with PP, MDD and BIP in first-degree relatives as well as for PP with PPD, MDD, and BIP, and c) estimate heritability and environmentality (shared and individual-specific) of PPD and PP; and (3) perform a mechanistic assessment of PPD and PP using RPS to develop a predictive model of who will develop PPD and PP and longitudinal risk of recurrent MDD and BIP. PMD are a first rank public health problem. We currently have a poor understanding of who will develop PPD or PP, and whether and how the two disorders are related. We urgently need improved understanding of the epidemiology, genetic epidemiology, and mechanisms of PPD and PP. These unique Danish population data provide the necessary sample sizes and statistical power for comprehensive longitudinal studies relevant to the mechanisms underlying PMD. Successful completion of this proposal would provide new knowledge crucial to understanding the risk factors and course of PMD that could eventually also prove to be key to understanding the etiology of mood disorders outside the perinatal period."
"9444525","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research program is to evaluate the therapeutic potential for buprenorphine and to use animal studies to support its development for depression and anxiety disorders. There is a clear medical need for new drugs that would expand the options for treating comorbid depression and anxiety, especially for the substantial number of patients' refractory to current medications. Buprenorphine is medically available and used safely for the treatment of physical dependence to opioids but has received virtually no attention for the use of psychiatric disorders in nondependent populations. As a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) partial agonist and kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist, buprenorphine has been studied extensively in models of drug reward, physical dependence, and analgesia. Recent studies highlighting the role of dynorphin in stress have shown that KOR antagonists can produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animal models. The pharmacological profile of buprenorphine as a potent MOR partial agonist and KOR antagonist supports the likelihood that buprenorphine would produce beneficial effects on stress-induced behaviors. Few published studies on the effects of buprenorphine in animal models of depression and anxiety exist to support clinical trials and development or to understand its potential mechanism of action. Taken together, these experiments will establish a basic foundation for considering the development of buprenorphine for new indications in psychiatric disorders and translate to prospective clinical treatment studies of depression and anxiety in treatment-resistant patients."
"9290785","The term overlap syndrome (OS) is used to describe the association of both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea disease (OSA) in a single Veteran. Given the high prevalence of both COPD and OSA, it is expected that a third of Veterans with OSA could be affected by OS. We demonstrated in 2 cross-sectional studies that the prevalence of OS in our Veteran population with COPD was above 44%. Importantly, Veterans with OS have a higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than either OSA or COPD-only Veterans, likely due to worse nocturnal hypoxia and subsequent inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Our preliminary data shows that serum hs-CRP levels are higher in Veterans with OS than Veterans with COPD-only. Therefore, therapy for Veterans with OS that decreases cardiovascular disease (CVD) by targeting inflammation is a high priority. Home-based exercise interventions that translate to a lifestyle with increased physical activity (PA) are an ideal strategy as 150 minutes of leisure time PA a week is associated with reduction in risk of CVD-related events and death. Further, PA decreases biomarkers of systemic inflammation (IL-6 and CRP). However, no data is available on the effect of exercise on biomarkers of systemic inflammation in Veterans with OS. It is difficult to increase the leisure time PA in adults with COPD and OSA as this population is more sedentary due to a combination of increased obesity, daytime sleepiness and dyspnea. Therefore, home-based exercise would be ideal for these Veterans. In a pilot study of 19 Veterans with COPD we demonstrated that the use of the Wii Fit program for home-based exercise was feasible and safe. The mean six-minute walk distance increased by 23 meters (p=0.01) after 12 weeks of moderate intensity exercise with the Wii Fit. Thus, adapting this exercise strategy to Veterans with OS is a novel treatment approach whose goal is durable increases in leisure time PA. Randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate that the current standard therapy for OSA, i.e. continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), alters inflammatory markers in OSA. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a single arm 12- week home-based exercise pilot intervention to determine the effect on biomarkers of systemic inflammation in 50 Veterans with OS on CPAP. We hypothesize that 1) Baseline PA intensity and duration will correlate inversely with the biomarkers of systemic inflammation independently of nocturnal hypoxia; and 2) Exercise training using a home-based computer exercise program will decrease biomarkers of systemic inflammation and increase exercise capacity in Veterans. To test these hypotheses, we will analyze measures of baseline PA intensity and duration (accelerometry) and biomarkers of systemic inflammation in Veterans with OS (AIM 1). Then the following parameters will be assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of home exercise training: a) biomarkers of systemic inflammation; b) PA intensity and duration; c) exercise capacity (AIM 2). Findings will support a future randomized exercise trial that will impact strategies to reduce CVD risk and in Veterans with OS through increased physical activity. The long-term clinical goal is to successfully implement a home exercise intervention in the routine medical care of the large Veteran population with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) with the ultimate goal of reducing their risk of CVD-related events and death through increased physical activity. This research area is a high priority given the high prevalence of OS and impact on Veterans' and general population morbidity, mortality and health-care associated costs."

The methods that we produce enable population-based analysis in numerous healthy and disease cohorts. We build upon our considerable prior progress in this competitive renewal proposal to focus our LONIR Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects on three specific areas. TR&D 1 (Image Understanding) focuses on methodological developments for the analysis of brain imagery including robust image segmentation and registration, quality assurance and evaluation of image processing results, and processing of structural and diffusion brain data. TR&D 2 (Connectomics) will advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond tensor models of diffusion for assessing fiber integrity and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools, introduce novel connectivity mapping approaches, and provide mechanisms for studying the genetics of brain connectivity. TR&D 3 (Data Interpretation) will utilize the imaging feature information extracted using tools from TR&D 1 and 2 and enable the interpretation of the resulting data, to address relevant biologically questions by providing tools for the selection of appropriate statistical models and the visual examination and interpretation of results. These research activities are tightly coupled and address the needs and requirements that have been presented to us by our Driving Biological Projects and Service Collaborators. These projects form a well-integrated program for the characterization, measurement, modeling, analysis, interpretation, and understanding of multifaceted patterns of structural and functional brain data. LONIR will facilitate studies of dynamically changing anatomical frameworks, e.g., developmental, neurodegenerative, traumatic, metastatic, by providing tools for comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of these processes. These research efforts are supported by integrated Infrastructure, Dissemination, Training and Dissemination cores."

"9282648","ABSTRACT: Integrin ?4 (ITG?4) and paxillin are essential adhesion molecules in endothelial cell (EC) focal adhesions (FAs), structures critical for mechano-sensing and the bidirectional signal transduction between the EC cyto- skeleton and the cell-matrix interface. While central for adhesion stability in response to mechanical stress and inflammatory lung injury, the mechanistic basis for dynamic FA coordination during EC barrier dysfunction and barrier restoration remains a fundamental but unresolved question. ITG?4 and paxillin exhibit unique structural and regulatory features pertinent to lung vascular barrier regulation. ITG?4 is unique from other laminin-binding integrins by the presence of the prominent long cytoplasmic domain that interacts with cytoskeletal proteins including actin and plectin, a protein link between the actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane intercellular junctions. In addition, we have generated highly novel data demonstrating that EC express several ITG?4 al- ternatively-spliced variants that appear to be involved in mechano-sensing and EC barrier regulation. Paxillin is a multi-domain adapter FA protein that recruits structural and signaling molecules to FAs in concert with cyto- skeletal rearrangement. Project #3's working model is that coordinate control of FA structures requires the dy- namic involvement of ITG?4 and paxillin as well as key PPG cytoskeletal effectors (nmMLCK, cortactin, EVL, c-Abl) to efficiently assemble functional adhesion structures during EC barrier responses (peripheral cytoskele- tal remodeling, lamellipodial formation, gap closure). We speculate that these EC responses are highly influ- enced by post-translational modifications (PTMs) and coding polymorphisms (SNPs). SA #1 will evaluate the influence of ITGB4 coding SNPs (and known pathological ectodomain SNPs) and ITG?4 PTMs in the plectln- binding cytoplasmic domain on EC barrier responses. SA #1 will also examine the influence of ITG?4 SNPs on the generation of the unique ITG?4 alternatively-spliced variants we have identified in mechanically-stressed EC as well as their contributions to EC barrier responses. Project #3 scientists have shown that paxillin partici- pates in both human lung EC barrier dysfunction as well in agonist-induced barrier enhancement. SA #2 will explore this dual role of paxillin in EC cytoskeletal rearrangement and barrier regulation and conduct in depth structure/function studies including live cell imaging of mutant fusion proteins. The influence of paxillin SNPs and c-Abl-mediated paxillin PTMs on differential paxillin interactions with critical cytoskeletal effectors and EC barrier responses will be investigated. Finally, SA #3 will test the functionality of ITGB4 and PXN coding SNPs and critical ITG?4 and paxillin PTMs in HGF- and S1P-mediated EC barrier enhancement in in vivo preclinical models of ARDS and VILI (Core C). Together with Projects #1 and #2, these studies will: i) determine the mo- lecular basis for the coordinate regulation of critical ITG?4 and paxillin structure/function regions; ii) yield im- portant insights into dynamic FA control by ITG?4, paxillin and the cytoskeleton; and thus, iii) create actionable EC barrier regulators for highly translational intervention."
"9247247","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Despite advances in medical therapy, a large number of patients with anterior infarcts remodel adversely and develop heart failure. We hypothesize that distinct changes in myofiber architecture play an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. We further hypothesize that diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) of the human heart in vivo will allow these changes to be characterized and thereby elucidate the microstructural basis for myocardial remodeling and the development of heart failure. Our group has previously developed a diffusion-encoded stimulated echo pulse sequence to perform DTI of the heart in vivo. Here we will make fundamental enhancements to the sequence to improve its speed, coverage and accuracy. We aim to perform a free-breathing DTI acquisition of the entire heart in vivo in less than 10 minutes. This will involve simultaneous multislice excitation, gradient reordering, and the use of advanced spatiotemporal registration techniques. To characterize changes in myocardial architecture, we will design novel analysis methods tailored to cardiac DTI. This will include the development of metrics for the quantification of myocardial tract and sheet architecture. We hypothesize that these measures, coupled with improvements in image acquisition, will allow subtle changes in myofiber organization to be detected and followed over time, which will help in identifying new targets for therapy. Aim 1 of the proposal will involve pulse sequence refinement to improve image quality and reduce acquisition time. In Aim 2, we will develop new techniques with which to characterize the microstructural changes seen in patients with cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). This will include metrics designed to detect the infarct, border, and remote zones, and to characterize the associated microstructural alterations. For each metric, we will determine a set of norms based on the study of healthy volunteers, and also determine the age and load dependence of the developed metric. In Aim 3, patients with recent anterior myocardial infarcts will be studied in a longitudinl fashion. Our preliminary data reveal that significant abnormalities in fiber and sheet architecture are seen in both the border and remote zones in these patients soon after infarction. We will follow these changes over time to better understand their relationship with the development of left ventricular dilation and heart failure. Completion of the study will result in the identificaton of a new panel of phenotypic biomarkers that can characterize myocardial remodeling at the microstructural level and predict the development of heart failure. These biomarkers will play an important role in the development of new therapies designed to prevent and treat heart failure, which will be of major medical and public health significance."
"9242663","Diseases associated with hyperandrogenemia and obesity profoundly impact women's health, including fertility. Ovarian dysfunction and menstrual irregularity are commonly associated with hyperandrogenemia (notably in polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS), but it remains unclear which alterations are a cause versus effect of androgen action. Recent studies suggest that obesity-related factors, such as adipokines and inflammatory cytokines, also impair ovarian function, but direct evidence from primates is limited. Based on preliminary data, and the validation of primate models (chronically testosterone, T-exposed, and western style diet, WSD-treated monkeys), longitudinal studies on peri-pubertal to young adult, female rhesus macaques are designed to test the hypothesis that hyperandrogenemia or diet alone leads to abnormalities in follicular/oocyte development and uterine structure-function, which when combined will further impair reproductive potential. The specific aims are to evaluate the effects of chronic (beginning just prior to menarche through young adulthood; years 1-4 of grant) T exposure and WSD, alone and in combination, on ovarian folliculogenesis and oocyte/embryo quality (AIM 1), plus menstrual cyclicity and uterine structure function (AIM 2); to identify the direct actions of androgen and adipokines on the primate follicle and oocyte at specific stages (preantral, small antral, preovulatory) of folliculogenesis (AIM 3); and to determine if the effects of T exposure, and/or WSD, on ovarian and uterine structure-function are reversible (AIM 4). Longitudinal studies will use circulating patterns and levels of hormones, sophisticated imaging (3-D Doppler and contrast-enhanced microbubble ultrasound, MRI) plus follicular and uterine biopsies to monitor ovarian and uterine structure-function. Ovaries will also be obtained for acute (cumulus-oocyte complexes) and longterm (3-D alginate-encapsulated follicles) studies of androgen and lipokine actions. The project group will work closely with the NHP Core, which will maintain monkeys (n=12/grp) in each of the four groups (Control, T, WSD, and T + WSD treatment), and ultimately test the fertility of treated animals, prior to evaluation of reversibility of treatment effects in year 5. We will interact with Projects I and III (primate studies) and Project IV (clinical protocols) to integrate our observations with those on macaque hypothalamus-pituitary and adipose/liver function, and to relate our findings to clinical scenarios. Important, new information will accrue on the actions of androgen and obesity-related factors on ovarian and uterine structure-function, relevant to the etiology and treatment of clinical disorders, e.g., PCOS, and associated infertility."
"9431515","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UCSC Diversity Action Plan at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a partner program with the UCSC Genome Browser, is implemented on our campus as the CBSE Research Mentoring Institute (RMI), a research education program that supports underrepresented minority (URM) students in both undergraduate and graduate (pre-doctoral) educational training that advances them toward successful careers in genomic science or its ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). The RMI improves equity and access to careers in genomic science by increasing the participation of underrepresented minority students who successfully complete degrees in genomics-related fields. Students supported by the RMI program must perform research with a faculty mentor in a genomics laboratory, or in the case of ELSI, focus on issues in genomics. The RMI provides financial support, a regular schedule of academic and professional development workshops, one-on-one coaching, and mentored research training. The program exposes students to the culture and rigors of a research environment under the close supervision of faculty mentoring, thus enhancing preparation for and success in graduate school and beyond. We recruit from regional community colleges and California State Universities that have high percentages of students from low-income and underserved populations. To ensure successful persistence to degree completion, we implement retention strategies based on best practices to create professional support and programming within a cutting-edge research environment that provides our cohort with the knowledge and tools needed to advance to meaningful careers in genomics."
"9253428","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          This resubmission is comprised of three applications (Clinical and Data Coordinating Centers (CCC, DCC) and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Core). We propose to conduct a large (N=2100) simple, superiority trial in the US and Canada - BEST - comparing best open surgery to best endovascular revascularization to prevent mortality, limb-amputation or further revascularization in a target limb with critical limb ischemia (CLI), meeting the current mandate for assessing comparative effectiveness. Trial leadership is comprised of a closely integrated and highly experienced group of investigators based at a CCC (Brigham and Women's Hospital, BWH , Boston University Medical Center, BUMC, and Massachusetts Hospital, MGH, Boston, MA), a DCC (New England Research Institutes, Inc., Watertown, MA) and an Executive Committee of experts in the field. The Health Economics Group at BWH will work closely with the DCC to address assessment of quality of life and cost-effectiveness (C-E). The trial will be conducted at approximately 120 sites in the U.S. and Canada, builds upon prior feasibility data and endeavors to address limitations of current research in this area.  Peripheral artery disease prevalence is 15-20% over 70 years, with higher rates in smokers and diabetics. In the subset with CLI, 40% require limb amputation and annual mortality exceeds 20%. With the advent of endovascular techniques for revascularization, we demonstrate from our completed surveys that there is current equipoise among practitioners with respect to best therapy in the majority of CLI cases. The BEST trial will provide, for the first time, urgently needed clinical guidance for CLI management in the context of C-E by using: a pragmatic design, including a range of established techniques; a novel primary endpoint - MALE (major adverse limb event including limb amputation or major re-intervention, bypass graft/graft revision or thrombectomy/thrombolysis) - free survival; multi-disciplinary recruitment of vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists and radiologists; and an innovative, cost-efficient C-E approach. Additional endpoints include other clinical event rates, functional status and QOL and C-E, all using standard definitions and instruments. 140 eligible centers in North America will be approached to ensure 120 are initiated and 80 sites each recruit 1 subject/month over 27 months accrual. Trial duration is 4.25 yrs - 2.25 yrs accrual and 2.0 yrs minimum follow-up. Two cohorts will be studied: All-Vein (N=1620) and Prosthetic Conduit (N=480). Within each cohort, the trial is stratified on 2 factors (4 strata): tissue loss vs. isolated rest pain and infrainguinl with/without significant infrapopliteal occlusive disease. In the All-Vein cohort, BEST has 85% power to detect an EVT vs. OPEN hazard ratio of 1.25 in the primary endpoint (MALE-free survival) with crossover rates accounted for, as well as 2% loss to follow-up. In the Prosthetic Conduit cohort, there is 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 for the primary endpoint. This resubmission fully addresses all prior reviewer concerns, to successfully and efficiently execute a trial that will provide important information for the CLI community."
"9329947","Project Summary The overall goal of this application is to determine the interplay between the liver and intestine in the regulation of fed-state metabolism with emphasis on bile acid (BA) metabolism. BAs function as physiological detergents to aid digestion of lipid nutrients but also function as signaling molecules that profoundly impact metabolism by activating nuclear and membrane BA receptors and also by mediating induction of intestinal FGF15/19 (human FGF19; mouse FGF15). BAs in excess are toxic so that their levels must be tightly controlled and the BA nuclear receptor FXR plays a key role in this regulation. Despite recent advances, the mechanisms underlying the interplay between the liver and intestine mediated by BAs and FGF15 to regulate BA levels, in particular hepatic expression of Cyp7a1, the rate-limiting BA synthetic enzyme, are not well understood. We have preliminary evidence that FGF15-mediated phosphorylation by Src of FXR plays an important role in this interplay. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that Src phosphorylation of FXR at Tyr-67 is mediated by FGF15 signaling under physiological conditions and that Y67FXR phosphorylation is important for gene-selective transcriptional regulation to reduce liver BA levels and terminate FGF15 signaling. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Examine the in vivo role of Src phosphorylation of FXR in regulating BA levels, protecting against hepatobiliary defects in normal mice and in mice challenged with biliary insults, and human relevance by examining FXR and Src and their phosphorylated forms in liver samples from primary cholestasis patients. 2) Define the function and mechanisms of FXR phosphorylation by FGF15- and BA-activated Src in the regulation of BA metabolism and 3) determine the role of FGF15-mediated phosphorylation of FXR, in coordination with PPAR?, in terminating FGF15 signaling. Multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches will be used, including genetic and virally generated mouse models and ChIP-seq genomic analysis to identify FXR binding sites globally in mice treated with FGF19. Our expertise on post-translational modifications of nuclear receptors and transcriptional regulation of BA metabolism uniquely qualifies us to address this important research question of the role of posttranslational phosphorylation of FXR in regulation of BA metabolism. Our proposal will determine the novel function and mechanisms of FGF15- induced phosphorylation of FXR, and provide new potential therapeutics and diagnostic markers for BA- and FGF15-related diseases, including cholestatic liver diseases."
"9346965","Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., resulting in over 480,000 deaths every year and costing more than $300 billion in loss of productivity. Smoking is also the leading cause of cancer and of deaths from cancer. Smoking causes cancers of the lung, larynx, mouth, bladder, liver, kidney, colon, rectum and others. While smoking rates in the U.S. have declined over recent years to 16.8%, decreases in smoking rates have been relatively slow since 1990, and the problem of relapse remains a major obstacle to reducing smoking prevalence. Only about 4% of those attempting to quit on their own and 15 to 25% of those involved in intensive cessation treatments remain abstinent as long as one year. Thus, the development of innovative and efficacious behavioral and pharmacological approaches to smoking cessation treatment remains a significant public health priority.  Tobacco quitlines are the major vehicle through which smoking cessation services are delivered in the U.S and are available in every U.S. state via a national quitline portal, 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Quitline counseling, for smokers initiating calls to quitlines, has impressive odds ratios of 1.20 to 1.66 in the latest Cochrane meta- analysis, however, the actual quit rates from the meta-analysis ranged only from 5% to 14%, or 21% when NRT was offered. Calls for new methods of improving tobacco quitline outcomes are clearly warranted.  Within the field of behavioral psychology, positive psychology has been a burgeoning area of research that may provide valuable and innovative directions for improving on behavioral smoking cessation treatments. Our investigative team recently developed and tested a smoking cessation treatment that incorporates training in positive psychology intervention strategies, which resulted in significantly higher odds of smoking abstinence across 26 weeks of follow-up compared to standard behavioral treatment. These promising findings suggest that providing tobacco quitline users with training and practice in the use of positive psychology skills during the course of their quitline engagement may increase smoking cessation outcomes relative to standard quitline use. Tobacco quitlines would derive significant benefit from such an adjunctive psychosocial approach for their clients. While issues of feasibility limit the use of this approach in a standard delivery method, its use in the form of a mobile application (app) holds significant promise.  The aims of this Phase I application are to employ user centered design processes to develop and test the acceptability and efficacy of a mobile health app, pQuit, which will incorporate intervention strategies from the field of positive psychology vs. a relaxation app, Breathe2Relax in a small randomized controlled trial of adult smokers. All participants will receive tobacco quitline counseling. The expected outcome of this project is the development of a prototype of pQuit, which can readied for Phase II testing of clinical efficacy in a future randomized controlled trial in conjunction with tobacco quitline counseling."
"9452266","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Filoviruses cause fulminant hemorrhagic fevers with a case-fatality rate of up to 90% in human outbreaks. Although filoviruses (Ebolavirus (EBOV) and Marburgvirus (MARV)) are endemic only to certain parts of central Africa and the Philippines, their extreme virulence and potential for weaponization have lead to the determination that both are high priority biothreats to US national security. Consequently, filovirus medical countermeasures have been prioritized for acquisition into the Strategic National Stockpile. While strategies for passive immunotherapy have made significant progress in the past two years, vaccination remains the most economical and technically feasible approach to protect larger groups of people from the threat of acquiring these viral diseases. The high incidence of acquired infection among healthcare workers during the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in several West African countries demonstrates the important role a vaccine could play in controlling the spread of the disease. While multiple vaccine candidates are under development, progress has been slow and a continuing need exists for alternate filovirus vaccines that meet stockpiling requirements.  The overall goal of this project is to develop a non-replicating recombinant subunit EBOV vaccine that can safely and reliably protect at-risk populations against EBOV infections. This vaccine is based on highly purified recombinant EBOV subunit proteins expressed by stably transformed Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells. A key advantage of this production system is the ability to consistently produce large quantities of pure, stable, and properly folded viral proteins. Purification by immunoaffinity chromatography is essential for the highly efficient production and is being facilitated by the use of plant-expressed monoclonal antibodies. Fine tuning of antigen dosing, immunization schedule, and adjuvant selection allow the rapid inclusion of new or modified targets into a core vaccine formulation to allow the formulation of a broadly protective vaccine in the future. This core formulation will have a safety profile only achievable with the use of highly purified subunit proteins.  This research is divided into three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, the ideal adjuvant for the EBOV GP (lead antigen) will be selected with a specific focus on achieving consistent humoral immunity in non-human primates (NHPs). Aim 2 will evaluate the ability of EBOV VP24 and VP40 antigens to enhance efficacy of the lead candidate formulation in primates as previously observed in rodent studies. This is followed by evaluation of durability of the selected final formulation. Aim 3 will be addressed concurrently with Aims 1 and 2. It will focus on detailed analysis of the humoral and cellular immune responses using conventional methods as well as the peptide-array based immunosignaturing technology. As we will have the samples from our three NHP efficacy studies, the sample size should be adequate for us to correlate challenge outcome with the immunologic readouts leading toward identification of a universal immunosignature for a protective EBOV vaccine that can be used for future clinical development."
"9439233","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UC San Diego Department of Radiology is resubmitting a competitive renewal of its postdoctoral training grant for medical residents, Training Clinical Scientists in Radiological Imaging. Following its first five-year funding cycle the department's innovative training program has met with great success. The group of trainees has begun joining academic departments to embark on their own academic careers, with excellent publication records in high impact journals, awards for their work-one for being the most cited article in Neuroimage in 2011-and having already been awarded grants to support their work and 2 NIH R01 grants to support mentor. The growing role of imaging in clinical care and biomedical research has resulted in an acute need for clinician- scientists skilled in cutting-edge imaging science. At present, there exists a talented pool of medical student applicants to academic radiology residency programs across the U.S.A. with >20 MD/PhDs and a >50 MDs that have spent >1 year of dedicate research time during medical school per year. Only a small fraction is enticed to stay in academic radiology and pursue research. The training program described in this proposal builds on the department's proven 4-year clinical training program by adding a full research year at the beginning of residency that is then built upon throughout the clinical training by spending 6 weeks of dedicated research time per year for the balance of the 4 years. Three one-year slots will be made available to applicants to the department's five-year radiology residency program. The goal is to tailor the training program to the individual needs of each applicant and to maximize trainees' research experience at UCSD. Clinical training will focus on areas of specific interest to the trainee in addition to meeting requirements for board certification. The clinical years will be consecutive to maximize trainees' learning; however, trainees will maintain contact with their research mentors throughout their stay at UCSD. The mentorship provided by each laboratory leader during trainees' research year and by the clinical scientist throughout the five-year residency will link their research and clinical experiences and provide them a model for future careers as clinical scientists. In addition to research opportunities and career mentorship, the program includes specialized lectures tailored to the needs of each trainee and workshop specific to academic radiologists. A Match Program-offered integrated training program focusing on the career of clinical scientists ensures equal access to all applicants and allows us to engage residents early in their training, resulting in committed, well-trained clinical scientists. UCSD is well suited to train the next generation of imaging scientists. For this proposal, we have assembled 16 Radiology and 8 non-radiology mentors that together have trained over 300 trainees in the past 10 years, have over 110 active grants and $70M in grant support and their trainees have published nearly 700 papers most of which is in high impact journals."
"9323737","Summary Infants have a high incidence of severe infections and low immune responses to vaccines. HIV-exposed uninfected infants (HEUs) have even higher incidence of severe infections, hospitalizations and death than HIV-unexposed uninfected infants (HUUs) and lower responses to vaccines. We hypothesized that the global immune dysfunction of HEUs results from excessive Tregs that develop in response to 1) a highly inflammatory in utero environment of HIV-infected pregnant women and 2) infant gut dysbiosis. These hypotheses will be addressed in the following Specific Aims: AIM 1. To measure the proportions of Tregs in HEUs and HUUs during the 1st year of life and to identify correlations between the abundance of Tregs and decreased immune responses to live vaccines. This will be accomplished by comparing the Treg subsets at birth, 6 months and 1 year of life of 100 HEUs and 100 HUUs from Soweto, South Africa, and by correlating the frequency of dominant Treg subsets (measured by flow cytometry) with the cellular immune responses to BCG vaccine (measured by ELISPOT) and with their antibody responses to measles vaccine (measured by ELISA). Both vaccines are live attenuated and therefore generate immune responses that mimic the responses to wild type infections. AIM 2. To identify differences in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota between HEUs and HUUs, which are associated with Treg subsets and their responses to vaccines. The gut microbiota have a prominent and well-established effect on the development of the immune system and on Tregs in particular. We will compare the microbiomes of HEUs and HUUs by high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and will investigate correlations with Treg subsets and immune responses to vaccines. AIM 3. To compare the HEU and HUU epigenetic profiles critical for Treg differentiation and function. Taking advantage that there are known key sites whose methylation status determines Treg differentiation, we will compare these regions in HEUs and HUUs. The completion of these Aims will open the possibility of indirectly educating the neonate immune system by modulating the infant and/or maternal gut microbiomes and/or by designing vaccines resistant to Tregs."
"9267554","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pennsylvania (Penn), in collaboration with the University of Botswana and the Ministry of Health, submits this application to train a small cadre of Batswana health professionals in HIV clinical research. Studies will address issues in treatment of HIV disease and co-infections in HIV- infected adults and children, treatment of malignancies and aging-related non-communicable diseases HIV infected adults, complications of HIV-exposure in uninfected children, and risk reduction in highly exposed uninfected women. This program will act as a catalytic agent to establish an extended research group in Botswana to address some of its pressing health problems identified by the Botswana Ministry of Health and which are consonant with the agendas of both Fogarty and PEPFAR. This proposal includes a close working relationship with the large Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Penn, which will enable the new research unit in Botswana to function at a highly professional level from its establishment. Training. The training will have tw pathways. (1) Independent Investigator training. Batswana trainees will enroll in Penn's Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) of which the first year will be spent on coursework at Penn and the second year on a research project in Botswana. The program aims to take 8 trainees over the 5-year program. Trainees will be paired with epidemiology and biostatistics mentors, and Botswana-based clinical and research experts to create an ideal environment for both their intellectual development and practical hand-on application of principles in the pursuit of new knowledge. These trainees will ultimately form the core of an extended research group, which will take the quality and quantity of clinical HIV research emanating from the University of Botswana and the Ministry of Health to a new level. (2) Associate Investigator training. This pathway will provide a series of 1- to 5-day modules to be conducted in Botswana, for health administrators, health clinicians, and research coordinators. The goal is to build in- country capacity to conduct locally driven investigation by empowering Associate Investigators to join collaborative teams led by the Independent Investigator trainees in their current and future research projects. These teams will be strengthened by an innovative teach-back approach in which the projects are used as training examples for the Independent Investigators to implement teaching skills and the Associate Investigator trainees to be become more intellectually vested in the projects. Institutional participation. The proposed training program will involve three key institutions in Botswana: the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Botswana, the Ministry of Health of Botswana, and the Botswana-UPenn Partnership. Investigators will leverage ongoing federally funded projects at the Botswana- UPenn Partnership to accelerate the pace of the development of their own research programs. Independent Investigators will take positions at either the University of Botswana or the Ministry of Health, where they will be guaranteed supported time to conduct research projects, and will form the nucleus of an extended group dedicated to research on HIV and associated diseases clinical research."
"9387319","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular targets for vitreoretinopathy and uveitis (intraocular inflammation) are poorly understood. This proposal builds on our exciting discovery of a calcium-activated protease, CAPN5 (calpain-5), as the cause of Autosomal Dominant Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV), and that CAPN5 processes PDGFB signaling. CAPN5 is the first nonsyndromic uveitis gene, and makes possible a highly innovative molecular-genetic approach for mechanism-based therapies for inflammation induced by photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptors express CAPN5, and an hCAPN5-R243L gain of function mutation in mice shows all the phenotypes of human ADNIV disease. The retina photoreceptors might be particularly sensitive to mutations in CAPN5, because high intracellular calcium is necessary and sufficient to regulate dark adaptation in photoreceptors. Our long-term goals are to find better and more specific treatments for inflammatory vitreoretinopathy. Our objective is to use in vitro and in vivo cell culture and mouse models to determine the mechanisms responsible for controlling activity of CAPN5. We will also investigate how uncontrolled CAPN5 activity leads to aberrant signaling of one of its substrates, platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB), and how this signaling results in the subsequent ADNIV phenotypes. Our central hypothesis is that an uncontrolled, calcium-activated CAPN5 pathway leads to ADNIV retinal degeneration and uveitis through aberrant PDGFB signaling. By creating a new mouse model we will be able to identify new therapeutic targets. Our specific aims are to (1) Dissect the ADNIV CAPN5 autoproteolysis effect in cells, (2) Determine if ADNIV CAPN5 hyperactively cleaves PDGFB to upregulate signaling, and (3) Test if PDGFB loss rescues the ADNIV phenotype in a preclinical mouse model. Impact. We expect to gain not only a better understanding of calpain activity and the role PDGFB plays in eye disease, but also to identify new therapeutic targets that may be applicable to many eye diseases. Our work should help determine the role of PDGFB signaling in ADNIV and other vitreoretinal degenerative diseases."
"9215254","Project Summary/Abstract The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however only a moderate number of the hundreds of genes and genomic regions thought to be involved in ASD have been identified. Advances have come largely from the study of rare genetic variants, especially de novo varia- tion, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), insertion/deletions (indels), copy number variation (CNV), and larger chromosomal imbalances. A portion of the progress for ASD has come through the efforts of the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC), which represents a coordinated effort by more than 40 independent groups to rapidly identify ASD risk genes. Here we propose to continue the work of the ASC, largely by continued pro- duction and analysis of sequence data from ASD subjects and their families. The ASC benefits from substan- tial leveraging of resources, including the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) centered at the Broad Insti- tute (BI) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) of ASC samples, supported by an NHGRI Center Grant to BI, to make this renewal as low cost as possible. We also plan new avenues of research, such as integrating whole genome sequence (WGS) data and building on ideas that have emerged from the study of common variants to understand the interplay of common and rare variants to impact risk. Through this new research we will accel- erate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Moreover, such variants have direct implications for patients and their families in terms of etiological diagnosis, genetic counseling and pa- tient care. Our central hypothesis ? formulated based on results over the past decade ? is that rare and com- mon variation contributes additively to risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific Aims: 1) Produce and/or analyze WES of 30,000 new ASD subjects, parents and other controls, for a total of more than 50,000 samples; 2) Develop and apply approaches to find ?hidden? risk variants, and, 3) Use results from common and rare variant studies to describe the interplay of such variation in ASD risk. This contribution is significant because it represents the first step in research to understand pathogenesis of ASD and to the development of pharmacological strategies for treat- ment of core symptoms of ASD and etiologically related neurodevelopmental disorders. The research pro- posed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identify- ing risk variants and for integrating rare and common variation. This is a new and substantively different ap- proach to gene discovery in ASD that departs significantly from the status quo and provides the means to achieve these important goals."
"9274471","ABSTRACT Darkfield imaging enables detection of unlabeled materials in tissues. The system we are requesting, a CytoViva Hyperspectral Microscopy system, combines proprietary darkfield microscope optics with hyperspectral detection to allow imaging, mapping and characterization of nanoscale materials (particles, viruses, bacteria) in tissues and cells. Darkfield imaging that is coupled with hyperspectral imaging, allows verification of the object through a characteristic spectral profile. The proprietary condenser increases the resolution over standard darkfield. The hyperspectral aspect of this system can also be used to understand histologic staining co- localization. Over the past 10 years, the UC Davis Cellular and Molecular Imaging Core (CAMI) has combined excellence in microscopy and fluorescence with complete sample preparation capabilities to serve over 90 UC Davis user laboratories. This is an established, shared facility resource that is supported with a fee for use (re-charge). The capabilities of the CytoViva system are needed by the co-investigators on this application. These major and minor users will use this instrument to study how nanomaterials interact with tissues and cells, to monitor bioavailability and composition of nanotherapeutics, to study the biology of inflammatory cells and to understand subtle shifts in toxicologic pathology and pathogen responses. This instrument does not duplicate existing instrumentation on our campus. Additional capability that will be supplied with this instrument includes fluorescence to allow colocalization of fluorescent signals with the hyperspectral image as is required by our users. The robust image analysis software included with this system allows spectral identification of nanoscale objects in a wide range of environments based on wavelength, scatter intensity, and scatter spatial properties. Most importantly, the image analysis software enables identification of nanoscale objects in the spectral image based on peak wavelength allowing standard histologic approaches to be used. This provides an important intermediate analysis capability as an alternative to EM or Raman spectroscopy for sample analysis and offers significant benefits to users in terms of lower cost and faster throughput. CAMI staff will provide training and consulting on imaging projects involving the CytoViva system and placement of this instrument in our core facility is a logical complement to our current capabilities which include excellence in sample preparation. This equipment will increase the impact of NIH funded research at UC Davis.          "
"9240396","Prestin, a motor protein serves as the cochlear amplifier contributing towards the sensitivity of the mammalian inner ear. Moreover, prestin expressed in heterologous systems yields functional characteristics that are not consistent with the bona-fide OHC properties, raising the possibility that there are missing prestin- interacting proteins that should be identified to understand the mechanisms of this remarkable motor protein. Using innovative genetic, molecular, cellular, and functional imaging strategies, we have invoke this hypothesis. In contrast to the dogma that prestin is uniquely OHC-specific, we hypothesize that the authentic cochlear amplifier consists of prestin and its family member, SLC26A6. We further hypothesize that SLC26A6 is required as an efficient transporter to create intracellular Cl- microdomain for the proper function of prestin.  To test the hypothesis, we propose the following three aims: 1) To test the spatial expression and co- localization of prestin and slc26a6 in OHCs. First, we will determine the expression and co-localization of prestin and slc26a6 in OHCs using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM). Prestin-/- and slc26a6-/- mice will serve as negative controls. 2) To test for the physical interaction or the hetero-oligomerization of prestin and slc26a6. To directly test for possible physical interaction or co-assembly between prestin and SLC26A6, we will use co- immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques. 3) To determine the in vitro and in vivo functional roles of the interaction or hetero-oligomerization of prestin and slc26a6. We will record the anion exchange activities and the nonlinear capacitance of the co-expressed prestin and slc26a6. We will design prestin-slc26a6 chimera constructs to further test for function interaction of the two proteins. Finally, we will test the prediction that in the absence of slc26a6, the motor functions of prestin will be severely altered, compromising the hearing sensitivity of slc26a6 null mutant mice.  These studies will reveal a missing functional component of the cochlear amplifier and may divulge a new therapeutic target for the treatment of hearing loss or deafness. The outcomes of these studies will alter our present understanding of the functional mechanisms of prestin in OHCs, and would shift the paradigm from ?prestin-centric? towards orchestral proteins that operate to amplify sound in the inner ear."
"9087184","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risk taking underlies many behavioral and health problems that contribute to the public health burden during the adolescent period. Recent advances in developmental neuroscience have identified key neurobiological underpinnings of adolescent risk taking, but there is little understanding of how these neural processes interact with key social processes in order to promote or prevent risk taking. This is an important limitation given that adolescence is a period marked by increasingly complex social development, and adolescent decision making most often occurs under conditions of socio-emotional arousal. Thus, the time is ripe to examine how social contexts shape the neurobiology of adolescent risk taking. This study will examine how three important social influences - family, peers, and authority - shape neurocognitive development. Adolescents will complete two tasks during a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan during which social influence is manipulated. The data generated should reveal how brain function is modulated by social contexts during this important period of development. In order to understand whether changes in neural activation represent risk or protection for adolescent risk taking, a key aim is of the proposed research is to examine how brain changes co-vary with relevant behavioral changes over time. By connecting key social and developmental processes to the neurobiology of risk taking over time, this project has the potential to challenge and shift current research and unambiguously inform the model of adolescent brain development. A more nuanced understanding of how social contexts differentially modulate neurocognitive development and risk taking will help us to understand the situations that may hinder or promote successful decision-making, creating vulnerabilities or protection for risky behavior. By shedding light on the neural mechanisms supporting these linkages, findings from the proposed study may be useful in intervening with youth at risk for emotional, behavioral, or social difficulties. Relatedy, by investigating such processes as youth transition through puberty, project findings may highlight this developmental period as an effective point of entry for prevention and intervention efforts in deflecting upward trajectories of risk taking and problem behavior."
"9285799","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fish is a major protein source and a primary source of nutrients such as long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which are essential for maternal and fetal health. All fish also contain methylmercury (MeHg), a known neurotoxicant at high levels of exposure as demonstrated by accidental poisonings in Japan and Iraq. However, despite many years of research, there is still substantial uncertainty regarding the safety of eating fish with natural background levels of MeHg during pregnancy. Identifying the potential reasons for this uncertainty is important, as limited understanding of factors influencing MeHg toxicity represents a challenge for promulgating public policies on fish consumption. Our studies in the Republic of Seychelles have revealed that the association between prenatal MeHg exposure from maternal fish consumption and child developmental outcomes is far more complex than previously anticipated, and likely involve concomitant dietary exposures and genetic factors influencing MeHg toxicity. To examine these complex relationships, we enrolled a cohort of 1,536 mother-child pairs and characterized them for prenatal MeHg exposure, maternal nutritional status, and developmental outcomes at 20 months of age. Further, we examined the modifying role of genetic factors on MeHg metabolism and toxicity in our human cohort and in a Drosophila model. While we continue to find that MeHg does not influence neurodevelopmental outcomes independent of nutritional status, our epidemiological and experimental genetics findings support a novel biological framework that describes the role of GSH-dependent pathways and inflammation in MeHg toxicity. We plan to examine this framework, and will continue both developmental follow-up of the children and the exploration of nutritional and genetic components. We aim to evaluate how prenatal nutritional factors affecting inflammation, and genetic factors affecting GSH-dependent pathways influence associations between prenatal MeHg exposure and developmental outcomes. We hypothesize that the association between prenatal MeHg exposure from fish consumption and developmental outcomes is largely influenced by endogenous protective metabolic pathways (toxicokinetics) and exogenous dietary factors (toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics). We will re-examine the children at seven years of age for developmental outcomes, and will draw upon stored blood samples from both mothers and child's cord to investigate additional genetic factors involved in MeHg toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, and measure inflammatory biomarkers as indicators of the role of the maternal inflammatory milieu in modifying MeHg toxicity. We plan to use experimental genetic studies to confirm the associations observed in our cohort and generate new hypotheses that can then be studied with an epidemiologic approach. Our approach will address novel hypotheses that should bring clarity to the interpretation of previous cohort studies, but also assist public policy makers in crafting advice to women of child-bearing age regarding the safety of consuming fish during pregnancy."
"9249127","Project Summary/Abstract Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a mutation in exon 1 of the gene for Huntingtin (HTT). The mutant protein (mHTT), which contains an expanded stretch of glutamine residues (polyQ), is responsible for all HD manifestations, including dysfunction and degeneration of neurons. The overall goal of this Project is the discovery and development of effective treatments for HD. The Project is informed by evidence that mHTT is a client protein of the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC and that TRiC overexpression prevents or rescues mHTT- induced phenotypes in model systems. In particular, we have shown that individual TRiC subunits (CCTs), as well as the soluble apical portion of CCT1 (ApiCCT1), reverse deficits in BDNF trafficking and signaling in BACHD neurons in vitro. Project 2 will decipher whether or not TRiC and TRiC-derived proteins (hereafter, TRiC reagents) act in vitro to prevent dysfunction and degeneration of cortical and striatal neurons from the BACHD model. Our hypothesis is that that increasing the levels of TRiC or TRiC-derived reagents will abrogate and/or reverse mHTT- linked pathogenesis. We propose four Aims to examine in vitro quantitative and temporal features of HD pathogenesis. In Aim 1 we will further define deficits in axonal trafficking and signaling of BDNF in the BACHD model in vitro; we will confirm and further explore the ability of TRiC-derived reagents to prevent or reverse deficits. We will begin with reagents proven effective (CCT3, 5 and Apical CCT1) and test reagents coming from Project 1. In Aim 2, we will define deficits in BACHD neuron phenotypes: synapse formation, synaptic connectivity, gene expression, structure of neuronal somas and processes, mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis. The timing of and possible progression of deficits will be defined and the impact of TRiC reagents explored. In Aim 3, we will define deficits in proteostasis in BACHD neurons examining clearance of mHTT that may involve protein folding, ER stress, and the UPS and autophagy/lysosome pathways. Whether introduction of TRiC reagents prevent and/or reverse changes will be examined. In Aim 4, we will examine iPSC-differentiated neurons from HD patients to determine whether deficits defined in Aim1-3 are detected and, if so, determine whether they are TRiC reagent-responsive. Project 2 is expected to enhance considerably understanding of HD pathogenesis and to define a novel approach to potential treatment. It is possible that TRiC and TRiC-inspired approaches may elucidate pathogenesis and treatment of other neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and ALS."
"9250228","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request support for 6 summer veterinary research fellowships at Wake Forest School of Medicine, as part of a multi-level training program in comparative medicine and research. The national shortage of veterinary scientists in biomedical research is well documented in terms of vacant veterinary research positions and unmet collaborative needs. This shortage has resulted in deficits in the quality of research findings and lost productivity among researchers using animals. Correcting the dearth of veterinary researchers requires education of veterinary students regarding research methods and opportunities and the unique value of their professional skills. Early exposure to research during veterinary school is the most promising strategy.  Therefore, the proposed summer research program seeks to expose veterinary students to biomedical research through practical experience. Objectives are (1) To provide a structured summer research experience at Wake Forest School of Medicine; (2) to teach students in the program the basic elements of hypothesis-driven research, grant-writing, and data analysis; (3) to provide training in ethics and professionalism in research; and (4) to provide the students with experience in oral and written presentation of scientific findings.  Training will be principally accomplished by one-on-one mentoring through completion of a research project  guided by a senior researcher chosen from a pool of 28 program faculty (including 11 veterinarians) in diverse  fields including pathology, comparative medicine, developmental psychology, behavior, substance abuse,  surgery, physiology/pharmacology, neurobiology, rheumatology/immunology, hypertension, cardiovascular  disease, diabetes, nutrition, cancer, radiation countermeasures, and reproductive  medicine/obstetrics/gynecology/women's health. Students will also participate in a dedicated short course in research survival skills, and in ongoing seminars and journal clubs in the Section on Comparative Medicine.  Students will write a research proposal and a final report of their findings, and will be encouraged to present their findings nationally and to publish. This program will provide opportunities for original scientific thought, ethical reflection, and acquisition of critical skills, in a setting uniquely supportive of veterinarians as independent researchers."

This will be achieved at the University of Virginia (UVA) by a fitness  support group for teen girls and their families and in the surrounding communities with educational exercise  programs for children at after-school and summer programs. These programs will encourage an interest in  exercise, enhance understanding of the physiology of puberty, develop appreciation for how exercise  reduces the risks of metabolic complications related to excess weight (especially PCOS), and encourage  interest in human sciences. A webpage supporting these programs will reinforce information provided to  families.  Second, it will update local and regional medical providers and students about PCOS-related medical  care and ongoing clinical research. Continuing medical education seminars will inform local/regional primary  medical providers and endocrine/adolescent specialists about recent advances in PCOS care. A tab on our  website for medical providers will serve as a clinical resource and provide contact information for referring  patients for subspecialty care or to participate in clinical research. Seminars and summer research  opportunities will engage undergraduate/graduate biology and medical students in PCOS research.  Third, it will inform the lay public about the problem of PCOS and the risks of excess weight to  reproductive health.

"9264603","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study objective is to establish the efficacy of isradipine 10 mg daily to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) disability. This is a companion application to that of Kevin Biglan, MD, from the University of Rochester entitled Data Coordination Center for STEADY-PD3.  PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease that affects 1% of the population above the age 65. The principal motor symptoms of PD are attributable to the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Recent data demonstrated that the selective vulnerability of these neurons may be due to the reliance of these neurons on L-type Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels and, more importantly for PD, that blocking these channels with israpadine, a dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonist, protects these neurons in in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinsonism. Recent epidemiological data also points to a reduced risk of PD with chronic use of dihydropyridines.  Isradipine is an approved agent for the treatment of hypertension. Our Phase II clinical studies have found that isradipine is safe and tolerable at the daily dose of 10 mg or below in participants with early PD. Isradipine penetrates the blood brain barrier and 10 mg daily dose achieves serum concentrations within the range found to be neuroprotective in animal models of PD.  Based on these observations we propose to conduct a 36 month Phase 3 parallel group placebo controlled study of efficacy of isradipine 10mg daily versus placebo to slow the progression of PD disability in 336 participants with early PD. The study will include interim futility analysis thus eliminating the need to complete a standalone futility study. The proposed study is designed to address two specific aims. First, to establish the efficacy of isradipine 10 mg daily to slow the progression of PD disability as measured by the change in the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part I-III score over 36 months. Second, to ascertain effect of isradipine 10 mg daily on the progression of PD over 36 months as measured by a number of clinically meaningful and widely accepted measures of progression of disability in early PD including:1) Time to initiation and dose utilization of dopaminergic therapy; 2) Time to onset of dopaminergic motor complications; 3) Change in non-motor disability; Exploratory measures will include global measures of functional disability, quality of life, the change in the ambulatory capacity (sum of 5 UPDRS items: falling, freezing, walking, gait, postural stability) and cognitive function.  The proposed study design represents a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of a novel therapy to slow progression of PD disability and to determine if efficacy if such exists is associated with clinically meaningful benefits. The simple study design reflecting real life scenario and availability of low cost generic isradipine will facilitate the translatio of the study results, if positive, into a meaningful clinical application."
"9278866","Abstract  Pluripotent stem cells can give rise to all cell types in the body and have therefore enormous potential for  regenerative medicine, and provide a powerful tool for studies in developmental biology and pharmacology.  Advances in transforming somatic cells directly into pluripotent (induced pluripotent stem: iPS) cells provide an  attractive avenue for generating large numbers of customized stem cells. Notable progress has been made to  efficiently generate iPS cells, including integration-free lines, however, detailed mechanistic insights regarding  the establishment, subsequent maintenance and efficient exit from pluripotency are still lacking.  Over the past four years our program project team has made significant contributions towards a better  understanding of these (Smith et al. Nature 2012,14; Ziller et al. Nature 2013,14; Gifford et al. Cell 2013;  Tsankov et al. Nature 2015; Liao et al. Nature Genetics 2015; Cacchiarelli et al Cell in 2015 and more). As  would be expected the results have helped pinpoint areas that need further experimentation and also  presented us with a new set of lingering questions that are central to our understanding of human pluripotency.  Our aims in the framework of the larger program project (past and future) will provide crucial insights towards  this end and as a result will have a broad impact on the fields of human reprogramming and pluripotency.  Over the next years, we will apply a complex, recently engineered DNMT1 knockout/inducible rescue human  ES cell line to address fundamental questions in human stem cell biology with a focus on the naïve versus  primed states. We will apply the latest advances in single cell technology and analysis to gain unprecedented  insights into the biology of human pluripotency. Lastly, we will use our recently developed and characterized  human secondary reprogramming system to define and study one of the most critical points (the final  transition) in the reprogramming process that is also the least understood."
"9221371","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a fatal, progressive adult-onset disease characterized by autonomic and motor dysfunction with widespread CNS demyelination. We have previously shown that ADLD is caused by duplications of the lamin b1 gene and that increased expression of lamin B1 underlies the disease process. In eukaryotic cells, lamin B1 is a major constituent of the nuclear lamina, a fibrous meshwork adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. The nuclear lamina maintains the structural integrity of the nucleus and has roles in essential cellular processes including transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, and epigenetic regulation. We have recently demonstrated that transgenic (TG) mice with oligodendrocyte specific over-expression of lamin B1 exhibit severe vacuolar demyelination of the spinal cord that result in age dependent degenerative phenotypes reminiscent of ADLD. TG spinal cords showed dramatic reductions in the expression of multiple genes responsible for lipid synthesis, including the critical lipogenic transcription factors, SREBP1 and 2. This was accompanied by global increases in the repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in spinal cord oligodendrocytes. As myelin is made up of ~70% lipids, defects of lipid synthesis can result in severe demyelination. Consistent with our gene expression data, we observed a significant reduction of myelin enriched lipids that were specific to the spinal cord white matter. Our results identify lipid synthesis defects as a major component of the demyelination caused by lamin B1 over-expression and suggests a novel link between lamin B1 and lipid metabolism. While lipid dysregulation provides a cogent framework for explaining the demyelination observed in the transgenic mice, the mechanisms linking lamin B1 over-expression and lipid synthesis in oligodendrocytes are unknown and this proposal aims at identifying these pathways. We will test the hypothesis that lamin B1 modulates repressive histone marks to down regulate expression of specific target genes and examine whether lamin B1 over expression in oligodendrocytes results in the dysregulation of specific pathways that may impact oligodendrocyte function. We will also determine how modulating lamin B1 levels impacts the disease phenotype. The experiments that we have proposed will elucidate mechanisms linking lamin B1 over-expression, lipid dysregulation and the demyelination phenotype, results that will be critical in the identification of therapeutic pathways for ADLD. In addition, they will also provide insights into the basic biology of oligodendrocyte function that may help in understanding other common demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis."
"9284069","Abstract Humans and animals can sense and respond to aversive experiences of others, an ability crucial for empathy, social bonding and important for survival. Here we study how neural circuits in the brain produce observational fear, a behavior of one subject displaying fearful responses to the observation of another subject in fear. Previous behavioral and human imaging studies have revealed a powerful influence of prior aversive experience on this behavior and have also identified several brain areas involved. However, what neuronal activity patterns in vivo allow one subject to subjectively perceive the others? experiences as aversive remains mysterious. Given the strong influence of prior experience on observational fear, we propose a hypothesis that the subjective sense of fear upon observation is represented by neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but strongly influenced by a particular neuronal activity pattern in the hippocampus (HP), called awake replay, that recalls prior fearful experiences. We will test the hypothesis by simultaneous recording of a large number of single neurons in ACC and HP in rats during observational fear tasks. We will first determine how HP awake replay and the associated ACC activity patterns are correlated with behavioral measures of observational fear and how they are generated within the HP and ACC neural circuits. Second, we will determine how key factors related to prior experience modulate the ACC/HP activity patterns underlying observational fear. In particular, we will study the effects of recency, valence, spatial and social contexts of prior experience. Finally, we will determine how the ACC/HP activity patterns are causally related to observational fear by disrupting these patterns and then examining its impacts on behavioral measures. The outcomes of this study will significantly advance our understanding of neural circuit computations in observational fear and may reveal a specific in vivo neural mechanism of how it can be produced by recalling prior fearful experiences. This study may open the door to understand antisocial symptoms in mental disorders such as antisocial personality disorder and schizophrenia and may inspire novel therapeutic strategies. 1   "
"9248355","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in protein kinase with-no-lysine (K) 4 (WNK4) are associated with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), a hereditary form of hypertension. WNK4 is an integrative regulator of renal electrolyte transporters that are involved in blood pressure regulation. Accumulating evidence indicates that WNK4 is a key component of a phosphorylation cascade that links the activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to electrolyte transport in the kidney. However, the angiotensin II/aldosterone-responsive elements in WNK4 and the aldosterone-responsive regulation of WNK4 stability remain unclear. The long-term goal is to understand renal electrolyte transport physiology via analyzing how mutations in electrolyte transporters and their regulators cause disordered electrolyte homeostasis, so that therapeutic strategies could be developed for relevant disorders of both rare and common causes. The objective in this application is to identify the mechanisms for the activation of WNK4 kinase and for the regulation of WNK4 stability by angiotensin II and/or aldosterone. The preliminary studies indicate that a regulatory domain in WNK4 harbors calmodulin binding and phosphorylation sites. This domain inhibits WNK4 kinase activity and the calmodulin binding site is required for this action. Mimicking phosphorylation in this domain abolishes the inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the stability of WNK4 protein is robustly regulated by Kelch-like 3 (KLHL3), an ubiquitin E3 ligase component mutated in PHAII. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PHAII mutations in both WNK4 and KLHL3 result in elevated WNK4 activity. Mutations in WNK4 elevate specific kinase activity/protein abundance and those in KLHL3 raise WNK4 protein abundance. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) Determine the regulation of WNK4 kinase activity by the regulatory domain of WNK4; and 2) Determine the regulation of WNK4 protein stability by the ubiquitin E3 ligase containing KLHL3. In Aim 1, the regulation of WNK4 kinase activity by calmodulin and by phosphorylation will be assessed using in vitro and in vivo assays, and the interaction surfaces of the regulatory domain with calmodulin and the kinase domain will be determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In Aim 2, the KLHL3-recognition motif at WNK4 C-terminal region will be determined. In addition, the effects of PHAII mutations in KLHL3 will be assessed biochemically and in knock-in mouse model. The responsiveness of KLHL3 to aldosterone will be determined in animals. The mechanisms for WNK4 kinase activation and protein stability regulation are significant, because they are essential for WNK4 to respond to physiological signals. Dysfunction of these mechanisms results in PHAII. Elucidating these mechanisms paves the way to new interventions for hypertension. The interaction surface information of the regulatory domain is crucial for developing small molecule inhibitors of WNK4 as research tools and potentially as new antihypertensive drugs."

AG04 localizes to spermatocyte nuclei during meiotic prophase 1, specifically at sites of asynapsis and in the transcriptionally silenced XY sub-domain, the sex body, a result that is exciting given the usually cytoplasmic location ofthe Argonaute proteins. We generated Ago4 knockout mice and showed that Ago4-/- spermatogonia initiate meiosis early, resulting from premature induction of retinoic acid-response genes. During prophase I, the sex body assembles incorrectly in Ago4-/- mice, leading to disrupted meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) associated with a dramatic loss of microRNAs from meiotic cells. Loss of MSCI results in apoptosis due to expression of Y-linked genes that are toxic to spermatocytes. However, expression analysis reveals that AG03 may at least partially compensate for the loss of Ago4, leading us to hypothesize thatAG03 and AG04 co-operate to regulate key events In mammalian meiosis. The goal of these studies is to further elucidate these roles in meiotic initiation and in meiotic silencing, and to understand further the redundancy that exists between these two Argonautes in these processes. The three specific aims are: (1) To generate and characterize the germ cell phenotype of Ago3.Ago4 mutant mice and to compare germ cell phenotypes between single and double mutant animals, (2) To explore the roles of AG03 and AG04 in meiotic initiation, and (3) To elucidate the role of Argonautes and their RNA cargoes in MSCI and in other meiotic silencing events including meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC). Taken together, these studies will provide the first fully integrated view of how different Argonautes function in the testis to promote proper meiotic entry and to ensure meiotic silencing during prophase 1."
"9282644","ABSTRACT: The Pre-Clinical Models of Acute Lung Injury Core (Core C) is designed to provide PPG investigators with rigorously defined and reproducible murine models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). The Core will advance three principal objectives with the first objective to provide a complete range of expertise, training, equipment, and data analysis tools to extensively study and characterize the role of cytoskeleton in preclinical models of murine lung injury. We will employ the state-of- the-art techniques to a) characterize the role of cytoskeleton in regulating lung endothelial cell barrier function, b) determine the effects of specific interventions in order to provide insight into the efficacy and mechanisms of novel therapeutic strategies, and c) facilitate the translation of basic research to clinical interventions. Toward this ultimate aim, the Core will first provide validated quantitative measurements of vascular permeability and inflammation. The second objective is to house and care for the genetically-engineered mice utilized in this PPG and to generate novel transgenic and knockout mice (e.g., inducible endothelium conditional knockout mice). The third objective is to examine selective siRNAs or pharmacological agonists or antagonists for cytoskeletal proteins as potential therapeutic strategies and approaches for ARDS and VILI models. The fourth objective will be to provide rigorously performed, protocol-driven performance of specific experimental strategies involving LPS and VILI preclinical models of ARDS/VILI as well as S1P and HGF rescue interventions. The last objective will be to evaluate the function of ARDS-associated SNPs and sites of functional protein post-translational modification (PTM), utilizing mutated cDNA (high efficiency expression plasmids) targeting the lung endothelium (with ACE antibody conjugated liposome) in the endothelial conditional knockout mice. As a centralized and functional core, Core C will perform all mice-related work across all three projects of this program, including generating new strains, breeding and housing of mice, generating preclinical ARDS/VILI models, accessing therapeutic effects of siRNAs and chemicals, performing lung inflammation assessment, and providing tissue samples to individual projects for specific assays (including immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis). In addition to its own space and equipment, the Core will have full access to and will utilize resources available at the University of Arizona shared facilities including the Genetically Engineered Mouse Models Core (GEMM) and the Small Animal Medical Imaging Service (SAMIS) Facility."
"9257202","The five-year relative survival rate of cancer patients has improved from 50 to 68% in the last thirty years. The survival rate of pediatric cancers has reached 80%, and the NCI predicts that 1 out of every 250 adults will be a survivor of childhood cancer by 2015. As the number of cancer survivors increases, so does the concern for their quality of life post-treatment. One of the most serious problems associated with radiation and chemotherapy is the off-target effect on germ cells. For young women, this is a particularly serious concern because the immature oocytes that comprise the ovarian reserve are highly sensitive to chemo/radiation therapies. Since the ovarian reserve represents ALL the follicles available for future fertility as well as endocrine function, the loss of immature oocytes and subsequent sex steroid deficiency have significant physical and psychological consequences. The goal of this project is to better understand the mechanisms associated with survival and death of immature oocytes caused by cancer treatments, and in doing so, identify neo-adjuvant medical approaches for preserving fully functional ovaries in young women undergoing treatment. A recent breakthrough discovery by Gonfloni et al. demonstrated that the ovarian reserve could be protected against the chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin, by co-administration of kinase inhibitor imafinib mesylate. Although its precise mechanism was not demonstrated, their study suggested that cisplatin-induced oocyte death was mediated by p63, a member of the p53 transcription factor family. Additionally, it was proposed that imatinib mesylate rescued oocytes from apoptosis by blocking activation of p63 by c-Abl. Our preliminary studies of p63-null oocytes confirmed the essential role of p63 in cisplatin induced death of oocytes. In addition, our studies suggested that the gene dosage of p53 and p63 determines the death/survival of oocytes. Moreover, p73, another member of the p53 family, was also highly expressed in oocytes undergoing apoptosis in response to cisplatin. Therefore, the overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the balance between survival and death of oocytes in primordial and primary follicles is controlled by the interaction between p53 family members, and thus the p53 family members are targets for fertoprotective agents. To develop safe and effective fertoprotective therapies, it is essential to elucidate the mechanism through which p53 family members are activated by chemotherapy. To advance our understanding, we have developed an assay system that consists of in vitro culture and subrenal grafting of mouse ovaries. We will dissect the molecular pathways involved in the death of immature oocytes by applying this assay system to genetically engineered mouse models. The results of these proposed studies will be critically important for understanding the mechanisms that underlie physiologic and iatrogenic follicle death and may reveal new strategies for protecting the fertility of young women diagnosed with cancer."
"9244671","Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons form the final common central pathway regulating fertility.  Properly patterned GnRH release is absolutely required for fertility, but is often disrupted in women with  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS affects - 8% of women. In most women with PCOS, there is a  persistent high frequency of LH release reflecting high frequency GnRH release. Prenatally androgenized  (PNA) mice have neuroendocrine phenotypes similar to women with PCOS, including increased GnRH  neuron activity, allowing mechanisms of this increase to be studied. PCOS is being detected at younger  ages, suggesting the antecedents of this disorder may be developmentally programmed. The neurobiological  changes underlying increased GnRH activity in this disorder and when during development changes occur  are largely unknown. The working hypothesis is that GnRH neuron activity during the prepubertal period is  critical for attracting appropriate afferent inputs and that alterations in GnRH neuron activity during this time  period that are induced by PNA alter the adult wiring and function of the GnRH neuronal circuitry. We will  test this hypothesis in two aims using state-of-the-art electrophysiology, defined animal models, and cell-targeted  genetic tools to elucidate the molecular and physiologic changes that occur. Aim 1 will characterize  postnatal development of the GnRH neuronal network and the effects of prenatal androgen exposure. Aim 2  will determine the role of GnRH neuron activity before puberty in establishing the adult network. Preliminary  data indicate that GnRH neuron action potential firing and GnRH release are increased during the juvenile  period in PNA vs. control mice. Neuronal activity during development is important for establishing  appropriate synaptic interactions. Consistent with this, there is increased fast synaptic input to GnRH  neurons at two weeks of age in PNA mice. We will characterize the normal development of GnRH neuron  activity, release, pattern of fast synaptic input, response to inhibitory and excitatory neuromodulators, and  pituitary responsiveness. We will then manipulate GnRH neuron activity in vivo during the neonatal/juvenile  period by targeting inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to  GnRH neurons using cre-lox technology to determine the role of GnRH neuron activity in establishing these  parameters. To complement the electrophysiology studies, we have adapted an innovative method for celltype-  specific translating mRNA enrichment to examine the molecular underpinnings of the functional  changes observed in PNA mice at the level of the GnRH neuron."
"9234422","ABSTRACT  Pediatric dysphagia, or difficulties with feeding and swallowing, is associated with many developmental  disorders; however, the underlying causes remain poorly characterized. Consequently, at present there are no  strategies to prevent feeding and swallowing defects. In this proposal, we will examine the potential of maternal  nutrition during pregnancy to prevent pediatric dysphagia in the LgDel mouse model of 22q11 deletion  syndrome (22q11DS). Our preliminary data suggest that pediatric dysphagia in newborn LgDel mice is due, at  least in part, to abnormal development of the hindbrain and cranial nerves (CNs). Furthermore, we show that  development of these structures in LgDel embryos is sensitive to exposure to the maternal dietary factor  vitamin A (VA) and its active metabolite retinoic acid (RA). Thus, we will test the hypothesis that altered  levels of vitamin A and other micronutrients in the maternal diet can prevent dysphagia by correcting  underlying abnormal hindbrain, CN, and/or craniofacial development. To test this hypothesis, we will  establish optimal protocols for modifying VA levels in the maternal diet to reduce the severity of pediatric  dysphagia, identify the targets of altered RA exposure resulting in reduced phenotypic severity, and elucidate  the molecular mechanisms that underlie this new prevention strategy. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the  relationship between maternal intake of VA and fetal RA levels. We will then ask if maternal exposures that are  benign for WT animals correct key feeding and swallowing phenotypes in dysphagic postnatal LgDel pups. In  Specific Aim 2, we will define the developmental mechanisms, including those discovered in PROJECT 2,  that are modulated by modified maternal VA intake. Thus we will better define the causal relationship between  developmental disruption and feeding and swallowing difficulties. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate the  effect of maternal nutrition on the expression or activity of 2 22q11DS candidate genes: Ranpb1 and Tbx1. We  will characterize dysphagia-related phenotypes in Ranbp1 mutants, assess the interaction of this mutation with  Tbx1, and determine the effect of altered VA/RA exposure. Together these experiments will define how  developmental and molecular mechanisms underlying pediatric dysphagia during embryonic development can  be exploited to prevent the disorder. Most importantly, these studies will provide a foundation for using an  established strategy for optimal prenatal care?modified maternal nutrition?to prevent pediatric dysphagia in  at risk pregnancies."
"9303375","ANIMAL MODELS FACILITIES CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Animals continue to be important models for the study of molecular mechanisms of complex biological processes related to environmental exposures. The AMFC provides and maintains genetically engineered mice that are increasingly being generated to model specific aspects of human diseases and have proven to be extremely valuable in examining how genetic alterations interact with environmental chemicals and microorganisms to induce disease. Having personnel with this expertise as well as centralized laboratory equipment will provide critically important resources for the CEHS. The overall objective of the Animal Models Facilities Core (AMFC) is to provide Center members with state-of-the-art pathology support, transgenic resources and a centrally managed AAALAC-accredited animal resource and surgical facility. The Core is staffed with experienced personnel and is equipped with essential equipment to generate genetically engineered mice, rederive imported mice by embryo transfer rederivation, provide colony management, utilize gnotobiotic technology, develop surgical models and prepare and interpret tissue samples by histological and immunohistochemistry analysis. The CEHS will continue to rely heavily on animal models, particularly genetically engineered mice (GEM). The models being used by Center members will require extensive characterization of their tissue phenotypes. Both the technical aspects of obtaining excellent quality sections and expertise in the identification of pathological changes are essential for the discovery of meaningful genetic and epigenetic changes that are responsible for the development of lesions. Unfortunately, this histopathologic expertise is not always available to biomedical research groups and, when absent, can lead to the misinterpretation of data. Under the direction of Professor Fox, who is boarded in laboratory animal medicine with 40 years? experience, and an additional five boarded DVMs and two board certified veterinary pathologists and a fully staffed diagnostic and histology laboratory, the AMFC will provide essential transgenic, embryo transfer derivation, colony management, germ free technology, histology, pathology and clinopathologic services that will enhance the research programs of Center members."
"9258477","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is central to the pathogenesis of chronic respiratory diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, asthma and COPD. While much emphasis has been placed on studying individual cell types and how they interact with the ECM, comparatively little attention has focused on how homeostatic maintenance of the ECM is coordinated amongst multiple lung resident cell types, and how cell interactions in the setting of injury or disease either restore homeostasis or generate pathological matrix remodeling. A major limitation preventing investigation of these crucial cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions is the absence of experimentally tractable multicellular culture systems which incorporate 3D matrices capable of long-term remodeling. Another major limitation stems from the limited number, availability, proliferative capacity, and phenotypic stability of primary human cells, which are a critical resource if we are to elucidate the normal homeostatic and pathological matrix remodeling processes that underlie human health and disease. Our goal in this proposal is to develop a cell culture model system that (1) facilitates long-term culture study of homeostatic and pathologic matrix remodeling under the control of multiple interacting primary lung cell types; (2) enables repeated non-destructive imaging and sampling to identify cellular and soluble cues that correlate with, and ultimately predict, the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions underlying matri remodeling; and (3) provides a platform for studying primary human cells in small quantities as a step toward enhanced phenotypic fidelity and personalized medicine. These design goals will be met through two interrelated specific aims. In Aim 1 we will develop and optimize a microfluidic system and culture conditions permitting stable, long-term co-culture of lung epi/endothelium and extracellular matrix-embedded fibroblasts. We will evaluate multiple physiologic metrics of ECM and tissue remodeling in co-culture, and evaluate their sensitivity and signal to noise ratio using culture conditions known to promote matrix/tissue remodeling in vivo (e.g. TGF-beta stimulation). In Aim 2 we will incorporate primary human cells into the microfluidic co-culture system as a step toward personalized medicine, therapeutic prioritization, and biologic discovery. We will use approved and failed anti-fibrosis therapies to assess the predictive capacity of this system as proof of concept. To capitalize on the discovery capabilities of the system, we will collect matrix compartment fluid samples for proteomic analysis to identify novel candidate mediators differentially expressed during matrix remodeling. This project will generate a new experimental platform that enables repeated real-time analysis of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during matrix remodeling, a process central to the pathogenesis of multiple respiratory diseases. Incorporation of primary human cells with low or no passaging into the platform will enhance the biofidelity of experiments and offer a unique resource for personalized medicine, therapeutic evaluation and biologic discovery in the realm of lung matrix remodeling."
"9327188","PROJECT SUMMARY Much work has been done examining the critical role of chronic early life stress (e.g. adolescent social isolation) on psychiatric disorders and addiction in adulthood. Our lab has developed a model of adolescent social isolation (aSI) which engenders robust increases in a wide range of behaviors that have been linked with increased vulnerability to alcohol addiction, including increases in anxiety-like behaviors and ethanol intake and preference. We have shown that aSI also results in a hyper-excitable basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain region heavily implicated in anxiety and motivated behaviors. Investigation by other groups suggests that the BLA and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are critical components of a network that regulates reinforcement and reinstatement of drug seeking and drug taking. In fact, modulation of BLA-NAc synapses has recently been shown to bi-directionally regulate motivated behaviors. Moreover, we have shown that the NAc, following aSI, shows disruption in catecholamine signaling. Thus, this proposal, for the first time, will examine the BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), in a model of chronic early life stress. Our central hypothesis is that chronic early life stress leads to increased excitability in the BLA-NAc circuit and that this adaptation contributes to the ?addiction vulnerable? phenotype engendered by this model. In Aim 1, we will employ electrophysiological and optogenetic techniques to test the hypothesis that aSI strengthens BLA- NAc glutamatergic synaptic function and disrupts addiction-related plasticity. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that aSI disruption of BLA-NAc glutamatergic synapses contributes to the escalation in ethanol intake observed following this chronic early life stressor. We will use chemogenetics to manipulate this circuit, as well as an operant ethanol self-administration task. Collectively, these studies may shed new light on the specific neural circuits through which early life stress heightens risk of alcohol misuse in life and potentially identify novel targets for the development of more effective therapies for alcohol use disorder."
"9414144","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AA) with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have higher prevalence of diabetes, poorer metabolic control and greater risk for complications and death compared to White Americans. Self-management interventions that include diabetes education and skills training are effective at improving metabolic control in diabetes. Recent findings indicate that patients with diabetes, especially ethnic minority patients, prefer telephone-delivered diabetes education to group visits or internet-based education. Preliminary data from our group suggest that a culturally-tailored telephone-delivered diabetes education and skills training intervention is an effective strategy to improve metabolic control in AA patients with T2DM. Use of telephone contact, video- conferencing, PDAs and web-based systems offer new opportunities to bridge the gap in support for diabetic patients between face to face visits with their health care providers. The FORA system is an inexpensive, off- the-shelf, state-of-the-art technology whereby a person/caregiver and a provider can communicate accurately on data needed for self-management of diabetes. The system is comprised of an easy to operate 2-in-1 Blood Glucose and Blood Pressure monitor that uploads results to a secure website via a modem. The provider (in this case a diabetes educator) can review the glucose and blood pressure readings weekly and use the data to tailor diabetes education and self-care skills training using motivational enhancement techniques to achieve optimal metabolic control. However, no large RCT has tested whether providing feedback to patients using novel technology like the FORA 2-in-1 Blood Glucose and Blood Pressure monitor leads to improvements in glycemic and blood pressure control or whether using the feedback to tailor and augment diabetes education and skills training are effective at improving metabolic control. We propose a randomized controlled study to test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention using the FORA system in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The long-term goal of the project is to identify effective strategies to improve metabolic control and hence reduce diabetes complication and mortality rates in AAs with T2DM."

An interdisciplinary, translational program is designed to discern between the effects of excess androgen exposure and metabolic changes due to a typical Western-style diet (WSD, high fat and fructose content) on: (1) the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary-reproductive tract axis, as well as adipose tissue; (2) the impact on fertility; and (3) if the treatment effects are reversible. Three research projects ue the nonhuman primate model, and one project focuses on the specific population of lean women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).  Project I, Metabolic and Neuroendocrine Responses to Hyperandrogenemia and Diet, is directed by J. Cameron, via a consortium with the University of Pittsburgh and K. Grove at ONPRC. Project II, Ovarian and Uterine Structure-Function: Influence of Androgen and Diet, is a collaboration between R. Stouffer and     O. Slayden, ONPRC. Project III, Effects of Androgen and Diet on Adipose Function, involves C. Roberts and colleagues at ONPRC. Project IV, Androgen Excess as a Mechanism for Adipogenic Dysfunction in PCOS Women, incorporates a consortium with clinical experts (D. Dumesic, G. Chazenbalk) at the University of California, Los Angeles. Projects l-lll will be supported by a nonhuman primate (NHP) Core (O. Slayden, Supervisor) operating as a closed resource. This Core will maintain four treatment groups of young, female rhesus monkeys (controls, testosterone or T-treated, WSD-treated, and T + WSD) for four years, culminating in a fertility trial. In Year 05, reversibility of T and WSD actions will be examined. In addition, the Administrative Core (R. Stouffer, P.I.), and Outreach Core (D. Gordon and M. Zelinski) will promote interactions within and among SCCPIR Centers and increase public awareness and understanding of reproductive health research. Important, new information will accrue on the actions of androgen and diet-related factors, individually and in combination, relevant to the etiology and treatment of fertility disorders, such as PCOS."

"9303693","ABSTRACT Cisplatin is one of the most widely used anticancer agents, including for the treatment of solid tumors in children and adults. The clinical use of cisplatin is associated with dose-limiting damage to renal tubular cells (nephrotoxicity), which occurs in up to 40% of patients despite intensive prophylactic measures, as well as with toxicity to cochlea (ototoxicity) and peripheral nerves (neurotoxicity), and these complications may limit further treatment or even threaten life. There is currently no known specific treatment for cisplatin-induced toxicities, and mechanistic details of these side effects remain poorly understood. We have recently found that the ability of platinum chemotherapeutics to cause damage to healthy tissues cells is dependent on organic cation transporters (OCT) and, for renal tubular cells, organic anion transporters (OAT) as well. In mice, these processes were found to be regulated by the two pairs of closely related transporters, Oct1/Oct2 that regulate cellular uptake of cisplatin, and Oat1/Oat3 that regulate renal uptake of a cisplatin mercapturic acid metabolite that acts as a precursor of a potent nephrotoxin. We found that the function of these 4 transporters can be potently inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib, through non-competitive mechanisms. In the current proposal, we outline three sets of related studies that will further test and refine the validity of our central hypothesis that targeted inhibition of OCT and OAT function with nilotinib will specifically affect accumulation of cisplatin in healthy target tissues and affect its downstream toxic effects: (i) Using various in vitro and in vivo models, including zebrafish and mice, we will further determine the qualitative and quantitative effects of nilotinib on the function of Oct1/Oct2 and Oat1/Oat3; (ii) Studies in zebrafish and mice with or without specific transporters and kinases of interest will determine the direct contribution of these proteins to cisplatin-related toxicity, including nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity, as well as drug disposition properties and drug- drug interaction potentials; (iii) Using mice with or without human tumor xenografts derived from replicating cell lines or patient tumors, we will determine the direct contribution of these proteins to cisplatin-related anticancer efficacy, and the in vivo effects of nilotinib on this phenotype. The demonstration of reduced cisplatin-induced toxicity through inhibition of critical transporters regulating access of the drug to healthy tissues will provide the foundation for additional studies in the future aimed at ameliorating this agent's debilitating side effects in routine clinical practice."
"9241352","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Merosin Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene and loss of laminin-?2 protein. MDC1A patients exhibit severe muscle weakness from birth, are confined to a wheelchair, require ventilator assistance to breathe and have reduced life expectancy. There is currently no effective treatment or cure for MDC1A and all affected children will die from this genetic disease unless treatments are soon discovered. Laminin-?2 is required for the formation of heterotrimeric laminin-211 (?2, ß1, ?1 ) and laminin-221 (?2, ß1, ?1) which are major constituents of skeletal and cardiac muscle basal lamina. Laminin-111 (?2, ß1, ?1 ) is the predominant laminin isoform in embryonic skeletal muscle and supports normal skeletal muscle development in laminin-?2 deficient muscle but is absent from adult skeletal muscle. We have recently shown that mouse laminin-111 protein can be systemically delivered to the muscle of laminin-?2 deficient mice to prevent muscle pathology, maintain muscle strength and dramatically increase life expectancy. These findings demonstrate that laminin- 111 is a highly potent therapeutic in the dyW-/- mouse model of MDC1A. At the time of diagnosis, children with MDC1A have developed significant muscle disease and it is unclear if laminin-111 protein therapy is effective at preventing disease progression after it has already started. This proposal will investigate if laminin-111 protein therapy can prevent disease progression after onset, determine if recombinant human laminin-111 can prevent muscle disease and investigate the mechanism of protection conferred by laminin-111 protein treatment. We will test the hypothesis that laminin-111 protein can functionally substitute for laminin- 211 and serve as an effective therapeutic for MDC1A. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims. First we will determine if laminin-111 prevents further muscle damage after disease onset, preserves muscle function and improves survival in the dyW-/- mouse model of MDC1A. Second we will determine if transgenic expression of human laminin-111, recombinant human laminin-111 or recombinant human laminin-211 improves preclinical outcomes in the dyW-/- mouse model of MDC1A. Finally we will determine scalability of laminin-111 protein therapy and define the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in mouse and dog models. Results from this study will pave the way towards developing laminin-111 protein therapy as a novel therapeutic for MDC1A."

"9231507","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of this study is to understand molecular mechanisms regulating astrocyte function in the injured CNS. Astrocytes encompass a complex and heterogeneous population of cells in the mammalian CNS with diverse functional properties. Prominent among these are their roles as essential components of the nervous system response to trauma, playing both neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective roles that serve to defend the CNS and restore homeostasis. Following nervous system injury or disease, astrocytes undergo a broad array of morphological, biochemical, and physiological changes collectively referred to as reactive astrogliosis. Despite their historical characterization as impediments to CNS regeneration and functional recovery, reactive astrocytes are gaining increasing recognition for their neuroprotective functions that include limiting inflammation and subsequent secondary damage. Indeed, astrocytes are emerging as targets for developing novel therapies aimed at treating the injured or diseased CNS. However critical gaps remain in our understanding of how reactive astrocytes achieve such diversity of function. Recently, a subpopulation of astrocytes in the healthy, adult brain has been identified that expresses the transcription factor, Gli1, indicating high and active Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Pharmacological studies point to a neuroprotective role for Shh in the injured CNS. However, the precise mechanisms by which Shh promotes neuroprotection, and whether those mechanisms are mediated by astrocytes, remain poorly understood. This study uses mouse molecular genetics to perform direct interrogations of the role of Shh signaling in reactive astrocytes and gliosis. Gli1 astrocytes will be marked and identified, and reactive gliosis will subsequently be triggered using a unilateral forebrain stab injury. Whether reactive Gli1 astrocytes exhibit specific cellular properties distinct from Gli1-negative astrocytes will be examined. To interrogate the functional significance of Shh activity in reactive gliosis, a targete molecular ablation approach will be used to examine how gliosis is impaired. Finally, transcriptional profiling of physiological and reactive Gli1 astrocytes will be performed in order o identify gene expression programs that are directly regulated by Shh signaling. Collectively, these studies will provide novel insight into the role of Shh signaling in the multifaceted cellula activities of reactive astrocytes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that distinguish the multiple roles and functional properties of reactive astrocytes is an important step towards understanding how to promote their neuroprotective roles, while attenuating their neuroinflammatory functions."
"9302502","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Subfertility, defined as delayed time-to-conception, affects an estimated 12% of women of reproductive age. The use of fertility-enhancing therapies, including assisted reproductive technologies (ART), has risen steadily in the United States due to several factors, including childbearing at older maternal ages and increasing insurance coverage. Prior studies of women's and children's health after ART have been limited by small sample sizes, non-US populations, or ART treatments performed more than a decade ago, and the lack of appropriate control groups. An important understudied area is that of non-ART fertility treatments and the perinatal, infant, and child health outcomes of these pregnancies. Our original pair of grants was the first population-based analysis of women's and children's health after ART to be conducted in the US. These studies, which had the unique strength of including a non-ART-treated subfertility comparison group, yielded a series of analyses suggesting that underlying subfertility, rather than the treatment modality, is the foundation for most maternal and child morbidity. In this renewal, we will expand this understanding through increased information on subfertility-related diagnoses, underlying non-subfertility medical conditions, non-ART treatment parameters, and outcome measures present in the All Payers Claims Database, as well as inclusion of new information on fathers. We will evaluate the health of mothers during pregnancy and for five years post-delivery, and their children through age four. The study population will include all Massachusetts women who delivered pregnancies between 2004 and 2011 (our original birth cohort) and their children, and will add study subjects who delivered between 2012 and 2017.

"9305367","Project Summary:  Future tactics for restoration of hearing or balance disorders in humans may target developmental signaling to reactivate progenitor character in native cells or utilize directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to produce transplantable sensory cells or tissues. These approaches will involve the generation of cellular states with characteristics similar to the prosensory progenitors that give rise to auditory and vestibular sensory organs during embryogenesis. A barrier faced here is our lack of information regarding the transcriptional programs that specify early otic progenitors toward vestibular vs. auditory and prosensory vs. non-sensory fates. Goals for this project include discovery of genetic mechanisms of auditory and vestibular prosensory specification and comparative systems-level evaluation of transcriptional programs active in in vitro generated otic sensory cells. These efforts will support the candidate's long-term objective of producing auditory or vestibular organ-specific progenitors in vitro and eventual bioengineering of transplantable organs.  Specific aims for achieving the stated goals include: 1) transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of auditory and vestibular sensory cells and prosensory progenitors, 2) functional testing of regulatory mechanisms of auditory and vestibular prosensory genes, and 3) transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of in vitro generated otic sensory cells. Innovations in research design include: novel Fbxo2 knock-in reporter mice and ES cell lines for specific otic sensory lineage delineation in live cells, the use of a combination of recombinase-editable transgenic mouse models and explant organ culture for regulatory element testing, and the application of recently developed advances in RNA-seq and ATAC-seq for transcriptional and epigenomic analysis at the single cell level.  Accomplishing the above specific aims will uncover mechanisms behind key fate decisions that lead to formation of auditory and vestibular organs and provide a direct comparison to in vitro generated otic organoid cells. The candidate is well suited to the project, with expertise in inner ear development and gene regulation and a strong record of training and past research accomplishments. The scientific environment for the mentored phase of this project, the Department of Otolaryngology at Stanford University School of Medicine, provides strong resources and collaboration opportunities to contribute to the projects success. This ECR R21 funding will support the candidate's transition to independence and generate papers and preliminary data for a first RO1. Future work in the candidate's lab will build upon this topic with parallel studies in mouse and ES cell models to investigate lineage specification, fate determination, and sensory organ bioengineering. This proposal represents a first step in what the candidate is confident will be a long journey of substantial contribution to science within the mission of the NIDCD."
"9253106","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Morbidity and mortality secondary to cardiovascular disease is the major health problem in obese patients. Obese patients are burdened with an array of metabolic dysfunctions associated with excess weight which drive the cardiovascular disease evident in this population. While this correlation is well-established, mechanistic links that could be exploited therapeutically are largely lacking. In preliminary studies for this proposal, we have made two major observations that shed significant new light on this issue. The first is that loss of metabolic control in skeletal muscle appears to be the key trigger for vascular injury in obesity. Correction of rapid glucose disposal by deletion of genes that limit insulin signaling or muscle growth appear to restore endothelial function in vitro and may underpin cardiovascular defects systemically. The second observation is the NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1) is a major culprit in vascular defects in obesity. Nox1 is overexpressed in large and small vessels from obese mice and appears driven by glucose excess, potentially via upregulation of galectin-3. In the current proposal, we will rigorously test these concepts in three aims. The firs aim will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques in vitro to determine the signaling mechanisms by which changes in the plasma milieu, specifically glucose, induce changes in Nox expression and superoxide production with specific emphasis on the role of galectin-3. The second aim will generate novel Nox1 and Galectin-3 KO mice on a genetically obese background to test the hypothesis that these two oxidant pathways contribute to vascular dysfunction in vitro with a specific emphasis on determining whether improving metabolism by increasing muscle mass obviates pro oxidant pathways. The third aim will pursue these concepts in vivo, testing whether increased muscle mass or blocking the Nox1/Galectin-3 signaling axis improves cardiovascular outcomes like blood pressure and vascular adaptions to hemodynamic stress. Taken together, these studies will provide new information on the mechanisms, mediators and physiologic impact of obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction. Successful completion of these aims may identify new targets to aid in the treatment of some the most pressing clinical outcomes of obesity."
"9362915","This proposal is for the purchase of a Hysitron TI950 TriboIndenter/Raman Spectroscopy System, which will add nanoscale materials science capabilities (e.g., nanoindentation, nanofabrication) and high resolution Raman Spectroscopy capabilities (e.g., chemical composition, mineral/crystal isoforms) to our present instrumentation?providing a significant improvement in our ability to measure physical and chemical properties of organs, tissues, cells, compounds, implants, and engineered materials. The laboratories interested in this piece of equipment are involved in a wide range of funded research programs, including bone metabolism, orthopaedics, cancer biology, diabetes, and obesity. With the Hysitron TI950 system, we will be able to measure true material properties of mineralized and soft tissues directly, without the need to estimate parameters based on macro-level tests that have flawed translation to the nano-scale. In addition, the particular instrument we are requesting has the capability to collect Raman spectra and nanoindentation-derived mechanical properties from the same micro-moeity, which will significantly improve the quality of experiments and measurements that we take, and at the same time, will usher in a multitude of new lines of investigation and collaboration that we currently do not enjoy. There are numerous VA-funded investigators at the Indianapolis VA that would benefit greatly from acquisition of the Hysitron TI950 system, including Drs. Robling (osteoporosis/mechano- transduction), Allen (osteoporosis/anti-resorptives), Moe (chronic kidney disease), Bellido (osteoporosis/hormone signaling), Roodman (multiple myeloma), Nakshatri (sarcopenia/cachexia), Chirgwin (myeloma/osteocytes), and March (adipose-derived stem cells). Moreover, the system would allow each of these VA investigators to expand their research programs and begin initiating new collaborations with the large biomedical engineering community on the IU Indianapolis campus, who have expressed significant interest in the system.  "
"9284760","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3?6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6?8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, ?note bloat?, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites."
"9325165","Project Abstract: Brain metabolism must accommodate a wide dynamic range of energy demands from time to time and from cell type to cell type. Although the metabolic response to increased brain activity is the basis of well-known functional MRI signals, the nature of this metabolic response is still very controversial. It has been demonstrated that metabolism plays a key regulatory role in several neurological conditions, including epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about the mechanisms coupling neuronal excitability to metabolism, though the main metabolic pathways have been well established for decades now. The study of real-time dynamics of brain metabolism has been hampered by the insufficient spatial and temporal resolution of the methods, but such limitations can now be overcome by the use of genetically- encoded fluorescent biosensors. I will use a combination of sensors to determine glucose consumption as well as the NADH/NAD+ and ATP/ADP ratios, respectively. These sensors can give calibrated quantitative readouts within intact brain tissue, by using two-photon microscopy with either ratiometric or fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). The Ca2+ indicator RCaMP1h and electrophysiologic recordings will provide me with a readout of neuronal activity. Hippocampal CA3 neurons can be excited synaptically (which also engages astrocytes) or antidromically. The proposed research combines the use of fluorescent glucose, ATP, NADH and Ca2+ biosensors with advanced electrophysiological and optical 2-photon imaging techniques to study the energy metabolism of neurons and astrocytes in brain slices. Aim 1 is to characterize the dynamics of glucose and NADH and ATP levels in the astrocytes and neurons (both glutamatergic and GABAergic) in hippocampal slices during resting and active states. This work will also explore the glycolytic contribution to the neuronal activity-induced acceleration of energy metabolism. Aim 2 is to determine the mechanisms linking the neuronal activity to an increased metabolism, both the triggering stimuli (Na+, K+ and Ca2+ fluxes) and subsequent signaling (such as ionotropic or G-protein coupled receptors and protein kinases)."

There are no controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trials to compare the efficacy and tolerability of currently available treatments of ESE. This and the accompanying Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) application describe the ESE treatment trial (ESETT), which is designed to determine the most effective and/or the least effective treatment of ESE among patients older than two years by comparing three arms: fosphenytoin (FOS), levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA). This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Bayesian adaptive, Phase III comparative effectiveness trial. Up to 795 patients will be randomized initially 1:1:1 and response-adaptive randomization will occur after 300 patients have been recruited. Randomization will be stratified by three age groups, 2-18, 19-65, and 66 years and older. The primary outcome measure is cessation of clinical seizure activity and improving mental status, without serious adverse effects or further intervention at 60 min after administration of study drug. Each subject will be followed until discharge or 30 days from enrollment. This trial will include interim analyses for early success and futility. This trial wil be considered a success if the probability that a treatment is the most effective is greater than 0.975 or the probability that a treatment is the least effective is greater than 0.975 for any treatment. This will be the first phase III clinical trial of ESE in children and adults."

"9270095","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Parkinson's disease (PD), degeneration of dopaminergic neurons leads to symptoms including slowness of movement, rigidity, tremor, and gait abnormality. The dopamine (DA) precursor levodopa (L-DOPA) dramatically alleviates motor symptoms, but can cause side effects such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) after prolonged treatment, thereby limiting its therapeutic use. A critical mediator of motor deficit in PD and excessive movement in LID is the striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which form the sole output of the striatum and receive DA input under normal conditions. The lack of DA input in PD, and the excessive, non-physiological DA input after chronic L-DOPA leads to abnormal MSN function and contribute to slowness of movement and LID respectively. The classical model of basal ganglia (BG) proposes that MSNs can be divided into two segregated pathways: i) D1-MSNs, which express dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) and form the direct pathway, targeting only the output nuclei of BG; ii) D2-MSNs, which express D2 receptors (D2Rs) and form the indirect pathway, targeting the output nuclei of BG indirectly via the external globus pallidus (GPe). However, subsequent anatomical studies found that axons from D1-MSNs form collaterals that also project to the GPe. These bridging collaterals thus allow D1-MSNs to influence the targets of both direct and indirect pathway. We recently found that the terminal density of these bridging collaterals is highly plastic and changes in response to alterations in DA signaling. D-1MSN bridging collateral is reduced by chronic D2R blockade but is almost doubled by D2R overexpression. Importantly, changes in bridging collateral density dramatically alter D1-MSN's influence on motor output. While optogenetic stimulation of D1-MSNs normally increases locomotor behavior, increasing bridging collaterals by D2R overexpression caused the same stimulation to inhibit locomotor behavior. This motor inhibition was reversed back to motor activation by normalizing bridging collateral terminal density via chronic D2R blockade. Experiments proposed here will test the hypothesis that bridging collaterals are also altered by abnormal DA signaling in PD and LID. We will use transgenic mice that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the Drd1a promoter, which allows the axonal projections of D1-MSNs to be visualized by immunohistochemistry against GFP. The terminal density of D1- MSN bridging collateral can therefore be determined by GFP staining intensity in the GPe. DA denervation by 6-hydroxydopamine will be used to induce hemi-parkinsonism. Limb-use bias will be used to assess akinesia, and LID will be induced by chronic L-DOPA treatment. We propose that DA depletion will progressively reduce bridging collateral terminal density, and that it would parallel the progressive ability of a D1R agonist to reverse akinesia. Furthermore, we propose that chronic L-DOPA treatment, which causes increases in LID severity, will be associated with further alterations in the terminal density of bridging collaterals. The identification of abnormal bridging collateral changes in PD will justify future development of therapy to reverse these changes."
"9290952","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis. Over 170 million people worldwide suffer from T2DM and the prevalence of this disease is steadily rising; indicating that new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease are sorely needed. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a tandem zinc finger protein that binds to AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of target mRNA molecules, and promotes their degradation. Several lines of evidence have suggested a link between TTP and metabolic processes. First, TTP is an insulin-responsive gene and its reduced expression has been linked to metabolic syndrome and insulin-resistance in humans. Second, deletion of the yeast homolog of TTP, Cth1/2p, has been shown to increase mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative metabolism. Lastly, our recent results show that TTP mRNA and protein levels are reduced in livers of diabetic mice, and that liver-specific deletion of TTP increases systemic glucose sensitivity in a mouse model of obesity-induced diabetes. We have also identified two targets of TTP involved in glucose oxidation whose expression increases in TTP knock-out primary hepatocytes; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase - E2 subunit (PDC-E2), which converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA for subsequent use in the TCA cycle, and Lipoic Acid Synthase (LIAS), the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of lipoic acid (LA). Coordinated regulation of LIAS and PDC-E2 is crucial as LA is a required cofactor for PDC-E2 function. My central hypothesis is that insulin stimulated expression of TTP reduces hepatic glucose utilization by modulating the levels of PDC-E2 and LIAS and that loss of TTP in the liver protects against the development of DM through its effects on the levels of these proteins and glucose metabolism. I will test this hypothesis in two specific  aims. In Aim 1, I will determine whether TTP regulates hepatic glucose metabolism through a PDC-dependent pathway and through its role in the biosynthesis of LA. In Aim 2, I will determine whether a reduction in hepatic TTP expression is protective against the development of diabetes due to its effects on hepatic glucose utilization. These lines of investigation are the  first to look at the role of an mRNA binding protein that causes mRNA degradation in the regulation of liver metabolism and promise to advance our knowledge of the role of TTP in regulating cellular metabolism. These studies may potentially lead to the development of novel therapies for disorders of glucose metabolism, such as DM."
"9254202","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ninety percent of those diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women, with peak incidence between the ages of 15 and 45, when women are most hormonally active. Despite significant research effort, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain unclear. Our laboratory previously backcrossed estrogen receptor alpha knockout (ER?KO) mice onto the NZM2410 lupus prone background. We demonstrated that female NZM/ER?KO mice had significantly less renal disease and significantly prolonged survival compared to WT littermates despite similar serum autoantibodies and glomerular immune complex deposition. ER?KO mice are not ER? null, but rather express an N-terminally truncated ER?. They have physiologic deficiencies including infertility due to disruption of a critical activation domain (AF-1). We showed that dendritic cell (DCs) from NZM/ER?KO mice have a blunted inflammatory response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. When these mice were ovariectomized, the protective phenotype was lost. Upon estradiol-repletion, protection was restored. True ER? null mice are not protected, suggesting that estrogen in the presence of the AF-1 mutant confers protection, rather than the absence of the full-length ER?66. Interestingly, the truncated ER? expressed in the ER?KO animal is structurally similar to ER?46, an endogenous ER? splice variant that lacks the AF-1 domain, and is a negative regulator of gene transcription. ER?46 has an identical DNA binding domain to ER?66 and is a powerful inhibitor of ER?66. We hypothesize that ER?46 expression has a protective effect in lupus. The goal of this project is to determine the role of ER?46 in SLE and TLR-induced inflammation and to improve our understanding of ER?-mediated transcription in the setting of inflammation. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Cunningham will (1) Define the in vitro molecular mechanisms underlying ER?46- and ER?66-regulated transcriptional activity impacting the innate inflammatory response of murine DCs, (2) Determine ex vivo and in vivo the role of ER?46 in TLR-induced lupus utilizing a murine strain expressing an A/B truncation mutant of ER? (ER?AF10), and (3) Use human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived DCs to define the role of ER?46 and ER?66 in regulation of the innate immune response in DCs from controls vs. lupus patients. Dr. Cunningham is a clinician-investigator with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent basic and translational researcher in the field of immunology with a focus on SLE. To facilitate her transition to independence, she seeks to further her training in dendritic cell biology, ChIPseq and bioinformatics, and the use of human cells from patient samples. Dr. Cunningham has a mentorship team with an outstanding mentoring track record and wide expertise to support her project. The studies proposed in this K08 mentored grant application will significantly advance the field by providing understanding of ER?-mediated transcription in the setting of TLR-induced inflammation, including ER? binding partners, gene targets, and modulation by ER?46, which represents a potential therapeutic agent."
"9251322","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remains a critical need for improved methods for in vivo cell tracking of stem cells delivered to infarcted myocardium as a means of regenerative therapy. In this application we propose to develop and compare two different PET-based cell tracking approaches. The first uses direct labeling of cardiopoietic mesenchymal stem cells (CMSCs) with positron-emitter 89Zr that has a 3.3 d half-life that is well-matched for in vivo monitoring of labeled cell dispositions by PET over periods of 2-3 weeks. We have developed a novel 2-step procedure for labeling cell-based products that includes preparation of a novel 89Zr-labeling intermediate that covalently binds to residues of cell-surface proteins with negligible cellular efflux post- labeling. The second approach entails transfection of the CMSCs with the human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) gene, and in vivo tracking of the cells by PET imaging in conjunction with the iodide analog PET probe, 18F-tetrafluoroborate. In this proposal, we will investigate the sensitivity and quantitative accuracy characteristics of both PET-based noninvasive cell tracking approaches in a well-characterized murine myocardial infarction model."
"9249584","ABSTRACT (Overall Component) The overarching goals of our Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC) are to prevent disease and improve public health through innovative programs of excellence in environmental health sciences research, to engage communities to address environmental health issues, and to enhance career development of talented environmental health investigators. The EHSC provides the framework for the generation of novel research findings and their conversion into effective resources for public health officials, medical professionals, and the community. This tradition of success is based on our ability to recruit broad multi- and interdisciplinary expertise, maintain a strong emphasis on basic science principles while incorporating clinical and translational approaches, and effectively interact with the community. The specific mission of the EHSC at Rochester is to improve public health through the generation of fundamental knowledge and elaboration of mechanisms by which chemical exposures, alone or through interaction with other modifying factors, contribute to cumulative health risk across the life span. As such, the theme that guides and integrates EHSC research and community engagement programs is the understanding of interactions of environmental and occupational agents with diverse individual contexts across the lifespan in modulating human disease and dysfunction. The goals of the Center are achieved through a major focus on three research programs: Pulmonary & Cardiovascular Disease Program, Neurodevelopmental & Neurodegenerative Disease Program, and Musculoskeletal Disease Program. While the Center is structurally organized into these Disease Programs, shared thematic biological processes, including immunological responses & inflammation, stem cell biology, early life sensitivities and mechanisms of adult disease, epigenetics, and nutritional/dietary factors, weave these programs together and synergize the research. These research efforts are supported by several structural units: Administrative Core, Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core, Biostatistics Facility Core, Community Outreach & Engagement Core, Pilot Project Program, and Career Development Program for Environmental Health Science Investigators."
"9288194","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-range goals of this proposal are to develop robust and reproducible methods for ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation as options for fertility preservation in survivors of cancer or other benign conditions wherein ovaria function is compromised. While 80% of young patients currently survive their cancers, devastating side effects of chemo- or radiotherapies leave female survivors facing infertility due to ovarian failure. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue remains the only option for prepubertal, adolescent and young women with cancer as well as adult patients for whom immediate cancer therapy is required. But, human ovarian tissue cryopreservation is considered experimental and hampered by several factors. Embryology clinics in the U.S. favor embryo and oocyte vitrification over slow-rate freezing, but there is no uniform protocol for vitrification of ovaria tissue. Although 30 human births have been reported from slow-rate freezing and transplantation to orthotopic sites, only 4 could claim that the transplanted tissue was known to be the source of the oocytes. Most young survivors will not have a healthy ovarian vascular bed as a transplantation site following cancer therapies. Cryopreservation is also the only option for patients contraindicated for ovarian transplantation due to the risk of reintroducing malignant cells. While in vitro follicle culture is under development, most studies use follicles isolated frm non-cryopreserved tissues. We successfully devised a method for vitrification of rhesus monkey ovarian tissue in a closed system, and demonstrated post-thaw function in vivo and in vitro. When transplanted to heterotopic sites, vitrified tissue resumes ovarian function, and yields mature oocytes capable of preimplantation embryonic development. Secondary follicles isolated from vitrified tissue and encapsulated for 3-dimensional (3D) culture survive, grow to antral stages and produce steroid hormones in vitro, but oocyte quality is poor. Since the ovarian cortex is composed of complex cell types that complicate cryopreservation, vitrification of individual follicles and subsequent 3D culture is a novel approach toward preserving gametes for young patients with highly invasive cancers. An elite panel of co-investigators and collaborators that bring expertise in both state-of-the-art cryobiology as well as pre-eminent experience in clinical ovarian transplantation will help us advance the current technology for more rapid translation to clinical practice for patients. Using the rhesus monkey, we propose to identify the transplantation site for optimal fertile function of both prepubertal and young adult ovarian cortical tissue, improve long-term transplant function via local administration of factors important for revascularization as well as follicular survival, and optimize vitrification of isolaed preantral follicles and their ability to yield competent oocytes following 3D culture in vitro. Liv births in nonhuman primates after these controlled studies will establish the safety and feasibilit of experimental therapies prior to clinical translation so girls and young women can be offered the best chances of becoming mothers after surviving cancer."
"9284285","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Essure system is one type of effective, permanent birth control for women that relies on the insertion of a polymer-coated metal or fiber coil into the Fallopian tube to cause inflammation and through it their irreversible blockage with scar tissue. Advantages over tubal ligation are that the insertion of the device through the vagina, the cervix and the uterus into the Fallopian tube with a hysteroscope (a flexible tube equipped with a camera) is an effective (<1% women pregnant during first year after implantation), permanent, low-cost, non-surgical procedure which typically takes less than 30 min. Disadvantages are that Essure takes 3 months to become effective, that allergies to the contrast-agent used in hysterosalpingography to confirm tubal blockage is a contraindication, that electrosurgical procedures (e.g. endometrial ablation) may no longer be possible, and that complications, when they occur, can be very serious, such as ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages and the perforation of the uterus or fallopian tubes by the metal coils and their migration into other organs. Increasing concerns surrounding Essure highlight the need for a new, improved device that offers Essure's advantages without its risks. We propose a novel device that uses precisely dosed, site-specifically delivered magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and their temporary immobilization in the Fallopian tubes for heating with an externally applied alternating magnetic field (AMF) to cause initial physical blockage, localized heating and inflammation, followed by scar formation and permanent tube blockage. Such a MNP-based device has never been demonstrated. Our preliminary results illustrate the great promise of this approach through: i) the homogeneous distribution of a well-defined concentration of MNPs in a non-penetrating, flexible device for ii) targeted placement and uniform heating during treatment that iii) allows fo the delivery of a well-controlled heat dose and, after treatment, iv) removes itself by controlled degradation v) whose components have been proven not to be toxic, vi) has shown tubal occlusion in only thirty days in an animal model, and vii) which will not preclude in vitro fertilization by the presence of a foreign body in the uterus. For the study of the proposed MNP-enabled device, we will use NT-01 particles (Micromod GmbH, Rostock, Germany) that have been manufactured by the Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) are currently under review for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use. We will determine the optimal material composition and consistency (e.g. gel, paste) for MNP delivery, device heating and degradation. While we propose the use of a specific type of MNP for this study, because of considerable experience with them, the device will be particle independent; in fact, we anticipate that further studies beyond the scope of this one will show that the combination of several different MNP types with different heating and diffusion properties may be advantageous. Key to the proposed approach is the hypothesis that MNP can be carefully dosed and site-specifically placed for sterilization and then safely be removed by device degradation. The hypotheses will be addressed in three interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a MNP-based device with well-defined heating properties for placement into the Fallopian tube with a hysteroscope. In Aim 2, we will in in vitro studies systematically determine the heating performance of different device options developed in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will systematically test in vivo in cats th efficacy of the device. The successful completion of the project will be transformative to the field, offering new, low cost sterilization options, with all of Essure's advantages and significanly reduced risks."

We will recruit from all 30 accredited veterinary medical schools in the nation, particularly from Tuskegee University with the objective of recruiting underrepresented minorities. A total of 6 new DVM-seeking scholars will be recruited each year during the next five year funding period of the program. SVSRP will provide students with experience in areas of research that couple student interests with research in animal models of infectious disease, immunology and inflammation and vertebrate genetics. Mentors will be assigned by the Advisory and Selection Committee to applicants based on applicant interests. Students will receive training in the writing of research proposals and scientific papers, biostatistics and experimental design, reports and presentations, visual display of quantitative information. Their training will also include humane care and use of animal models and the ethical conduct of research as led by speakers with expertise in human experimentation, the Belmont Report, the Animal Welfare Act, scientific integrity and rigor and reproducibility. A unique feature of this program will be a visit to the NIH, USDA, and other agencies in Washington, DC to better understand research career opportunities for veterinarians and to learn how public policy is influenced by research. After completing orientation and writing a research proposal, students will spend nine weeks in the mentor's laboratory doing research. To sustain interest in biomedical research, we will organize a weekly meeting with successful DVM researchers from academia, government, or biotech industries. VMCVM has successfully administered summer research training programs in the past, culminating in training 143 DVM students in biomedical research since 1995. Since administering this T35 SVSRP in 2006, we have completed essentially all that we originally proposed during the last 10 years. Renewal of this SVSRP will enable the VMCVM to continue providing opportunities and training to DVM students in biomedical research and encourage pursuit of a research-based career as world-class scientists."
"9294240","ABSTRACT Diseases of the nodal tissue of the heart can be life threatening, particularly in the young. Nodal tissue spontaneously depolarizes serving as a pacemaker for cardiac contraction, yet despite this central role critical for survival, the cause of nodal dysfunction is poorly understood. This lack of mechanistic understanding has impaired development of efficacious and selective pharmacotherapies, and as a correlate, drugs levied against nodal disease carry significant toxicity for the patient and can still be entirely ineffective. While the nodal automaticity was traditionally thought to be controlled by ion channels on the plasma membrane, there is a growing body of evidence that calcium-signaling within the cell may regulate spontaneous depolarization ? its automaticity. Previous investigation has shown that calcium leak from the internal calcium release channel, RyR2, may be associated with increased nodal firing, thus understanding this so-called ?calcium clock? can provide additional molecular targets for nodal-specific novel therapeutics. I have created a mouse model of nodal-specific expression silencing of a protein called junctophilin-2 (JPH2), which I have previously shown to be critical to effective calcium- handling in the contractile myocyte, as a tool for studying a dysfunctional calcium clock. I have found that this mouse has an elevated heart rate at rest and a rapidly firing atrioventricular node which causes an arrhythmia known as accelerated junctional rhythm (AJR). I propose 3 specific aims to test our central hypothesis that reduced JPH2 expression results in CaMKII-mediated increase in RyR2 gating which causes increased store calcium leak and drives increased nodal automaticity and AJR. My aims are to 1) utilize confocal-based calcium imaging of isolated nodal cells from HCN4:shJPH2 mice, coupled with RyR2 single channel recordings to determine whether reduced JPH2 expression causes increased calcium leak with higher RyR2 channel opening probability; 2) apply known chemical inhibitors of RyR2 to isolated single cells and HCN4:shJPh2 mice to assess whether calcium leak can be normalized and AJR effectively treated; and 3) conduct biochemistry from isolated nodal tissue to determine the role of CaMKII signaling, including its downstream phosphorylation targets, in regulation of nodal firing. I expect that completion of these aims will yield clinically translatable mechanistic insight into the ?calcium clock? of the node. Through exploration of the first murine model of isolated cardiac nodal disease in the literature, these aims will provide a substrate from which to test novel therapeutic agents specifically targeted at perturbed calcium-signaling in nodal tissue. Completion of this 5-year training grant will allow me to combine my clinical training in pediatric electrophysiology with exploration of the molecular mechanisms of nodal disease and become an independently funded physician-scientist committed to helping children with arrhythmias."
"9248845","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which is the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). The MACS was funded by NIAID and NCI in 1983, with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men. With the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the MACS became also a study of the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases associated with aging. MACS participants, including 1808 enrolled in SHARE, have been followed semiannually since 1984 and have provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens. Evaluating and following the prevalent and incident cases of HIV infection in SHARE and the MACS has provided key insights into risk factors for infection with HIV, monitoring and mechanisms of progression of HIV infection once it is established, host defense against HIV, genetic factors affecting HIV pathogenesis, and use, efficacy, and adverse effects of different types of therapy for HIV and related illnesses. SHARE and MACS are currently recruiting new participants who are receiving more recent cART regimens that are more potent, safer, and more convenient than older regimens, and which are initiated earlier in the course of HIV infection; this recruitment will be completed by the end of the current funding period in March, 2014.  The specific aims of SHARE for the 2014-9 renewal period reflect those of the MACs and are to determine: the effect of evolving, earlier initiated c ART regimens on HIV-induced inflammation and immune dysfunction; the occurrence of and risk factors for emerging, non-AIDS-defining, high morbidity outcomes according to HIV infection and new c ART regimens; the determinants for incidence, progression and survival of malignancies, both AIDS- and non-AIDS-defining; the biologic and physiologic effects of treated HIV infection on the aging process; the relationships of substance use and psychosocial factors of aging in HIV infection with adherence, coping skills, resiliency, depression and quality of life and genetic factors associated with resistance to and control of HIV infection. SHARE will contribute to these goals through leadership of eight MACS working groups focusing on these topics, and through local studies focusing on liver disease, energy metabolism, cytomegalovirus infection, and regulation of immune activation and inflammation. These aims can be achieved only through continued follow-up of this extremely well-characterized cohort. SHARE and the MACS should continue to play a leading role in studies that will foster better treatments and prevention of HIV infection."

"9232223","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the most deadly form of brain cancer. There is a dire need to better define the molecular pathways that regulate the malignant features of GBM, in particular, its invasiveness and the persistence of glioma stem cells (GSC), also known as tumor propagating cells, which are thought to be the main source of tumor recurrence due to their tumorigenic potential and therapy resistance. Plexin-B2 is an axon guidance receptor originally identified as a gene highly upregulated in glioma. Our recent patient database analyses found that upregulation of Plexin-B2 correlates with glioma grade and poor survival. This prompted us to investigate the mechanistic basis of this important link. Our studies in human ATCC glioma cell lines demonstrated that Plexin-B2 activation alters actin cytoskeleton and promotes cell migration through activation of Rho GTPases. In intracranial transplants, Plexin-B2 shRNA knockdown hindered invasion and disrupted glioma vascularization. Our new preliminary data from patient-derived GSC lines suggest that besides a promigratory role, Plexin-B2 may also regulate glioma stem cell phenotypes, including stem cell marker expression, self-renewal capacity, proliferation and differentiation potential. Building on these exciting results, we propose to test the central hypothesis that Plexin-B2 plays a multifaceted role in promoting glioma invasion and stem cell characteristics. To facilitate our studies, we have adopted CRISPR gene editing technology to generate bi-allelic mutations of Plexin-B2 in patient-derived GSC lines. In Aim 1, we focus on glioma invasion and ask if Plexin-B2 signaling influences cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility of GBM cells by performing culture assays, brain slice cultures, and intracranial transplants. By comparing cell migration of GSCs and their differentiated progeny, this set of studies also addresses whether migratory potential is contingent on differentiation hierarchy. In Aim 2, we focus on glioma stem cell characteristics and ask if Plexin-B2 contributes to stem cell marker expression, self-renewal capacity, proliferation and differentiation potential, and treatment resistance. We will investigate in survival cohorts with GSC intracranial transplants if Plexin-B2 deletion confers survival benefit and if it reduces radiation resistance. In Aim 3, we focus on functional targets and downstream effectors of Plexin-B2 signaling in mediating migration and stem cell properties. We ask which intracellular domain of Plexin-B2 is the main signaling arm, if cellular migration is mediated through modulation of Rho GTPases, whether STAT3 functions as a core signaling hub, and if stem cell factors SOX2 or OLIG2 function downstream of STAT3 for stemness maintenance. Lastly, we will study the adhesion molecules L1CAM and cadherins/protocadherins, the most significantly regulated group of genes that were identified in our recent RNA-Seq analysis of Plexin-B2 knockout GSC. Understanding how Plexin-B2 regulates the malignant features of GBM will open up possibilities for new targets to inhibit glioma growth and invasion."
"9305791","Project Summary/Abstract The CDC recently declared insufficient sleep to be a ?public health epidemic,? noting that an estimated 50-70 million US adults have sleep or wakefulness disorders. Although it is well-recognized that insufficient sleep increases the risk for many chronic conditions, the role of sleep in the development of cancer is unclear. While epidemiologic studies are sparse, they have yielded some provocative but inconsistent findings. Such inconsistencies may reflect the complexity of underlying etiologic mechanisms. Sleep plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of a number of key processes integral to carcinogenesis, including inflammation and cellular replication and proliferation. Furthermore, there may be individual differences in vulnerability to the effects of sleep deficiency, depending on chronotype (i.e., whether one?s endogenous biological rhythm of sleep/wakefulness follows a morning or evening preference). Our objective is to advance the understanding of how sleep deficiency may influence cancer risk, considering both potential underlying mechanisms and host vulnerability. The study will capitalize on resources available from the California Teachers Study (CTS) in which 65,000 women have provided detailed self-reported data on sleep and chronotype, a subset of whom have also provided blood samples available for the conduct of biomarker assays to quantify physiologic effects. The specific aims are to: 1.) evaluate cancer risks associated with self-reported sleep deficiency among CTS participants; 2.) assess the relationship between self-reported sleep deficiency and biomarkers of physiologic effect for chronic inflammation and telomere length; 3.) evaluate the degree to which cancer risks and the physiologic responses to sleep deficiency vary by chronotype. In addressing each of these aims, several specific dimensions of sleep deficiency will be considered, including poor sleep quality, extremes in sleep duration, fragmented sleep and long sleep latency. Cases of invasive breast and other selected commonly-diagnosed cancers (colorectal, melanoma, endometrial, non-Hodgkin?s lymphoma, thyroid) will be identified via linkage to the California Cancer Registry. Biomarker assays will be run on 800 blood samples collected from non- cancer cases within a year of the sleep and chronotype data. Multiplexed immunometric assays will be used to quantify levels of circulating biomarkers of inflammation. Quantitative PCR will be used to measure telomere length. Cox Proportional Hazards and Ordinary Logistic Regression models will be used to estimate risks for each dimension of sleep deficiency, adjusting for other known risk factors. Multivariable linear models will be used to characterize the relationship between the biomarkers and specific dimensions of sleep. Initial models will be expanded, incorporating chronotype to explore potential differences in risk and/or effect by chronotype. The long-term objective of this project supports the NCI?s mission to reduce the burden of cancer by furthering our understanding of its etiology and avenues for prevention. Additionally, it supports NIH?s recently identified priority to advance the understanding of sleep and circadian functions in health and disease."
"9242697","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sudden death in the young (SDY) is a critical public health issue with significant knowledge gaps, specifically in the epidemiology and etiology of SDY in the United States. In a proportion of unexplained SDY cases, the etiology is a genetic arrhythmia syndrome caused by mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channels or regulatory proteins. Post-mortem genetic testing has suggested the cause of death in 10-35% of autopsy- negative SD cases. Occasionally, mutations are identified with clear-cut pathologic significance, but a major challenge to the field is that many identified mutations are novel or uncharacterized, and pathogenicity is difficult to determine. The NIH in collaboration with the CDC has established a prospective, population-based SDY registry, with collection of DNA samples for cases with no definitive cause on autopsy, allowing post- mortem genetic investigation. The goals of this research program are to address knowledge gaps in unexplained SDY with a multifaceted approach which includes sequencing ion channel and high-priority candidate genes in SDY cases and controls, in vitro assessment of putative pathogenic mutations, and systematic clinical evaluation for family members of SDY victims (Specific Aim 1). Control samples are available from a very large (> 200,000 samples) electronic medical record-linked biobank in place at our institution. We also propose expansion of the SDY biorepository to include tissue samples from SDY victims and investigating developmental regulation of ion channel expression as a factor in infant SD (Specific Aim 2). The investigative team has established collaborations with one of the SDY Case registry funded agencies (Tennessee Department of Health) and the regional Medical Examiner's office in order to carry out the proposed studies. Accomplishing these Aims will: allow return of clinically-actionable results to families by investigators with expertise in interpretation of ion channel variants and clinical car of channelopathies; enhance the SDY biorepository with a tissue bank and a DNA biorepository from a large well-phenotyped control cohort; and investigate potential novel mechanisms underlying SDY."
"9330576","Project Summary Significance and Rationale: Deregulation of normal tissue repair processes has dramatic consequences for life quality and survival of patients. Together, insufficient healing (chronic wounds) and excessive repair after injury (scarring/fibrosis) cause healthcare costs that reach tens of billions of dollars per year in the US; these costs are expected to further increase with our aging populations. Chronic and fibrotic healing occur when the body´s own repair capacity is either impaired or overwhelmed. One approach in regenerative medicine is to replace injured, diseased or aged tissues with functional tissue equivalents. This approach often fails because of adverse host reactions that are part of the repair program, e.g., immune, inflammatory, and fibrotic responses. Thus, regenerative medicine increasingly considers to support the adult´s body´s own regenerative capacities to promote closure of wounds that never heal and to keep excessive repair at bay. However, it is still unclear why humans lost regenerative capacity during evolution, whereas lower organisms can regenerate whole organs. Understanding the underlying common control mechanisms will help to devise novel strategies to regenerate rather than repair organ injuries to extend the healthy life expectancy of our aging population. Objective: There is a fundamental need for innovative, transformational, and interdisciplinary research to understand how ?dormant? regeneration processes can be activated and exploited in a controlled manner to promote human adult organ regeneration. It is the overarching objective of the Gordon Research Conference on Tissue Repair and Regeneration (GRC-TRR) to foster interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations that will deliver the next generation of discoveries in regenerative medicine. Aims and Approach: Aim 1: To establish the GRC-TRR as the premier and unique forum to discuss regene- rative medicine among experts from different disciplines that would otherwise not meet. Great diversity has always been and will be the greatest strength of the GRC-TRR. We will bring together fundamental and translational scientists studying different aspects of repair/regeneration using a wide variety of experimental models and approaches. Aim 2: To support junior investigators so that they can present their work to peers and leaders in the field, learn about, and become integrated into this research community. As for the past three meetings, the GRC-TRR will host a preceding Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), organized for and by graduate students and postdocs who will stay for the GRC. Aim 3: To defray the travel and registration costs of GRS and GRC-TRR speakers to stimulate their attendance over the whole meeting. From the great success of the intimate and no-intimidating setting of previous GRC-TRRs, we can expect relationships to be forged at this meeting that will last for decades to come. We will also encourage participation by underrepresented minorities, through scholarships offered by existing GRC programs. Generous NIH support will greatly enhance the quality of the program and the ultimate success of the GRS/GRC-TRR."
"9265779","PROJECT SUMMARY The majority of moderate to severe diarrheal cases in children ages 2-5 years living in Asia and Sub- Saharan Africa are attributed to Shigella. Recurrence of infection results in death or long-term disability. No vaccine is currently available. While multiple candidates have been developed, only a few have been tested in humans for safety and immunogenicity. However, their protective efficacy remains unknown. No immune correlates of protection have been established, which poses a hindrance to Shigella vaccine development efforts. An additional challenge is the lack of standardized immunological assays that could be used to harmonize data from different clinical studies. The goal of this application is to establish and validate serological assays that can predict efficacy of Shigella vaccine candidates in humans. Our preliminary data supports the hypothesis that antibodies with anti-microbial activity and a distinct profile of antigen-specific antibodies in serum from vaccinated subjects can be predictive of vaccine efficacy. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate assays to measure the anti-microbial functionality of anti- Shigella antibodies (serum bactericidal, opsonophagocytic killing and inhibition of macrophage and neutrophil toxicity) using serum samples from trials in which healthy human adult subjects received the Sfl2aWC candidate vaccine or a placebo. We will examine vaccine-induced antibody and clinical data (i.e. disease) post-challenge with S. flexneri 2a to identify a distinct serological profile that can be indicative of vaccine efficacy. In Aim 2, we will develop a high throughput multiplex ELISA to measure multiple Shigella-specific antibodies [e.g. Invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa) IpaB, IpaC and IpaD, VirG and strain specific LPS] in a single well. Serum from Sfl2aWC vaccine recipients before and after vaccination and before and after challenge will be tested with this new MSD ELISA to determine a potential association between antigen-specific antibodies and protection against disease. In Aim 3, we will adapt the assays determined to correlate with enhanced protection in humans and apply them in guinea pig and mouse studies. Identification of animal models for which the same serological readouts predict a protective outcome would be a critical advance for pre-clinical vaccine assessment as such models would more closely resemble vaccine performance in humans. This application involves a partnership between leading researchers of Shigella pathogenesis, vaccine development and immunology from the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and The John Hopkins University (JHU) and this work has the potential to develop technology and reagents that will facilitate vaccine development efforts."
"9049921","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Herpes Simplex Keratitis (HSK) is a major cause of infectious blindness in industrialized countries. Induced by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of the ocular surface, HSK is a chronic inflammation of the cornea that results in neovascularization and opacity, compromising visual acuity. Interestingly, HSV-1 is rarely found in HSK lesions; instead, the lesions are predominantly infiltrated by immune cells like neutrophils and CD4 T cells. However, the mechanism by which HSV-1 induces and manipulates HSK immunopathology is poorly understood. Previous work in our lab and preliminary studies show that a potential immune pathway, when targeted by the virus, may attenuate HSK. HSV-1 is known to inhibit autophagy, a cellular recycling process universal to all eukaryotic cells. When HSV-1 infects dendritic cells in vitro, downstream activation of CD4 T cells is compromised. This corroborates the in vivo finding that infection with a mutant virus that  can't modulate autophagy induces a greater CD4 T cell response. Furthermore, our preliminary studies show that the genetic deletion of dendritic cell autophagy results in reduced HSK disease in vivo. Taken together, these data link an immunomodulatory function of HSV-1 to HSK disease through viral control of autophagy in dendritic cells. Our proposal will test our overarching hypothesis that autophagy in dendritic cells is a determinant of HSK immunopathology and is targeted by HSV-1. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that autophagy in dendritic cells promotes HSK immunopathology. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that HSV-1 antagonism of autophagy in dendritic cells modulates HSK disease.  If our hypotheses are correct, we will have identified a unique paradigm in which an immunomodulatory action of HSV-1 antagonizes HSK disease. This avenue of research could lead to bioengineered viral proteins, repurposed as therapy for combating HSK disease. Additionally, completion of this research proposal and rigorous training plan will fulfill the broader objective of enhancing physician-scientist career development. This fellowship will enable the trainee to develop advanced skills in basic, clinical, and translational  research that facilitate integration of clinical and research interests in infectious ocular diseas."
"9247851","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's capacity to sense and produce time intervals flexibly is an essential building block of many cognitive functions and sensorimotor skills. Yet, the neural mechanisms for measuring and producing an interval of time are unknown. We will take advantage of the foundational work on the anatomy and physiology of the primate oculomotor system to assess the mechanisms of interval timing in the oculomotor circuits of the brain. First, we will focus on the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the associaton cortex, where correlates of elapsed time have been reported previously. We will record from LIP neurons in an oculomotor time reproduction task to test the hypothesis that LIP response dynamics track the animal's estimate of elapsed time during both measurement and production of time intervals. Second, we will use optogenetics to excite and suppress neural activity in LIP at high temporal resolution to ask whether and how LIP plays a causal role in the perception and production of time intervals. Third, we will examine the neural signals at the output node of the lateral cerebellum (i.e., the dentate nucleus, DN), which is thought to play an important role in timing and temporal coordination. Based on previous work suggesting a role for the lateral cerebellum in non-motor timing, we will test the hypothesis that DN signals encode elapsed time during measurement of time intervals. These experiments combine multiple innovations including a novel behavioral paradigm and cutting-edge technology and have the potential to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the neural mechanisms of interval timing in the primate brain."
"9305160","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome contains fewer genes than many seemingly simpler organisms, but humans-especially the human brains-create remarkable protein diversity by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Dysregulations of alternative splicing networks have been repeatedly found in autistic brains, indicating critical roles of alternative splicing in human mental health. However, it's unclear when and how the human brain acquires complex alternative splicing during development, and our current knowledge lacks a systematic understanding of how the regulation of alternative splicing relates to developmental human brain disorders. A major gap is the lack of a direct comparison of differentially spliced exons between early human neural progenitors and differentiated neurons in development. In this project, Dr. Zhang will combine fluorescence activated cell sorting, RNA sequencing and multidisciplinary functional approaches to test the hypothesis that cell type-specific alternative splicing executes an important layer of control on cerebral cortical development. Specifically, this proposal aims to: 1] Identify genome-wide alternatively spliced exons between cortical neural progenitors and neurons in mice and humans, 2] Investigate the functional impact of alternatively spliced exons, and 3] Identify mutations that cause aberrant alternative splicing and developmental human brain disorders. Dr. Xiaochang Zhang is an Instructor at the Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) and Harvard Medical School, and his proposed 4-year mentored career plan will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Christopher A. Walsh in the Division of Genetics and Genomics at BCH. Dr. Zhang's background is in molecular and developmental biology, and his long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in alternative splicing mediated regulation of cerebral cortex development and human brain disorders. Under the mentorship of Dr. Walsh, a world leading expert in the fields of human cerebral cortical development and disorders, Dr. Zhang has developed a research and training platform that will allow him to acquire the experimental skills and knowledge necessary to be productive in both a mentored and independent setting. To accomplish this, Dr. Zhang will take advantage of the expertise and resources in human genetics and developmental neurobiology of the Walsh lab, acquire additional skills and training in relevant research areas, and establish collaboration with a team of experts. The plan is ideally carried out in the Walsh lab at BCH, given its distinguished record for training research scientists in a rich and collaborative environment."
"9259286","`Spontaneously' emerging patterned neuronal activity during early development prior to the onset of sensory experience is a widely observed phenomenon in vertebrate nervous systems. Since the first discovery of the waveform of spontaneous activity in the developing rodent retina over 20 years ago, multiple instances of this activity have been demonstrated to play an important role for the refinement of neuronal architecture. However, despite a history of research, our understanding of specific mechanisms such as how this activity appears, propagates, or shapes development is far from complete, mainly due to the technical challenges of manipulating the phenomenon in intact animals. Examining similar processes in a model system with improved genetic tools, such as in Drosophila would provide greater experimental access for understanding this process. However, it remains unclear whether such robust spontaneous neuronal activity that shapes neurodevelopment in vertebrates exists in simpler invertebrate model systems. In preliminary calcium imaging experiments in Drosophila, I observed the existence of robust patterned spontaneous calcium activity in photoreceptor neurons during early retinal development before sensory processing begins. This activity is reminiscent of mammalian retinal waves, thus I propose three aims designed to determine the role and underlying molecular mechanisms of this activity in the developing Drosophila visual system. In aim 1, I will combine genetically encoded calcium and voltage indicators with cell-type specific Gal4 driver lines to fully characterize the cell types engaged in this activity throughout the developing visual system. In aim 2, I will determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms that generate this spontaneous activity using two approaches. First, I will establish whether widely used genetic tools for manipulating neuronal activity in adult animals, such as inward rectifying potassium channels (Kir2.1), can influence spontaneous activity during development. Second, I will conduct a candidate RNAi screen for genes that are required for generating patterned spontaneous calcium activity. Finally, in aim 3, as instructed by mammalian studies, I hypothesize that patterned spontaneous activity plays a functional role in refining neuronal wiring of photoreceptor neurons and will determine which specific developmental processes are regulated by this activity using the mechanistic understanding gained from aim 2. This work aims to establish an invertebrate model of patterned activity-dependent neurodevelopment. This will greatly facilitate mechanistic and detailed in vivo studies of this poorly understood developmental phenomenon and make use of the powerful genetics and genome-wide screening capability available in Drosophila. Ultimately, this will promote an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent neural plasticity, which has critical roles in a variety of neurodevelopmental diseases, including autism spectrum disorder."

"9302167","PROJECT SUMMARY ALI/ARDS is a serious condition with high mortality rates, and more complete understanding of pathologic mechanisms mediating lung vascular inflammation and barrier dysfunction in ARDS is critical for development of efficient therapeutic approaches to confront this devastating disease. Previous studies by our and other groups revealed pronounced anti-inflammatory and barrier enhancing effects of cyclic AMP elevating agonists on pulmonary vascular endothelium, which accelerated ALI recovery. Endogenous cAMP levels also appear to be critical for the maintenance of endothelial cell anti-inflammatory status and barrier function. However, septic and ALI conditions lead to impairment of cAMP homeostasis, which may contribute to severity of endothelial dysfunction and lung injury in ARDS. The importance of this mechanism is supported by beneficial effects of pharmacological inhibition of cAMP hydrolyzing enzyme, phosphodiesterase (PDE) in preclinical models of septic ALI. Despite these encouraging results, precise molecular mechanisms of PDE activation in inflammatory conditions still remain to be elucidated.  Coagulation and inflammation are activated by the same types of challenges and correlate both temporally and spatially in different pathologies, but mechanistic interactions between these two processes are incompletely understood. Fibrinogen is a key component of the coagulation system. Increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrin deposition are distinctive features of advanced ALI and septic syndromes. Fibrinogen directly interacts with ?5?1 integrin adhesion receptor expressed by pulmonary endothelial cells. Our exciting pilot studies show that this interaction may augment EC inflammation and barrier dysfunction caused by bacterial pathogens via recruitment of PDE4 to the ?5-integrin associated signaling protein complex. This proposal will investigate for the first time the molecular mechanism of synergy between ARDS-relevant coagulation component fibrinogen and lung EC inflammation caused by bacterial particles.  Aim-1 will employ in vitro and in vivo models of ALI caused by Gram-positive bacterial particles to evaluate fibrinogen role in lung vascular endothelial dysfunction and severity of lung injury. Aim-2 will investigate assembly and activation of ?5-integrin-ILK-paxillin signalosome and evaluate its role in the mediation of fibrinogen-induced exacerbation of endothelial dysfunction and lung inflammation. Aim-3 will study targeting of PDE4 to fibrinogen-activated ?5-integrin-ILK-paxillin signalosome and its significance for PDE4- dependent suppression of intracellular cAMP and augmentation of HKSA-induced ALI."
"9303631","Project Summary/Abstract The promise of precision medicine is that a physician can tailor a therapeutic regimen to suit each individual patient. In the case of cancer, this means a personalized therapeutic strategy based on the molecular features of an individual's cancer. But while successes in precision medicine have garnered significant attention in recent years, precision medicine has not made an impact for the vast majority of cancer patients. Our overarching goal is to use proteomics and systems biology to understand the relationships between cancer genotype and therapeutic response, with the long-term goal of expanding the prospects of precision medicine. Our study focuses primary on cancers expressing mutant forms of K-Ras, the most commonly mutated oncoprotein in cancer and one of the best biomarkers for the failure of a cancer to respond to therapy. Using a variety of experimental and computational approaches, this project will address three key questions related to K-Ras and the promise of precision medicine. First, we will exploit a relatively rare circumstance in which colorectal cancers expressing a specific mutant form of K-Ras are uniquely sensitive to inhibition of the MEK kinase. We will use mass spectrometry and computational modeling to determine why cancers expressing K-RasG12D and K-RasA146T are differentially sensitive to inhibition of MEK. Next, we will address the limitation of univariate genetic prediction of therapeutic efficacy by determining how genetic and epigenetic factors interact to establish network signaling state. We will use mass cytometry and computational modeling to explore how signaling downstream of mutant K-Ras is affected by cellular lineage and by secondary mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Finally, we will move beyond genotype as a predictor of therapeutic efficacy by developing an algorithm to predict sensitivity to kinase inhibition based on phospho-proteomic measurements. We will validate the computational approach via preclinical therapeutics studies in patient-derived xenografts. Altogether these studies will utilize state-of-the-art experimental and computational approaches to make personalized medicine a realistic goal for patients suffering from K-Ras mutant cancer."
"9329142","PROJECT SUMMARY Elucidation of the pathways and factors that mediate microRNA (miRNA) repression of mRNAs is critical to understanding the biology of these ubiquitous small RNAs and utilizing them in applied and therapeutic settings. miRNAs mediate post-transcriptional repression of mRNAs by binding the 3? UTR of mRNAs through base-pairing interactions in the context of an Argonaute (AGO) family protein. Despite progress in identifying features of target sites that are correlated with observed repression, there exists a major gap in the field's understanding of how miRNAs recognize their target sites and which binding events lead to mRNA repression. This is due to the reliance on indirect methods to infer these features, such as conservation of sites, mRNA expression level changes upon miRNA induction, and AGO binding sites via UV-crosslinking. Since these methods interrogate naturally occurring miRNA sites, they are most informative for more common sites and have less statistical power to address less common sites. Biochemical studies have only been performed on a few target sequences and suggest that RNA?RNA base pairing of miRNA-target interactions are greatly modified in the context of AGO, and consequently, simple base-pairing rules used in repression models are not predictive of AGO?miRNA binding affinity. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that in vitro binding affinity of the AGO?miRNA complex to mRNA targets sites is an unaccounted feature that will be predictive of changes in mRNA levels containing a particular site. This hypothesis is derived from the observed relationship between repression levels and the extent of complementarity of common miRNA-site types to their miRNA (i.e. repression of an 8mer > 7mer > 6mer). Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to determine the extent to which binding energetics of miRNA-AGO target complex account for the repression levels observed in vivo. First, human AGO-miRNA binding kinetics and thermodynamics will be determined using a high-throughput binding assay on pools of sequence variants of miRNA target sites. These data will allow determination of the contributions of miRNA?target sequence complementarity, structural accessibility, and primary sequence identity to binding affinity. These data will also provide insight into less common miRNA-site types whose functions are debated and largely unexplored. Principles derived from this analysis can be used to engineer AGO family proteins and synthetic miRNAs. Second, intracellular repression data will be generated for thousands of different sites and obtained by sequencing the levels of a reporter gene 3? UTR containing a library of miRNA binding-site variants. These repression data will include less common miRNA-site types and will be free from the effects of varying 3? UTR context. The binding rate and equilibrium constants acquired in vitro will be compared to the newly generated in vivo repression data to determine the extent to which binding affinity accounts for repression. These comparisons will provide insight into the features of miRNA-target recognition that are important for repression, and can be applied to the design of miRNA-based therapeutics."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this training strategy is to develop scientific leadership in HIV- and ART-associated cardiometabolic (CM) research in Rwanda through developing a dynamic team of scholars to implement well- designed contextually relevant studies, publish and present results at scientific meetings, and for networking, and develop expertise for independent research funding. Regional Alliance for Sustainable Development (RASD Rwanda) and University of Rwanda (UR) College of Medicine and Health Sciences (UR-CMHS) propose to collaborate with Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, USA (WUSTL) to implement a mélange of long-, medium-, and short-term tailored didactic and hands-on training, balanced for Master's (MS) degree and non-degree face-to-face mentorships. We will provide MS in Clinical investigation training to postdoctoral scholars, followed by 3-months Mentored Career Development Fellowships, MS in Biostatistics, and MS in Biochemistry Laboratory Medicine. Research training in Endocrinology and Metabolism and advanced nursing techniques will be provided, plus technical training in stable isotope tracer methodologies for substrate kinetics measures, and echocardiographic measures of vascular and cardiac function. WUSTL Faculty assisted by previously trained mid-career Rwandan co-mentors will provide 4-weeks hands-on intensive didactic training to 15 mid-career investigators in Advanced Epidemiology & Biostatistics in Year 1, using existing Ministry of Health HIV datasets, resulting into publications. In Year 2, 4-week intensive workshop training to develop Grant Writing Skills will occur followed by post-training mentorships. Promising young and mid-career scientists will benefit from regular, custom-tailored and flexible mentoring from senior WUSTL Faculty and Rwandan co-mentors (the mentored become mentors) to enhance the research culture at UR-CMHS, while Rwandan co-mentors will gain a breadth of skills from more experienced Faculty to train junior scientists- a pool of future mentors. We envision that 4 WUSTL Faculty will mentor 4 young scientists each, resulting in 16 successful mentorships annually, with up to 80 mentorships in 5 years. Trainees' unique HIV research projects will be supported to accelerate novel findings. Furthermore, WUSTL Summer Fellowships (8 weeks) in the Public Health Advanced Summer Education Program for Research in Global Health, and Bench Fundamentals for Translational Laboratory Research course will each accept 2 trainees/year. Upon return to Rwanda, all trainees will be integrated into the vibrant HIV research infrastructure to contribute to rigorous investigations, and to eventually enable UR to become an African scientific leader in cardiovascular and metabolic research associated with HIV, nutrition, obesity, diabetes and other related co- morbidities, with improved independent scientific capacity to attract and manage grants, and ability to inform global community on HIV care and practice."
"9231490","?    DESCRIPTION: The patho-physiological hallmark of acute lung injury (ALI) is severe derangement the interface of blood with the endothelial vascular lining. Endothelial cells (ECs) exert protective mechanisms including those mediated by thrombomodulin (TM), which inhibits thrombin's pathological activities in part through the production of activated protein C (APC) from its plasma precursor, via interactions between TM, thrombin, protein C, APC and the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) which is located in close proximity to TM in the endothelial plasmalemma. In ALI, TM and EPCR are functionally suppressed. Replenishment of this endothelial mechanism is an important therapeutic goal, but infusion of recombinant APC and TM did not improve the outcome of ALI, because problematic delivery and inability to partner with natural regulatory molecules limited effectiveness and lead to adverse effects. To solve these problems we fused TM to a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of antibodies to PECAM, obtaining scFv/TM that provides protection superior to untargeted TM and APC in animal models of ALI. scFv/TM anchoring on endothelial cells in proximity to EPCR boosts protection. To circumvent the loss of endogenous EPCR typical of ALI, we use dual delivery of scFv/TM and scFv/EPCR, based on our recent serendipitous discovery of collaborative enhancement of endothelial binding of paired monoclonal antibodies directed to distinct PECAM epitopes. Here we will study the delivery, mechanisms and benefit/risk ratio of these fusions and embark on their clinical translation: Aim 1: Dual scFv/TM and scFv/EPCR targeting to endothelium. We will employ a combination of genetic and pharmacologic approaches to selectively modulate molecular regulation of the fusions in order to quantify their effects on ALI. Aim 2: Pre-clinical efficacy and safety in animals. Beneficial and adverse effects of anti-PECAM scFv/TM and scFv/EPCR will be characterized (vascular leakage, alveolar inflammatory response, morphologic and physiologic outcomes). Aim 3: Endothelial targeting scFv/TM in human lungs. To enable the clinical translation, we shall: A) Re-engineer the fusions using molecular elements applicable in humans; and, B) Study their targeting in isolated human lungs."
"9243324","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic injuries, major surgery, burns, cerebral ischemia and head injury can induce failure of glucose homeostasis characterized by hypercatabolism and severe hyperglycemia (HG). A thousand papers published over nearly a century reinforce the axiomatic relationship between trauma and HG. The HG of trauma is highly correlated with a poor chance of survival. Post trauma HG, aside from wreaking havoc with attempts to manage metabolic fuel reserves following a severe injury, exacerbates thrombogenesis, infection and inflammatory processes all of which increase morbidity and mortality. While the connection between trauma and metabolic failure characterized by HG is well accepted, there is no practical understanding of the mechanism relating disparate traumatic incidents with autonomic failure characterized by HG, beyond citing stress-related increases in sympathetic activation.  This R21 proposal will test a preliminary hypothesis that thrombin (generated by bleeding trauma) and the activation of proteinase activated receptors (PARs) on astrocytes in the hindbrain can induce a sympathetically-mediated hyperglycemia. We further propose that gliotransmission from PAR-activated astrocytes in the hindbrain activates neurons in the solitary nucleus or basal lateral medulla. Neurons in these sites are critical to generating autonomic counter-regulatory responses characterized by the elevation of plasma glucose in reaction to low CNS glucose availability. This hypothesis is an extension of our earlier published results which have demonstrated that the severe gastric stasis following traumatic injury is likely due to the proteinase activation of PAR-expressing hindbrain astrocytes that then cause a cessation gastric motility via action on vagal regulatory circuits controlling the gut.  The first im will combine neuronal labeling procedures to pre-identify neurons in the hindbrain known to be essential to sympathetically-mediated hyperglycemia with brain splice live cell calcium imaging methods. This technique will allow us to determine if PAR-activated astrocytes (i.e., that produce calcium spikes which drive gliotransmission) specifically activate these pre-identified neurons. The second aim will use site specific nano-injection combined with in vivo physiological techniques to study the effects of PAR agonists, localized cytoglucopenia, astrocyte blockade and sympathetic pathway blockade to determine the relevance of thrombin/PAR activation to glycemia.  Revealing an interaction between injury (and PAR activation) and glucose sensing circuits in the hindbrain may produce new insights into the management of trauma-induced metabolic failure."

"9265450","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our recent studies of the communication between neuronal soma and satellite glial cells (SGCs) in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) suggest that somatic release of ATP in response to afferent nerve stimulation activates purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) in SGCs. Under normal conditions, tonic activation of P2X7Rs in SGCs reduces P2X3R expression in neuronal somata, thus exerting inhibitory control of neuronal activity. Following high frequency nerve stimulation, activation of P2X7Rs evokes cytokine release causing an enhancement of P2X3R activity in somata and an increase in the excitability of neurons. The P2X7R-mediated SGC-neuronal soma feedback controls under inflammation and nerve injury conditions have not been well established. This knowledge is essential for understanding the generation and maintenance of abnormal chronic pain. The goal of this application is to understand changes in neuronal soma-SGC communication during different phases of chronic pain development. We hypothesize that following injury, an increase in cytokine release switches P2Rmediated SGC-soma communication from inhibitory to excitatory feedback control, thus initiating the development of abnormal pain states. A subsequent large increase in ATP release, which activates P2X7Rs and pannexin-1, produces a large enhancement of SGC-soma communication and thus leads to the transition from the development to the maintenance phase of chronic pain. We will (1) determine if P2R-mediated SGC-soma communication changes during the development and maintenance phase of chronic pain, (2) determine the mechanisms underlying the change in SGC-soma communication and (3) determine if modulation of SGC-soma communication is a valid strategy for the management of chronic pain."
"9345127","Project Summary The present application ?Novel Treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder? addresses the critical need for more efficacious treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, activates a key neural signaling cascade upon a trauma experience. In this activation, glutamate binds to and activates the NMDA receptor, a glutamate receptor subtype. Binding and activation triggers the formation of a complex at the receptor and leads to activation of the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and a concomitant increase in the production of the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO). These events trigger aberrant synaptic plasticity that is implicated in the initiation and maintenance of PTSD. Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) targets nNOS to the NMDA receptor facilitating the formation of this signaling complex. PSD95 is therefore, required for NMDA receptor activation of nNOS. Lai, Anagin co-founder and principal investigator for this project, first showed that the small molecule, IC87201, disrupts the functional protein-protein interaction between nNOS and PSD95 in vitro and attenuates NMDA receptor dependent hyperalgesia in vivo. Anagin, an Indiana-based small business and its preclinical team at Indiana University, led by Dr. Shekhar (co-founder of Anagin), has demonstrated that IC87201 and a related analog, ZL006, block the long-term encoding of conditioned fear even after a fear conditioning session has occurred (i.e. post- trauma). Unlike NMDA receptor antagonists, these protein interaction inhibitors are efficacious in suppressing PTSD-like symptoms in a well-established preclinical model without producing motor or memory impairment. Thus, disruption of signal compartmentalization represents an innovative approach to develop novel treatments for anxiety disorders with fewer side-effects. In Anagin's successful SBIR Phase I studies, the team established positive structural-activity-relationship and demonstrated oral efficacy of its first-generation lead and identified a promising new chemical series. The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to deliver an orally available drug candidate and initiate IND-enabling studies delineated through two specific aims. Aim 1: Perform lead optimization studies to select a Drug Development Candidate. Aim 2: Validate the Drug Development Candidate in IND-enabling studies. A traditional drug medicinal chemistry approach will be used to design and develop novel analogs with improved pharmacokinetic properties and potency compared to the parent compounds. Anagin anticipates completion of initial IND-enabling studies at the end of the grant period. The development of effective pharmacotherapies with novel chemical structures that possess limited side-effect profiles is expected to drive down escalating health care costs and alleviate unnecessary suffering in PTSD patients. The ultimate goal is an FDA IND submission of a drug candidate for Phase I clinical trials in PTSD or anxiety disorders."
"9264450","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Fliser et al. identified the presence of insulin resistance in non-diabetic patients with IgA or inherited nephropathies and nearly normal values of serum creatinine and GFR, pointing out that this complication is not restricted to dialysis patients. They concluded that chronic kidney disease (CKD) rather than a specific kidney disease causes insulin resistance. However, mechanisms causing insulin resistance in CKD are unsettled: there appears to be normal binding of insulin to its receptor with the defect present in intracellular signaling. My project i based on a novel pathway I uncovered, namely that CKD stimulates the expression of a membrane- bound, tyrosine phosphatase, Signal Regulatory Protein Alpha (SIRP-alpha), resulting in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its downstream mediator, insulin receptor substrate-1. My goal is to determine how CKD-stimulated SIRP-alpha induces skeletal muscle wasting and cardiac muscle fibrosis and dysfunction.  CKD is a major concern for U.S. Veterans because of the increased morbidity and mortality it invariably causes, including insulin resistance. My long-term goal is to identify mechanisms causing insulin resistance in CKD and to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent its catabolic complications. The development of insulin resistance is not limited to CKD but occurs in obesity, type 2 diabetes and inflammatory conditions and it is tempting to speculate that results of my studies might extend to other conditions. Fortunately, the research interests of my mentors, Drs. Garcia and Mitch, are at least in part similar to my goals while Drs. Chan, Justice & Taegtmeyer can help me address experimental problems.  My Preliminary Results indicate that increased SIRP-alpha expression occurs via NF-alphaB and that silencing SIRP-alpha in muscle cells enhances insulin signaling and suppresses protein wasting. Specific Aim 1: to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRP-alpha recruits SHP2 and whether the SIRP-alpha-SHP2 complex reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1. Specific Aim 2: to study the mouse with whole body KO of SIRP-alpha by inducing CKD. My goal is to examine how CKD in the absence of SIRP-alpha affects insulin signaling and muscle metabolism. I will determine how CKD affects muscle metabolism in mice with muscle-specific KO of SIRP-alpha. Specific Aim 3: we also find increased SIRP-alpha expression in hearts of mice with CKD. Since diabetes can cause fibrosis in the heart with impaired function, I plan to determine if SIRP-alpha KO mice are protected against the development of CKD-stimulated cardiac fibrosis and decreased function.  My short-term goals are to address these Specific Aims as a prelude to becoming an independently- funded principle investigator. My long term goal is to identify mechanisms causing the complications of impaired insulin signaling and CKD. Specifically, I will enhance my knowledge and skills in didactic courses plus seminars (e.g. cell and molecular biology, grant and manuscript writing, ethics in biomedical research and translational research design). I believe I have the necessary environment to grow into a successful investigator, including strong mentorship, a world-renowned Career Advisory Committee and participation in local and national research meetings. To extend my research, I am applying for the VA-CDA and hope to develop therapies to improve the quality of life of U.S. Veterans, suffering from conditions such as CKD, type 2 diabetes or obesity that are characterized by impaired insulin signaling."
"9295429","Project Abstract  This proposal describes a research plan and a training program to facilitate Dr. Gondek?s transition from a junior faculty member to an independent investigator. Dr. Gondek studied the genetics of Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes and in particular Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) in the laboratory of Dr. Jaroslaw Maciejewski at Cleveland Clinic. As a hematology fellow in the laboratory of Dr. William Matsui at The Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Gondek studied the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the development and progression of hematologic malignancies. Dr. Matsui, Dr. Gondek?s primary mentor, is a world-renowned expert in the field and was the first to report the importance Hedgehog signaling in the regulation of cancer stem cells in multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancer. Upon completion of his clinical and research fellowship Dr. Gondek joined the faculty as an Instructor of Oncology to develop the research translational program in MDS. Support from the K08 Career Development Award will enable Dr. Gondek to gain additional skills, receive mentorship and protected time to advance his academic career. Dr. Gondek?s goal is to become an independent investigator in and leader in MDS translational research.  In this application Dr. Gondek will study the role of a key regulator of Hedgehog signaling, Gli2, in normal hematopoiesis and progression of MDS. Hedgehog signaling seems to be a promising target in human malignancies and its inhibition has shown to be effective in certain tumors. To this end, the efforts to explain the role of Hh in normal and malignant hematopoiesis focused on upstream components of the pathway (e.g. Patched and Smoothened) but the results have been ambiguous. In this proposal Dr. Gondek will elucidate the function of the key Hh regulator Gli2 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis and define the role Gli2 as a selective and safe therapeutic target.  Using transgenic animal models the proposed research will elucidate the role of Gli2 loss and gain-of- function in normal hematopoiesis and MDS progression. These goals will be achieved through the following aims: 1) Determine the role of Gli2 loss in (a) normal definitive hematopoiesis and (b) MDS progression using Nup98-HoxD13 mouse model, 2) Determine the requirements of Gli2 activator for (a) normal hematopoiesis and its role in (b) progression of MDS.  Results of this research will further the understanding of Gli2 function in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. The investigators hypothesize that this project will provide novel insights into the processes that drive MDS progression and may lead to strategies focused on targeted Gli2 inhibition as a new treatment for high risk MDS and leukemia."
"9314073","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Reproductive success of any species relies critically on germ cell development. Germ cells are totipotent cells that transfer their genome form one generation into the next. Upon fertilization, they differentiate into all somatic lineages while setting aside a fraction of cells that give rise to future germ cells. They realize this feat by establishing a germline specific genomic landscape through transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling coupled with an expansive post-transcriptional regulation involving mRNA localization. Germ cells form germ granules and all organisms depend on these granules for germ cell function. mRNAs enrich within granules where their translation and degradation is regulated. First, critical steps of germ cell development rely entirely on post-transcriptional events such as mRNA localization. This process is fundamental in achieving spatial and temporal control of mRNA translation and stability not only during Drosophila germ cell specification but also during mammalian spermatogenesis. Thus, to understand germ cell development and the reproductive success of any species it is paramount to characterize the mechanisms that govern mRNA localization to germ granules. Lack of adequate spatial and temporal sensitivity to resolve single mRNAs specifically in the germline in intact organism through development has profoundly hindered our ability to fully understand the mechanisms and the impact of mRNA localization on germ cell development. Using a genetically amenable model organism such as the fruit fly, coupled with biochemistry and single-mRNA imaging, provides an ideal strategy to complement mammalian research. During my postdoctoral studies, I developed a super-resolution approach where I coupled single-mRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) with structural illumination microscopy (SIM) and showed that multiple mRNAs form homotypic clusters that are asymmetrically- distributed in granules. In contrast, proteins were evenly distributed within granules. My hypothesis is that the mRNA itself plays an instructive role in mRNA localization and germ granule assembly. Here, I present a focused strategy to address my hypothesis and characterize the formation of homotypic clusters and germ granules in vitro and in vivo. With much improved resolution over SIM, I will implement stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) super-resolution and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to dissect how mRNA clusters form in the embryo and in reconstructed germ granules in Drosophila S2 cells, identify sequences that drive clustering and identify the biological relevance of clustering. I will then identify proteins that promote higher-order RNA clustering. Finally I will examine how mRNAs and granule proteins promote granule assembly. The knowledge gained in this study will provide understanding of how mRNA localization shapes germ cell development. Given that many features of germ cell development are conserved among species, any genes, networks and mechanisms identified as well as technologies developed could be implemented to study germ cell development and reproduction in other organisms."
"9460766","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tannerella forsythia is major periodontal pathogen implicated in the development and severity of periodontal disease pathogenesis. In spite of its importance in periodontitis T. forsythia remains one of the most understudied periodontal pathogens, partly due to its fastidious and slow growth as well as of the lack of good genetic system useful for manipulation of this organism. So far, only a few virulence factors have been described for T. forsythia. It has been showed its interaction with epithelial cells and synergisti relations with other bacteria in the oral community such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. Although not always possible, the best way to study a microorganism is within its own habitat, in situ. We characterized in vivo gene expression profiles of subgingival biofilm samples in advanced periodontitis using metatranscriptomic analyses. A comparison of data from periodontitis and health revealed the presence of a highly up-regulated region in the genome of T. forsythia during periodontal disease. Interestingly, after hits normalization this region was highly up regulated. We believe that the high expression of this region during disease may indicate its clinical relevance. Two different annotations have been proposed for the transcripts by the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD): a cell wall hydrolase and a Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV. The principal Aim for this proposal is: To characterize the most highly expressed proteins of T. forsythia during periodontal disease. The first step will be elucidating whether that region encodes one or two proteins. In the second part of the project the protein will be characterized in order to identify ts enzymatic activity and clarify which of the two annotations by HOMD is correct. T. forsythia requires external sources of N-acetylmuramic acid to grow. It has been hypothesized that T. forsythia may assist dampening of inflammation and evading the host immune system through the degradation of peptidoglycan released from the oral biofilm which is toxic for the host. In case we detect cell wall hydrolase activity we will pursue that hypothesis. If DDPIV protease activity is identified, T. forsythia may be directly involved in host tissue destruction and we woud have identified a new virulence factor. The studies proposed in this application are aimed at understanding the functions of highly up-regulated T. forsythia proteins during in periodontal disease."
"9269555","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metabolic and innate immune responses, two primitive systems critical for the long-term homeostasis of multi-cellular organisms, have evolved to promote cooperative, adaptive responses against diverse environmental challenges. Conversely, over-nutrition associated with modern high-calorie diets often leads to mis-regulation of metabolic-innate immune interactions and the development of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type II diabetes. Thus, there is a critical need to characterize the mechanistic connection and coordination of these responses. The goal of our research is to use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a simple model system to uncover the origin of metabolic-innate immune interactions in order to advance our knowledge of diet-mediated metabolic imbalances in humans. In this proposal, we plan to characterize a novel interaction between the innate immune transcription factor NFkB and the insulin-responsive metabolic transcription factor Foxo. NFkB transcription factors, evolutionarily conserved regulators of innate immunity, are emerging as a critical node in the bidirectional communication and coordination of metabolic and innate immune signaling pathway interactions. Using Drosophila, an important model organism for the study of metabolism and integrative physiology, we have previously established a role for Foxo transcriptional function in the control of NFkB-mediated innate immune responses. We now provide further evidence that diet-dependent NFkB activity in the Drosophila fatbody (similar to mammalian adipose tissue) can also impact lipid homeostasis through the regulation of Foxo function; establishing a cellular Foxo/NFkB 'homeostatic module' that governs metabolic and innate immune responses through mutual regulation of transcription factor activity. Drosophila provide an invaluable, genetically tractabl model to characterize this module, as these signaling networks are conserved from flies to humans. Interestingly, the Drosophila fatbody combines functions of nutrient and pathogen sensing organs, highlighting the inherent association between metabolic state and innate immune function. There are three specific aims to this proposal: (i) To assess the role of fatbody-specific NFkB activity in the regulation of lipid homeostasis; (ii) to characterize the molecular and cellular interaction between Foxo and NFkB; and (iii) to assess the role of fatbody-specific Foxo/NFkB interactions in the regulation of nutrient- dependent metabolic adaptation. Using the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila, coupled with integrative molecular, cellular, physiological, and high-throughput diet-mediated approaches, we will define this interaction at multiple levels of biological organization. Exploiting Drosophila to explore th origin of metabolic-innate immune interactions holds tremendous promise for an enhanced rate of uncovering both novel disease mechanisms and pharmaceutical targets aimed at treating the underlying metabolic imbalances that lead to pathologies such as obesity and type II diabetes."

"9462279","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease with significant health and economic burdens that lacks an established therapy to prevent recurrent episodes or progression to chronic disease. Our long-term goal is to develop therapies for these diseases. The absence of effective therapies stems in part from our limited understanding about the pathophysiology of pancreatitis. The prevailing trypsin-dependent model holds that intracellular trypsinogen activation and failure of protective mechanisms responsible for trypsin inactivation are central to pathogenesis. Despite great effort the role of trypsin in pancreatitis remains speculative and incompletely defined. Recent studies suggest another mechanism for disease in patients with mutations in exocrine proteins, disruption of normal protein homeostasis and activation of ER overload pathways. As a result, expression of the mutant proteins is toxic to acinar cells and increases the risk for pancreatitis. With this model, the approach to developing new therapeutics would differ significantly from approaches based on the trypsin-dependent model. Herein, we address the hypothesis that carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) mutants associated with chronic pancreatitis activate adaptive cell signaling pathways and cell death pathways, initiate an inflammatory response and increase susceptibility of cells to injury by metabolic stress. The CEL mutations occur in the region containing a variable number of proline-rich tandem repeats (VNTR). Our preliminary data show that the DEL variants accumulate within the cells as aggregates and activate adaptive cell signaling pathways. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the cellular pathways for the disposal of insoluble aggregates of CEL VNTR variants; 2) Identify the adaptive cell signaling pathways activated by expression of CEL VNTR variants; 3) Confirm our ex vivo results in mouse models that express CEL VNTR variants in the pancreas. The knowledge gained by the proposed studies will improve the overall understanding of pancreatic injury and provide insight into potential pharmacological interventions directed at a new therapeutic target, protein homeostasis."
"9235286","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The display of patterned spontaneous activity is an emergent property of the immature nervous system that is thought to mediate synaptic competition and instruct self- organization in many developing neural circuits. In the visual system, isolated (in vitro) preparations of developing retina exhibit propagating electrical activiy amongst neighboring retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), termed 'retinal waves'. Since RGCs relay visual information to higher order structures in the central nervous system, retinal waves are thought to play a key role in activity-dependent refinement of topographic neural maps in the superior colliculus (SC), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and visual cortex (VCtx). However, the role of retinal waves in neural circuit development remains remarkably controversial, in part because their existence has never been demonstrated in vivo. Previous work using extracellular microelectrode recording techniques in vivo demonstrated limited and local correlated spiking between pairs of embryonic rat RGCs, but no assessment of wave activity has been undertaken in vivo, likely because of the methodological challenges associated with recording from a large cohort of RGCs in neonatal animals. In this proposal, we use a highly novel imaging approach to examine and characterize spontaneous activity throughout the visual neuraxis, including RGCs, the SC and VCtx, in neonatal mice in vivo. We seek to establish whether traveling waves of spontaneous activity occur in awake, behaving neonatal mice, and examine the spatiotemporal properties of waves throughout the developing visual system during the first two weeks after birth. Our preliminary data indicates that spontaneous retinal waves are present for at least a week of development in vivo and exhibit a similar profile of spatiotemporal properties as those described previously in vitro. Moreover, retinal waves generate matched activity patterns in the midbrain and visual cortex. Given the remarkable fidelity of retinal waves during the period prior to eye opening in mice we report here in vivo, together with previous work demonstrating that spontaneous waves within macaque retina are present in vitro before birth, it seems likely that the visual system experiences patterned activation by retinal waves for a substantial gestational period during human fetal development that may be crucial for shaping the functional maturation of neural circuits before the onset of sensory experience. In all, these experiments are designed to investigate the properties and role of patterned spontaneous activity in vivo in the development of neural circuits in the mammalian visual system."
"9249674","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excess dietary salt causes target organ damage and increases the risk for adverse cardiovascular (CV) events independent of blood pressure (BP). Recent data in salt-resistant, normotensive rodents suggest that high dietary salt enhances the excitability or gain of sympathetic circuits, exaggerates sympathetic and CV responses to various stimuli, and increases BP variability (BPV). There are limited data regarding the impact of dietary salt intake on sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and CV function in salt-resistant humans as well as the underlying mechanisms contributing to these adverse effects. Our long-term goal is to determine how dietary salt adversely affects BP regulation and CV health. The objective of this proposal is 2-fold: (1) to comprehensively evaluate the impact of dietary salt intake on SNA and CV reactivity and BPV in normotensive humans, and (2) to identify novel mechanisms underlying these adverse neurogenic effects of dietary salt using salt-resistant rodents. Our working hypothesis is that high dietary salt elevates plasma [Na+] to activate forebrain osmoreceptors via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This subsequently sensitizes neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) through a local activation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and decrease in resting K+ conductance. In turn, both human subjects and animals have exaggerated SNA and BP responses to a variety of stimuli thereby leading to increased BPV and greater risk for adverse CV events. We will test this hypothesis through 4 specific aims: 1) Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that high dietary salt increases SNA and CV reactivity in normotensive adults, 2) Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that high dietary salt increases BPV in normotensive adults, 3) Aim 3 will determine the extent by which a high salt diet induces neuroplasticity and alterations in membrane properties of RVLM neurons via local activation of AT1R to exaggerate SNA reflexes and increase BPV, and 4) Aim 4 will determine the extent by which changes in plasma sodium concentration and ENaC alter RVLM neurons and exaggerate SNA reflexes and increase BPV. To address both objectives through these aims, we have established a unique multi-institutional, multi-PI collaboration that includes a human CV physiologist and an animal neurophysiologist. This combination uniquely positions the research team to readily translate findings in animal models to humans and impact CV health. The expected outcome is to definitively demonstrate that dietary salt loading increases CV reactivity and BPV through a sympathetic nervous system mechanism that originates in the brain. The proposed research is significant, as these studies will provide empirical evidence that dietary salt intake impacts neurohumoral control of the circulation in salt-resistant humans. In addition, the proposed studies in rodents will identify novel mechanisms underlying these adverse effects and thereby create a platform for new therapeutic targets. The proposed research is innovative because it will identify a novel neurogenic action of dietary salt in human CV regulation."
"9254215","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impaired arm function is a major cause of chronic disability among stroke survivors. A number of treatment approaches have been developed to facilitate the recovery of arm function, targeting stroke induced motor impairments such as paresis, spasticity and losses of independent joint control that result in involuntary elbow, wrist and finger flexion while lifting the arm (i.e., the flexion synergy). However, our understanding of how muscle adapts to these impairments over time is not clear at this juncture nor how changes in muscle properties impact the functional use of the paretic arm. Therefore, we propose to determine the extent of structural changes in the skeletal muscles of the paretic arm due to the persistence of a prominent flexion synergy, paresis, and the associated disuse of the paretic upper limb. Subsequently, we propose to demonstrate the effects of these secondary musculoskeletal changes on the ability to generate functional arm movements by using novel simulations of combined arm and hand motion. We postulate that the flexion synergy, paresis, and the chronic disuse of the paretic upper limb that results from the stroke, induce substantial changes in both passive and active muscle properties, thus limiting the ability to generate functional arm movements, even if normal neural drive from the brain would be restored. In Aim 1, we propose to investigate the relationship between the abnormal flexion synergy and increases in passive stiffness that result in more flexed arm postures in individuals with stroke. In Aim 2 we propose to characterize changes in muscle architectural parameters (i.e., fascicle and sarcomere length, and muscle volume) following stroke and determine the effect of any structural deviations from age-matched able-bodied individuals on maximum isometric force generation ability, as indicated by calculating muscle physiological cross-sectional area, a standard anatomical measure of an individual muscle's ability to generate force. Finally, as part of Aim 3 we propose to employ state-of-the-art forward dynamics simulation techniques using an upper limb model that integrates the arm and hand to determine the extent to which altered muscle properties (Aims 1 & 2) and abnormal muscle co-activation patterns (Aim 1) account for the severe limitations in functional use of the upper limb experienced by individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that determining the exact role of altered muscle properties on functional use of the paretic upper limb following chronic hemiparetic stroke will allow for the design of more effective rehabilitation interventions This will change the way clinicians approach the rehabilitation of the paretic upper limb by highlighting the relative importance of the various musculoskeletal changes which combined with the proposed measurement tools provide the means to design and test therapies to reduce or prevent detrimental changes in muscle following stroke."
"9242668","PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instructions):  The primary goal of the SCCPIR Outreach Core is to increase public understanding of and support for basic and clinical research in the reproductive sciences. Ongoing ONPRC outreach programs primarily target students (10 years of age through graduate school). This Core will expand our reach into the adult population (while also providing enhanced opportunities for high school students) to promote better understanding of issues concerning reproductive health and infertility in these two groups. Implementation of the following objectives will allow us to achieve this goal: 1) a Science Cafe series, marketed to adults and high school students, featuring evening lectures given by reproductive scientists from ONPRC and OHSU on topics of basic science concepts and reproductive health issues; 2) a series of Science Saturdays for  adults, consisting of 3-hour classes to provide opportunities for adults to be exposed to cutting-edge reproductive science topics taught by research scientists and supported by hands-on laboratory activities; 3) a series of Mother-Daughter Science Saturday events, similar in content to the Science Saturdays, but marketed exclusively to women and their daughters/mothers; 4) a Science Camp for adults, consisting of  one evening each week for four weeks including hands-on activities, focusing on reproductive health and infertility issues; 5) an Infertility Saturday Academy for high school students consisting of six Saturdays of lecture and hands-on activities covering the topics of infertility and fertility control; and 6) a strong on-line presence to provide curricular materials for educators, information for website visitors, and promote our programs to the general public. An Advisory Group will be formed to review and refine our outreach efforts, consisting of members from the existing ONPRC Education Outreach Task Force, that includes scientists, animal technicians, and members of the lay community. The impact of our programs on attendees will be evaluated using pre- and post-tests. These data will be analyzed by a professional evaluator who will report to the Advisory Group and the SCCPIR P.l. (Dr. R. Stouffer), to assess the effectiveness of the SCCPIR outreach programs."
"9209621","Project Summary/Abstract  All mature blood cells are derived from rare hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that reside in the adult bone marrow. Evidence shows that proper gene expression in HSPCs is essential for maintenance of homeostasis. Moreover, recent work suggests that progenitor cells may be as important as hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in maintaining steady-state blood cell production and establishes a new level of complexity in blood cell production. Several transcription factors are critical for the formation and function of HSPCs, and for the differentiation to specific blood lineages. However, following hematologic injuries that reduce blood cell numbers, such as chemotherapy or toxic insult, a slow HSC response can result in life threatening complications from infection, bleeding, and anemia. Furthermore, malfunctioning HSPCs through dysregulated transcription factor expression can result in bone marrow failure or malignancies. Cell isolation through flow cytometry using specific surface markers has significantly refined the HSPC population. However, since tissues and populations are rarely homogeneous and consist of numerous distinct subsets, it has become increasingly clear that studying bulk populations of cells provides only limited knowledge, while interrogation of individual cells would provide insight into biological processes masked at the population level. Therefore, it is important to identify the molecular events regulating HSPC self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation during both steady-state and stress hematopoiesis at the single cell level. Additionally, the hereditable properties of individual clones suggested that some HSPCs are imbalanced with respect to myeloid versus lymphoid cell potential as well as cell cycle status that can alters their reconstitution potential. Our proposal will use droplet- based Barcoding and Analysis of Single Cells (dBASC) to discover distinct transcriptional and epigenetic clonality of the earliest events in adult hematopoiesis. Functional heterogeneity of HSPCs based on analysis of self-renewal and differentiation at a clonal level has been appreciated for some time through cell transplantation assays but our collaborators, Camargo, Scadden, and Zon and have taken this a step further to uncover steady-state clonal hematopoiesis. The transcriptional network within HSPCs to promote self-renew is maintained through several well-characterized pathways. Together with Dr. Orkin?s single cell RT-PCR approach, we will validate the importance of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation on HSPC clonality. By studying the transcriptional network that regulate self-renewal, stress and clonal hematopoiesis, our unique single cell approach will provide an important step toward our fundamental understanding of biology of HSPCs and progenitors."
"9389067","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of ongoing cell-therapy trials for ischemic heart disease (IHD) use bone marrow (BM)-derived progenitor cells (PCs); however, the efficacy remains modest. Major barriers to effective cell therapy include limited potential of PCs to differentiate to ECs and functional impairments of PCs from patients' background disease, such as diabetes which accounts for 40-65% of heart failure patients in the US. Recently we found that the E2F1 transcription factor contributes to EPC dysfunction in diabetic conditions by activating the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases 2 and 4 (PDK2/4). Deletion of E2F1 (E2F1-/-) in BM PCs leads to reduced PDK2/4 expression and increased oxygen consumption. These results are extremely exciting because PCs normally reside in their niche at a relatively quiescent state and rely primarily on glycolysis as fuel source (even with  sufficient oxygen supply), and recent reports suggest that a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation is required for their functional activation and differentiation. Indeed, we found that the altered metabolic activities in E2F1-/- PCs are associated with a dramatic increase in the capacity of endothelial differentiation. Remarkably, after administered to mice with myocardial infarction, E2F1-/- PCs generated significantly more ECs in the ischemic myocardium than WT PCs. Furthermore, we have identified that Sam68, an adaptor protein involved in high-fat diet (HFD) - induced insulin resistance, interacts with E2F1 and enhances E2F1-mediated PDK2/4 promoter activity. Collectively, accumulating evidence in the literature indicates that adult BM PCs, when recruited at sites of injury, are not readily differentiating int vascular cells despite the environmental angiogenic cues, and our results suggest that this checkpoint is enforced, at least partially, by E2F1-mediated metabolic control; thus inhibition o E2F1 may re-set the metabolic switch to permit PC differentiation and vascular repair. The goal of this application is to establish the role of the E2F1-PDK2/4 pathway in BM PC energy metabolism and differentiation, and to determine whether approaches that target this pathway could enhance the effectiveness of BM PC therapy for IDH with concurrent diabetes. Our central hypothesis is that E2F1 activates PDK2/4 expression, thus inhibiting glucose utilization and PC differentiation in ischemic reperfused heart, and that targeted inhibition of the E2F1-PDK2/4 pathway can promotes PC differentiation and cardiovascular repair. A series of experiments are proposed to (Aim 1) characterize the role and the underlying molecular mechanisms of E2F1-mediated PDK2/4 expression in the regulation of BM PC metabolism, differentiation, and function and to (Aim 2) evaluate the effectiveness of targeting the E2F1- PDK2/4 pathway for enhancement of BM PC recruitment, differentiation, and PC-mediated cardiovascular repair. We expect that this study will advance the field by establishing the crucial role of cellular metabolim in BM PC differentiation and opening new avenues into research for better cardiovascular cell therapy."
"9406446","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children hospitalized with severe illness in sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk of morbidity and mortality following discharge from hospital. These children represent an accessible high-risk population in which targeted interventions to prevent morbidity and mortality could have dramatic impact. A large cluster randomized trial of azithromycin delivered in a mass drug administration program within trachoma endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated an almost 50% mortality benefit in children 1-9 years of age in treated communities. However, mass drug administration of azithromycin leads to the rapid emergence of macrolide resistance within treated communities and is expensive. The targeted delivery of azithromycin to children at hospital discharge may be a novel and practical intervention to maximize benefit while minimizing risk of antibiotic resistance. We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of azithromycin provided at discharge, compared to placebo, in reducing mortality and re-hospitalization rates in children age 1-59 months in Kenya. The study will also investigate potential mechanisms by which azithromycin may reduce morbidity and mortality in this population and will assess the emergence of antibiotic resistance among treated individuals and their primary caregivers. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention will also be conducted."
"9265915","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The developmental mechanisms that lead to under-connectivity, over-connectivity, and mis-connectivity between association regions of the cerebral cortex in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and other diseases of cortical circuit development (DCCDs) remain undefined. Our published work from the last phase of this project, plus additional preliminary data, indicates that distinct cortical developmental mechanisms are disrupted in mouse genetic models of DiGeorge/22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS), a genetic syndrome with one of the strongest associations with ASD, ADHD and SCZ vulnerability. We will now test the hypothesis that selective, reversible developmental disruption of connections made by layer 2/3 cortical projection neurons between and within association cortices underlies behavioral changes in mouse models of 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS). We will define for the first time the relationship between selectively altered development in association cortices and pathologic changes in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, connectivity and behavior in genetic models of ASD, ADHD, and SCZ vulnerability. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether altered basal progenitor proliferation selectively diminishes of layer 2/3 cortical projection neuron (cPN) frequency in association regions in 22q11DS mouse models. We will evaluate changes in axon growth and guidance from the diminished population of layer 2/3 cPNs for quantitative and qualitative changes in association cortical connectivity. Our data will establish whether reduced layer 2/3 cPN neurogenesis and related disruption of axon growth account for 22q11DS behavioral pathology due to under-connectivity. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether metabolically-mediated changes in layer 2/3 cPN dendritic differentiation disrupt development of local synaptic contacts between layer 2/3 cPNs and key inhibitory or modulatory inputs in association cortical areas. We will assess the contribution of these changes, apparently influenced by distinct 22q11 candidate genes, independent of diminished layer 2/3 cPN genesis to key behavioral impairments in 22q11DS mouse models. In Specific Aim 3, we will assess the feasibility of reversing these developmental changes via pharmacological manipulation of antioxidant defense/reactive oxygen species clearance during development versus adulthood. Our current observations suggest that 22q11 deletion results in oxidative stress and diminished growth in cortical neurons, and that the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine can reverse these effects. Our work will provide a mechanistic foundation for current efforts to use antioxidants as a therapeutic agent for patients with a wide range of DCCDs. Together our results will define the selective contribution of developmental mechanisms that lead to association cortical over/under connectivity versus misconnectivity in ASD, ADHD or SCZ, and the relatively effectiveness of correcting specific developmental deficits for improving behavioral outcomes in DCCDs."
"9417288","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stroke is a major cause of disability, and the burden of stroke is increasing given increasing survival rates. Rehabilitation therapy after stroke therefore remains a major national concern, with an annual cost of several billion dollars. While rehabilitation therapy of increased intensity and duration have been firmly linked with improved patient outcomes, many patients do not receive this due to issues such as cost and access. Methods are needed to deliver stroke rehabilitation in a maximally efficient manner. A telehealth solution might be useful to address these issues. This study aims to determine if telerehabilitation is comparably efficacious with outpatient clinic therapy, using a single-blind, randomized, non-inferiority study design. The primary endpoint is the change in arm motor status from baseline to 1 month post-therapy. A pilot study found that telerehab performed well at increasing patient knowledge on stroke prevention and risk factor control. The current study will confirm this result and will determine whether these gains in knowledge extend to real world improvement in two hard endpoints relevant to stroke patient outcomes: body weight and blood pressure control. Because compliance with many forms of therapy is often limited, hypotheses related to inter-subject differences in compliance will be tested. The long-term goal of this program is to develop a comprehensive system for delivery of telerehabilitation in the home that increases access to high intensity therapy using an economically sound approach, and thereby improves patient outcomes. The current proposal is a major step in this direction."
"9331254","Project Summary We seek funding for the highly successful and unique Red Cells Gordon Research Conference (GRC), which has been ongoing since 1979, and the accompanying Gordon Research Seminars (GRS) for trainees, which was initiated in 2013 and has received outstanding attendee scores for two previous meetings. The conferences provide a relaxed, collegial venue to unite diverse investigators working on all aspects of erythrocyte biology, from basic science to translational research on blood disorders. The upcoming Red Cells GRS/GRC meetings will occur July 15-16, 2017 and July 16-21, 2017, respectively, at the Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island, located about 80 miles from the Boston International Airport. The Red Cells GRC will present the most cutting edge, unpublished research on diverse topics including the ontogeny of erythropoiesis, derivation of erythrocytes from pluripotent stem cells, membrane cytoskeletal proteins, genetic/epigenetic regulation of erythroid transcription, cytokine signaling pathways that stimulate erythropoiesis, iron/heme biology, specialized aspects of terminal erythroid maturation and anemias due to genetic and/or infectious causes. In addition, NIH program officers will discuss new funding and training initiatives, and a distinguished speaker will give a keynote address providing a historical overview of the field. The Red Cells GRS will occur over 1.5 days prior to the GRC and include short talks and poster sessions by postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, a keynote address, and workshops on mentoring and career development from successful scientists and physician-scientists from academia, industry and government. Selected trainee talks will be presented at the subsequent GRC. Overall, the Red Cells GRS/GRC serve two important missions of the NIH, particularly the Hematology Branch of the NIDDK and the Blood Diseases Branch of the NHLBI: 1) to promote health-related research that will improve our understanding of blood disorders and lead to new cures, and 2) to enhance the pipeline of new biomedical investigators through support, encouragement and exposure to outstanding scientific research."
"9389315","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will examine the acquisition of conditioned drug-related responses in healthy adults. Conditioned drug cues are believe to play an important role in drug use, especially in relapse when they illicit drug-seeking behavior. Although numerous studies have demonstrated acquisition of conditioned drug cues in animal models, few studies have examined acquisition and expression of these responses in humans. To understand how conditioned stimuli acquire their powerful motivational force, we need to understand how they are acquired, how the conditioned responses are manifested (e.g., behavioral, physiological, neural), and how they persist. The knowledge gained will provide a translational link between the rich animal literature and the human clinical situation, and eventually allow us to target the learned responses as targets for addiction treatment. We have developed a novel procedure to study acquisition of Pavlovian conditioned responses in humans, showing that visual and auditory stimuli paired with a moderate dose of methamphetamine acquire positive incentive properties. Here, we propose to refine the procedure. We will measure the responses using sensitive measures of behavior, physiology, and brain activity using fMRI. We will determine the optimal parameters of conditioning, test the persistence and extinction of the conditioned response, and test the effects of the stimulus on emotional responses and neural activity using fMRI. Together, these studies will improve our understanding of how conditioning contributes to drug use, and provide a strong method and empirical basis to study conditioning with other drugs, the effects of potential treatment medications, and individual differences in cue reactivity."
"9262286","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD), the most common of all polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, is characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of huntingtin (htt). Of particular importance to the etiology of HD is the N- terminal htt exon 1 (HDx1) region, which becomes progressively more prone to aggregation and misfolding as the length of its polyQ tract increases. Elevated numbers of glutamines (typically >40) cause the formation of various cytotoxic amyloid structures including fibrils, protofibrils and smaller oligomeric structures (Fig. 1). Cell and animal studies suggest that inhibition of misfolding is a promising avenue for preventing HD. However, the lack of structural information on these species has prevented a clear understanding of the mechanisms of HDx1 misfolding and hampered efforts to modulate this misfolding process as an avenue for therapeutic treatment. This proposal exploits two recent biochemical and methodological advances made by the Langen group. First, it became possible to generate clean preparations of various misfolded forms of HDx1 containing 46Q. These include two different fibril types, one that is toxic and one that is only weakly toxic, as well as a protofibrillar form of highly toxic HDx1. Second, together with Professors Siemer and Chiu, the Langen group has begun to apply a powerful and synergistic combination of structural methods that include site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) together with EPR, solid state NMR (ssNMR) and cryo-EM for studying HDx1 misfolding. The preliminary results have revealed exciting potential for this novel approach. The first aim seeks to compare and contrast the structures of toxic and weakly toxic HDx1 fibrils using SDSL, ssNMR and cryo-EM. This comparison will provide insights into the structural features that distinguish toxic from non-toxic forms of HDx1. Such information is likely to facilitate future efforts aimed at preventin the formation of toxic species. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the structures of highly toxc, A11 positive protofibrils, which form early during the misfolding process. Such early misfolding intermediates have been suggested to be the primary toxic pathogens in many amyloid diseases, but their structures remain poorly understood. Specific Aim 3 follows up on preliminary data that show that negatively charged membranes, especially those mimicking mitochondrial membranes, potently accelerate misfolding and promote the formation of toxic, A11 positive structures. This aim will study how membranes accelerate HDx1 misfolding and how this interaction, in turn, may disrupt membrane integrity. The proposed studies might explain how interaction of Hdx1 with cellular membranes can promote toxicity and why mitochondrial function is so disrupted in HD patients. Phosphorylation at positions 13 and 16 has been shown to protect from toxicity. In order to understand how this modification might be protective, we will test how it affects the formation of fibrils, toxic protofibrils and membrane-mediated misfolding."
"9316408","PROJECT SUMMARY This application is submitted in response to PA-13-194: Mechanisms of alcohol and nicotine co-addiction. Allelic variation in CHRNA5, the gene encoding the ?5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit, increases vulnerability to alcohol and tobacco dependence. Here, we will use cutting-edge molecular, genetic and behavioral techniques to investigate the role for ?5* nAChRs, particularly those in the medial habenula (MHb)-interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) pathway where ?5* nAChRs are densely expressed, in regulating the motivational properties of alcohol. In Specific Aim I, we will assess alcohol drinking in two lines of mice with deficient ?5* nAChR signaling: ?5 subunit knockout mice and ?humanized? knock-in mice in which the ?5 nAChR subunit gene has been genetically modified to express the major risk allele for tobacco and alcohol dependence in humans. Second, we will use the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure to assess the rewarding and aversive effects of alcohol in these lines of mutant mice. We predict that alcohol intake will be increased, and aversive effects of alcohol decreased, in mice with deficient ?5* nAChR signaling. In Specific Aim II, we will investigate the effects of alcohol on the MHb-IPN system. First, we will use optogenetics coupled with electrophysiological recordings to examine the effects of alcohol on excitatory and inhibitory transmission at the MHb-IPN synapse and determine the role for ?5* nAChRs in these effects. Second, we will use rubidium efflux assays to determine the effects of alcohol drinking on the activity of ?5* nAChRs in the MHb-IPN system. We predict that alcohol stimulates excitatory MHb inputs to IPN ? an ?aversion? signal ? and that this effect is attenuated by deficient ?5* nAChR signaling. We further predict that prolonged alcohol intake results in diminished activity of ?5* nAChRs in MHb-IPN system, which may contribute to the development of the alcohol drinking habit. In Specific Aim III, we will investigate the involvement of the MHb-IPN system, and ?5* nAChRs in this system, in regulating alcohol drinking. First, we will use an elegant Cre recombinase-dependent chemogenetics (DREADD) approach to stimulate or inhibit neurons in the MHb-IPN system, or more selectively only those MHb-IPN neurons that express ?5* nAChRs, and examine effects on alcohol drinking. Second, we will use virus-mediated gene transfer to re-express otherwise absent ?5 nAChR subunits in MHb or IPN neurons of the ?5 KO mice and examine the effects on alcohol drinking in these mice. We predict that the MHb-IPN system, and ?5* nAChRs in this system, play a key role in regulating alcohol intake. This innovative program of research may yield novel insights into the mechanisms of alcohol dependence that supports development of entirely new classes of therapeutic agents."
"9234413","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelin is a multi-lamellar sheath made from the plasma membrane of specialized glial cells that surrounds axons and allows for the rapid firing of action potentials in the nervous system. In addition to insulation, myelinating glia provide vitl trophic support and nutrients to axons and loss of myelin can result in severe diseases of the nervous system, including multiple sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Two unique myelinating glial cell types, oligodendrocytes (OLs) and Schwann cells (SCs), are responsible for myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), respectively. Although the implications of myelin loss or disruption for human health are clear, it  is necessary to learn more about the development of myelinating glia in order to lay the foundation for developing new therapies for myelin diseases.  To uncover new regulators of myelination, our lab performed a large-scale forward genetic screen in zebrafish. One of the mutants found in the screen, stl83, displayed a severe myelin reduction in both the CNS and PNS as well as axon swellings. Whole genome sequencing technology and complementation analysis were used to determine that the stl83 phenotype is the result of a missense mutation in the gene actin-related protein 10 (actr10), which encodes a critical component of the dynactin complex. Dynactin is necessary for proper function of the molecular motor dynein, which is responsible for the retrograde transport of cellular cargo, including organelles, mRNA, and proteins along microtubules. In general, actr10 is understudied; specifically, a role for actr10 in  myelinating glia has never been described. This proposal therefore seeks to determine how actr10 regulates the development and myelination of OLs and SCs. In Aim 1, I will characterize defects observed in actr10 zebrafish mutants in order to determine the stage at which actr10 regulates myelination and test whether the deficits are glial cell autonomous. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism whereby actr10 mediates myelination in glia. The proposed aims will illuminate how actr10 regulates myelination of the CNS and PNS."
"9252594","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian brain have been demonstrated to play important roles in the plasticity of higher brain function and repair and regeneration after brain damage. Yet, our understanding of the regulation of adult NSCs at the molecular level remains sketchy, and this is one of the reasons for why strategies to harness the capacity of endogenous NSCs for brain repair have not yet made sufficient progress for clinical applications. The goal of this study is to fill in this current knowledge gap by identifying crucial regulatory mechanisms in adult NSCs using mouse as a model system. In particular, our recent studies have shown that the homeodomain transcription factor (TF) Gsx2 and basic helix-loop-helix TF Ascl1, which have been well known for their essential roles in embryonic brain development, play vital roles in controlling NSCs in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Importantly, we found that Gsx2 and Ascl1 control adult-specific regulatory steps in NSCs. We also have shown that these TFs play essential roles in injury-induced neurogenesis. Our preliminary studies further suggest that unlike in embryos in which Gsx2 and Ascl1 act in a linear cascade (Gsx2 ¿ Ascl1 ¿ neurogenesis), their cross-inhibition plays a key role in controlling the fate of adult NSCs. Based on these novel findings and in vivo tools, we will test the hypothesis that Gsx2 and Ascl1, as well as their downstream effectors, play crucial roles in controlling NSCs in adult-specific manners under intact and injury conditions in the following three specific aims: Aim 1 will reveal novel mechanisms for lineage progression of adult NSCs through studies on Gsx2, Ascl1, and their downstream targets. ; Aim 2 will reveal novel mechanisms for regional specification of NSCs and neuronal subtype specification of olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons through studies on the regulation of Gsx2 and its downstream factors.; Aim 3 will reveal novel mechanisms for injury-induced neurogenesis through studies on the regulation of the expression and action of Gsx2."
"9209619","Lifelong hematopoiesis involves the proliferation and differentiation of successive clones into mature blood lineages. Mono- or oligoclonal hematopoiesis can occur in elderly patients who have somatic TET2 or DNMT3A mutations. The production of blood by one or a few clones with somatic mutations renders patients susceptible to blood disorders such as refractory cytopenias or myelodysplasia. It is unclear which combinations of these mutations are sufficient to promote clonal dominance or maintain malignancy. Here, we have developed a system in the zebrafish to study the genetics of clonality. A Zebrabow fish allows for clonal labeling of stem cells and their progeny with random combinations of three fluorescent proteins, providing enough diversity to produce up to 30 detectable colors. Using a tissue-specific inducible CreERT2 system, we labeled stem cells at 36 hpf of development and then grew the animal to adulthood. This labeled roughly 20 clones of cells, establishing that there are 20 cells of the developing aorta that contributed to adult hematopoiesis. We have also developed tissue-specific CRISPR technology to target multiple genes simultaneously. Using this approach, we will look for gene combinations that are required for clonal hematopoiesis. We then will undertake a chemical screen to find pathways that suppress clonal dominance. Single cell analysis with the Tenen and Orkin labs will be used to examine specific gene expression in particular dominant clones after FACS isolation. We plan to evaluate the activity of the genes and small molecules discovered using the zebrafish in the mouse Hue system (Scadden) and the transposon barcoding strategy (Camargo). Our collaboration with Dr. Orkin will identify chromatin factors required for the establishment of normal clonal dynamics. Our studies will have an impact on understanding early clonal events that regulate normal and malignant hematopoiesis, and could develop novel therapeutics to suppress clonal hematopoiesis."

"9226140","Description This small grant application, developed in response to PA-14-037 (Women & Sex/Gender Differences in Drug and Alcohol Abuse/Dependence), integrates the team?s expertise in neurobehavioral assessment and investigation of sex differences with a growing literature regarding the potential efficacy of cognitive retraining in facilitating recovery among persons with substance use disorders (SUDs). As a pilot project, we ask whether cognitive training specifically focused on remediating compromise in top-down control processes underlying selective attention has differential benefits for treatment-seeking men vs. women. We recognize that although neurocognitive improvement during training is desired, of practical import is whether gains are achieved during training transfer to other tasks and settings. Therefore, we propose to examine transfer of training gains to tasks/domains varying in their similarity to training demands. Furthermore, given noted sex differences in emotional processing and the purported role of emotional factors in women?s substance use, we include training that engages emotional processing via the use of affective stimuli (faces and words) as an experimental variable; we posit that both men and women will benefit, but that women may benefit to a greater degree. To interrogate individual differences and inform further treatment development, we will examine associations between/among pre-intervention measures including demographic and substance use histories, family history of SUDs, interpersonal problems, neurocognitive performance and training-related improvements as well as psychosocial adaptation and substance use after discharge; These analyses are enabled by the overlap between the proposed work and the on-going R01 (AA022456, PI Nixon). In the current proposal, we focus on treatment-seekers with alcohol use disorders (AUD) who may or may not meet criteria for other substance use disorders (SUD). To address our objectives/aims, we propose that equal numbers of treatment- seeking men and women (Ss) be randomly assigned to one of two active training interventions (neutral or affective stimuli). Ss will complete baseline and post-intervention testing and will be contacted on a monthly basis for ~ 3 months following discharge to assess substance use and psychosocial adaptation. To control for abstinence-related recovery, a third group of Ss who meet identical selection criteria will complete pre- and post-intervention testing but will not engage in the intervention. The data will inform questions of neurocognitive recovery and sex differences and guide development of more comprehensive initiatives. The feasibility of the work is enhanced by concurrent work addressing parallel questions in the PI?s laboratory."
"9360393","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The rising prevalence of severe obesity in early childhood, especially in underrepresented minorities, is a challenge to the cardio-metabolic health of our youth. Although largely attributed to the environment, heredity plays a significant role in determining adiposity. The influence of these genetic factors is largely undefined in children from underrepresented minorities where the prevalence is the highest. This study seeks to identify the rare genetic variants contributing to severe obesity in a large cohort of children with severe early onset obesity from mixed ethnic groups. The primary goal is to explain the biology of extreme obesity by understanding the effects of genetic variants on physiological attributes leading to extreme obesity. We hypothesize that the burden of genetic variants related to obesity will be higher in children with severe early onset of obesity,  The sample of subjects is selected from children with severe obesity (BMI > 120% of the 95th percentile, equivalent to Class II obesity or higher), documented at an age less than 6 years. We have established a large multi-institutional collaborative cohort including a prospective family study of children attending the clinics at Boston Children?s Hospital that serve large populations of underrepresented minorities, a cohort at Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia using data extraction from the electronic health records and samples from the biorepository and a research cohort from the Columbia University Medical Center. For the prospective family study, children with severe obesity and their first-degree relatives are invited to participate in the study. In the collaborative cohort, we will perform whole exome sequencing in children with extremes of obesity, most rapid trajectory of growth of body mass index and those with family structure favorable for mendelian pattern of inheritance. We will perform targeted sequencing of approximately 80 genes including those causing syndromic and non-syndromic forms of obesity, and those prioritized in the whole exome study in all other samples. We will develop an integrated genetic risk score based on the common and identified rare genetic variants, and correlate it with the longitudinal BMI trajectories and cardio-metabolic consequences extracted from the electronic health records. Additionally, we will perform metabolic phenotyping including energy intake and expenditure, body composition and hormonal response to a standard meal in a subgroup from the extreme tails of the genetic risk scores to understand the differences in physiology leading to severe obesity.  Individuals of different genetic ancestries can have different patterns of genetic variation. It is possible that studying multiple ethnicities may identify new genes. Children with rare variants of large effect, or varying genetic risk scores could help describe differences in physiology uncovering therapeutic targets, or a response to treatment that could eventually influence clinical care. Finally, our study cohort of underrepresented minorities will provide a unique replication/extension cohort for other large-scale genetic studies in children with severe obesity."
"9254454","MOLECULAR ANALYSIS / TRANSLATION GROUP MASS SPECTROMETRY / PROTEOMICS SHARED FACILITY (MSPSF) ABSTRACT The over-arching goal of the Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Shared Facility (MSPSF) is to provide state-of- the-art capabilities and training in mass spectrometry, proteomics, and bioanalytical technologies to support the research needs of UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB-CCC) members. The MSPSF is a research resource that provides services to UAB-CCC members that support the identification, characterization and quantification of proteins, as well as post-translational modifications. The proteins may be isolated from cells, biological fluids and tissues (fresh, frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE]). The MSPSF has streamlined and standardized its operations and offers cost-effective, high quality services to UAB-CCC members through utilization of standardized workflows and operating procedures that cover a wide range of applications including the identification of specific post-translational changes, global and targeted quantitative proteomics, and structural biology. The interface between data gathering and analysis has been strengthened and now includes basic and advanced informatics applications. In the current funding cycle, the MSPSF has expanded its services in response to the emerging needs and thematic emphasis of the UAB-CCC through initiatives undertaken in collaboration with other UAB-CCC Shared Facilities. These include the development and validation of robust proteomic analysis carried out using FFPE tissues from mouse and human and development of reagents and animals that permit utilization of approaches based on stable isotope-labeled amino acids in mice (SILAM). The MSPSF supports basic and clinical research within all six programs of the UAB-CCC that is focused on mass spectrometry/proteomics analyses of proteins in either purified or complex biological samples. During the current funding cycle 48 UAB-CCC members utilized the MSPSF to further their cancer research. Information gained provides critical insights that include biomarker discovery for disease diagnosis, progression, and therapeutic response; including changes in cellular pathways associated with a specific process. The services provided play an important role in translating basic science discoveries to clinical applications in the treatment of cancer."
"9247243","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The health effects and economic burden associated with cigarette smoke (CS) exposure are overwhelming. The primary health effects are associated with symptoms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Currently, there are no effective therapies to deter disease progression in COPD patients. Over the last several decades, research has primarily focused on pathologies attributed to oxidative stress and the proteolytic imbalance associated with macrophage and neutrophil functions. Although the significance of these leukocytes and their effector functions are well documented, the mechanisms that lead to their aberrant activation by CS are poorly understood. The goal of our laboratory is to investigate the pathways whereby CS exposure activates pulmonary leukocytes. In this project, we present compelling evidence for a role of the CLEC5A activating receptor in macrophage activation in COPD. Our preliminary studies reveal that CLEC5A, expressed on alveolar macrophage, plays an integral role in macrophage activation following CS exposure. We generated a Clec5a-deficient mouse strain that reveals an essential role for CLEC5A in macrophage activation and pulmonary injury following CS exposure. The Clec5a-deficient mice fail to develop the hallmark features of COPD including pulmonary inflammation, macrophage accumulation and airspace enlargement. Furthermore, using a novel CLEC5A receptor fusion protein and CLEC5A-expressing reporter cell line, we provide evidence that a unique, previously undiscovered ligand for CLEC5A is expressed on CS-exposed pulmonary epithelial cells. These findings suggest a novel mechanism that promotes airway inflammation and pathologies in response to CS exposure."
"9332692","Project Summary Homologous chromosome pairing and meiotic synapsis are essential processes that are required in both oogenesis and spermatogenesis to prevent aneuploidy and developmental defects in offspring. Despite the importance and high conservation of synapsis, not every aspect is the same between the two sexes. Heterogametic species have evolved less stringent or differential regulation of meiotic pairing and synapsis in order to successfully pass on their genetic information. My preliminary results indicate that male and female C. elegans even have different requirements for dynein in regulating the initiation of synapsis. Dynein dependent forces have been proposed to test that a potential homolog match is correct, and once this has been established, synapsis (SYP) protein loading between the homologs initiates. Knockdown of the dynein light chain (DLC-1) at an elevated temperature results in SYP polycomplex formation away from chromatin in females. Unexpectedly, DLC-1 depletion in males at the same temperature shows grossly normal synapsis. Even more surprisingly, mutants in the heavy chain and dynactin components of dynein also do not show SYP polycomplexes in female meiosis. This indicates that there is a previously undescribed function for DLC-1 in synapsis initiation. There are many examples of dynein-independent functions for DLC-1, including stabilizing or interrupting dimer interactions. A consensus binding motif for the DLC-1 ortholog has been reported, and there is a potential binding motif in one of the SYP proteins. I hypothesize that DLC-1 functions to regulate SYP protein interactions until correct pairing has been verified. I further hypothesize that males employ an alternative method to regulate synapsis initiation. Specific Aim I investigates the role that DLC-1 has in female meiosis by testing if it interacts directly with synapsis proteins, and DLC-1 interactors in female meiosis will be identified and tested for a role in synapsis initiation. Specific Aim II focuses on why males do not require DLC-1 by assessing if males need dynein at all in pairing chromosomes, and investigate whether a redundancy in light chains evolved in male meiosis. Understanding such sex specific differences in meiotic regulation using a genetically tractable organism will help us better understand natural and disease states in humans that lead to an increased incidence of aneuploidy and meiotically based infertility."
"9249579","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)          The overarching goals of our Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC) are to prevent disease and improve public health through innovative programs of excellence in environmental health sciences research, to engage communities to address environmental health issues, and to enhance career development of talented environmental health investigators. The EHSC provides the framework for the generation of novel research findings and their conversion into effective resources for public health officials, medical professionals, and the community. This tradition of success is based on our ability to recruit broad multi- and interdisciplinary expertis, maintain a strong emphasis on basic science principles while incorporating clinical and translational approaches, and effectively interact with the community. The specific mission of the EHSC at Rochester is to improve public health through the generation of fundamental knowledge and elaboration of mechanisms by which chemical exposures, alone or through interaction with other modifying factors, contribute to cumulative health risk across the life span As such, the theme that guides and integrates EHSC research and community engagement programs is the understanding of interactions of environmental and occupational agents with diverse individual contexts across the lifespan in modulating human disease and dysfunction. The goals of the Center are achieved through a major focus on three research programs: Pulmonary & Cardiovascular Disease Program, Neurodevelopmental & Neurodegenerative Disease Program, and Musculoskeletal Disease Program. While the Center is structurally organized into these Disease Programs, shared thematic biological processes, including immunological responses & inflammation, stem cell biology, early life sensitivities and mechanisms of adult disease, epigenetics, and nutritional/dietary factors, weave these programs together and synergize the research. These research efforts are supported by several structural units: Administrative Core, Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core, Biostatistics Facility Core, Community Outreach & Engagement Core, Pilot Project Program, and Career Development Program for Environmental Health Science Investigators."
"9267970","PROJECT SUMMARY The Cell Biology/Morphology Core provides BADERC investigators with technical support, equipment, advice and expertise for cell biological, immunocytochemical and morphological studies related to cell/membrane biology and signal transduction; cellular immunology and islet cell biology; and vascular and endothelial cell biology. The Core occupies space in the MGH Program in Membrane Biology facility on the 8th floor of the Simches Research Center, which is adjacent to the MGH main campus. The Core Director, Dr. Brown, has considerable expertize in the area of membrane biology, membrane proteins, and intracellular trafficking. He and his colleagues have a long and well-established track record of operating similar Core facilities in the context of other Centers and Program Projects over the past 25 years, including previous iterations of this BADERC Core. The aim of the Core is to provide an integrated cellular imaging solution to problems in Diabetes and other targeted research areas at a time when few or no isolated laboratories can develop the highest level of technical competence in the important and specialized areas served by the Core. The Cell Biology Core is designed to maximize the use and availability of several specialized items of equipment, that are not only prohibitively expensive for many laboratories, but that also require expensive and regular maintenance. This includes all aspects of microscopy from routine immunofluorescence work, confocal imaging, and (immuno)electron microscopy. The Core is especially proud of its record in successfully attracting NIH Shared Instrumentation Grants (SIGs) and institutional support over the years. With support of Core users, we have obtained 5 SIGs in little more than 10 years, the most recent of which was a $700K award in 2012 for a new Nikon A1R confocal platform that can offer sophisticated imaging and analysis capabilities to BADERC users including fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). In addition, a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRF) was purchased with MGH institutional funding, along with other important Core equipment over the years. Thus, the Core is continually striving to evolve and upgrade its equipment and expertize to allow its users to perform cutting edge research, and the MGH clearly appreciates the value of its services. A major and important objective of the Core is to provide an environment for the training of key personnel from participating laboratories, a strategy that has worked very successfully over the prior funding periods. Dr. Brown and his highly-qualified technical support staff have well-established and proven procedures in place for maximizing Core use in the context of varied projects and specific experimental requirements. The bottom line is that this Core works smoothly and well, and has done so for over two decades. Its use has resulted in several hundred publications over that time that contain images taken by Core staff, or by trained users, including over 60 in the previous BADERC funding period. We expect this to continue based on the usage proposed in this application."
"9209617","RESEARCH SUMMARY Hematopoiesis is now recognized as the integrated activity of multiple, largely progenitor clones with heterogeneous behavior. Clonal complexity is thought to diminish with age and human studies suggest that oligoclonal hematopoiesis with disease associated mutations is common. The presence of such clones incurs a substantial risk of hematologic neoplasia and all cause mortality. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular drivers of clonal behavior under stress conditions and to test whether modifying those drivers is capable of changing the relative competitive balance of normal and abnormal, risk bearing clones in animal models. We will use techniques of fluouresence clonal tracking in the mouse developed by us and compare these with retrotransposon clonal marking techniques in the mouse of Carmago and fluorescence clonal tracking techniques in the zebrafish developed by Zon. Further, we will characterize genetic characteristics of clones at single cell resolution using techniques of Tenen and define ncRNA candidate molecular drivers with Tenen. Finally, we will target epigenetic modifiers defined by Orkin, Tenen and Zon to test the impact on clonal competition between normal and mutant clones in vivo. Combined these complementary and collaborative approaches will point to methods for altering competitive relationships in hematopoiesis in favor of normal cells.  "
"9246564","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most-common inherited form of heart disease, characterized by thickening of the left ventricular wall, contractile dysfunction, and potentially fatal arrhythmias. There is extensive evidence that defects in excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) contribute to the pathogenesis of both cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Specialized membrane junctions known as 'junctional membrane complexes' (JMC) are important subcellular structures in L-type Ca channels (LTCC) on the plasmalemma communicate with ryanodine receptors (RyR2) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to initiate contraction. Little is known about the proteins that govern proper subcellular targeting of Ca channels within JMCs, but junctophilin-2 (JPH2) has been identified as a key candidate. In humans, missense mutations in JPH2 cause HCM, although the molecular mechanisms remain unresolved. We have recently demonstrated that JPH2 also binds to and modulates RyR2 channels in the JMC, but the exact protein domains involved in these interactions are still unknown. Moreover, reduced expression of JPH2 has been reported in patients with HCM and animal models of heart failure, but it is unclear whether loss of JPH2 is directly linked to impaired contractility and/or arrhythmias in failing hearts. We have generated several mouse models with HCM-linked JPH2 mutations or with increased/decreased JPH2 expression levels in the heart. The long-term goal of this project is to define the molecular mechanisms by which JPH2 and associated molecules regulate JMC integrity and EC coupling in normal hearts, and how aberrant JPH2 function causes HCM, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Our overall hypothesis is that in normal hearts JPH2 is required for JMC integrity and the regulation of Ca channels therein, whereas loss of JPH2 function due to downregulation or mutation causes cardiomyopathy, heart failure and arrhythmias. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: In Aim 1, determine the role of JPH2 in organizing key Ca handling proteins within the JMC. - In Aim 2, unravel the mechanisms by which genetic JPH2 variants cause HCM. - In Aim 3, determine if JPH2 downregulation is the cause of loss of TTs/JMCs in heart failure."
"9262998","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Active psychosis in schizophrenia is among the most severe and burdensome medical conditions worldwide. However, the mechanisms of psychotic symptoms in this disorder, such as hallucinations (i.e., abnormal percepts in the absence of external sensory stimuli), remain elusive. This K23 application presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator focused on the application of functional neuroimaging to the study of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The activities in this application build on the candidate's prior training and are set in a resource-rich environment that will foster his development of expertise in (1) advanced analytic methods and study conduct for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research; (2) computational neuroscience; (3) perception and cognition research; (4) pathophysiology and clinical assessment of schizophrenia; and (5) responsible and ethical conduct in scientific research with vulnerable populations. Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling, the current research proposal seeks to (1) define the neural mechanisms that generate hallucinations in schizophrenia; and (2) inform the development of a computational model of hallucinations based on predictive coding, an empirically-validated theoretical framework that supports a role of sensory systems in learning and predicting regularities in the external environment. The overarching hypothesis is that abnormal prediction-based attenuation of sensory cortical function produces excessive activity in the sensory cortex that generates hallucinations. To test this hypothesis, the present study will employ a novel speech discrimination fMRI paradigm, two groups of patients with schizophrenia, those with active, frequent auditory verbal hallucinations and those without a significant history of hallucinations, and a third group of healthy controls. This design will allo for testing a direct link between dysfunction in sensory predictive-coding mechanisms and the online experience of hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia, and will thus inform the neurobiological basis of psychotic symptoms in this disorder. Together, this training and research program will facilitate the candidate's transition to an independent research career and will help identify new therapeutic targets for refractory psychosis.  RELEVANCE: The novel application of the predictive-coding framework and model-based fMRI to the study of psychotic symptoms will shed new light on the mechanisms of generation of psychotic symptoms, thus filling an important gap in schizophrenia research. This project will serve to develop an explanatory model of hallucinations that can be used to generate specific, testable hypotheses for future neuroscience research in both humans and non-human animal models, and to uncover novel targets (sensory prediction deficits) likely modifiable by treatment via learning or pharmacotherapy."

The broad goal of this SCCPIR Center is to assess the independent and combined effects of testosterone (T) and a high calorie diet (typical of the Western-style diet; WSD) on reproductive function. The specific goal of the NHP Core is to provide significant cost savings to the SCCPIR Center projects. The NHP Core will lease and maintain 48 female rhesus monkeys for study by Projects l-lll. This will eliminate repeated lease fees and setup charges for the individual projects. The NHP Core will coordinate veterinary care and husbandry of the animals through the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC), Division of Animal Resources (DAR). The NHP Core will administer the WSD, thereby reducing per diem charges associated with the preparation of special diets. The NHP Core will provide a dedicated set of technical staff and management that would otherwise be cost prohibitive for studies of this size. The NHP Core staff is trained to perform routine surgical and other procedures (e.g. T implant placement) that would otherwise require scheduling with the DAR Surgical Unit, greatly saving on procedural costs. There will be no fee structure or chargebacks for Projects l-lll. The NHP Core will provide general supplies (syringes, blood tubes, storage vials, swabs, etc.) leaving individual investigators responsible only for costs for procedures/assays unique to their particular projects. Researchers will plan studies with the NHP Core during regularly scheduled meetings between Dr. Slayden, the core supervisor, and NHP Core staff.

"9244859","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MRI cerebral perfusion imaging is a widely disseminated technique on nearly all MRI scanners used for clinical diagnosis of brain disease and for neuroscience research. Over the last five years there has been considerably increased use of arterial spin labeling (ASL) for clinical diagnosis, while still i.v. injections of a gadoliium based contrast bolus are widely used clinically. Both brain perfusion methods, ASL and DSC techniques, involve making images very fast to identify the passage of blood through the capillary compartment. The image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is limited by the small (e.g., 3%) fraction of blood in tissue volumes. This is proportionately small but a second limitation is the time window of imaging, which is constrained to about 500-700 milliseconds for the capillary phase of blood passage. Therefore, rapid imaging of blood inflow is essential. For this reason DSC contrast based methods and ASL with multi-slice 2D EPI have not been able to satisfactorily image perfusion in the entire brain except with thick slices hence reduced spatial resolution. 3D imaging has therefore been developed as an alternative to 2D EPI. However, 2D images have certain desirable characteristics compared with 3D if there are patient motion artifacts. To overcome these limitations we propose to develop novel technology to acquire images simultaneously instead of separately. This approach called simultaneous multi-slice imaging ASL (SMS ASL) and SMS DSC increases by several fold the number of images that are acquired during the limited time window of capillary perfusion phase so the whole brain can be imaged. Another benefit of SMS-ASL is that the time to scan the brain can be greatly reduced by avoiding repeated scans of different brain areas, thus, reducing motion artifacts. A second major innovation in this project is the Hadamard encoded ASL, which is highly useful in clinical studies where the blood arterial transit time (ATT) is not known as in normal aging of people. The Hadamard-ASL acquires images at several different inflow times (TI) to be sure to capture the capillary perfusion phase of blood in at least one set of images. By acquiring the different TI values in a well-defined sub-bolus partitioning of the labeling period, their combination gives separated images at the distinct TI with essentially 2x the SNR and half the net scan time as required by current methodology which acquires each TI data set independently and sequentially. Both the Hadamard and the SMS can be combined for further improvements in SNR, speed and spatial resolution. This will highly impact the accessibility to patients and the robustness of the perfusion technology in clinical use. The availability of the new simultaneous perfusion imaging technology will give clinicians and researchers the capability of performing significantly improved MRI perfusion measurements in patients and these improvements will impact the diagnosis of many different brain diseases, including stroke, leukoencephalopathies and degenerative diseases; i.e., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Perfusion measurements of quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and ATT are important quantitative biomarkers useful as physiological imaging in evaluating new drug therapies for brain diseases. This family of new perfusion imaging techniques utilizes more efficient pulse sequences that provide major advantages in resolution, slice coverage, SNR and speed. The new simultaneous imaging will have high utility and be highly desirable for use on clinical scanners worldwide. The improved quantitative MRI perfusion imaging offers overall increased efficiency that is highly commercializable given they provide improved diagnostic approaches to evaluate brain disease and further improve specificity and sensitivity in MRI neuroradiological exams. The new sequences will be designed, implemented and evaluated on MRI scanners operating at 1.5 Tesla at AMRIT, at 3T at University of California Berkeley and at 3T and 7T at University of California, San Francisco Medical Center and at Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School. Once the new perfusion sequences are optimized they will be further evaluated and optimized in collaborative clinical test sites of UCSF Medical Center, UCLA and University of Pennsylvania. In addition to establishing their value in neuroradiology exams, they will be made into useful tools for basic and clinical neuroscience research."

"9254464","CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM) ABSTRACT The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC) is charged with maintaining the highest standards of clinical investigation that are aligned with all UAB, state and federal regulations, while assisting investigators in protocol development and maintaining efficient processes related to clinical investigations. The CPDM is responsible for the following significant functions: 1) Coordination, tracking, and reporting of all cancer clinical research activity undertaken at UAB, 2) Continuous improvement of the clinical trial activation process, 3) Ongoing education and training of clinicians and clinical research staff, 4) Clinical trial data quality monitoring, 5) Cancer clinical trial participant safety, and 6) Actively ensuring all sections of the population represented in the UAB CCC's catchment area have the opportunity to be represented in cancer clinical trials. CPDM adds value to the work of the UAB CCC members by providing support for protocol development as well as navigating the PRMS approval process, and assuring that there is knowledgeable and professional support for investigators at all stages of experience with the clinical trials process. The CPDM accomplishes this objective by providing centralized critical staff and infrastructure for all aspects of clinical research coordination and activation, as well as the efficient, and ethical conduct of open protocols. It provides the monitoring of the studies and all aspects of quality assurance. In addition, the CPDM provides a centralized database of protocol-specific data. This robust organization assures that all clinical trials have excellent support in protocol adherence, regulatory compliance, and recruitment (especially minority recruitment). Outstanding clinical trial support and quality of the CPDM are demonstrated by a number of objective measures described below; four FDA audits over the last 15 years (3 for high enrollment in FDA pivotal clinical trials and 1 for a gene therapy trial) resulted with no 483 forms being issued. Patient enrollment has increased over the last three years, especially to investigator-initiated and early phase clinical trials. The CPDM has taken steps to modify the staff and improve the infrastructure in response to the changes in UAB CCC research emphasis and faculty, and to the changing regulatory environment over the past five years: 1. The CPDM has relocated to the newly renovated Wallace Tumor Institute; 2. The CPDM has implemented OnCore®, a comprehensive clinical trials management system; 3. The CPDM has implemented the Clinical Trials Monitoring Committee (CTMC); this committee monitors in real time active clinical trials in the UAB CCC for patient safety; 4. The CPDM has incorporated specialized protocol management teams who have enhanced both investigator-coordinator interaction and accrual to trials in high-priority areas. In summary, the CPDM has expanded its capacity and aligned its focus with the changing needs of UAB CCC members. CPDM continues to provide excellent coordinating and monitoring support."
"9209615","OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This program brings together five hematopoiesis investigators who have been working collaboratively to address the fundamental question of how individual hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) are regulated to contribute to the production of blood under homeostatic and stress conditions. It creates a collective of complementary technologies developed in the investigator's laboratories to track individual clones in vivo and thereby to model how distinct clonal behaviors contribute to hematopoietic output under varying conditions. Furthermore, it employs innovative tools for manipulating specific molecular regulators of gene expression to test which molecules drive specific HSPC behaviors. These are tested in the context of inflammatory and genotoxic stress and are evaluated for their ability to alter the competitive relationship of normal HSPC with clones bearing blood disease associated alleles known to accumulate in the aging human. The cross comparison of models, species, time in development and molecular parameters (mRNA, meDNA, ncRNA, chromatin state) shared through an established common database and analytic tools provide a uniquely powerful means of defining with high resolution the process of hematopoiesis. By providing a mechanism to sustain interaction, share data and techniques and create a forum for resolution of conflicting data, this PO1 will facilitate the creation of a hematopoiesis `roadmap' whereby interventions at specific molecular waypoints can modulate blood cell production to enhance hematopoietic regeneration and limit aberrant clonal outgrowth in settings of disease."
"9246570","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this revised application is to determine the mechanisms by which sickle cell disease (SCD) increases inflammation and vasocongestion. Recently we reported that SCD increases circulating levels of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) and that nearly 70% of the total TLR4 reporter activity in SCD plasma could be inhibited by anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibodies. HMGB1 is a nuclear binding protein that aids in regulating gene expression and maintaining DNA structure. However, HMGB1 can also be released from activated neutrophils and injured cells and tissues. Once released, HMGB1 acts as a Damaged-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) that, depending on its thiol oxidation status, activates the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) or Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Although it is well-established that SCD increases neutrophil counts, neutrophil activation as well as tissue injury during vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), events that are all associated with HMGB1 release little is known about the role of HMGB1 in SCD. Here we hypothesize that SCD increases HMGB1 release which impairs EC function to increase vasocongestion. To test this hypothesis 3 aims are proposed. Aim 1 determines how SCD increases HMGB1 release and the impact this has on pathophysiology at baseline and after hypoxia\reoxygenation (H\R) injury. Sickle mice will be depleted of neutrophils and effects determined at baseline and after H/R injury with respect to HMGB1 activity and changes in levels of HMGB1, cf Hb and hemin. Aim 2 determines how HMGB1 impairs EC function with respect to vasodilatation, inflammation and adhesion. HMGB1 will be depleted in mice and effects of depletion determined with respect to vasodilatation; sVCAM-1, sICAM-1 and sE-selectin to assess EC injury and inflammation; and, with respect to WBC\RBC - EC interactions. Aim 3 determines the effects of oxidative stress in SCD on rates of HMGB1 thiol oxidation. The studies will determine how chronic states of oxidative stress in SCD mediate HMGB1 oxidation thiol status and the impact that HMGB1 oxidation status has on RAGE and TLR4 activity, inflammation and VOC. In vivo and ex vivo studies will reveal how targeting oxidative enzymes modulates HMGB1 oxidation status and isoform specific downstream signaling and pathophysiology. Studies will be performed in mice, in EC cultures and our RAGE & TLR4 reporter cell lines. The hypothesis tested is that oxidative stress in SCD accelerates oxidation of reduced HMGB1 to HMGB1 disulfide, establishing chronic states of TLR4 activation and increased IRF5 nuclear translocation, a potent signal for EC injury and death. These studies are designed to determine if and the extent to which the HMGB1-TLR4-IRF5 pathway is involved in the mechanisms by which SCD impairs EC function and increases vasocongestion. Our studies will provide some of the first evidence linking oxidative stress in SCD to the release and oxidation of HMGB1. Knowledge gained from our studies will help in the design of new therapeutic strategies for targeting HMGB1 to improve vascular health and limit vaso-occlusive crises in SCD."
"9242711","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autophagic-Lysosomal Stress Promotes Exosomal Release and Transfer of Proteins Autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease with strong evidence indicating that in aging and disease, this major protein/lipid quality control pathway is inefficiet. There is increasing association with genetic mutations that may contribute to lysosomal stress, including reduction in glucocerebrosidase (GC) function in Parkinson's and related disorders. The net effect is reduced lysosomal activity that may contribute to the accumulation of redundant proteins and dysfunctional organelles.  While most proteins are retained internally and sequestered as aggregates, recent work has shown that proteins like a-synuclein and tau can spread from one cell to another, or from one region to another. The transmission of pathology may be an opportunity for neurons to enhance self- preservation mechanisms extruding potentially toxic proteins into the extracellular milieu. We have evidence that chemically-induced lysosomal stress can increase the extracellular release in the form of exosomes and may contain proteotoxic elements. Exosomes are intracellular vesicles released from most cells that are readily taken into recipient cells and may represent a medium for pathological transfer of proteins. Further, it is likely that exosomal release is significantly increased versus free protein release when there is lysosomal stress. In this project we examine the role of lysosomal stress in exosomal production and transfer of cargo to nearby cells as a model linking lysosomal dysfunction seen in neurodegeneration and the transmission of pathology. We employ complimentary cell, animal and human substrates to characterize this biological and putatively neuropathological event."
"9266467","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) will expand the highly successful Undiagnosed Diseases Program of the NIH by increasing access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation's leading clinicians and scientists. Stanford Medicine is uniquely placed to advance the mission of the Undiagnosed Disease Program through the establishment of a Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford (CUDS). We propose a program that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) advance research into underlying mechanisms of disease; and (3) foster cooperation and collaboration both within and outside the UDN. In Aim 1, patients referred by the Coordinating Center will be evaluated through a protocol including pre-visit video consultation and genetic counseling, a week-long visit during which phenotypic, biochemical, genomic and environmental data will be collected and video conference follow up. Blood will be collected for generation of inducible pluripotent stem cells from patients and relatives. A site-wide Diagnosis Board will review case progress and identify internal and external experts for live or virtual video consultation. Use of a telepresence will enable 'virtual consultation' with experts in specific rare diseases from wherever they are across the world. Aim 2 is focused on genomic analysis that will take advantage of our mature pipeline for genome interpretation and may include Stanford's 'clinical grade' genome capture and sequencing technology. De-identified datasets will be shared across network sites, and with scientific collaborators, using both local and coordinating center computing infrastructure. Genomic data will be analyzed in concert with structured analysis of individual phenotypic characteristics via a phenotype interaction map to narrow the search space for genetic variants of interest. An Informatics Board will review progress on data analysis and determine the need for further investigation including multi-omics data collection and analysis. Aim 3 takes advantage of the walking distance co-localization of Stanford Hospitals with the University labs, which will allow the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to utilize unique Stanford resources such as the Stem Cell Institute and the Human Immune Monitoring Center. A Pathogenesis Board will review progress on determination of pathogenesis in individual cases and identify avenues and experts for exploration of causality of individual variants. Each case and disease hypothesis will be presented at the Center's Molecular Mechanisms of Disease weekly conference which will be recorded for dissemination within the network. Working documents will be shared with other sites on a weekly basis via a secure web portal."
"9277258","This R01 application will investigate a novel signaling pathway, the Hippo pathway, in mammalian heart regeneration. The long-term goal is to develop new treatments for patients with heart failure by generating new cardiomyocytes in the adult heart. The objectives of this application are to gain insight into biomechanical properties of cardiac tissue that are regulated by Hippo signaling. The central hypothesis is that Hippo signaling is a negative regulatory pathway that prevents cardiomyocyte regeneration in the adult mammalian heart by promoting a more fetal-like elasticity profile of cardiac muscle. The specific aims are to define the Hippo regulated biomechanical properties and cardiac aging, to determine dynamic changes in biomechanical properties after myocardial infarction, and to determine the functional characteristics of regenerated cardiomyocytes in Hippo mutant hearts. The project is both conceptually and technically innovative. The concepts to be tested are new ideas in cardiomyocyte biology and new and cutting edge imaging technologies are used to address hypotheses. The significance is high because there are no treatments for heart failure due to cardiomyocyte loss. Devising ways to generate new cardiomyocytes is highly significant."
"9259809","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease that is characterized by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, fibrous constituents, monocytes, and various other inflammatory cells in the arterial wall. Atherosclerosis is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The major cause of deaths from heart attacks (86%) and brain aneurysm (45%) are due to vulnerable plaques that rupture suddenly and trigger a blood clot or thrombus that blocks blood flow. Early detection of plaque lesions is the first and necessary step in preventing the lethal consequences of atherosclerosis. Diagnosis of the latent vulnerability of a plaque lesion relies on both tissue structural and chemical compositions. Multimodality intravascular imaging that can provide both structure and molecular information will provide clinicians with a critically important tool for diagnosing vulnerable plaques, monitoring the progression of disease, and evaluating the efficacy of intervention. The broad, long term objective of this proposal is to develop an integrated multimodal intravascular imaging system that combines intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and photoacoustic tomography (PAT). The multimodal intravascular imaging system is unique in that it combines the advantages of high spatial resolution of OCT, broad imaging depth of US, and molecular contrast of PAT. The integrated IVUS/OCT/PAT will provide the physician with a powerful tool for imaging, diagnosing, and managing vulnerable plaques. The specific aims are: (1) Develop a high-speed nanosecond fiber laser centered at 1730 nm for PAT imaging with lipid contrast; (2) Develop an integrated IVUS/OCT/PAT imaging catheter; (3) Develop a multimodality imaging system that combines IVUS/OCT/PAT; (4) Demonstrate real-time in vivo multimodality imaging of cardiovascular plaques in rabbit and porcine animal models. The proposed research requires an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and clinicians. We have assembled such a team: OCT/PAT group (Dr. Chen from BLI at UCI); IVUS/PAT group (Drs. Zhou and Shung from NIH Transducer Resource Center at USC); and Interventional cardiology group (Dr. Patel from Dept. of Cardiology at UCI). The proposed research is expected to have significant impact in the earlier detection, prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. PHS 398"
"9464986","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among a few oral and maxillofacial pathologists with a Ph.D. degree in the field of Immunology and Oral Biology, the candidate seeks to develop an independent research career focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of oral, head & neck cancer. The candidate has been continuously productive, and published in well-respected peer-reviewed journals on the topics highly relevant to this application. Under the mentorship of Dr. Robert Ferris, a leading head and neck surgeon-scientist, the candidate has made novel discoveries in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC) cells to support this application. With synergistic mentorship from a fully integrated five-member committee with broad expertise to cover every aspect of this application, this award allows the candidate to develop new experimental skills and knowledge of cancer immunology, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling, and translational HNC research. Additional mentored training in a prominent HNC program, at the University of Pittsburgh, is conductive for high quality translational research and the development of scientific leadership skills of the candidate. HNC is the sixth most common human cancers with frequent resistance. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, shows promising therapeutic efficacy in about 20% of HNC patients. Cetuximab suppresses tumor growth by inhibition of EGFR signaling and activation of cellular immunity targeting cancer cells. However, the 80% non-response rate suggests an intrinsic resistance mechanism. Autophagy has been shown to be hijacked by multiple solid tumors to endure therapy-induced inflictions. Recent study shows that autophagy induction in tumor cells dampens their susceptibility to immune effector cells, and that inhibition of autophagy sensitizes HNC cells to cetuximab. However, the lack of mechanistic insight into the autophagy machinery in HNC cells renders the targeting of this mechanism remarkably unspecific and ineffective. Our long-term goal is to leverage molecules involved in autophagy to improve systemic therapy against HNC. A recent study reveals an autophagy-promoting mitochondrial protein complex centering on NLRX1 and TUFM proteins. We hypothesize that specific inhibition of autophagy, by targeting the NLRX1-TUFM complex, sensitizes HNC cells to cetuximab. Three aims are put in place: (1) we will assess the role of NLRX1-TUFM complex in modulating the effects of EGFR blockade in vitro; (2) we will investigate the role of autophagy in modulating HNC patients' responses to cetuximab; (3) we will validate the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRX1-TUFM in vivo, and explore the mechanisms this complex employs to engage EGFR blockade-induced autophagy. Completion of this project will provide novel insights into the autophagy machinery of HNC cells and identify potential therapeutic targets to improve a cetuximab-based regimen."
"9249630","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is a common, morbid and highly lethal disease of primarily older patients. Importantly, there are currently no therapeutic strategies that limit the growth of aneurysms, due in large part to a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and progression. In addition to advanced age, genetic predilection, and male sex, the most important risk factor for AAA is a history of tobacco use. We have found that supplementation of two preclinical animal models of AAA with the major tobacco component, nicotine, causes accelerated disease formation and enhanced inflammatory signaling. These effects are associated with downregulation of microRNA (miR)-24. Given that many of its gene targets are pro-inflammatory, miR-24 is a prime suspect in the chronic inflammation and accelerated AAA development associated with nicotine supplementation and may, therefore, offer a therapeutic target. We hypothesize that nicotine causes downregulation of aortic miR-24, resulting in elevated expression of genes related to inflammation and accelerated AAA disease. Conversely, enhancing miR-24 expression and activity within the aortic wall will have therapeutic benefit. In Specific Aim 1, we will use cell culture models as well as pharmacological and molecular methods to delineate the signaling events initiated by nicotine that result in decreased miR-24 levels. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the downstream effects of reduced miR-24 on inflamamtiory gene expression and cellular function. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will modulate miR-24 levels in vivo to evaluate the effects upon AAA formation. These specific aims will investigate a novel mechanism that may underlie nicotine-induced vascular inflammation and accelerated aneurysm formation as well as provide the basis for advancing future research and clinical translation."

"9267971","Summary The main objective of the Animal Metabolic Physiology Core is to provide teaching and consultation on experimental design, performance of techniques, and analysis and interpretation of data for in vivo and ex vivo methods to investigate alterations of glucose homeostasis, insulin action, leptin action and body composition in rodent models of obesity and insulin resistance. Increasingly, the biologic roles of gene products and pathways emerging from genomic, proteomic, metabolomic and other discovery approaches are being queried by generating overexpression and gene knockout rodent models. Thus, there is a growing need for characterization of new mouse models created by genetic or viral vector technologies. The Animal Metabolic Physiology Core is designed to meet the needs for characterization of rodent models that have alterations in glucose homeostasis, insulin action, leptin action and/or body composition and adiposity. The consultation is carried out with an emphasis on the translational aspects of the studies. The specific objectives of the Core are 1) to teach and 2) to provide consultation to investigators in designing, carrying out and interpreting in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro studies aimed at investigating glucose homeostasis; lipid metabolism; insulin action; the actions of other hormones that regulate insulin sensitivity and energy balance such as leptin; and body composition 3) to review the results with users and assist in analysis and interpretation to ensure accuracy of results and understanding of their biological meaning. The Core also performs a limited number of these studies on selected mouse or rat models obtained by members of the Center."
"9327254","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Males and females have striking differences in development, health and disease, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. At the genetic level, different sex chromosome constitutions, XX in females and XY in males, result in differential expression of sex chromosome genes. Autosomal genes are also differentially expressed between the sexes, but, since autosomal DNA content does not vary by sex, this difference is evidently due to epigenetics. Interestingly, sex chromosome genes encode transcription factors and chromatin modifiers, which may have different expression levels and/or activities in males and females. Thus, I hypothesize that the actions of epigenetic and transcriptional regulators encoded by the X and Y chromosomes create sexually dimorphic expression across the genome. In Aim 1, I will ascertain whether epigenetic and transcriptional programs depend on sex chromosome dosage using cells from males and females varying in their sex chromosome complement (XO, XX, XY, XXY, XYY, and XXX). In Aim 2, I will assess activities of candidate regulatory genes on the sex chromosomes in males and females, and individually manipulate them to investigate their functional roles in epigenetic and transcriptional sex differences. This work will increase our mechanistic understanding of differences between the sexes, and motivate future research on sex-biased diseases."
"9247801","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Loss of inhibitory control over appetitively motivated behavior, sometimes manifested as `bingeing', is a phenotype present in multiple psychiatric conditions. It is widely assumed that bingeing emerges from the dysregulated function of frontal-executive control mechanisms that govern subcortical motivation systems; nevertheless, specific neuropharmacological mechanisms and circuit connections are not clearly understood. One clue derives from the fact that opiate antagonist drugs are among the only pharmacotherapies with some efficacy in improving inhibitory control across a wide variety of psychiatric disorders with binge features. Hence, opioid actions within frontal circuits could be a crucial substrate underlying binge-type pathologies. To date, however, opioid effects in frontal cortex have been almost completely overlooked. In the previous funding period, we discovered that µ-opioid receptor (µOR) stimulation in rat ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) - an area analogous to those showing abnormal responses in a variety of disorders with binge features - engenders robust non-homeostatic feeding and hyperactivity, increased food motivation in a progressive-ratio task, and robust `impulsivity-like' impairments in a PFC-sensitive task of inhibitory control. These effects were not reproduced by a wide array of monoamine receptor agonists or antagonists, demonstrating unique actions of µORs relative to other PFC modulatory systems. Furthermore, dual-site drug microinfusion studies revealed that PFC µOR signaling engages appetitive drive via feeding/arousal circuits in the lateral-perifornical hypothalamic region (LH-PeF), including the hypocretin/orexin system, while concurrently causing activation of an AMPA-coded PFC?nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) circuit that limits food motivation. Finally, we found that repeated episodes of sweetened-fat `gorging' sensitize AcbSh GABA systems, potentially blunting the effect the PFC?AcbSh `limiter circuit'. Based on these findings, we propose a novel network model stating that loss of control over appetitive behavior occurs when subcortical systems are driven by excessive PFC-µOR signaling, and/or when there is an imbalance in the PFC?LH-PeF (`appetitive-driver') and PFC?AcbSh (`appetitive limiter') pathways. Moreover, we propose that palatable food gorging causes neuroplastic changes in AcbSh amino-acid (glutamate, GABA) systems that blunt incoming PFC signals, curbing the influence of the `limiter circuit', thereby allowing appetitive behavior to go unchecked. In this way, the neuroadaptations caused by intense reward-driven feeding could engage a vicious cycle, leading to further binge-like behavior. We will test this working hypothesis with a combination of classic pharmacology experiments and studies using virally introduced Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). These engineered receptors permit the activation of G-proteins with a synthetic ligand; thus, neuronal activity can be modulated within specific populations of virally transduced neurons. Using a dual-virus approach, we will target DREADD expression to PFC neurons specifically projecting either to the AcbSh or to the hypothalamus, and selectively manipulate these tagged neurons in rats performing operant tasks of food motivation and inhibitory control. Furthermore, using classic pharmacology + DREADD experiments, we will test the hypothesis that palatable-food bingeing desensitizes vmPFC?AcbSh `limiter circuit' and perhaps amplifies the vmPFC?hypothalamus `appetitive-driver' circuit. Using receptor antagonists, we will examine the role of endogenous µ-opioid and hypocretin/orexin transmission in mediating PFC-driven food motivation and impulsivity. Finally, we will explore possible gender differences in PFC-µOR control of food motivation and food impulsivity."
"9462486","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The EPA estimates that one out of every four Americans lives within three miles of a hazardous waste site. Over 450,000 brownfield sites are awaiting remediation and 1,280 sites on the National Priorities List. Potential Responsible Parties or the Superfund program are tasked with remediating these sites, but insufficient funding and growing number of sites have led to significant delays. The US remediation market has been growing steadily since 2009, averaging 2-3% increases per year, and the global environmental remediation technology market is forecasted to expand to $80.5 billion in 2019. Clearly there is a societal need and market potential for innovative remediation technologies that decrease cost and increase efficacy. In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) is the fastest growing remediation technique as it is lower cost, more effective, and less disruptive than other methods. However, current ISCO methods require gaseous or liquid-form oxidizers that pose significant hazard to workers during transport and delivery and often require multiple injections, which increase cost and exposure risk.  AxNano, in collaboration with North Carolina A&T, has developed Controlled Release Polymer Structures (CRPS) as a slow release ISCO technology that will transform the environmental remediation industry by: (1) mitigating exposure risk during deployment by encapsulating the reactive agents within a safe, easy to handle, solid matrix; (2) allowing for efficient treatment of contaminated groundwater via sustained release of high doses of reactive agents with a single application.  This Phase I project will determine design parameters to enhance the efficacy of our patented CRPS for ISCO remediation of contaminated groundwater. The CRPS will be optimized by maximizing the oxidative agent(s) loading while maintaining a stable solid structure. Proof-of-concept tests will be conducted under varied conditions (i.e., pH, temperature, and density) in dynamic flow column studies that mimic those present in the subsurface environment. Broad spectrum efficacy of the optimized CRPS to transform two classes of Superfund-relevant contaminants (i.e., chlorinated compounds and polyaromatic hydrocarbons), will be tested over a range of concentrations to yield dose response curves. Collectively, the results of this Phase I will be used to model the performance of these materials in realistic environments and guide planning of pilot scale field studies. Phase I work will also involve designing a plan for scale-up manufacturing and preparing for pilot field testing. Scale-up design, cost of manufacturing, and deployment strategies of this solid phase material compared to current liquid and gaseous ISCO remediation technologies will also be evaluated in order to determine the feasibility of transitioning this technology to a commercial product."
"9230389","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries is one of the most common chronic infectious diseases in the world. The occlusal (biting surface) and interproximal (between teeth) areas are where there need for quantitative imaging of tooth decay and depth of cracks in the USA. In addition a majority of the caries load in USA is carried by different groups, such as Alaska Native people who have many times the national rate of tooth decay. Health care disparities in this population are exacerbated by rural remoteness. The average number of dental fillings per Alaskan Native person is double that of urban dwellers. To provide safe, high-quality dental care in these remote areas, an x- ray replacement is desired which provides high-resolution optical images of cracks and decay deep within teeth that does not require ionizing x-ray radiation. The current problem is that the optimal wavelengths of infrared light (1310 and 1460 nm) that can be used to see decay in teeth, do not have small high-resolution cameras for pediatric clinical use. Thus, an alternative method of forming infrared images will be developed and tested that produces the highest contrast of the lesion, which is scanning laser light either i transmission, reflection, and in a right-angle configuration (for example, scan the occlusal surface and detect above the gum line). The smallest laser-based imaging device has been developed at the University of Washington (UW), being the diameter of a round toothpick (1.2-mm) while producing high-quality video images at multiple wavelengths. The scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) technology has been tested by Dr. Joel Berg in children at The Center for Pediatric Dentistry with shared administration from UW Pediatric Dentistry and Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA. Although this device used visible light for testing the health of the enamel the change to infrared is straightforward, allowing much deeper imaging of cracks and carious lesions using optimal laser wavelengths for high-contrast transmittance and reflectance imaging. The small size of the scanner allows the two imaging modes to run concurrently if needed to find the extent of a crack, maximum depth of caries, and even total volume of caries under surveillance with non-surgical medicinal therapies. The hand piece will be smaller than any bitewing radiographic sensor used in children now, while providing new features of imaging during restorative work, possibly under tele-medicine conditions. The SFE technology is fundamentally low in cost because it uses laser and detectors that are fully developed in the telecommunications industry. The low- power scanned laser light imaging can be made portable and carries no significant risks. This project will fabricate a prototype device, determine its optimal imaging modes (wavelength &configuration), develop new 3D imaging algorithms, test with extracted teeth and verify with a pilot study with children 6 to 12 years of age."

"9279926","Erythroid (E; red blood cell) and megakaryocytic (M; platelet precursor) lineages are essential and  vital to vertebrate health and viability as they performing crucial functions like oxygen delivery  and wound healing. Consequently, relatively minor aberrations in their developmental or  functional programs lead to life threatening disorders. These proclivities are an inevitable fall out of  the high turnover rate of these cells that makes them acutely susceptible to malfunctions and  malignancies arising from imbalances  between proliferation and differentiation. These imbalances  in turn are due to the dysfunctions of various molecular regulators of these processes as evidenced  by a growing body of data  from  human  patients  and  animal models. The transcriptional  repressors Gfi1/1b (growth factor independence 1/1b) and their cofactors LSD1 (lysine specific  demethylase1) and Rcor (REST corepressor)  proteins  have  emerged  over  the  past  several years  as critical regulators of hematopoiesis. Yet the true  scale  of  their  functions,  and   mechanistic ramifications of their actions, in E-M development have only been nominally documented.  Therefore, this proposal focuses on elucidating the collective functions of these transcriptional  and chromatin regulators and their principal gene/chromatin targets, in orchestrating the ontogeny  of E-M cells from progenitor (MEP) specification to their divergence and differentiation into  specialized effector cells. In addition to producing a comprehensive overview of these emergent  molecular programs and networks in normal development, these insights should also  provide  a   rational scientific  basis  for  managing  hematopoietic  disorders resulting  from the errant  activities of these master molecules."
"9348125","Summary In a variety of diseases and conditions when oral feeding is impossible, enteral feeding through percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) is necessary to provide long-term nutrition for adult and pediatric patients. It is estimated that over 70 thousand feeding tubes are placed in pediatric patients in the US annually. However, these patients frequently experience complications associated with PG tube placement. Late-onset complications (at least 6 days after PG insertion) were estimated to be 44% in pediatric patients. Common complications include infections, tube clogging, tube dislodgement and poor stoma formation. Poor stoma formation, in particular, leads to a variety of problems such as peristomal infection and gastric content leakage. PG-associated complications often require hospital revisions, resulting in higher economic cost as well as increased patient morbidity and discomfort. Revisions are estimated to cost over $1 million annually in pediatric PG patients in the US alone. Therefore, effective strategies are required to prevent these complications, without introducing more issues, in children whose nutrition is dependent on PG feeding. Here, Sharklet Technologies, Inc. proposes to develop a novel Sharklet-micropatterned pediatric PG device that is anti- infective, anti-clogging and improves stoma formation in children who receive enteral feeding. The power of the Sharklet technology is that the novel micropattern can be produced in the same approved biomedical materials used currently, without the addition of any potentially toxic chemical. It therefore offers a safe solution for vulnerable infant and child populations, consistent with NICHD goals of ensuring that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease and disability. Sharklet Technologies, Inc. (STI) applies proprietary micrometer-scale topography onto a variety of medical and consumer devices in order to control bioadhesion. Design of the Sharklet micropattern is inspired by the microtopography on shark skin that has a natural anti-fouling activity. STI has received Phase I SBIR funding to test the feasibility of Sharklet pediatric PG tubes and majority of milestones have been achieved. Sharklet surfaces have been shown to reduce at least 50% feeding formula accumulation and prevent microbial biofilms by 89%. In addition, Sharklet micropattern promotes human epithelial cell migration towards wounded areas by 167%. Building on these successes, in this Phase II project, STI proposes to verify the efficacy of Sharklet PG devices in reducing complications, and to manufacture and commercialize this novel device for pediatric patients. Phase II Aims are proposed to scale up Sharklet PG development: Aim 1 ?Develop manufacturing for a silicone PG tube using design controls and product development to produce a first-generation product; Aim 2 ?Examine first- generation PG tubes for performance against in vitro tests of anti-clogging, bacterial contamination prevention, and cell migration improvement; Aim 3 ?Test the PG tube for use in a preclinical porcine model of feeding tube implantation to demonstrate improved stoma formation in the presence of bacterial contamination or trauma; Aim 4 ? Manufacture a final production lot of PG tubes for validation and verification testing such that requirements are met for 510k submission with the claim equivalence compared to a predicate device. Phase II results will lead to the submission of a 510(k) regulatory package for a device-level claim. The strong Phase I success and the broad-based technical, business and regulatory skills of STI?s expert, multi- disciplinary team sets the stage for a successful Phase II manufacturing and validation project designed to lead to post-Phase II clinical trials in collaboration with a third-party investor or industry partner. In all, the proposed Phase II project will validate the efficacy of this innovative PG product that harbors multiple patented Sharklet micropatterns to minimize PG-associated complications in pediatric populations."
"9404714","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a significant public health concern in the United States. Most important are the effects of the virus on developing fetuses and immunocompromised individuals where it causes a variety of pathological conditions ranging in severity from mild to life-threatening. Since HCMV is present in a persistent or latent form in 50-90% of the world's adult population, the identification of virl gene products that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a latent infection is an intense and important area of investigation. HCMV encodes 4 GPCR homologs including US28, which has been shown to exhibit both constitutive and agonist-dependent G-protein signaling activities in HCMV infected fibroblasts. Although US28 exhibits high level signaling, it is not essential for lytic viral replication and therefore its function in viral pathogenesis remains unclear. Interestingly, US28 mRNAs are expressed in latently infected hematopoietic progenitors and monocytes, prompting questions regarding the potential role of US28 during latent CMV infections. Our exciting preliminary data indicates that US28 promotes a successful latent infection as US28 null viruses spontaneously enter the lytic phase in hematopoietic cells where wild type virus establishes a latent infection. Therefore, we hypothesize that US28 directed signaling in HCMV infected hematopoietic progenitors leads to the establishment and/or maintenance of latency. To explore this hypothesis, we will take advantage of a newly constructed panel of US28 mutant viruses and recently established methodologies to examine US28 signaling in HCMV infected cells. In Aim 1, we will examine the biological parameters by which US28 drives latency using viral recombinants in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells, and in Aim 2 we will examine the molecular signaling properties of US28 and determine which pathways contribute to the establishment and/or maintenance of latency. Finally, experiments like those proposed in this application are essential for our understanding of the role of CMV GPCRs in viral pathogenesis and will open novel avenues of research for the development of unique antivirals that specifically target the latent reservoir of virus infection."
"9248246","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza infection remains an enormous public health concern despite the availability of vaccines and worldwide surveillance. The high mutation rates of influenza A viruses (IAVs) enable the viruses to evade natural and vaccine-mediated immunity. Also, current anti-viral therapies do not prevent IAV-related deaths when there is a delay in initiating treatment. Thus, new therapeutic options for treating influenza disease are an immediate public health priority. Our pilot studies identify MMP-9 as an attractive IAV therapeutic target. MMP- 9 is strikingly upregulated in plasma samples from human subjects infected with seasonal and H1N1 IAV and in lungs from mice infected with H1N1 IAV. In mice, Mmp-9 increases IAV-associated mortality and late-stage lung inflammation and late-stage lung viral burdens. We proposed to test the therapeutic efficacy of a re- purposed therapeutic candidate (ADZ1236) that selectively and potently inhibits MMP-9 activity in IAV infections in two species in three integrated and highly collaborative aims. Aim 1 will test the therapeutic efficacy of AZD1236 therapy in mice infected with BL2 H1N1 IAV. AZD1236 will be tested in mice alone and in combination with a clinically-used antiviral agent (the neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir). A delayed initiation of treatment approach will be optimized to model rea-world treatment scenarios for serious IAV infections. Aim 2 will identify the mechanisms by which Mmp-9 promotes (and AZD1236 limits) serious IAV infections in mice. We will study H1N1-infected WT vs. Mmp-9-/- mice and Mmp-9 bone marrow chimeric mice and use in vitro approaches to test our hypothesis that Mmp-9 promotes adverse outcomes in IAV disease by cleaving host or viral proteins. These Mmp-9 substrates will be identified. Aim 3 will test the therapeutic efficacy of AZD1236 in ferrets infected with BL2 H1N1 and the BL3 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 strain (and in H7N9 IAV-infected ferrets if this strain emerges as an epidemic or pandemic strain during the funding period). Our studies will determine whether AZD1236-mediated MMP-9 inhibition has therapeutic efficacy against IAV in both small and large animals sufficient to thereby satisfy the FDA Two Animal Rule required to demonstrate efficacy to apply for FDA approval. Successful completion of the work proposed herein may provide a first in class therapeutic intervention for serious influenza-mediated lung disease."

OVERALL COMPONENT As the cost of genome-scale sequencing continues to decrease and new technologies for genome editing become widely adopted, the laboratory mouse is more important than ever as a model system for understanding the biological significance of human genetic variation and for advancing the emergence of genomic medicine. The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) has a unique and strategic role as a community resource for facilitating the use of the laboratory mouse for understanding human biology and disease. MGD serves three major user communities: (i) biomedical researchers using mouse experimentation to investigate genetic and molecular principles of biology and disease processes, (ii) clinical and translational scientists using mouse as a model to study human disease, and (iii) bioinformaticians / computational biologists using the rich integrated data in MGD to develop algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines for data analysis and interpretation. In the grant renewal period, MGD staff will continue to integrate new genetic, genomic, variant, functional, phenotypic, and human disease model data essential to researchers using the laboratory mouse in biomedical research. We will make these data freely available through a variety of web-based and programmatic user interfaces. Our Resource Project aims include (i) maintaining the canonical catalog of mouse genome features, (ii) serving as the authoritative data for mouse functional annotations, and (iii) maintaining a comprehensive catalog of mouse mutant alleles and their phenotype and disease model associations. We also will expand and refine our Human-Mouse Disease Connection portal to serve the clinical, translational, and comparative research communities. To support our Resource Project aims, we will maintain cost-effective software, database, and hardware using industry best practices. We will maintain MGD's secure infrastructure through regular maintenance, upgrades, and planned evolution. We will develop new software components to accomplish biologically driven initiatives and we will implement enhancements to the system as new data types and data sources relevant to our mission emerge. To ensure the greatest impact of MGD in the broader scientific community, we provide robust user support and outreach through online user documentation, tutorials, training workshops, and one-on-one assistance using a variety of communication modalities and major social media tools. We actively solicit community input, data submissions, and collaborations."
"9325248","Opiate abuse is an epidemic in the US, where opiates have a high relapse rate, and unintentional overdose deaths have tripled from 2001 to 2013. Despite the prevalence of opiate abuse, relatively little is known about the neuroadaptations that occur with chronic use. We previously determined that chronic opiate exposure induces a unique change in the size of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key brain region in the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit, and decreased VTA DA soma size was also observed in post- mortem human samples of heroin addicts, suggesting translational relevance. Moreover, we have demonstrated that changes in soma size are correlated with VTA DA neuronal activity and reward processing in rodent models, suggesting a functional link. However, further understanding of opiate-induced structural and functional neuroadaptations of VTA DA neurons has been limited by VTA cellular heterogeneity and techniques to isolate and examine specific subsets of VTA DA neurons. For example, unbiased genomic approaches necessary to identify novel molecular mediators have been limited to homogenization of the entire VTA, which includes multiple neuron types, not just DA cells. Further, it has become increasingly clear through optogenetic studies that VTA DA neurons themselves are diverse, as subsets of VTA DA neurons are differentially activated by rewarding or aversive stimuli depending on their projection target, e.g. the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or prefrontal cortex (PFC). Thus, this proposal seeks to address the limitations stemming from VTA cellular heterogeneity through the use of cutting-edge viral and molecular techniques, addressing the central hypothesis that chronic morphine induces structural plasticity in VTA DA neurons in a projection-specific manner and is mediated by transcriptional changes in VTA DA neurons. Aim 1 will determine whether chronic morphine induces circuit-specific changes in structural plasticity (soma size and dendritic spine density) through injection of retrograde adeno-associated vectors that express fluorescent proteins in a Cre-recombinase dependent manner into the NAc and PFC of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-Cre mice. Preliminary data suggest differences in basal and morphine-induced soma size between NAc- and PFC-projecting VTA DA neurons. Aim 2 will use an innovative cell type-specific purification technique, Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) to isolate mRNA specifically from VTA DA neurons and assess gene expression changes in candidate genes, as well as novel genes via RNA-sequencing, that may mediate morphine-induced structural and functional adaptations. Our previous RNA-sequencing data have shown that chronic morphine induces a unique gene expression pattern in the VTA compared to cocaine; these studies will determine whether such changes are driven specifically by VTA DA neurons. Together, this work is expected to advance the understanding of how chronic opiate exposure alters the structure and function of VTA DA neurons and to identify novel mechanisms underlying mesocorticolimbic circuit dysfunction."
"9254547","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of the proposed research are to improve understanding of the pathogenesis of RNA splicing factor retinitis pigmentosa (RP) so that therapies can be developed for these blinding disorders. Mutations in genes that encode RNA splicing factors are the second most common cause of the dominant form of RP, and thus are an important cause of vision loss. The splicing factors affected, pre-mRNA processing factor (PRPF) 3, PRPF4, PRPF6, PRPF8, PRPF31, and SNRNP200 are highly conserved components of the spliceosome, the complex which excises introns from nascent RNA transcripts to generate mature mRNAs. Since RNA splicing is required in all cells, it is not clear how mutations in these ubiquitous proteins lead to retina-specific disease. Since all of the RNA splicing factors identified to harbor mutations that cause RP are associated with the U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP complex of the spliceosome, it has been hypothesized that defects in RNA splicing underlie the RNA splicing factor forms of RP. What remains unclear is if specific aberrantly spliced transcripts cause the retinal disease, or if generalized alterations in splicing which occu globally affect the retina more than other organs. To investigate the mechanisms by which mutations in RNA splicing factors cause retinal degeneration, gene targeted Prpf3, Prpf8 and Prpf31 mutant mice were generated, and are being used to test the hypothesis that aberrant splicing underlies the retinal disease. In the past funding period cell autonomous defects in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell function were identified in the gene targeted mice. These are recapitulated in human ARPE-19 cells following knockdown PRPF31, suggesting that RPE cells are the primary target cell type in RNA splicing factor RP. RNA-seq analyses of the RPE from the three gene targeted mouse lines suggest that altered splicing of a limited number of transcripts underlies the defects in RPE function, and thus the retinal degenerative disease. In Aim 1 of the proposed research the effects of the identified altered transcripts on RPE cell function will be tested in cultured RPE cells and in the RPE in vivo to determine which of the altered transcripts could be responsible for disease. In Aim 2, these studies will be extended to human cells, since it is now possible to generate RPE cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and to introduce specific mutations into hiPSCs using genome editing tools. In Aim 3, the hypothesis that gene augmentation therapy can provide therapeutic benefit for PRPF31 disease will be tested. This is a logical extension of prior work, since mutations in PRPF31 have been shown to cause disease via haploinsufficiency, and RPE cells have been identified as the target cell type in RNA splicing factor RP. Viewed together, these Aims provide a logical pathway toward defining the pathogenesis of RNA splicing factor RP, and initiating work towards developing therapies for these forms of RP."
"9258453","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Family members are the most important source of support for Americans in need. Parents, adult children, and siblings often provide time assistance, financial transfers, and in-kind support to each other while coping with life-course challenges such as illness, loss of a spouse, or unemployment. One of the most significant facilitators of providing or receiving such support is an individual's spatial proximity to his or er extended family. At the same time, the need to be located near extended family members can impose significant restrictions on that individuals' residential mobility, which in turn may lead t more limited employment opportunities, choices of schools for children, and development of social networks. Despite the potential influence of spatial proximity to family members on health, caregiving, and socioeconomic status, few empirical reports exist regarding the dynamics of family spatial proximity over the life-course.  This project will use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a nationally representative, longitudinal survey containing prospective reports by individuals and their extended family members - e.g., parents, children, siblings, grandparents - for more than 45 years (1968 through 2015). For members of the same extended family, the PSID contains extensive information on numerous socioeconomic factors that influence mobility including health status, employment, income, wealth, and household composition, as well as very specific information on residential location down to the exact census block. Capitalizing on these unique features of the PSID, the proposed project will:  a) construct and release a national dataset of family spatial proximity; b) for the first time thoroughly describe dynamic patterns of Americans' spatial proximity to parents, children, and siblings over the life-course; c) identify factors influencing spatial proximity; and d) assess individuals' longitudinal outcomes of health and health care utilization related to spatial proximity to family. The proposed empirical research will contribute profoundly to social science and public health research and public policy for improving individuals' health and socioeconomic status."
"9322866","Overall Summary Abstract Our Center brings together three multidisciplinary Project teams focusing on the biologically critical question: What is the full genetic architecture that determines the hypothalamic control of human reproduction? Using the mendelian human disease model of Isolated GnRH Deficiency (IGD), Project 1 will accelerate its successful novel gene discovery efforts in our existing and fully phenotyped IGD cohort of >2,000 to identify new genes critical for human reproduction as attested to by their creation of IGD when mutated. Using whole exome, whole genome, and RNA sequencing in selected subsets of this cohort such as those: i) sharing a 2nd rare phenotype; ii) with known structural abnormalities; or iii) from multiplex families, we will identify a wide range of coding and non-coding defects in this population. These resulting new ?candidate IGD genes? are then forwarded to Project 3 for in vivo functional confirmation in zebrafish. Project 2 will focus its complex trait genetic expertise on identifying new genetic loci/genes associated with the 3 commonest reproductive disorders in women: PCOS, premature ovarian insufficiency, and hypothalamic amenorrhea. Using genome wide association studies combined with tracking of these conditions with associated genetic loci in several population cohorts where genotypes and phenotypes are already available (cf. Letters of Collaboration), P2 will surface large numbers of new, common, and milder loss of function (LoF) mutations in genes underlying these diseases. As sufficient new loci/genes become apparent, P2 will assemble these new genes into new biology pathways regulating various physiologic and pathologic controls of human reproduction. P3 will validate each of these new candidate genes using a zebrafish bioassay. By then recalling our IGD and population patients harboring these novel mutations to re-phenotype them and thus define the full, unbiased phenotypic spectrum of associated phenotypes, penetrance, varied expressivity, and interactions with other genes associated with each new genes in our Educational/Outreach Core. Collectively, these inter-disciplinary, integrated approaches, techniques, and expertise will provide a deeper understanding of the range of reproductive defects associated with these new genes that are critical for normal human reproduction."
"9271765","Project Summary: Given the pervasive disparities in alcohol use disorders (AUD) and HIV among young Latino men, the proposed training plan will build upon my work on HIV transmission risk and co-morbidities by training me in: 1) alcohol and HIV epidemiology, 2) the integration of biological measures with behavioral science, and 3) longitudinal data analysis, while expanding the scope of my health disparities research to include Latino men. With the guidance of my exceptional Mentor Team, the proposed training aims will be achieved with a combination of in-/formal coursework and workshops in alcohol epidemiology, stress response biomarkers, and longitudinal statistical methods as well as practical experience in primary data collection, assay, and analysis, of salivary, urinary, and blood stress biomarkers with behavioral data in ethnic minority populations. In addition, this K01 will provide me with guidance to develop skills for a successful academic career and support for my transition into an independent investigator. Men make up 87% of new HIV infections among Latinos. Latino men play a central role in bridging HIV/STI across sexual networks due to their sexual risk behaviors (e.g., concurrent sex partners, unprotected anal sex, same-sex [MSM] activity). Furthermore, harmful alcohol use increases risk behavior and IPV perpetration, all factors associated with a substantially increased risk for HIV/STI. The syndemic co-occurrence of AUD, intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV/STI is theorized to take root in systemic socio-structural disadvantage, but the mechanisms causing this syndemic are not well understood, especially in Latino men. The Social Stress Theory suggests that social inequity elevates exposure and vulnerability to stress, limits access to coping resources, and increases AUD and HIV disparities. The proposed longitudinal, epidemiological study aims to elucidate the temporal sequence of AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI, as well as identify risk/protective social stress factors in Latino men (versus white men) during their critical transition from adolescence (12-18 years) to mid-adulthood (32-42 years). To achieve this, we propose secondary analysis of four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n=5,140), which contains rich social, behavioral, and biological data (e.g., stress response, HIV/STI biomarkers). Findings from this research will inform the development of more effective AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI prevention and treatment interventions for Latino men, and will highlight sub-group nuances among Latino men (e.g., by non-/white race, national sub-group, and sexual orientation). Classified as High Priority by the NIH Office of AIDS Research, this K01 will provide cross- cutting research training for a highly productive ethnic minority junior investigator to conduct HIV/AIDS Research to Reduce Latino Health Disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections and to understand the role of chronic inflammation and AUD in exacerbating these disparities."
"9277071","The importance of hepatobiliary transport proteins in medication disposition, safety and efficacy is well recognized. Identifying key hepatic transporters involved in these processes and understanding the factors that impact their function is critical to successful drug development and optimal pharmacotherapy. The overall goal of this research program is to address major knowledge gaps in hepatobiliary drug transport and develop novel strategies to assess and predict the impact of transporter function altered by drug interactions (DIs), genetic variation, and disease. This information is fundamental to the science of precision medicine, and will aid in preventing DIs and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). My laboratory pioneered the use of sandwich-cultured hepatocytes, a powerful in vitro tool now widely used to study hepatobiliary drug transport and hepatic transporter-mediated DIs. We were the first to assess the functional impact of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis- associated increases in hepatic basolateral efflux transporter expression on drug/metabolite disposition in humans, and to utilize human liver scintigraphy data to evaluate a hepatic DI. Our collaborative team is developing computational tools that can be used a priori in early drug development to identify compounds with DILI liability, and we formulated a strategy integrating physiological parameters and experimental data with a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model to evaluate DILI mechanisms. These highly innovative approaches can improve predictions of hepatic transporter-mediated DIs and DILI liability, leading to safer medications. In the current application, we propose to continue translating fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms to clinical applications by addressing the following key questions: Which hepatic basolateral efflux transporters are critical to bile acid (BA) homeostasis and anionic drug disposition? The role of basolateral transporters (e.g., OST?/?) in the hepatic and systemic disposition of BAs and anionic drugs/metabolites will be elucidated. This information will enable us to more accurately predict BA-mediated DILI, a major drug development safety issue and reason that approved drugs are withdrawn from the market. How are hepatic basolateral BA and anionic drug efflux transporters regulated? Information is scarce on the interplay of BA exposure, hepatic transporter dynamics, and the regulation of these proteins in humans. We will fill these critical knowledge gaps, which currently compromise accurate predictions of hepatic transporter function, DIs, and BA- mediated DILI. What in vitro, in silico, and in vivo tools could help predict, more efficiently and accurately, the clinical impact of altered transporter function on BA and anionic drug disposition? In vitro assays routinely used to predict transporter-mediated DIs are unable to identify complex interaction mechanisms. Development of novel in vitro tools, in vivo probes, and in silico models will provide a powerfully efficient approach to identify hepatic transporter-mediated DIs, BA-mediated DILI susceptibility factors, and improve prediction accuracy to optimize pharmacotherapy and avoid adverse effects."
"9245623","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, a novel and highly virulent Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged, causing ~40% mortality rates. MERS-CoV replicates efficiently in humans, camels and bats, but not mouse cells demonstrating a broad yet rodent-restricted host range. Ominously, person-to-person transmission and subclinical infections endanger global populations and economies. Importantly, we have demonstrated that closely related bat coronaviruses (Bt CoV), like HKU4, uses the same bat and human receptor for entry as MERS- CoV, raising the specter of further zoonotic introductions of antigenically distinct coronaviruses into human populations. Consequently, we develop a multidisciplinary program that includes X- Ray crystallography, electron microscopy, protein biochemistry, molecular virology, reverse genetics and animal model development to address fundamental questions regulating key BtCoV HKU4 and MERS-CoV-host structure-function relationships in: i) receptor mediated binding, fusion and entry, ii) cross species transmission, and iii) in vivo pathogenesis.  MERS-CoV and BtCoV HKU4 encode an envelope-anchored spike glycoprotein (S) that binds to its host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) through its S1 subunit, initiating a cascade of host serine protease regulated conformation changes that elicit S2-mediated membrane fusion and entry. The major barrier for HKU4 mediated entry into human cells occurs at protease initiated membrane fusion, rather than at the receptor binding interface. Thus, our program identifies a checkpoint associated with bat CoV cross species transmission into other mammals, including humans. In addition to identifying key structural and biochemical interactions that regulate S and DPP4 receptor ortholog-guided binding protease regulated fusion and entry, we apply reverse genetics, structure-guided mutations, and experimental evolution to study HKU4 and MERS-CoV host adaptation and pathogenesis, using recently developed transgenic animal models. In Aim 1, we study the biochemistry and structure of MERS-CoV and HKU4 bound to various species receptor-binding domains (RBD). In Aim 2, we study S processing by bat and human entry proteases. In Aim 3, we study HKU4 and MERS-CoV pathogenesis using transgenic mice and experimental evolution. The overall goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding group 2c CoV receptor recognition, entry and pathogenesis. In parallel, we produce key deliverables that are crucial for developing effective antivirals and vaccines, thereby improving rapid response and the overall global health."
"9235316","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hand is one of the most complex, versatile, and critical human sensory organs. Sensory signals from the hand play a key role in guiding the dexterous manipulation of objects. Without these signals, we would need to constantly watch our hand to ensure that an object was properly grasped, to monitor our use of a tool, and to maintain its proper shape. Furthermore, simple activities of daily living, such as tying one's shoe, or turning a door knob, would be slow and clumsy, and require great concentration. In contrast to the sense of touch, which has received a lot of experimental attention, the representation of hand position and hand movements in the brain is poorly understood. Indeed, unlike vision and audition, for which monitors and speakers are commercially available, proprioception research presents unique technological challenges in measuring and manipulating the sensory input. As increasingly sophisticated technologies become available, however, we are able to more fruitfully investigate this important sensory modality.  Our objective is to apply rigorous and quantitative methods to investigate the cortical basis of proprioception in primates, with an emphasis on hand kinematics and posture. Furthermore, we seek to understand how proprioceptive representations interact with motor representations in the cortex to guide behavior. To these ends, monkeys will perform two tasks: a grasping task, with objects different widely in shape and size, and a finger-press task, in which the animal is instructed to make individuated finger movements. While the monkeys perform these tasks, we will measure their hand movements using a camera- based motion tracking system, and record, using chronically implanted high-density multi-electrode arrays, the neuronal activity evoked in proprioceptive and motor areas of the cortex. We will then use a variety of mathematical techniques to (1) understand how hand movements and position are represented in the activity of individual neurons and of neuronal populations and (2) characterize the interactions between proprioceptive and motor representations to understand the role of this sensorimotor interplay in motor control.  Our labs are currently developing approaches to convey sensory feedback through electrical stimulation of cortex for use in upper-limb neuroprostheses. Proprioceptive information about the position and movements of the prosthetic limb is essential for a complete prosthetic limb for the same reasons it is important in the native limb. Results from the proposed project will thus inform how to incorporate proprioceptive feedback in sensorized neuroprostheses."
"9256502","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In general, economic models of human development assume that mothers have rational expectations about the technology of skill formation, that is, about the process that determines how their offspring develop skills in socio-emotional and cognitive domains. This assumption implies that all women -- regardless of their race,  education,  or  socio-economic  status  --  have  the  correct  information  regarding  how  investments  affect  the  development  of  their  children.  When  such  models  are  structurally  estimated,  the  variation  in  observed  investments  across  families  is  attributed  to  shocks  heterogeneity  in  the  characteristics  of  the  children  or  families, but not to the heterogenety in the knowledge base of the mother.  The goals of our research are to test whether this assumption is accurate~ to formulate an economic model of  human development that allows for the heterogeneity in maternal beliefs to play a role in the maternal choices  of investments~ and to evaluate the importance of such heterogeneity in the determination of child development  and the welfare of the families. To execute this task, we will collect longitudinal data on 960 nulliparous women in three rounds. The women will be divided into six cells according to their race (white and black) and schooling level (less than high school or GED, exactly high school, more than high school). In the first survey round, conducted in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, we will ask the women about their beliefs regarding the impact of investments on child development.  The second survey round, conducted at approximately 6 months post- delivery, will collect data on investment choices made by the mother and her perception of father involvement.  Finally, in the third round of data collection, conducted when the child is approximately 24 months old, we will  ask the mother about the child's developmental milestones using instruments developed for Children of the  National  Longitudinal  Survey  of  Youth  1979  (CNLSY/79),  and  assess  the  children  with  the  Bayley  Short  Form-Research Edition (BSF-R) used in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), and  re-interview the mothers about their beliefs.   In  addition to  primary  data  collection  we  wil analyze  the  child  development data from the  CNLSY/79  and  ECLS-B. We will use these data to obtain objective estimate of the technology of skill formation. Using the data collected as part of this proposal, we will be able to obtain the maternal subjective beliefs about the technology of skill formation.  By comparing the objective estimates with subjective beliefs, we will be able to determine the accuracy of maternal beliefs by schooling and race cells. Because we will have data on investments in the 2nd survey round, we will be able to investigate whether the beliefs are correlated with investment choices made by women. From the 3rd round, we will be able to see if mothers' subjective beliefs change as a result of their observation of their children's development."

In addition to providing access to the state-of-the-art instrumentation, the SBSF supports the Cancer Center members through service and consultation over a wide array of structural biology projects ranging from: 1) structural determination of proteins, protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes of interest in different cancers; 2) structure-based virtual screening of compound libraries; 3) drug discovery research in general including structure-based chemical syntheses; 4) fragment-based design of new inhibitors; 5) screening of compound libraries by NMR and crystallography; 6) applications of NMR-metabolomics in cancer research, and on membrane proteins as drug targets. The SBSF works closely with the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance (ADDA) to support the research efforts of the CCC members developing novel drugs to treat multiple forms of cancer. During the past funding period the facility was used to support fundamental and translational research for 105 users, 78 of which are CCC members with NIH funding exceeding $60 million. SBSF usage resulted in more than 50 different novel protein structures published in a variety of journals including Science, PNAS, Biochemistry, JBC, JMB, Cell Biology, Molecular Pharmacology, Trends in Biotechnology, Acta-D, Acta-F and Structure. Examples of value added via the shared facility include: a) determination of more than 20 x-ray structures of the retinoid X receptor, RXR, a protein implicated in breast cancer and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A clinical drug candidate is currently in human phase 1b trials at NCI; b) Identification of novel Src kinase inhibitors (initial hits) that target the Src/calmodulin interaction and exhibit anti-pancreatic cancer activity. This project is utilizing both NMR and x-ray crystallographic techniques in developing new inhibitors from these initial hits; c) x-ray structure information was produced for several inhibitors bound to the drug- binding pocket of P-glycoprotein, one of the multi-drug resistance transporters that often become over-active in cancer cells causing resistance to chemotherapy."
"9247859","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite increased monies dedicated to post-stroke care persistent deficits in the ability to perform everyday tasks with the paretic limb are a significant contributor to continuing declines in the quality of life. Therefore, a greater understanding of the processes underlying motor learning and recovery post-stroke is needed to enhance existing therapist-guided and robot-assisted interventions. Current rehabilitation practices and research focus on establishing new neuromotor patterns in preserved tissue through repetitive use of the paretic limb but place less emphasis on how compensatory strategies influence this process. In particular, functions mediated by cognitive areas of the brain that are recruited in support of the compensatory strategies may shape the neural patterns that emerge. These compensatory neural patterns may enhance short-term performance at the expense of persistent longer-term recovery. Understanding the consequences of compensatory cognitive recruitment of neural substrates like dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is critical to the development of effective, targeted interventions for adults living with stroke-related hemiparesis. In the absence of such knowledge development of interventions to promote motor recovery may be successful but limited in efficacy. As such enhancing and re-establishing quality of life post-stroke will remain a challenge. Our central hypothesis is that enhanced recruitment of cognitive functions, localized to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in support of compensatory motor strategies serves to develop and consolidate sub-optimal patterns of neural reorganization within motor cortical areas that limit learning. The overall objective of the proposed study is to determine whether short-term suppression of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will reduce constraints upon emerging neural patterns in motor cortical areas and lead to greater sustained improvements in motor ability post-stroke. At the completion of the proposed work, it is our expectation that we will have demonstrated that learning, and by extension recovery, post-stroke is enhanced by suppressing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex despite any potential short-term decreases in performance. Further, we hope that this work will identify preliminary predictors of who might benefit clinically from suppression of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and that this work will act as a substrate for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the proposed research activities is an important step towards developing enhanced therapist guided and robot-assisted rehabilitation interventions that integrate adjunctive non-invasive brain stimulation of non-motor cortex targets. Continued development of our knowledge of learning post-stroke and how to implement such knowledge in the clinical setting will ultimately decrease the socioeconomic impact of hemiparesis and enhance quality of life post-stroke."
"9282639","?DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):     This revised A1 PPG application remains a highly translational PPG focused on the critical role of the endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeleton in the pathobiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). ARDS, a devastating disorder with a mortality of ~30-35%, is defined by increases in lung vascular permeability, a major influence on ARDS mortality. The clinically-relevant PPG studies we have proposed will define the molecular mechanisms by which EC signaling drives cytoskeletal remodeling to either disrupt vascular integrity via production of paracellular gaps (that increases lung vascular permeability) or to restore EC barrier integrity via peripheral cytoskeletal remodeling and formation of cytoskeletal-driven lamellipodia and focal adhesions that promote EC gap closure. The analysis of these biophysical events represent the thematic underpinnings of this PPG and will be conducted by an outstanding translational team of gifted and interactive basic and physician-scientist investigators who will utilize clinically relevant bioactive/biophysical stimuli (VEGF, TNF?, LPS, mechanical stress) both in vitro and in preclinical models of ARDS and VILI. Project #1 will perform sophisticated structure, function and genetic analyses of the multi-functional non-muscle myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK) isoform in the context of paracellular gap regulation and as a target for lung vascular barrier restoration. As EC barrier-regulatory enhancement is determined by peripheral actin remodeling, Project #2 will provide novel information regarding the interactions between nmMLCK and key actin-binding proteins (cortactin, Ena/VASP-like or EVL, c-Abl) in EC barrierrestorative responses (peripheral cytoskeletal remodeling, lamellipodial dynamics, gap closure). Focal adhesion (FA) proteins are complex participants in both the pathobiology and resolution of ARDS via bidirectional signaling to the cytoskeleton. Project #3 will interrogate the role of the FA proteins, integrin ?4 and paxillin, in cytoskeletal linkages to focal adhesion dynamics (assembly/disassembly) and lamellipodialmediated closure of inflammation-induced EC gaps as well as the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and post-translational modifications (PTMs) on FA structure /function. Supported by four highly interactive cores, our programmatic approaches are woven into unique PPG features: i) testing of novel ARDS/VILI therapies designed to attenuate the highly druggable lung EC permeability pathway (MLCK inhibitors, S1P, HGF, integrin ?4 antibodies) and, ii) the interrogation of ARDS-associated SNPs in key PPG EC barrier-regulatory genes, studies of enormous importance as African descent individuals are a population at high risk for reduced survival in ARDS. By leveraging the outstanding scientific environment at the University of Arizona and long standing collaborations with University of Illinois scientists, this model translational PPG is exceptionally suited to provide comprehensive mechanistic understanding of lung vascular barrier regulation, and facilitate the development of therapeutic targets to restore the integrity of the injured pulmonary circulation."
"9249126","Project Summary/Abstract Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the Huntingtin (HTT) protein. A hallmark of HD found in the brains of patients is the presence of intracellular deposits containing the N- terminal fragment of mutant HTT (mHTT) with an expanded poly-glutamine sequence. Mutant HTT is prone to misfold and form aberrant species, including oligomers, fibrils and bundles of fibrils; one or more of these species can be toxic, particularly to neurons. Mutant HTT species is modulated by the protein homeostasis (or proteostasis) status of the cell. The 1 MDa, ring-shaped hetero-oligomeric chaperonin TRiC/CCT, essential for proteostasis, has emerged as a central regulator of mHTT aggregation and toxicity. TRiC is a chaperone that. Our preliminary data showed that TRiC binds to wild type (WT) and mHTT monomers, oligomers and fibers suppressing both aggregation and toxicity. Further, we find that overexpression of TRiC or small TRiC-derived domains remodels mHTT aggregates in vivo and in vitro and can protect from mHTT toxicity in HD models. We hypothesize that understanding the action of TRiC on mHTT can provide a therapeutic avenue for HD treatment. This Project will provide a deeper mechanistic and structural understanding of how TRiC and TRiC- derived domains (hereafter TRiC reagents) interact with mHTT species at the different stages of the aggregation pathway, including monomers, oligomers and fibrils, and how they influence the misfolding and aggregation landscape of mHTT. Aim 1 will use biochemical, functional and cryo-electron tomographic analyses to characterize mHTT aberrant species and their interactions with TRiC reagents using recombinant proteins. Aim 2 will examine the effects of TRiC reagents on the formation and remodeling of mHTT aberrant species in the cellular context, using neuronal lysates from HD cell models, including primary neurons from R6/2 and BACHD mice. Aim 3 will use structural and biochemical assays to examine how mHTT expression affects selected subcellular components such as axonal microtubules and mitochondria, and TRiC proteostasis in HD cell models with and without TRiC reagent treatment. We will establish a scoring system indicative of the effects of the presence of TRiC reagents on our biochemical and structural assays of mHTT species both ex vivo and in vitro. Our experiments are highly synergistic with Projects 2 and 3, which assess TRiC's role in ameliorating pathogenesis in HD neuronal and HD animal models. The results from this Project will provide a conceptual framework for these more physiological and translational studies by defining new, optimized TRiC reagents and which cellular loci and processes to examine, in preparation for engaging in studies that could establish proof-of-concept TRiC-based therapeutics for Huntington's disease."
"9444918","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although mortality due to stroke is decreasing, stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Participating in active rehabilitation aimed at minimizing impairments and maximizing function can reduce disability caused by stroke. Unfortunately, up to 40% of individuals who have had a stroke are discharged home without rehabilitation services; instead these individuals are discharged home with recommendations to increase physical activity through a home exercise program and/or a community exercise program. Recent evidence suggests that individuals post-stroke do not participate in exercise programs or continue with the home exercise program received at discharge. The overall goal of this F32 postdoctoral fellowship is to develop a resource for individuals post-stroke that facilitates engagement in physical activity after hospital discharge. The objective of this researc training fellowship is twofold: (1) gain patient-centered understanding of the facilitators and barriers to physical activity immediately after hospital discharge and (2) tailor the physical activity components of an Internet-based program to address the needs of individuals post-stroke. The first objective will consist of questionnaires and focus groups. Questionnaires will be administered to individuals post-stroke with chronic disabilities and those recently discharged home. This aims at identifying the unique barriers and facilitators to physical activity immediatel after hospital discharge. Individuals post-stroke, their caregivers, and rehabilitation therapists will participate in focus groups in order to capture all stakeholders' perspectives on factors that impact physical activity after hospital discharge. The second objective consists of adapting an Internet-based physical activity program to address the needs of individuals after stroke, using those facilitators and barriers identified in the first objective. The outcome of this study, a strke-adapted physical activity program, could be used as a resource to bridge the end of rehabilitation with continued home recovery and potentially improve long-term outcomes and quality of life. This research responds to AHRQ's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan Goal 3C: Improve the accessibility and quality of supportive services for people with disabilities and older adults Goal 1C: Emphasize primary and preventive care, linked to community prevention services, and Goal 1E: Ensure access to quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and support, for vulnerable populations."

The objectives of the Administrative core are: (i) to centralize all administrative actions and financial recording keeping; (ii) to provide statistical and data processing support for the projects; (iii) to prepare scientific and financial reports as required by the university and the NHLBI; (iv) to ensure that the PPG research meets the highest standards through periodic review by the internal and external review panels; (v) to facilitate the use of common resources; (vi) to provide the projects and cores with a review of all expenditures on a monthly basis as well as dealing with University Accounting and Grants offices concerning grant budgets; (vii) to provide the communication venues that foster exchange of scientific information and ideas and allow highly facile seamless communication between PPG scientists in Chicago and Tucson; (viii) to coordinate the travel arrangements of UA and UIC investigators for quarterly face-to-face meetings, 2 meetings in Tucson and 1 meeting in Chicago, 1 meeting during ATS conference (location varies). As this communication is vital to the success of the program, Core A personnel, will orchestrate the video conferencing of the: i) weekly meetings of individual Project and Core teams, ii) biweekly meetings of the Program Committee (led by Core A Leader and PPG PI) where Project and Core leaders discuss scientific and administrative matters, and iii) regular monthly research seminars that will allow PPG investigators to present their work in progress to other researchers. In this A1 revised PPG application, we have added to the original Core A personnel, a faculty-level Core Research Project Coordinator (Dr. Ting Wang) who will facilitate workflow between Chicago and Tucson, especially with regard to Core B, C, and D experiments and the critical exchange of reagents between Projects. Finally, Core A will coordinate the inter-project, inter-departmental, and inter-institutional collaborative arrangements and evolve new arrangements as deemed necessary for the scientific progress of the Program Project as a whole. Together, these coordinated administrative services will ensure optimal purchasing practices, facilitate frequent and productive communications between PPG scientists, and promote the high quality scientific interactions necessary to meet the goals of this translational PPG."
"9260945","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) affects one in every 10,000 people in the US, with a current estimate of ~30,000 patients in the US. HD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an autosomal dominant mutation coding for a polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin protein. Although the cause of the disease has been identified and genetic tests are available to identify those individuals who carry the mutation and will succumb to the disease, there is currently no therapy to slow or prevent the disease progression, only symptomatic treatments with limited impact. The purpose of the proposed studies is to identify biological probes which can be used for future drug development and eventual testing for their ability to prevent the progressive neurodegeneration in HD. We previously reported in vitro and in vivo proof of concept that disrupting the interaction of mutant huntingtin (mhtt) with calmodulin (CaM) is an outstanding target for treatment in models of HD. We demonstrated that disrupting the binding of mhtt to CaM, with a 46 amino acid peptide, consisting of amino acids 76-121 of CaM, was protective in HEK293 cells transiently expressing a mhtt protein construct, in neuronally differentiated SH- SY5Y cells stably expressing a mhtt protein construct and a transgenic mouse model of HD, R6/2 mice. The goal of the current proposal is to identify selective small molecule inhibitors to disrupt the binding of mhtt to CaM. We have developed and validated a HTS ready, AlphaScreen(r) assay to identify compounds which disrupt the binding of mhtt to CaM. Orthogonal screens will be used to test for selectivity using in vitro assays to test for disruption of the interaction of CaM with other proteins and a cel culture-based assay to evaluate cytotoxicity of the compounds. {Cheminformatic analysis will identify a set of prioritized chemotypes that will be subjected to iterative medicinal chemistry optimization.} Lastly, tertiary screens in a cell culture model of HD will be used to determine whether the chemical probes are neuroprotective against mhtt and disrupt mhtt-CaM interactions in cells. The goal of this project is to identify compounds that disrupt the binding o mhtt to CaM and do so selectively without inhibiting the function of CaM. The top compounds will further protect against both the deleterious effects of mhtt in neuronal cells and the transamidation of mhtt in neurons. The long-term objective of the project, outside of the scope of this proposal is to develop compounds that are protective against the neurodegeneration and other deleterious effects of mhtt in transgenic mouse models of HD and eventually lead to translational clinical testing for HD."
"9308175","PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed project will build on a well-established collaboration between researchers at the NYU School of Medicine, HealthFirst (largest Medicaid insurer in NYC), New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, clinical practices, and community partners to promote diabetes prevention among NYC South Asians. The goal of this study is to test the effectiveness and assess the implementation process of an integrated intervention to support weight loss for South Asian patients at risk for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in primary care settings. The integrated intervention has two components: an electronic health record (EHR)- based component to increase screening and identification of South Asian patients who are at-risk of T2DM; and 2) A registry-driven community health worker (CHW)-led health coaching component. Using a stepped- wedge design, we will implement the study in 25 NYC primary care practice (PCPs) sites enrolling 2,840 South Asian patients at- risk for T2DM. The project has two specific aims. First, we will test the effectiveness of an integrated EHR-based intervention (ie. an alert to screen at-risk patients and a registry function to track outcomes) plus CHW-led coaching of registered patients compared with usual care. The primary outcome is >5% weight loss among South Asian patients at-risk for T2DM. Second, using a mixed-methods approach and the RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) evaluation framework, we will systematically assess the implementation process and delineate factors that influence adoption, sustainability, and scalability of an integrated EHR-CHW intervention within applied practice settings. The integrated EHR-CHW protocol will support team-based care by allowing for feedback between providers and CHWs, who will be providing health education to participants while actively participating in patient management with providers."
"9259967","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The on-going Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study is comprised of an original cohort of nearly 4,000 US adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and aims to elucidate a broad set of risk factors for the high burden of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality among those with CKD. Despite kidney fibrosis being a final common pathway for nearly all forms of CKD, the CRIC Study has not yet examined markers of fibrosis as risk factors or predictors of clinical outcomes. The proposed CRIC ancillary study aims to leverage stored samples and accumulated follow-up within the CRIC Study to: 1) investigate the association of fibrosis markers of matrix deposition and inflammation (galectin-3, connective tissue growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase-2, and amino-terminal peptide of procollagen III) with CKD progression defined as ESRD or halving of estimated glomerular filtration rate, 2) determine the relationships between these fibrosis markers and atherosclerotic CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease) and death, 3) examine differences in the associations between the fibrosis markers and all outcomes by baseline levels of kidney function and inflammation, and 4) explore associations between genetic variants within the genes encoding for the measured fibrosis markers and CKD progression. Elevations in one or more of these fibrosis markers early in CKD could help identify a high-risk subgroup that may benefit most from more intensive risk factor management and suppression of inflammation, and potentially lead to targets for novel interventions for patients with CKD."
"9318085","Abstract Despite enduring high mental health burden, Pacific Islanders have received minimal research or clinical attention in the US. Due to our poor understanding of the issues surrounding Pacific Islander mental health, engaging Pacific Islanders in mental health services has been very difficult. For example, a Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Mental Health program targeting Samoans only managed to enroll 4 patients in 2 years even using Samoan community providers. A pilot study of these 11 community providers by the Principal Investigator identified several factors including mental health stigma, poor mental health literacy, and a lack of culturally responsive services as contributing to poor Samoan mental health service engagement. This study draws from the Cultural Determinants of Help-Seeking Model to address this research and clinical gap by conducting focus groups and citizens' panels to obtain public input from 50 Samoans in LAC and 50 Marshallese in Arkansas on their unique mental health perspectives, needs, barriers and facilitators to services, and strategies to overcome these barriers. The citizens' panels will bring together lay public members, present multiple viewpoints about various mental health issues, and have members deliberate and reach a collective decision on these issues. All group materials will be translated into English, Samoan, and Marshallese, and interpreters will be present during the sessions. The groups will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by the Research Team for themes. Numerical data will also be collected about levels of public awareness about mental illness, mental health stigma, acculturation, and underutilization of mental health services from 100 Samoan and 100 Marshallese community members to better understand these possible service barriers. Analyzed data will be used to develop a set of intervention components that are likely to increase service engagement among both Samoans and Marshallese. These components will provide the foundation for a universal service engagement intervention for Pacific Islanders that will be developed and tested in future research. Study findings will be disseminated via presentations and peer-reviewed manuscripts to the Pacific Islander, public mental health, and academic communities."
"9348090","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is one of the most common medical problems among older men ? affecting 33% of men by the time they reach 50 years of age and 75% by the time they reach the age of 80. LUTS is a progressive disease that has been shown to significantly increase the risk of depression and reduce quality of life. Due to this, early detection and active management of LUTS is critical. Uroflowmetry is an important test in the diagnosis, monitoring, and post-treatment evaluation of men with LUTS. Uroflowmeters are devices that generate graphs that characterize the volume and flow rate pattern of the void. From these graphs, physicians can identify the peak urinary flow (Qmax) which is the best single measure to predict whether or not a patient?s urine stream is obstructed. However, all uroflowmetry testing is currently being done in-clinic, which has limitations. First, having patients void in an artificial and unfamiliar clinic setting results in a different flow characteristic compared to having them void at home. Second, in-clinic testing results in a high number of uninterpretable voids when the patient isn?t able to void enough in the clinic. Uninterpretable voids are not billable by the care provider and the time spent attempting to collect this data in the clinic is wasted. In order to provide an alternative to in-clinic testing, Stream Dx, Inc. has developed and patented a low-cost, clinically accurate electronic flowmeter for at-home use. This uroflowmeter can generate the same volume and flow data that is collected by in-clinic uroflowmeters and can store multiple days? worth of patient void data in memory. Data collected on the device can then either be uploaded by the patient to our web-based portal for clinician viewing or, be uploaded by Stream Dx, Inc. after mailing the device back to the Company. In this Phase II Proposal, Stream Dx, Inc. plans to increase the usability of the Stream Dx uroflowmeter for patients and physicians. First, the Company will modify the existing device for handheld use to increase usability and compliance by patients. Second, the Company will develop mobile apps to capture intake and outflow data for patients and physicians to use in an at-home and in-clinic setting, respectfully. Third, data analytical tools will be developed on the Stream Dx website to provide physicians with additional methods of analyzing patient void data. Finally, the patient data will be integrated with the local hospital?s Electronic Health Record (EHR) for improved accessibility of the data by physicians."

"9250799","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by a suite of cognitive and social deficits, as well as by a range of somatic abnormalities, including mitochondrial, metabolic, and thermoregulatory deficits. The metabolic features of ASDs have received little attention from researchers investigating ASD-related phenotypes in mouse models. In addition, few researchers have taken a developmental approach to modeling ASD-related social deficits, despite the ASDs being understood as developmental disorders. Recent evidence indicates that several mouse models of social dysfunction (e.g., oxytocin and oxytocin receptor knockouts) have striking metabolic and thermoregulatory deficits that have gone unnoticed in previous studies of ASD-related phenotypes. A framework for relating social and metabolic deficits is lacking, and it is unclear to what extent the social deficits displayed b these models may relate to disrupted metabolic (e.g., thermal) homeostasis. We will test a framework in which social and metabolic phenotypes are seen as intimately related across developmental timescale, and in which animals with compromised metabolic and/or thermoregulatory homeostasis are predicted to exhibit deficits in basic aspects of social functioning. We will employ a suite of developmental, genetic, and pharmacological methods to elucidate these relations, and will focus on brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis as a model system for relating social and metabolic phenotypes in mouse models. First, we will track individual developmental trajectories in mice from high- and low-social strains, employing a battery of metabolic and social/emotional measures during development, with the aim of exploring the impact of naturally occurring variation in metabolic phenotypes on variation in social and emotional phenotypes. Next, we will characterize social and metabolic functioning in a number of mouse lines and genetically-engineered gene 'knockout' constructs selected for having deficits in either social or metabolic functioning, with the aim of testing our hypothesis that metabolic and social phenotypes manifest co-variations within and across mouse strains and constructs. We will also test the contribution of thermal conditions during animal rearing and testing to performance on commonly used tests of social and emotional functioning in several mouse models of ASD-related phenotypes already known to possess significant thermoregulatory deficits. This experiment will clarify the role that thermoregulatory deficits pla in the social and emotional deficits displayed by these mice. Lastly, we will examine the hypothesis that metabolic heat generated by BAT plays a significant role in mediating the prosocial effects of oxytocin in mouse models using pharmacological manipulation of BAT and oxytocin functioning. These experiments will greatly add to our knowledge of the development and expression ASD- related phenotypes in mouse models, and will have high translational value, given the presence of poorly understood metabolic deficits in ASD."
"9261385","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysregulation of vitamin D metabolism can lead to several diseases including hypercalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, rickets, osteomalacia and growth retardation. The bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), is made by the enzyme Cyp27b1 (25- dihydroxyvitamin D 1-alpha hydroxylase). Renal Cyp27b1 has long been considered the primary source of circulating 1,25D. This 40-year principle was established mainly from the observation that decreased renal function is strongly associated with decreased serum 1,25D levels in anephric animal models and patients with chronic kidney disease. It is well known that parathyroid hormone (PTH) activates its renal receptors to increase Cyp27b1 expression, and subsequently, to elevate serum 1,25D levels. However, these paradigms fit basic observations that do not take into account the fact that many tissues express the 1-alpha hydroxylase and generate 1,25D. Our preliminary studies in mice with vitamin D receptor (VDR) or Cyp27b1 gene knockout targeted specifically to parathyroid cells suggest that the Cyp27b1 expressed in parathyroid gland (PTG) could be a major source of circulating 1,25D and exert endocrine actions on mineral and skeletal homeostasis. We further found that the incubation of freshly isolated mouse PTGs with PTH(1-34) profoundly increased Cyp27b1 protein and RNA in these PTGs, indicating direct regulation of this enzyme by PTH. The above studies together led us to hypothesize that the parathyroid Cyp27b1 is a prominent source of circulating 1,25D that is subject to direct regulation by PTH and other hormonal and mineral factors. To test this hypothesis we will (1) determine the hormonal, mineral, and skeletal actions of PT-derived Cyp27b1 in the mouse model, and (2) determine the mechanisms and systemic factors that regulate Cyp27b1 expression and function in the PTG. Successful completion of this fellowship project will lend support to new regulatory paradigms for vitamin D and mineral metabolism and will provide me with essential training in parathyroid physiology, cell biology, vitamin D metabolism and mouse genetics, and will expand my technical skills in my development as an independent research scientist."
"9282298","Abstract Significance: New approaches for rapid identification and early preclinical validation of novel therapeutic targets are crucial to make important ?go/no-go? decisions and curb the cost of developing new cancer treatments. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are a powerful platform to study disease initiation and maintenance, the tumor microenvironment and the responsiveness of cancers to known or novel therapeutics; however, the long lead times and high costs required to develop, intercross and maintain models with various cancer predisposing gene combinations have limited their practical utility in the drug discovery process. Recently, we have shown RNA interference (RNAi) in mice can serve as a fast alterative to gene deletion and be exploited experimentally to silence nearly any gene target, by the expression of synthetic short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Importantly, because it is reversible, gene silencing by RNAi better mimics the dynamics of small molecule inhibition than permanent genetic knockouts. Furthermore, with the advent of new genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we are able to introduce additional sensitizing lesions to induce disease pathogenesis. In synergy with RNAi technology, complex multi-allelic ESC based GEMMs can be generated without extensive intercrossing. Using this combination of CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi technologies, we are able to not only model disease pathogenesis, but also mimic drug therapy in mice, giving us unprecedented capabilities to perform preclinical studies in vivo. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that CRISPR/Cas9-RNAi-GEMMs of cancer can be developed rapidly using new genome editing technologies (CRISPRs) to introduce additional sensitizing lesions and recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) for precise integration of tetracycline inducible shRNAs to silence specific gene targets. Preliminary data: We have previously used CRISRP/Cas9 and RMCE to generate RNAi-GEMMs without any breeding. Specific Aims: As a proof-of-concept, we will develop a model of lung adenocarcinoma by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce a conditional KrasG12D allele into the endogenous locus and in situ delivery of sgRNAs targeting Trp53 which will be activated by a conditionally expressed Cas9 allele. We will further modulate mutant Kras or Mek1/2 activity by introducing tetracycline inducible shRNAs to model therapeutic inhibition. Finally, we will expand our flexible platform by producing validated, ?off-the-shelf? viral vectors carrying combination sgRNAs targeting commonly altered genes in NSCLC. Together, these studies will define a new paradigm and accelerate drug discovery research by creating a flexible platform for the generation of RNAi- GEMMs that will serve as innovative research tools, guiding the development of novel and effective therapeutics."
"9444672","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a new T32 application requesting funding for a Neurobiology of CNS Injury and Repair Training Program for 4 predoctoral fellows/year. The training of the predoctoral fellows will be carried out by training faculty in the University of Kentucky Spinal Cord & Brain Injury Research Center (SCoBIRC). The overall goal of the proposed program is to provide broad-based training in modern research concepts regarding the acute, subacute and chronic pathophysiology of SCI and TBI and the identification of potential disease-modifying molecular targets that can drive the discovery of pharmacological and gene therapeutic strategies by which the devastating effects of these injuries can be ameliorated. These strategies will include both neuroprotective and neurorestorative approaches. Although it is anticipated that most of the trainees will pursue careers in laboratory-based therapeutic discovery research, they will also receive training in clinical aspects of the targeted neurological disorders and the practical issues involved in the design and conduct of neurological clinical trials. To accomplish this, the predoctoral fellows wil also spend one day/week for a semester shadowing neurological, neurosurgical and/or neurorehabilitation clinical faculty, and attending weekly grand rounds to gain an understanding of the clinical nature of TBI and SCI that their research is focused upon. This will enhance their future ability as independent investigators to not only make therapeutic discoveries in experimental injury models, but also provide them with knowledge concerning how to design their basic research in a manner that will more readily enable the translation of promising therapeutic approaches into clinical studies and therapeutic trials."
"9266208","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diversity of sex-specific behaviors in adult organisms have been well-described, as have anatomical differences in the nervous systems of each sex. In addition to their relevance in healthy nervous system function, sexual dimorphisms are also evident in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and PTSD. To understand the role of neural dimorphisms in these disease states, the field must first elucidate the genetic and developmental mechanisms by which these dimorphisms are established in healthy nervous systems. This proposal aims to combine the power of C. elegans genetics and the elucidated neural connectomes of both hermaphrodite and male animals with new transsynaptic labeling technologies to describe the genetic pathways regulating synaptic dimorphisms in sex-shared neurons.  In testing the hypothesis that sex-specific behaviors are a reflection of sex differences in the neural connectome, and that these differences are genetically regulated, our lab has described both synaptic pre-patterning and synaptic pruning mechanisms that contribute to formation of synaptic dimorphisms in C. elegans, and has shown that cell-autonomous regulation by the sex determination pathway in both the pre and postsynaptic sides of a given connection determines sex of the synapse.  This proposal will characterize the genetic mechanisms controlling the development of these synaptic dimorphisms in the PHA and PHB phasmid sensory neurons. In aim 1, transsynaptic labeling will be used to not only validate the dimorphic connectivity for the PHA phasmid sensory neuron, which is currently based on electron micrographical data, but also describe the developmental dynamics by which synaptic dimorphisms are established, and how this is regulated cell-autonomously by the sex determination pathway. In aim 2, the highly-conserved DM domain gene, dmd-4, will be investigated for a role in controlling synaptic pruning. dmd-4 is expressed dimorphically in both the PHA and PHB phasmid neurons at the adult stage, and this dimorphic expression is cell-autonomously downstream of the sex determination pathway. In aim 3, forward genetic EMS screens will be utilized to identify mutants unable to prune juvenile sex-shared synapses into mature sex-specific synapses, in both a hermaphrodite-specific and male-specific synaptically- labeled strain.  This will ultimately enable the description of a genetic pathway by which sex-shared neurons undergo synaptic pruning to generate sexually dimorphic adult neural circuits."
"9309767","PROJECT SUMMARY We will evaluate a technology-enabled strategy designed to promote medication adherence, routinely monitor regimen use, and mobilize appropriate transplant center resources to respond early to kidney transplant (KT) recipients demonstrating inadequate adherence. Medication non-adherence is a leading root cause of graft failure, and KT recipients have the highest reported rate of poor adherence (~35%) among all organ transplant recipients. Despite many attempts, there have been few successful interventions evaluated to date that have significantly improved KT recipients' regimen adherence and subsequent health outcomes over time. Using evidence from our research team's extensive previous studies in other chronic disease contexts, we will implement and comprehensively test a low cost, `low touch', thus highly scalable intervention: the Transplant regimen Adherence for Kidney recipients by Engaging Information Technologies (TAKE IT) strategy. The TAKE IT strategy leverages a transplant center's electronic health record a web-based patient portal, and mobile technology to: 1) educate patients on their prescribed Rx regimens, 2) help them organize their daily regimen schedule in the most efficient manner, 3) remind them via SMS text when to take their medicine, 4) routinely monitor regimen use, and 5) provide care alerts to engage appropriate transplant center clinical staff (e.g. pharmacist, social worker, nurse care coordinator) when medication concerns are detected. All components of the TAKE IT strategy have been developed with prior NIH support, refined with `user' input (patient, family, clinic staff), and their efficacy tested in non-transplant settings. Our primary aim is to: 1) test the effectiveness of the TAKE IT strategy, compared to usual care, to improve KT recipients' treatment knowledge, medication use, transplant-specific and chronic disease outcomes. Our secondary aims are to: 2) examine the persistence of any effects of the TAKE IT strategy on outcomes over 2 years among new and established KT recipients, 3) evaluate the fidelity of each component of the TAKE IT strategy over time, and investigate any patient, provider, or transplant center barriers to implementation, and 4) determine the costs of delivering the TAKE IT strategy from a transplant center perspective. We will conduct a 2-arm, patient- randomized controlled trial at two large, diverse transplant centers (Northwestern University; Mayo Clinic). 300 KT recipients within 3 months of transplant (`de novo') and 400 `established' patients between 18 and 36 months post-KT will be recruited and followed for 2 years. In-person interviews will be conducted at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Electronic health and pharmacy records will be ascertained to capture medication adherence and clinical outcomes. Additionally, our team will closely evaluate the implementation of all components of the TAKE IT strategy from launch through 2 years follow-up. We will further inform future dissemination efforts by estimating the incremental costs of implementing and sustaining the TAKE IT strategy from the perspective of two transplant centers."

"9209994","Project Summary/Abstract While phagocytosis is an effective immune strategy against many infectious microbes, some, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have evolved the ability to subvert the phagosome maturation that normally follows engulfment, and establish replicative niches inside macrophages. Intriguingly, triggering the autophagy pathway through nutrient withdrawal or chemical treatment can stimulate macrophages to overcome the block, and deliver the phagosomal contents to the lysosome for degradation. It was also found that recruitment of canonical autophagy effectors to the phagosome is required for this process, which suggested that the autophagy pathway promotes phagosome maturation. We have discovered that an evolutionarily conserved protein, Psidin, plays opposite roles in these processes: it inhibits autophagy but promotes phagosome maturation. The existence of a protein with such opposing roles indicates that, rather than co-operating, autophagy and phagocytosis may be divergently regulated, and also offers an entry point to understanding how. Using the model system Drosophila, our goal is to understand how Psidin exerts these differential effects, with the expectation that these investigations will help us understand how cells regulate these two critical processes. In Aim 1, we will test whether known biochemical activities of Psidin, such as actin regulation or protein acetylation, contribute to its regulation of autophagy vs. phagocytosis, or whether novel activities are responsible, by analysing psidin mutants that selectively impair known activities of Psidin. Immunoblot and mass spectrometric analysis will determine whether Psidin affects the levels of the Acetyl CoA metabolite, or of Lysine acetylation of total cellular proteins or candidate autophagy effectors. Finally, we will identify post-translational modifications that could direct Psidin's regulation of autophagy vs phagocytosis. In Aim 2, we will determine where in phagosome maturation and the autophagy regulatory cascade Psidin exerts its effects, and test for roles for Psidin in mediating a possible tradeoff between autophagy and phagocytosis. Phenotypic analysis of the autophagy and phagosome defects in psidin mutants, along with epistasis analysis of double mutants will allow us to determine whether Psidin regulates phagocytosis and autophagy at similar stages of the two processes but in opposite ways, addressing the exciting possibility that Psidin acts as a nutrient-dependent switch between them. Finally, we will test whether Psidin activity can boost phagosomal clearance of Mycobacteria. Overall, by applying the power of Drosophila genetics towards important and unresolved questions about the interactions between autophagy and phagocytosis, this work will clarify how these pathways engage to combat serious infections, and thus offer new avenues for therapeutic approaches to treat tuberculosis."
"9346755","Project Summary/Abstract Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) is an oncovirus that causes several cancers including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). It is estimated that 3 to 5% of U.S. blood donors have been infected with KSHV, yet in some high-risk populations such as homosexual men, prevalence is as high as 65%. In spite of HAART, KS remains the second most common AIDS- associated malignancy. A third of AIDS-KS cases now arise in individuals with relatively high CD4+ cell counts and low HIV-1 viral load. A recent study has observed a continuing high prevalence and increased acquisition of KSHV in HIV- 1+ infected persons on HAART. The data clearly indicate that KS is still occurring in HIV-infected individuals, even in the context of successful HAART. In immunosuppressed populations, approximately 1 in 200 transplant patients will develop KS. The prevalence of KSHV is responsible for the continuing incidence of KS and its associated reduction in life expectancy of HIV+ individuals. Despite its strong disease association, particularly in the HIV+ and immunosuppressed populations, there is no FDA approved clinical diagnostic test for KSHV and consequently a significant unmet need remains for a simple, cost-effective commercially viable KSHV diagnostic kit that would be an essential component of any effort to control virus transmission and monitor serostatus of those already infected. The ability to gauge the KSHV serostatus of an HIV+ individual would help clinicians make appropriate interventional choices to prevent KS onset. The overall goal of this project is to develop a serological multi-antigen assay for the detection of KSHV antibodies that can be used commercially to diagnose at-risk patients and identify blood/tissue donors with KSHV infection. In prior SBIR Phase I and II work, Epiphany developed a single-well, multi-antigenic KSHV enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) called ?4-Combo.? In screening a sera panel containing both KSHV true- positives and normal, low-risk blood donors, 4-Combo was the only assay out of 7 other independent ELISAs to detect all consensus KSHV samples with excellent specificity and sensitivity (estimated >99%, 98%, respectively). For the next stage of the kit development, it is critical to examine 4-Combo's performance against large sera banks of epidemiologically validated KSHV positive and negative controls with relevant confirmatory assays to establish the true effectiveness of the assay. A collaborative consortium that merges Epiphany with the biomedical and clinical research capabilities of the University of Miami (UofM) Miller School of Medicine, the Miami Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) and the labs of Dr. Enrique A. Mesri (CFAR) has been created. Together, Epiphany and Miami CFAR are uniquely equipped to achieve the following Aims. In Aim 1, synthetic, manufacturing, and analytical process development will be implemented followed by pilot production of a set of 4-Combo diagnostic ELISA kits. In Aim 2, these kits will be assessed and optimized by screening retrospective clinical blood samples and serologically characterized plasma/ PMBCs and validated by western blot. In Aim 3, large-scale kit production will commence. Assay stability and validation studies will be performed. A larger panel of HIV+ sera and tissues available to UofM CFAR, its cores and transplant centers, and national repositories will be massively screened to establish sensitivity and specificity. Achieving the goals of this project will establish the clinical and commercial value of 4-Combo ultimately resulting in the first FDA-approved clinical diagnostic assay for KSHV."

We plan to continue this program which has been an integral part of our Molecular Therapy Center for the past 20 years and we propose to expand the program to include 4 grants per year at $50,000 direct costs per grant."
"9242679","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite overall decreases in fertility rates throughout Latin America, fertility among adolescents has remained stubbornly persistent, particularly in countries such as Honduras which experiences some of the highest adolescent fertility rates in the region as well as globally. Honduras is also one of the 5 top countries from which the most illegal immigrants arrive in the US, many of whom are adolescents. Innovative research that integrates the understanding of the demographic and geographic determinants of adolescent fertility in Honduras with cutting edge social networks and social norms research can provide important insights into the pathways by which adolescent fertility in this population can be prevented.  This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide me with experience in formal demographic methods specific to researching fertility, expertise in the social determinants of adolescent fertility, as well as methods in spatial and social demography. This training and experience will foster my development as an independent researcher who can bridge the fields of spatial and social demography with the conceptual and methodological skills of social network analysis and social norms theory. My career development plan is designed to augment my training in global public health and allow me to: 1) gain experience in formal demography, with a focus on methods specific to understanding fertility, 2) develop expertise in the social determinants of adolescent fertility in Latino populations and 3) Obtain methodological expertise in spatial demography and geo-informatics, including analysis of spatial data, and integration of spatial variables into statistical analyses. These training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, hands-on research, and mentoring from an interdisciplinary team of experts.  The overall objective of my research project is to identify the social and spatial determinants of adolescent fertility with the goal of informing future work on prevention within this vulnerable population. The project will utilize data from a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded social network study to capitalize on its extensive research infrastructure. Previous research has suggested that social norms are an important determinant of adolescent fertility in Latin America, although these norms have, up to now not been measured quantitatively. Spatial demography provides the tools necessary to understand the geographic and social clustering of norms and attitudes, through the ability to parse out the effects of each component individually. Specifically, the research aims for this K01 are to: 1) Using formal demographic methods, determine the distribution as well as the social and demographic determinants of adolescent fertility (AF) for both girls and boys on a complete population within 160 villages in rural Honduras, 2) Assess the relationship between spatial clustering and social networks as determinants of AF, and test the effect of social network cohesion on the relationship between fertility-related social norms and AF, and 3) Assess the utility of a men's participation intervention on an adolescent boy's chance of becoming a father. This project will provide the groundwork for an R01 looking at a cohort of children from the original study population to extend the measures in this study to include an understanding of how migration, and family processes impact adolescent fertility. These training and research activities will position me as one of a few researchers in the field of public health with this uniue skill set and enable me to develop an independent research career."
"9244068","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our perceptions, behaviors, emotions, memories and intelligence depend on the appropriate synthesis and release of specific neurotransmitters in the brain. Since the award of the Nobel Prize for the discovery of chemical synaptic transmission, it has been thought that transmitters are fixed and invariant throughout life and that the plasticity of the nervous system consists of changes in the strength and number of synapses. We have discovered that activity plays a key role in transmitter specification in the developing spinal cor, regulating the specification of glutamate, an excitatory transmitter, versus GABA, an inhibitory transmitter. This discovery contrasts sharply with the current general view of transmitter constancy and identifies another way that the nervous system can adapt to the environment. Strikingly, we have discovered that transmitter switching also takes place in the adult mammalian brain. These findings lead to several related questions: 1) Is activity-dependent transmitter respecification cell-autonomous in the embryonic Xenopus spinal cord? Do patterns of calcium spike activity regulate transmitter identity in the neurons generating them or does regulation depend on the activity of neighboring cells?  2) Does activity-dependent transmitter respecification involve the action of secreted factors?  If so, what are they?  3) What is the molecular signaling cascade that drives transmitter respecification? How is calcium spike activity linked to transmitter switching? The immediate goals of this research are to test specific hypotheses about the mechanisms by which natural, spontaneous electrical activity regulates transmitter specification in the vertebrate CNS. We expect to provide information about the cellular and molecular machinery that governs transmitter specification during development. The long term goals are to use this understanding of the molecular pathways of activity-dependent transmitter respecification to develop new tools useful for treating disorders of the nervous system."
"9328867","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project, ?Identifying neurobiological predictors of alcohol use onset during adolescence?, responds to the need for a better understanding of the characteristics present prior to initiation of alcohol use that may represent risk factors for use onset during adolescence. Early initiation of alcohol use is considered one of the most important risk factors in the later development of alcohol and substance use disorders, but it is not yet well understood when initiation of use is driving neurobiological changes that account for this increased vulnerability, and when initiation is largely a proxy for pre-existing traits and neurobiological patterns, which may actually be responsible for the risk. The present prospective study therefore aims to identify those neurobiological and behavioral markers that exist prior to the initiation of alcohol use and may confer risk for earlier use onset. Specifically, the study will rely on analysis of functional connectivity data from a hippocampus-mediated spatial memory task and a frontally-mediated response inhibition task, in order to test the importance of hippocampus-PFC integration in informing adaptive decision-making and reducing risky behaviors. Adolescents are being enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcohol or other drug use at 13-14 years old for a baseline scanning visit, and are being followed for two years via annual visits and quarterly phone interviews to assess initiation of alcohol and substance use and other risky behaviors. Baseline scanning includes acquisition of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during response inhibition and spatial memory tasks, and resting state perfusion (PCASL). Magnetic resonance measures are being integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize patterns that may be predictive of initiation and other risky alcohol and drug use in adolescence. Together these data will provide a foundation for informing neurobehavioral targets and strategies for prevention and intervention efforts in maladaptive alcohol and substance use."
"9260941","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by the expansion of a CAG triplet repeat encoding a stretch of polyglutamine (polyQ) within Huntingtin (HTT), the protein product of the HD gene. The HD mutation confers a deleterious gain-of-function and potential loss-of- function on mutant HTT that affects a variety of cellular pathways. Gene-silencing is a promising therapeutic strategy for HD which can circumvent the challenge of finding treatments targeting all the cellular pathways that are affected by mutant HTT. To determine the optimal time for reducing mutant HTT expression for achieving maximal therapeutic benefit, and to evaluate the consequences if selective targeting of the mutant HTT allele cannot be achieved, we propose using novel HD knock-in mouse models (HdhLacO-140Q and HdhLacO- 20Qhu mice) in which Lac operators have been inserted into the mouse HD locus (Hdh). After crossing these mice with a strain of transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the Lac repressor (ß-actin-LacIR-tg), we can globally de-repress or repress mouse mutant huntingtin (Htt) expression, or both mutant and normal Htt expression at different ages by administering or withdrawing Isopropyl-ß-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in their drinking water.  In Aim 1, we will characterize the effect of repressing either mutant Htt or or both mutant and wild-type Htt expression at weaning, 3-, 6-, and 9-months of age in HdhLacO-140Q/+; ß-actin-LacIR tg, HdhLacO-140Q/LacO-20Qhu; ß-actin-LacIR tg, and control mice by characterizing their behavior, neuropathology, and htt expression levels at 2- to 24- months of age. In addition, to examine the effect of de-repressing mutant htt expression in an aged mouse (modeling discontinuation of a gene therapy in an older patient), IPTG will be administered to 12-month old HdhLacO-140Q/+; ß-actin-LacIR tg mice. Their phenotypes will be characterized at 12- to 24-months of age and compared to controls.  In Aim 2, in order to identify potential biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of a gene-silencing therapy, we propose to characterize by RNA-seq the proximal gene expression changes that occur in the cortex and striatum following repression of mutant htt or both mutant and wild-type htt expression at 3-, 6-, and 9- months of age. Validation of candidate genes will be performed first with brain tissue and cultured primary neurons. Validated genes will then be further examined using blood samples obtained from mice prior to and following mutant htt repression.  Together, the results of these analyses should contribute to the design of future gene-silencing therapies for HD, and to our understanding of HD pathogenesis."
"9303380","PILOT PROJECT PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The CEHS Pilot Project Program plays a pivotal role in fostering innovation and growth of the Center. The Pilot Project Program provides consistent opportunities for new research directions in toxicology and environmental health. Every year, the CEHS issues a call that is geared towards support of basic and translational research, occasionally the CEHS will issue a special call geared towards Junior faculty or translational research. All calls for proposals are open to the MIT community, leading to support of existing CEHS members, as well as non-members whose work is either already in alignment with that of the Center, or investigators who would like to explore new research directions related to environmental health sciences (EHS). By encouraging non-members to apply, we are able to encourage involvement of the Center activities, which in some cases leads to a more serious commitment in the form of membership, thus keeping the CEHS membership in a state of constant renewal. There is a fast turn-around time, enabling applicants to quickly leverage time-sensitive opportunities. With its emphasis on both supporting Junior faculty and on promoting Senior faculty to move in new EHS research directions, the Pilot Project Program provides a platform of support for new and exciting research aimed at addressing important challenges in environmental health, both at the local, national, and global levels. During the next competitive cycle, we propose to continue the Pilot Project Program which has been highly effective in the past (see Highlights of Pilot Projects Awarded in the Research Strategy) and which promises to continue to be an important source of support for cutting edge research related to EHS. Our specific aims are: (1) provide support for Junior Investigators to assist them in the establishment of new research directions related to environmental health. Pilot funding supports the gathering of preliminary data that can be used to garner more significant mechanisms of support from the NIEHS. (2) Provide a means for rapid turnaround support in order to be responsive to time-sensitive opportunities in EHS. (3) Provide a mechanism for researchers who historically have not focused on environmental health to become engaged in the mission and activities of the Center. These activities are critical in order to recruit new membership. (4) Allow for established investigators to move in directions in EHS and toxicology that represent a significant departure from their ongoing funded research. (5) Draw in investigators from other areas of endeavor to apply their expertise to EHS research. And (6) develop novel COE2C activities and tools arising directly from Center members? research."
"9262305","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a common, childhood-onset neurological disorder characterized by involuntary and compulsively-performed patterned movements called tics, often preceded by sensory premonitory urges. Severe cases suffer substantial morbidity, despite the use of antipsychotics and even deep brain stimulation. The neurobiology of TS likely involves both atypical motor and sensory development; however, the majority of investigations to date have focused on the pathophysiology and treatment implications of dysfunction in motor system circuits only. Innovative methods are now available to probe the relationship between sensory function and motor control in children, investigations critical for developing better treatments for severe TS.  In prior NIH funded research, Drs. Mostofsky and Gilbert, have employed careful clinical phenotyping, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in evaluating pathophysiology of neurobehavioral disorders in children. This study builds on prior work as well as new data quantifying sensorimotor adaptation in TS. The over-arching hypothesis of this proposal is that GABAergic dysfunction in sensorimotor cortex results in a combination of abnormal sensory adaptation and impaired inhibitory motor function that underlie the emergence of symptoms of premonitory urges and tics in TS. The primary aim of this study is to quantify the relationship between sensory adaptation, inhibitory motor physiology, and urge and tic severity in children with TS and to compare these metrics with GABA levels in sensorimotor cortex and supplementary motor area.  The investigators in this multi-PI study bring a unique combination of complementary scientific and clinical expertise, established scientific collaborations using innovative methods, and solid preliminary data to support this novel study of the pathophysiology of TS. To this end we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To evaluate and compare tactile sensitivity and adaptation in children with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and typically developing children (TDC) and determine whether impaired tactile adaptation is associated with premonitory urge severity and tic severity. Aim 2: To measure and compare inhibition in bilateral motor cortex (M1) using TMS in children with TS and TDC and determine whether reduced M1 inhibition is associated with tic severity. Aim 3: To measure and compare GABA levels in bilateral sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in children with TS and TDC and determine whether S1/M1 GABA correlates with tactile adaptation, M1 inhibition, and premonitory urge and tic severity in TS.  This innovative investigation of tactile, motor, and GABAergic dysfunction during emergence of tics in childhood will provide information vital for identifying treatments that reduce symptoms and prevent adverse outcomes in TS."
"9278166","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to develop and validate a high-resolution spatio-temporal seizure source imaging technology to image and localize seizure origin and onset zone from noninvasive high resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements to aid pre-surgical planning in partial epilepsy patients. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting about 50 million people worldwide. In approximately 30% of these patients the seizures are not controlled by medical therapy. Partial epilepsy, i.e. seizures that begin in a focal region of the brain, represents the most common type of drug resistant epilepsy. Epilepsy surgery has the best chance of curing partial epilepsy, but is only an option if the brain region generating seizures can be accurately localized and safely removed. Accurate localization of seizure origin and seizure onset zone is of paramount importance for successful epilepsy surgery. In this project, we propose to develop novel source imaging methods to image and localize seizure origin and seizure onset zone noninvasively. Of innovation is the proposed development of seizure source imaging approach, by means of novel data-driven spatio-temporal distributed source imaging and sparse signal processing strategy. Furthermore, we propose to rigorously validate the proposed approach in a group of epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial recordings and surgical resection treatment, and to disseminate the imaging software and clinical data to be developed in the proposed project. Our preliminary results are highly promising and attest to the feasibility and merits of the proposed approach. The specific aims of the proposed project are: Aim 1. Development and optimization of dynamic seizure imaging methods. Aim 2. Development of data- driven seizure source extent imaging methods. Aim 3. Validation of seizure source imaging from intracranial recordings and surgical outcomes. Noninvasive localization of seizure origin and seizure onset zone is of crucial significance for the successful surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy. The successful completion of the proposed research promises to lead to significantly advance our capability to manage drug-resistant partial epilepsy, benefitting numerous patients and the healthcare system."

"9362682","Abstract Funds for six racks to accommodate Mouse Individually-Vented Cages (IVCs) requested from Allentown would increase the mouse housing capacity in the VA Puget Sound HCS Animal Research Facility. We have recently added four new investigators at the VAPSHC which increases the overall animal numbers. The ability to efficiently house more mice within the existing space is necessary because we must accommodate the increasing number of mice needed by our investigators. Single sided racks would allow the animal facility to house more mice in smaller rooms by pushing the cage racks against the walls. No additional staff training, facility construction or electrical work will be required."
"9253029","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The importance of dietary retinol (vitamin A) and retinoid signaling for normal development and differentiation in the testis has been recognized for many years. Signaling is effected in part through the retinoic acid receptors (RARs), of which there are three isoforms, ?, ß, and ?. We and others have shown the importance of signaling via the RAR? receptor in particular during spermatogenesis by gene targeting: mice deficient in RAR? (Rara-/-) are viable but the males are sterile, exhibiting defects in the seminiferous epithelium resembling those seen VAD diet. We have also shown that mice treated with an orally bioavailable pan-RAR antagonist become sterile, with similar testicular abnormalities. We have further shown that this induced sterility is reversible even with daily treatments for as long as 4 months upon cessation of drug treatment. Importantly, no detectable side effects were observed at these low doses and normal progeny were sired by fathers after restoration of fertility. This suggested that RAR-antagonists have potential as novel, non-steroidal compounds for male contraception. We propose to pursue this potential as outlined in the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Given the successful use of the pan-RAR antagonist compound 9 to induce male sterility and the recognition that it is RAR? that is critical for regulating spermatogenesis, we propose to test RAR?-selective antagonists that are immediately available and are being developed by our medicinal chemist collaborators in inhibiting spermatogenesis. Specific Aim 2. RAR? functions as a transcription factor, activating or repressing downstream target genes and antagonists function to block this transcriptional regulation. We therefore propose that such downstream target genes may themselves represent targets for interfering with spermatogenesis and inducing sterility, particularly if they are either testis-specific or function in a testisspecific manner. As spermiation appears to be a cellular process that is exquisitely sensitive to modulation of retinoid signaling, we will therefore focus on elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the improper anchorage of spermatids relative to the basal compartment, failure to translocate from basal compartment to the tubular lumen, and failure to disengage for spermiation, etc. at the cellular and molecular levels. These experiments will involve examining the expression of candidate genes known to be important in these processes and the identification of new genes by state-of-the-art RNA-Seq analysis. Specific Aim 3. To pursue RAR-antagonists ultimately as contraceptives in men, we propose to undertake a small scale trial in a non-human primate model (the common marmoset). The goal is to set the stage for future pre-clinical trials by examining the efficacy of antagonists with regard to induction of sterility and restoration of fertility. These studies will be done in collaboration with scientistsat the Southwest National Primate Research Center in San Antonio. Our prediction is that the pan-antagonist compound 9 will inhibit spermatogenesis in a reversible manner at doses that will not induce undesirable side effects."
"9243217","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad goal of the proposed research project is to improve treatment outcomes for patients with FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 mutations are detected in approximately 25-30% of AML patients. Recently, we have found that two drug-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutations represent the most common cause of relapse in AML patients undergoing treatment with AC220 (quizartinib), the first clinically active investigational inhibitor of FLT3 for patients with AML. We have preliminary evidence that the most common AC220-resistant mutation in AML patients is sensitive in the laboratory to crenolanib, a drug that has already undergone clinical trial evaluation for other types of cancer. Crenolanib is also active in the laboratory against activation loop (AL) mutations in FLT3, which are found in 5-10% of AML patients. The second AC220-resistant mutation is sensitive to ponatinib, another investigational drug that is active in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) assess the activity of crenolanib against clinically-important FLT3 mutant isoforms in vitro and in vivo; 2) assess the ability of crenolanib and ponatinib to collectively suppress all secondary FLT3-ITD kinase domain mutants in vitro and in vivo; and 3) determine the structural and functional impact of AL mutations in FLT3. This research focuses on AML, which impacts approximately 13,000 Americans annually, the majority of whom die of their disease within 1-2 years. It is anticipated that the proposed research will: 1) determine the potential of a novel FLT3 inhibitor as a treatment for AML associated with activation loop mutations in FLT3; 2) inform the development of a possible combination FLT3 inhibitor clinical trial; 3) provide insights into the structural and signaling impacts of activation loop mutations. The research design includes in vitro and in vivo as well as structural and signaling studies, and in addition, translational studies of primary samples, including from AML patients who have developed resistance to AC220 treatment."
"9361301","The ?WR Testworks Autonomic Nervous System Integrated Evaluation Laboratory? provides a unique resource to assess autonomic and peripheral nerve function. The turn-key system is linked to a central computer and accesses a common database. The system is in use in some major clinical and research centers in the United States and has been developed, tested, validated, and upgraded. The system consists only of high quality equipment components, excellent technical support from the company, and an extensive normative database. There is currently no system to test autonomic function at the VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS) in Baltimore or any surrounding VA hospital. Drs. Russell and Zilliox have many years of expertise with assessing autonomic function and are supported by two fully trained technicians. Thus, the combination of the equipment and the expertise will ensure that high quality, reproducible research recordings are obtained.  The WR Testworks Full Autonomic Lab will be mainly utilized by six Major Users funded by VA awards; and one minor user who works closely with several VA investigators. All these projects are linked by a common theme in that they assess macro and micro vascular disease and neuropathy. As many of the funded VA clinical or translational projects at the VAMHCS in Baltimore are linked to autonomic nervous system dysfunction, the system will potentially offer other VA investigators a new powerful tool for their research projects, and provide a platform to develop new research strategies. The autonomic laboratory will be primarily utilized in these VA funded projects: Project I (James Russell, MD): Autonomic testing will be performed in Veterans with impaired glucose regulation as part of a lifestyle intervention study. A measure of autonomic function, the cardiovagal function will be the primary outcome measure. Subjects will be randomized to either an intense intervention group or standard care group. The laboratory will be Important in measuring cardiovagal autonomic function in this study. Project II (Dr. Lindsay Zilliox, MD): In this project the association between falls and orthostatic hypotension in metabolic syndrome will be determined. Subjects will undergo an intervention program to determine if the balance and lifestyle change will improve autonomic function, as measured by the autonomic laboratory, and reduce risk of falls. Project III (Brajesh Lal, MD): The project will determine the association between symptomatic carotid stenosis, cerebral hypoperfusion, and cognitive impairment. As impaired autonomic function and autonomic neuropathy impacts cerebral blood flow; testing research subjects for impaired autonomic function would help to identify factors that might impair cerebral blood flow and thereby affect cognitive performance. Project IV (Odessa Addison, PhD): Autonomic dysfunction increases the development of peripheral arterial disease and this in turn is associated with both autonomic and neuropathic changes. The autonomic laboratory would allow examination of the autonomic nervous system?s role in altered muscle perfusion in peripheral arterial disease and the effect of weight loss and exercise interventions. Project V (Steven Prior, PhD): This study will determine (1) the association between circulating angiogenic cell mobilization; and improved autonomic function and reduced small fiber neuropathy and (2) the effect of exercise training and neuromuscular electrical stimulation on autonomic neuropathy, and in turn the effect on peripheral arterial disease. Project VI (Alice Ryan, PhD): This study will examine the effect of a resistive training intervention on autonomic function with an intention to improve stroke outcomes and falls risk."
"9333796","Young people (15-24 years old [yo]) acquire half of the 20 million new sexually transmitted infections (STI) annually in the U.S. and 1 in 4 sexually active adolescent girls has an STI. Complex biological, socio- behavioral, and cultural factors place sexually active adolescent girls at higher risk of acquiring STIs compared with boys and adult women. Some STIs can increase HIV acquisition by breaching the protective mucosal epithelial barrier, promoting inflammation, and recruiting HIV target cells into the genital tract. This synergy between STIs, inflammation, and HIV contributes to the 380,000 new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women (10-24yo) each year worldwide. In communities where STI and HIV prevalence are high, sexually active girls using hormonal contraception (HC), but without barrier protection, are at risk of STI/HIV acquisition. Several observational studies have suggested that depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) may increase the risk of HIV acquisition by up to 3.0-fold. Yet, the biological aspects of STI co-infections, inflammation, exogenous hormones, and HIV acquisition in adolescent girls and young women are understudied. Given that most HIV infections occur at mucosal surfaces, there is a critical need to better understand mucosal immune function and biologic factors like hormonal status and vaginal microbiota that can alter susceptibility to STI/HIV among adolescent girls and young women. In the absence of such knowledge, the development of effective biomedical technologies to prevent STIs and HIV within this vulnerable key population will likely remain difficult. Our central hypothesis is that the hypoestrogenemia induced by DMPA decreases the vagina's natural host defense mechanisms against STI/HIV by altering the microbiota (e.g. decreasing lactobacilli), decreasing mucus pathogen trapping properties, and increasing inflammation. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two specific aims: (1) To identify the association between the vaginal microbiota, inflammation, and STIs. The vaginal microbiota of 225 menarcheal, sexually-active, healthy U.S. adolescent girls and young women (13-24yo) will be characterized by 16s rRNA sequencing using self- collected vaginal swabs in a cross-sectional design; and (2) To determine the impact of DMPA use on vaginal microbiota, inflammation, and female genital tract anatomy and physiology. A subset of adolescent girls and young women who initiate DMPA (n=40) or those not using any HC (n=40) will be followed prospectively. Changes from baseline in the vaginal microbiota, inflammation, and cervicovaginal mucus properties will be assessed at 3 and 12 weeks. Our approach is innovative because it seeks to address key issues in an understudied population using cutting edge methods. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance the field by providing key insight into the important role of vaginal microbiota and exogenous hormones, which may lead to a new approach to HIV prevention among adolescent girls and young women."
"9254451","DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS ABSTRACT The Developmental funds of the CCSG represent a vital component of the UAB-CCC Core grant by empowering the Center Director to respond to and provide leadership for the strategic scientific needs and priorities of the Center. The UAB CCC uses these funds in three primary ways. First, New Investigator funds are combined with other Center funds (e.g., gift account) and funds from departments and other Centers to provide attractive recruitment packages for faculty important to the Cancer Center's research enterprise. These recruitments may represent an enhancement of a new research initiative, expansion of an existing program or replacement of departing or retiring faculty. During the current cycle the recruited investigators have been awarded over $1.9M in extramural funding. The second use of these funds is for our Pilot Grant Program with an emphasis on young or new faculty and inter- and intra-programmatic collaborative research programs and seed funding for multi-project grants such as SPOREs and P01s. The CCC contributes to 3-4 junior faculty grants in collaboration with our American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant. Our Scientific Advisory Committee reviews and critiques these applications for Cancer Center research priorities and potential for extramural funding. The recipients of these funds have an excellent track record of successful grant funding (more than $4.1M in extramural direct costs) and adding to the scientific growth of our programs. Third, development funding is used to invest in new research technologies that the Center membership find of significant value yet cannot afford to implement individually. This investment manifests itself as expansion of the capabilities of a current shared facility or the creation of a developing shared facilities centered on the new technology. In the current funding cycle the Microbiome/Gnotobiotic Shared Facility received Developmental Funds as did the Pharamacometrics facility During the last funding cycle of the UAB-CCC there were five new investigators supported by CCSG Development dollars, seven junior investigators received pilot funding, 6 putative PO1 teams received developmental funding, one new developing shared facility was started, and another four received significant upgrades in technology. All the efforts of the CCSG Development dollars were implemented to further the mission of the Center and provide added value to the CCC membership."
"9362734","In order to understand the causes of diseases such as cancer, kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes, or degenerative diseases of the nervous system, it is important to define small macromolecular assembly/organization and their position, their spatial and temporal dynamics, along with the capability of studying these events as it happens in living cells. These capabilities are critical for understanding cellular processes and changes in cellular structures associated with disease and developmental abnormalities. Toward this goal, we are most interested in Super-resolution approaches to deliver information on subcellular organization at different timescales using various labeling probes. For example, the N-STORM imaging system will provide the necessary capacity to determine the interaction of cancer cells with other cell types, including lymphocytes and vascular cells that form blood vessels, as well as circulating inflammatory cells in the vasculature during cancer progression in the translational animal models. Our BVAMC investigators study mutations in proteins that affect the function of non-motile cilia that exist in renal epithelial cells in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Conventional confocal microscopy does not have the resolution to provide detailed information and to define structural and functional relationships in cilia and to examine ciliary defects that lead to PKD. The N-STORM super-resolution microscope overcomes the resolution limits posed by wavelength of light in conventional microscopy and would be an outstanding tool to explore, at the micron to nanometer level, primary cilia. Heart failure investigators are studying how several types of immune cells, including regulatory T- lymphocytes, interact with the injured and failing myocardium. Super resolution microscopy will permit more precise characterization of immune cell-cardiomyocyte interactions, cell migration, extravasation, and cell biology related to receptor trafficking, cell polarization, proliferation in live cell models. This technology will allow BVAMC investigators to efficiently employ fluorescent techniques for detecting protein-protein interactions in living cells with high precision to obtain detailed insight that will enable better design of receptor antagonist drug(s). With super-resolution microscopy, BVAMC investigators focusing on HIV can directly address in living cells critical questions involving HIV envelope (Env) protein biosynthesis, including post- translational modification, and importantly, solutions to critical problems that currently limit the production of native-like HIV-1 Env vaccine immunogens. Finally, the N-STORM will provide live cell imaging to track the cellular uptake and intracellular path of highly destruction proteases in cardiac myocytes and lung epithelial cells and facilitate development of targeted therapies in inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases. These studies represent a cross-section of diverse areas of disease oriented, clinically relevant research of the BVAMC investigators. The application of this exciting new technology will enhance funding capabilities and most importantly our research goals and mission of Veteran-centric medical care."

To accomplish this, the BBSF has the following specific aims: 1) coordinate and manage statistical and bioinformatics activities in the CCC, ensuring that investigators have ready access to study design and analytic consultation and support; 2) provide data analysis for CCC projects using contemporary statistical methodologies; 3) provide statistical consultation on study design and research proposal development, including pilot projects; 4) participate in teaching and training activities of the CCC; 5) provide high-quality, centralized data management services; and 6) develop methodologies for novel experimental designs and analyses that will enhance the BBSF's technical capabilities in providing collaborative research support. The BBSF continues to respond to the increasing requirement for multidimensional data analyses in mechanistic and functional studies using ?-omics? technologies, including the CCC Microbiome initiative, and works closely with the other Shared Facilities to provide support in these areas. The BBSF also plays an active role in the outreach efforts of the CCC and provides training in research design as well as ongoing support to investigators in the NCI-supported UAB, Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University partnership. The BBSF is composed of a team of faculty members and support staff, primarily from the Division of Preventive Medicine in the Department of Medicine, and calls on additional consultation resources on an as-needed basis. It provides CCC investigators easy access to well-established and comprehensive biostatistical and bioinformatics support in a timely and cost-effective manner. The success of the facility is evident through the high volume of both cancer-related publications and grants for which the BBSF provides key support in research design and statistical analyses."
"9270291","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The objective of the Short-Term Research Training Program for AuD Students at Boys Town National Research Hospital (BTNRH) is to provide a 3-month, full-time, hands-on translational research experience in the hearing sciences to five predoctoral AuD students per year. The need for this program is motivated by a shortage of audiologists who engage in research careers. By exposing AuD students to an intensive research experience, we have a unique opportunity to encourage AuD students to consider a PhD or otherwise pursue clinical/translational research careers. For this program, each trainee will be involved in all aspects of a research project, working in one of 14 BTNRH laboratories currently conducting translational research related to audiology. Most of the 14 laboratory directors have extramural support, mainly from the NIDCD in the form of R01 and R03 grants. Trainees will work with BTNRH faculty mentors who have extensive experience working in a clinically oriented, multidisciplinary research environment. The primary research experience will include (1) completion of a research project that includes the design, implementation, data collection, and analyses for the study; (2) reporting of results of the research project at the American Auditory Society meeting the following spring; (3) mandatory participation in a course in responsible conduct in research; (4) participation in weekly journal groups; (5) attendance at seminars and colloquia; and (6) informal discussions with members of the research faculty, in addition to frequent interactions with each trainee?s mentor. Prior to research participation, trainees will complete the CITI training course related to research involving human as participants. During the program, trainees will be exposed to a wide range of laboratories, in addition to the one in which they are primarily assigned. Trainees will be able to utilize support services that include cores devoted to subject recruitment, laboratory computing, and statistical analyses. T35 trainees will benefit from the experience of BTNRH faculty who have mentored postdoctoral fellows (as part of our T32 training program), provided research training to AuD and PhD students from various universities, and mentored AuD trainees who participated in the past nine years of the T35 program. T35 trainees will be recruited from AuD programs nationally, with special efforts to identify and recruit trainees from under-represented populations. Several measures will be used to assess the program?s success including (1) the number and quality of applications received, (2) exit questionnaires completed by each trainee, (3) questionnaires sent to AuD program directors regarding the impact of the T35 traineeship on their students, (4) the number of publications resulting from each traineeship, (5) the number of trainees who go on to pursue a PhD in preparation for a career in research, and (6) the number of trainees who obtain positions in which research is emphasized."
"9464212","Project Summary  We seek to develop an ultra-stable ultra-fast insulin analog formulation for use in advanced ?smart? pumps in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. A commercially available insulin formulation that is stable at body temperature for at least 180 days and at room temperature for a year would respectively make practical (a) implantable intraperitoneal closed-loop pumps for the treatment of T1DM/T2DM and (b) pre-filled patch pumps for the treatment of T2DM. The economics of the latter market makes practical the development of a critical enabling technology for an implanted artificial pancreas (?AP?) device linked to a continuous glucose monitor. Ultra-fast pharmacokinetic/dynamic (PK/PD) promises to improve the safety and efficacy of the feedback algorithms employed in such closed-loop systems.  The current barrier to the development of more stable insulin formulations is the temperature-dependent susceptibility of insulin to undergo fibrillation; such physical degradation leads to a pro-inflammatory amyloid. At body temperature fibrils can form in commercial insulin formulations in as little as one week on gentle agitation (as in a pump reservoir). Once fibrillation begins, a seeded nucleation-growth process promotes the rapid conversion of the native insulin molecules into amyloid; activity declines exponentially, making dosing inaccurate and leaving deposits that lead to catheter occlusion.  To overcome this barrier, an innovative structural approach is proposed based on a single-chain insulin (SCI) platform that is fully potent and yet refractory to fibrillation and chemical degradation. Design of this platform is based on (i) recent crystallographic studies of how insulin interacts with its primary binding site in the insulin receptor (?Site 1?) and (ii) molecular models of insulin fibrils. In particular, we have discovered that a properly constructed 6-8 residue linker between the C-terminus of the B chain (ThrB30) and N-terminus of the A chain (GlyA1) can prevent fibril formation for >1 year on gentle agitation at 37 oC while preserving native biological activity. Such an SCI is stable both in a zinc-free monomeric formulation and in a zinc-based hexameric formulation, thus providing marked flexibility in choice of excipients for the simultaneous optimization of stability and rate of absorption (fast-ON). We will extend such optimization to engineer fast- OFF pharmacodynamics (PD) through modification of insulin?s ancillary receptor-binding surface, cognate to Site 2 in the fibronectin-homology domains of the receptor ?-subunit.  An ultra-stable fast-ON/fast-OFF SCI formulation would provide a major advance in AP technology. We therefore propose to synthesize and characterize five such SCIs as candidate formulations. Dr. B.H. Frank (principal investigator) was co-inventor of Humalog? during his prior career at Eli Lilly. Thermalin Diabetes, LLC has an exclusive license to SCI-related IP, which is owned by CWRU."
"9249580","ABSTRACT (Overall Component) The overarching goals of our Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC) are to prevent disease and improve public health through innovative programs of excellence in environmental health sciences research, to engage communities to address environmental health issues, and to enhance career development of talented environmental health investigators. The EHSC provides the framework for the generation of novel research findings and their conversion into effective resources for public health officials, medical professionals, and the community. This tradition of success is based on our ability to recruit broad multi- and interdisciplinary expertise, maintain a strong emphasis on basic science principles while incorporating clinical and translational approaches, and effectively interact with the community. The specific mission of the EHSC at Rochester is to improve public health through the generation of fundamental knowledge and elaboration of mechanisms by which chemical exposures, alone or through interaction with other modifying factors, contribute to cumulative health risk across the life span. As such, the theme that guides and integrates EHSC research and community engagement programs is the understanding of interactions of environmental and occupational agents with diverse individual contexts across the lifespan in modulating human disease and dysfunction. The goals of the Center are achieved through a major focus on three research programs: Pulmonary & Cardiovascular Disease Program, Neurodevelopmental & Neurodegenerative Disease Program, and Musculoskeletal Disease Program. While the Center is structurally organized into these Disease Programs, shared thematic biological processes, including immunological responses & inflammation, stem cell biology, early life sensitivities and mechanisms of adult disease, epigenetics, and nutritional/dietary factors, weave these programs together and synergize the research. These research efforts are supported by several structural units: Administrative Core, Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core, Biostatistics Facility Core, Community Outreach & Engagement Core, Pilot Project Program, and Career Development Program for Environmental Health Science Investigators."
"9312409","Enteric infectious diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with diarrheal diseases being among the leading causes of death in the young. Detailed understanding of the interaction between enteropathogens and the human host is limited due to the inaccessibility of pathogens while growing within host tissues. Workers generally reconstruct human disease events using animal infection and tissue culture- based models to analyze the pathogen-host interface. Human diseases, however, are often poorly reproduced in animal models, while tissue culture models lack the complexity to fully reconstruct events during disease that bring in a complex group of host cells. To address these issues and provide more physiologically relevant models for use by workers studying enteropathogenesis, this application proposes a Center on Enteric Diseases in Engineered Tissues (CEDET) to generate bioengineered three-dimensional models of human tissue derived from human clinical intestinal cells. The engineered tissues developed by the CEDET team will be challenged directly with enteropathogens in a quest to develop analytic strategies that more accurately mimic events that occur in the human host compared to work in known tissue culture models. The CEDET brings investigators from the Engineering and Medical campuses of Tufts University together with a gastroenterologist to focus on identifying new strategies for analyzing the interface between enteropathogens and intestinal cells of clinical origin. The proposed CEDET will develop engineered tissue platforms for pathogens having specific metabolic requirements, described as individual but synergizing projects. In Project 1, the engineered tissues will be used to generate a model system in which the apical and basal faces of the epithelium will be exposed to different O2 tensions, to allow the study of Clostridium difficile, a strict anaerobic organism. Project 2 will develop a 3D in vitro tissue model of the human intestine tunica mucosa and study infections of human epithelium by Vibrio cholera and enteropathogenic Yersinia spp. This Project will allow the development of a tractable 3D human intestinal tissue model system for studying the specific mechanistic steps that are important for enteric pathogens to successfully colonize the host intestine. Finally, in Project 3, the 3D intestinal models will be used to overcome the technical hurdle of developing a system for continuous propagation of Cryptococcus, investigation of host-parasite interactions in primary human cells and a system for drug screening recapitulating human gut structure. Each of the Projects is driven by Aims that propose to construct artificial tissues of increasing complexity, bringing in immune cells, primary cells derived from endoscopic isolation in the clinic, and human microbiome samples in O2-controlled environments. The entire Center will be driven by Administrative and Scientific Cores, which have the express purpose of supporting synergy between the individual Projects."
"9363118","The goal of this proposal is to install CLARITY at this James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa, FL. CLARITY is a revolutionary new system that can see inside post-mortem tissue. Until now researchers have had to slice the tissue into thin sections and then visualize small areas of the tissue. With CLARITY the entire tissue, such as a whole brain, spinal cord, heart or other tissue, is made transparent allowing researchers to investigate the subcellular structure, neuronal network, specific proteins, biomolecular complexes and gene expression profiling at the resolution of single cells. For the first time, researchers can visualize the entire brain, spinal cord, or other tissue for defects associated with neurodegenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury, aging, cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke. MRI and other imaging methods are good for living tissue, but they do not provide resolution at the single cell level, they cannot identify mild traumatic brain injury, nor can they identify changes that precede full-blown pathology. MRI is not applicable to small animals, such as rats and mice, the animals of choice in neuroscience research. As reviewers, we are now seeing grants from other institutions that use CLARITY in their projects. Indeed, grants that use traditional anatomical and neuroanatomy methods are being rejected. To maintain our competitive edge it is essential to install CLARITY. This equipment will accomplish the following specific aims: i) image neural circuits and molecular pathways and mechanisms activated by optogenetic stimulation, ii) identify defects in these circuits and pathways in response to alcohol and drug addiction and specific diseases, iii) identify where these pathways are disrupted in response to cardiovascular disease, renal disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer?s disease and Parkinson?s disease."

In 2016-2020 symposium topics will include: neurofibromatosis - type I and II, leukodystrophies, brain tumors, Tourette syndrome, and traumatic brain injury. The NDC symposia uniquely serves and educates the child neurology community, ensuring clinicians can be most effective at the bedside, while also contributing to discussions on future research directions."
"9302074","Young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) commonly struggle with both glycemic control and weight. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in T1D parallels that of the general population. There is a compelling need to develop interventions to optimize two key outcomes ? glycemic control and weight status ? that address underlying metabolic processes and behavioral challenges unique to T1D. Accordingly, our main objective is to develop a rigorous adaptive design to test the efficacy of behavioral interventions to simultaneously optimize glycemic control and facilitate weight management among overweight young adults with T1D. In June 2015, we established a transdisciplinary consortium, ACT1ON: Advancing Care for Type 1 Diabetes and Obesity Network, at three institutions: University of North Carolina (UNC), Florida Hospital Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes (TRI), and the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes at Stanford University. Together, we propose Specific Aims in three phases:  Aim 1: Phase One (18 months): To establish a rigorous scientific foundation for this work. Study One: The Influence of Glycemic Control and Obesity on Energy Balance and Metabolic Flexibility in Type 1 Diabetes. Goal: To develop a comprehensive model of energy balance and metabolic flexibility in T1D that accounts for hyperglycemia and body composition. We will enroll 33 individuals at TRI (8 lean T1D, 8 overweight T1D, 8 obese T1D; with three age-, sex-, and weight-matched non-diabetic controls per group). Study Two: Dietary Response to Non-Severe Hypoglycemia. Goal: To explore the role of non-severe hypoglycemia on weight status and dietary intake, using data from a funded study (UC4DK101132 MPIs, Mayer-Davis, Maahs, Seid).  Aim 2: Phase Two (24 months): To conduct a pilot and feasibility study (n=72, 3 experimental diets, 9 months) using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to identify acceptable and effective dietary strategies to optimize both glycemic control and weight management in young T1D adults.  Aim 3: Phase Three (6 months): To incorporate findings from Aims 1 and 2 to finalize the intervention strategy and SMART design of a fully-powered efficacy trial of behavioral interventions that will be acceptable and feasible to optimize glycemic control and weight management in young adults with T1D.  We are uniquely qualified with expertise including clinical care, energy metabolism, nutrition, psychology, clinical trial design and statistical analyses, all with a focus on T1D. The proposed research is innovative, with state-of-the-art bioenergetic modeling, trial design, and statistical methods. Achievement of our objective would be highly significant and will ultimately lead to changes in clinical practice with an effective, acceptable approach to co-manage glycemia and weight in young adults with T1D."
"9254467","01 INFLAMMATION, IMMUNOLOGY AND IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS (III) PROGRAM ABSTRACT Decades of research on basic immunology and the interactions of tumors and the immune system have led over the past few years to an explosive increase in the successes of immunotherapeutic modalities in cancer. The objective of the Inflammation, Immunology, and Immunotherapeutics (III) Program is to build on and to accelerate those successes by developing novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of leukemia/lymphoma and solid tumors, and to understand and exploit the basic biology of the immune system's responses to cancers. The emphasis is on antibody and T-cell mediated therapy in preclinical models and clinical translation studies. The Tumor Immunology Program has been a component of the Cancer Center since its inception and in 2012, it merged with the Virology Program to become the III Program. It is currently led by Casey T. Weaver, M.D. (Pathology), and Donald J. Buchsbaum, Ph.D. (Radiation Oncology), and has 40 primary faculty members from seven departments. The Program has $11,611,410 in annual direct grant support of cancer relevant research including $756,267 from NCI, $9,592,968 from other NIH Institutes, $289,001 from other peer-reviewed awards, and $973,174 in non-peer-reviewed support. The Program has two major areas of emphasis: (1) development of targeted immunotherapy utilizing antibody specificity to deliver apoptotic stimuli, drugs, or radioactive isotopes to tumors in animal models and human cancer; and (2) exploration of basic immunobiology research in the areas of inflammation and T- and B-cell immunology to translate into immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic modalities. The Program has major collaborations with the Experimental Therapeutics and Cancer Cell Biology Programs, and HudsonAlpha including individual projects in the Breast Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer SPOREs. During the previous funding period there were 310 total publications, of which 72 (23%) were intra-programmatic, 69 (22%) inter-programmatic, and 161 (52%) inter-institutional. 1"
"9250648","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The main objective ofthe Administrative Core (Core A) is to provide a structure and support mechanism to the entire Center for Reproductive Genomics (CRG). The Admin core will facilitate interactions across the Ithaca and Manhattan campuses of Cornell University, will encourage research in small RNA biology, both in reproductive medicine and across clinical disciplines, and will promote strong training in reproductive medicine that encourages a translational focus. In general, the Admin core will focus efforts on three major philosophies: translational and innovative research, teaching, and outreach. The Admin core will be housed in the College of Veterinary Medicine, specifically within the Department of Biomedical Sciences, a department that already orchestrates two major cross-campus initiatives: the Center for Vertebrate Genomics and the Stem Cell Center. The CRGs close proximity to these two centers will provide integrated access to many investigators with similar interests and in similar disciplines. The Core Director and Co- Director will oversee many aspects ofthe core's function including fiscal management, co-ordination of CRG meetings, organization of biannual meetings ofthe Internal Advisory Council, and the annual retreat, which will also encompass meetings ofthe Internal and External Advisory Committees. Lastly, the core will administer the Pilot and Collaborative Projects small grants competition, which will be held twice per year and which will focus strongly on encouraging new faculty to enter the field of reproductive biology, and more specifically to focus on small RNA biology and genomics. Similarly, the Admin core will administer the Translational Research in Small RNA biology program in which researchers from other SCCPIR centers will be invited to Cornell to learn about small RNA biology and to acquire relevant techniques for their further research. For all these functions, the core can rely on the almost-daily involvement ofthe Core Director, Dr. Paula Cohen, whose leadership capabilities are exemplified by the very existence ofthe CRG, which she devised and established in 2006. Together with Ms. Elena Cestero, the CRG administrator, this team is well prepared to run the Core."
"9222002","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in women of childbearing age has resulted in a substantial increase in mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. In the absence of intervention, the rate of MTCT can reach 35%. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced the incidence of MTCT; however, such treatment is not widely available in developing countries, and ART does not affect the initial transmission of the virus through the epithelium. To initiate systemic infection, HIV must first be transmitted across oropharyngeal and/or intestinal mucosal epithelia of neonates/infants and then infect susceptible immune cells, but the mechanisms of HIV transmission across neonatal/infant mucosal epithelia is poorly understood. We have developed two novel and complementary models for the study of epithelial transmission of HIV: monostratified polarized oral epithelial cells and polarized oriented oral and intestinal tissue explants of adult and fetal/infant origins. We have shown that cell-free and cell-associated HIV transmission may occur through the fetal/infant oral epithelium but not the adult oral epithelium. Our preliminary data show that HIV-associated phosphatidylserine (PS) interaction with the PS receptor T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) may facilitate cell-free viral transcytosis through the neonatal/infant oral mucosal epithelium. HIV-infected cells of the mother from cervical/vaginal fluid and breast milk may penetrate into neonatal mucosal epithelium by interaction of adhesion molecules of macrophages/lymphocytes with mucosal epithelia. We also found that the anti-HIV innate proteins HBD-2 and - 3 inactivate virus during its transcytosis in the vesicular compartment through indirect interaction with gp120. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms of HIV transmission via neonatal/infant oral and intestinal epithelia may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV MTCT and the development of a new preventive therapeutic strategy against HIV MTCT. Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To study the role of HIV macropinocytosis and endocytosis in viral transmission across fetal/infant oral and intestinal epithelia. 2. To study the molecular mechanism of HIV-infected macrophage penetration into fetal/infant oral and intestinal epithelia. 3. To investigate the mechanisms of HBD-2- and -3-mediated intracellular inactivation of HIV in fetal/infant oral and intestinal epithelia. The results of these studies will provide new information on the molecular mechanisms of MTCT of HIV via fetal/neonatal oral and intestinal mucosal epithelia and will open new avenues for designing antiviral drugs that specifically block HIV MTCT through mucosal epithelia."
"9420456","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last decade, the numbers of incarcerated females has tripled, making women the most rapidly growing group of offenders in the United States. When compared to incarcerated males, female offenders have a higher rate of being sentenced for drug crimes; moreover, they are often injection drug users (IDUs), have sexual partners who are IDUs, and are often forced into the sex trade for survival. As many as 50 percent of female offenders report physical and/or sexual abuse; further, traumatic abuse, chronic emotional distress, and internalized stigma resulting from being a felon and a drug-user, have a profound effect on the women's self-esteem, leading to feelings of hopelessness and depression, delayed recovery and reintegration, increased risky behaviors, and health concerns. Not surprisingly, women who have been incarcerated are nearly twice as likely to experience mental illness compared with non-offending women; further, 44 percent recidivate within a year due to possession of a controlled substance. In particular, among homeless female offenders (HFOs), both parolees and probationers report ongoing challenges for successful re-entry. These include unstable housing, disorganized lives, unemployment, and limited access to health and social services. While the Los Angeles County Department of Probation has provided guidance for successful programs in its California Blueprint Master Plan for Female Offenders, the suggested strategies of enhancing empowerment, positive coping, and job skills, and providing peer-mentored approaches have not yet been implemented or evaluated.  In Phase I of this R34, our team of University of California Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Irvine researchers plan to utilize our successful community participatory approaches to refine a gender-sensitive criminogenic needs - focused intervention program, Female Ex-Offender Mentoring in Care (FEM-CARE), with the help of a community advisory board, composed of HFOs and addiction staff; and finalize strategies which will be validated by focus group sessions with HFOs. In Phase II, we will randomize 130 HFOs participating in one of two residential drug treatment programs to assess the impact of the FEM-CARE or a Health Promotion control program on reduction of drug and alcohol use and recidivism. This study is based upon our team's history of promoting theoretically-based, culturally- sensitive nurse-led interventions that are enriched with criminal justice theoretical perspectives, and have resulted in significant reductions in drug and alcohol use among homeless persons, many of whom have had a history of incarceration. Our most recent successes in engaging male parolees in nurse-supported peer mentorship, our team's expertise in enhancing stigma reduction among vulnerable women, and our criminal justice experts have informed this study. Finally, recent formative research with HFOs has revealed a desire for peer role models to support and enhance knowledge of and access to healthcare, promote positive coping, stable housing, and job skills, and to reduce stigma and depressed mood; all of these factors can result in novel programs designed to prevent drug and alcohol use and reduce recidivism. This foundation and strong community support garnered has led to the design of our proposed intervention program."
"9346740","Abstract: Since their clinical introduction over 30 years ago, cochlear implants (CIs) have had a remarkable impact on patients experiencing moderate-to-profound hearing loss. Recent advances in technology have driven the development of ?hearing preservation? implants and procedures designed to preserve the residual acoustic hearing of patients while treating the damaged areas of the ear with an electrically stimulated CI. Despite these advances, over half of patients undergoing this procedure will eventually lose residual hearing months to years after surgery likely due to cochlear trauma sustained during the surgery. Additionally, because current techniques do not allow the electrode to be inserted farther into the cochlea to reach now dysfunctional regions, patients either require additional surgery or live with suboptimal hearing once again. iotaMotion is developing an implantable robotic-assisted positioning system to enable precise control of intracochlear electrodes both intra- and post-operatively to reduce the effects of post-surgical hearing loss. The anticipated impact of this technology will be to improve the long-term outcomes of patients undergoing ?hearing preservation? cochlear implantation as well as increase the candidacy range for this procedure. The overall goal of this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project is to further develop and ultimately commercialize iotaMotion's proprietary technology. During ?Phase I-equivalent SBIR? studies, iotaMotion developed and characterized an initial prototype to establish proof of concept and feasibility in cadaveric models. Following that success, Phase II will continue to develop the technology toward commercialization with the following specific aims: 1) Verify device compatibility and ?open? platform with commercially available cochlear implants . Using 3 clinically available electrodes, we will establish the procedure, instructions, and ease of use for integrating each electrode within the device, then determine the maximum stall force that can occur with each device/electrode combination. 2) Establish that the iotaMotion pilot-line system meets functional, quality, safety, and biocompatibility requirements in a GLP environment. Using a combination of international standards and in-house experiments, we will demonstrate that the device can be sterilized, is biocompatible, and can remain functional in the body for up to 6 months. Quality standards will be implemented to ensure valid data are collected for eventual regulatory submission. 3) Evaluate the efficacy of the iotaMotion robotic-assisted surgical system in a long-term large-animal model. Phase II will conclude with an evaluation of the device efficacy in an established sheep model over 3 months. Completing these aims will set the stage for our system development and production in a GMP environment with private-sector partnering and execution of a prospective clinical trial designed to establish safety and efficacy in humans. The phase II project enables iotaMotion to achieve significant commercialization milestones, driving the company forward toward improving the hearing and quality of life for millions worldwide."
"9294220","The proposed research will use a personalized precision medicine approach to establish a preclinical model of chronic repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI). The first objective of the proposed research is the elucidation of the blood molecular signature for chronic rat rmTBI. The second objective is to test whether administration of the neuroprotective agent neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) improves behavioral performance in this model. This is highly relevant because a significant military and veteran population exists that experiences persistent symptoms chronically following mTBI/concussion. The Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique, RNA-Seq, can identify characteristic expression patterns of exons, or a molecular signature, in blood samples drawn from stroke and TBI patients that can distinguish the injured patients from controls. The proposed study will employ RNA-Seq analysis in the development of an experimental animal model that will allow for control of model parameters, reducing the sample size, compared to human studies, needed to conclusively identify blood molecular signatures. This represents a step towards the development of a diagnostic tool that could be used to objectively identify patients who suffered rmTBI, resulting more targeted treatment. A significant benefit of this preclinical model is that it will support testing of experimental therapies, giving valuable functional and blood molecular information in return. This proposal includes an initial therapeutic trial with NRG-1. NRG-1 has the additional ability to reduce brain inflammation which could address the issue of persistent inflammation that has been demonstrated in chronically injured brains. This could also contribute to the improvement of behavioral outcomes."
"9253442","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching theme of the proposed Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is to transform how individuals with comorbid mental illness/AIDS are treated and managed by developing innovative, interdisciplinary, and integrative approaches to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes and achieving a better understanding of the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying these combined illnesses and treatments. No other center in the U.S. is currently pursuing this explicit focus, making PMHARC unique in the NIMH ARC portfolio. A substantial body of work links psychiatric disorders to acquisition of HIV infection, accelerated immune dysfunction, poor access to HIV care, and poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment once in care. Yet, there is a relative paucity of evidence-based interventions focused on the combined treatment of mental illness/AIDS and related medical co-morbidities, and relatively little work in determining the relationships between mental health treatment and HIV/AIDS disease and understanding the underlying biology. PMHARC will stimulate novel approaches and strategies to address these problems by providing mentoring and resource support for both new and established investigators choosing to study comorbid mental illness/AIDS, in part through innovative pilot studies. PMHARC's leadership has extensive expertise in contemporary pharmacotherapy of mental illness and AIDS, cognitive behavioral treatments, and theory-based behavioral interventions. PMHARC will extend well-established collaborations at Penn and CHOP, including those in the Department of Psychiatry and Penn Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), as well as with community partners in Philadelphia. A unique feature of PMHARC is the collaboration of well-established mental health AIDS researchers, well-established mental health researchers who have not previously studied AIDS, well-established substance abuse AIDS researchers who have not previously studied mental health, and AIDS researchers not previously focused on mental health. PMHARC will have an Administrative and Developmental Core, and four Shared Resource Cores."
"9249123","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary cellular defense system against protein misfolding and impaired clearance is the functional network of chaperone proteins, such as TRiC, which are both responsible for the proper folding of normal proteins and the attempt to refold or initiate destruction of damaged and genetically abnormal proteins. Compelling evidence from model systems supports the view that the proteostasis network can be modulated to improve the outcome of the cellular challenges presented by the toxic protein species responsible for neurodegenerative disease. However, to date, no effective therapeutic intervention for any neurodegenerative disease has been developed based on any principle including modulation of the chaperone network. This proposal is focused on carrying out an integrated program of investigation whose goal is to create a strong framework in which basic science understanding of the structure of toxic species and their interaction with the proteostasis  network is linked to translational approaches to reduce the accumulation of these species through reduced production and/or enhanced clearance. In so doing, the application addresses the critical societal goal of intercepting the oncoming epidemic of neurodegenerative disorders. We have chosen the paradigmatic neurodegenerative disease Huntington's disease and the TRiC chaperonin network as the focus of our program, based on strong data by our team that TRiC complex components provide clear beneficial effects on mutant HTT-induced phenotypes in model systems. In this Program Project we propose 3 integrated Projects and 2 supporting Cores to investigate mHTT-TRiC chaperonin interactions and determine how select TRiC related components contribute to or reduce mHTT-driven pathogenesis. The hypothesis that guides the proposal is that TRiC plays a critical role in regulating the accumulation of toxic form of the expanded repeat HTT protein and hence increasing the activity of TRiC and TRiC-derived proteins will abrogate and/or reverse mHTT-linked pathogenesis. We propose the following four overall Specific Aims: Aim 1: To characterize the interactions between TRiC reagents and aberrant forms of mHTT under in vitro and ex vivo conditions as well as in HD model cells and neurons. Aim 2: To investigate the impact of existing and novel TRiC reagents on the production and accumulation of mHTT species and cellular proteostasis. Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the impact of TRiC reagents on neuronal function and survival in cell culture. Aim 4: To systematically evaluate and compare the impact of TRiC reagent therapy in mouse models of HD through quantitative measures of neuronal structure, function and pathology. Our program will provide a framework for the extension of the study of TRiC based therapeutic strategies for other neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, PD, ALS or FTD. While our proposal will focus on TRiC-based therapeutics, our assays may point to the participation of chaperones that partner with TRiC in regulating mHTT effects and open the possibility of additional novel approaches to HD and related disorders."
"9329003","PROJECT SUMMARY The human genome has traditionally been studied as a linear entity, ignoring how three-dimensional looping interactions that bring together distal non-coding regulatory elements and proximal promoters may modulate gene expression. Even with innovations in chromosome conformation capture techniques, the 3D neuroepigenome remains largely underexplored. Exploration of cell-type-specific chromosomal conformations will advance insight into hitherto unknown roles of non-coding sequences in the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The basic mechanisms of these processes can be elucidated using a human induced pluripotent stem cell-based platform, where isogenic neural cell types can be inexhaustibly derived from one individual. In this proposal, we seek to explore how 3D chromatin interactions and topology change based on cell type given an identical genotypic background in normal human neural differentiation, from neural progenitor to either astrocyte or excitatory neuron. I hypothesize that identity-specific regulatory element- promoter loops will emerge that connect noncoding sequences to transcription start sites, thereby modulating gene expression. By overlaying known schizophrenia ?risk loci,? many of which are in noncoding regions, on neuron-specific chromatin loops, I will attempt to find those loci that occur in sequences of the genome critical for loop formation. Finally, I hypothesize that by manipulating such candidate (i.e., risk-loci-bearing) loops with targeted CRISPR epigenetic editing, I will observe changes in gene expression. Findings from the proposed project will greatly advance knowledge in the field of how the 3D genome can quite literally contribute to the risk architecture of psychiatric disease, promoting the development of more effective diagnosis and treatment in the future."

First, the treatment of many neurological disorders would benefit from a method for generating specific types of neurons from the patient's own induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells. Second, many psychiatric disorders arise in part from developmental defects. Generating therapeutic tools to treat these types of disorders will require a detailed understanding of how each neuronal subtype is normally formed. We have been investigating this question in the model organism Drosophila, which has been profoundly important for discovering mechanisms of neurogenesis relevant in mammals. Much is currently known about how neural progenitors acquire their spatial identity (e.g. forebrain vs. hindbrain) but we still know very little about how they sequentially produce different cell types. We previously identified a series of transcription factors that specify temporal identity within the Drosophila nervous system. Here we focus on three related questions in embryonic progenitors (Aims 1-3) and conclude with the first analysis of temporal identity in a newly discovered Drosophila post- embryonic neural progenitor that shares features with the primate outer ventricular zone progenitor (Aim 4).  In Aim 1, we will determine whether the Hunchback transcription factor acts transiently in progenitors or continuously in post-mitotic neurons to specify first-born temporal identity. Because the mammalian Hunchback ortholog Ikaros has a similar role in specifying early-born retinal ganglion cell fates, this aim has the potential to hep design therapeutic treatments to replace a cell type essential for human vision.  In Aim 2, we follow up on results from the previous funding period showing that neural progenitors lose competence over time to form early-born neuron subtypes in response to a pulse of Hunchback expression. We will determine the mechanism of progressive loss of competence in these progenitors, aided by the identification of a nuclear protein whose expression mimics the competence window, and whose prolonged expression can extend the competence window.  In Aim 3, we initiate work on a new Type II neural stem cell that we and others recently discovered. Each brain lobe contains 8 type II neuroblasts that divide asymmetrically to produce a series of intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) that each also divide asymmetrically to make a sequence of 10-12 neurons. We will characterize the relationship between neuroblast or INP birthorder and the production of distinct neural subtypes. We have recently identified transcription factors expressed in sequentially in INPs, and we will determine if they specify temporal identity in these sublineages."
"9235242","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 repeat that results in expression of the DUX4 retrogene. Mutations in SMCHD1 result in decreased D4Z4 epigenetic repression through its direct repressor activity at the D4Z4 repeat and cause FSHD. The broad and long-term goal of this application is to develop therapies for FSHD based on increasing SMCHD1 activity or protein level, or decreasing the activity of factor(s) that counter-act SMCHD1 epigenetic activity at the D4Z4 repeats. The specific goal of the research design is to determine the positive and negative modulators of SMCHD1 activity and their epistatic relationship to the epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat and DUX4 expression. Aim 1 will identify the molecular components and the biological functions of the pathways that regulate the post-transcriptional and post-translational production and activity of SMCHD1, and provide a rational basis for the therapeutic modulation of SMCHD1 in FSHD muscle. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that FSHD2-associated SMCHD1 variants partially inhibit the activity or stability of the wild-type protein and provide a rationale to target the variant isoforms as a therapeutic approach. Aim 3 Identifies components of the SMCHD1 repressive complex and determines their role in D4Z4 epigenetic repression. Together, these studies will provide the basis for future therapeutic development based on increasing the epigenetic repression of D4Z4 in FSHD individuals."

"9244669","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects approximately 8% of reproductive-aged women and is marked by  hyperandrogenism and oligo/anovulation (with subfertility). The underlying causes of PCOS remain unclear,  but puberty is a critical developmental window during which the pathophysiology of PCOS unfolds.  Peripubertal hyperandrogenemia (HA) can represent a precursor to full-blown PCOS, and HA is very  common (~ 60% overall) in peripubertal girls with obesity.  Our primary goal is to understand the ontogeny of PCOS across pubertal development, especially with  regard to abnormal gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and gonadotropin (luteinizing hormone [LH]  and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) secretion. We will address two key gaps in knowledge: (1) How do  the neuroendocrine abnormalities of PCOS (e.g., rapid GnRH pulse frequency and excessive LH secretion)  develop during puberty? (2) Why does HA begin and progress in girls who go on to develop PCOS?  In brief, our working model for the pubertal development of PCOS in obese girls is as follows: Progesterone  (P4) negative feedback is an important contributor to day-night differences of GnRH secretion during  puberty, but HA antagonizes P4 negative feedback on the GnRH pulse generator. Entering neuroendocrine  puberty in the setting of relative HA (initially of adrenal origin) promotes an abrupt transition to high 24-h  GnRH pulse frequency: this favors LH over FSH secretion, which promotes ovarian HA and interferes with  follicular development. In addition to disrupting P4 negative feedback,- HA antagonizes sex steroid positive  feedback at the pituitary, leading to defective LH surges. Together, these neuroendocrine abnormalities  support a progression to adolescent/adult PCOS.  The proposed project involves clinical research studies designed to elucidate the role of P4 in directing daynight  differences of GnRH pulse frequency during puberty in normal girls (Aim la); the role of testosterone  (and HA) in modifying day-night regulation of GnRH pulse frequency (Aims lb and 1c); the role of HA in  disrupting sex steroid positive feedback (LH surge generation) in late pubertal girls (Aim 2); and the sources  and determinants of HA in some pubertal girls with obesity (Aim 3). These studies will synergize with the  basic studies of Projects II and III to help elucidate the pubertal ontogeny of PCOS, all with a view to  developing rational preventive strategies."

"9249128","Project Summary/Abstract Biochemical analysis and cell based phenotypic assays clearly establish the impact of modulation of the TRiC chaperonin system on mutant Huntingtin protein. To develop an effective TRiC based therapeutic strategy for blunting the pathological impact of mutant HTT, it is essential that studies on TRiC chaperonin interactions with mutant HTT be carried out in an animal model setting as close as possible to the human brain. The studies proposed in this project directly address this central issue. Aim 1: To perform an integrated evaluation of the impact of apiCCT1 delivery to the mouse striatum on mutant HTT biochemistry and quantitative measures of HD pathology. Preliminary data demonstrates that exogenous application of the apical domain of CCT1 in cells is sufficient to modulate aberrant accumulation of mHTT. To form an accurate and quantitative understanding of the impact of apiCCT1 delivery to CNS cells in vivo we will deliver apiCCT1 by several alternative modalities and 1) carry out assessments of the status and levels of aberrant forms of expanded repeat containing HTT including soluble, oligomeric and fibrillar forms, 2) assess the impact on HD pathological phenotypes in HD mouse models, including using reporters for the measure of transcriptional dysregulation, an early, characteristic HD phenotype, and 3) quantitatively assess the efficiency of uptake and subcellular localization of delivered apiCCT1. Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the modulation of additional components of the TRiC system and TRiC inspired reagents on HD pathology and mutant HTT behavior in mouse brain. In projects 1 and 2 of this proposal, novel TRiC based or TRiC inspired reagents including novel forms of apiCCT1 optimized for therapeutic benefit, other components of the TRiC chaperonin system such as CCT3 and CCT5 and combinations of TRiC inspired reagents, will be developed. In this project, these novel TRiC inspired reagents will be tested in mouse brain for their impact on mutant HTT driven pathology and biochemistry using methodologies used for apiCCT1 in specific aim 1. Aim 3: Bring an optimized TRiC based therapeutic strategy to full scale behavioral testing and evaluation of neuronal trafficking in HD model mice to evaluate the potential clinical utility of this strategy. We will carry out full scale behavioral testing in fragment (R6/2) and full length (BACHD) HD model mice of optimized TRiC chaperonin based therapeutic intervention for HD. These studies will be designed to serve as initial preclinical studies to evaluate TRiC chaperonin therapy for human use. We will use neuronal trafficking assays based on studies already shown to demonstrate the striking impact of TRiC chaperonin activity in cell culture to assess the impact of TRiC chaperonin therapy on this significant parameter of neuronal health and function on full length HD model mice in vivo.  "
"9282643","ABSTRACT: This Proteome & Genome Core (PPG Core B) will provide essential, cutting edge, proteomic/transcriptomic/genetic expertise to facilitate the translational impact of this highly integrated PPG. This PPG Core will be responsible for providing the research investigators with a well characterized ARDS biobank (i.e. DNA from European descent and African descent subjects), a complete list of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) for each PPG candidate gene, mid-throughput genotyping services, and data analysis tools to test for association between PPG-studied SNPs and susceptibility and severity of ARDS. The functional non-synonymous coding SNPs will be screened in silico to identify their impact on protein structure and function (protein-protein interaction, catalytic activity, post-translational modification) by computational protein structure molecular modeling, with protein-protein interaction validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) screening. Effects of exon-intron boundary SNPs on alternative splicing of these key genes will be analyzed by in silico prediction and further validated by SNP-containing minigene constructs in individual projects. PPG Core B will provide the service to generate the mutated DNA constructs (with disease-associated SNP) to generate recombinant protein used in SPR, or GRF-labeled protein for cellular location tracking in endothelial cells (to be used in Core D and individual projects). In addition, this PPG Core will further validate the genomic expression data by proteomic approaches (2-D protein gel and mass spectrometry). On top of the protein level characterization, the PPG Core B will define the protein translational modification (PTM) status including phosphorylation, nitration, and ubiquitination via traditional mass spectrometry analysis. PPG Core B will utilize the up-to-date technologies to provide a proteomic-genomic study platform for all three Projects and generate novel information on the genes targeted for investigation in this PPG. This PPG Core will also provide software and hardware infrastructure for (i) federated tissue management (e.g. chain of custody while transferring tissues from any lab to any Core) and (ii) secure data exchange between Cores and Research investigators. Core B will also resource investigators and Cores with TissueMetrix tissue management software that also provides chain of custody management of samples transferred between investigators and Cores and reconciliation between lists of samples send and received. In addition, large files generated by the cores will be transferred to investigators using a secure IPSwitch portal that also manages authentication and keeps logs of accessed files by legitimate users (e.g. genomics, transcriptomic, proteomics, imaging)."
"9237203","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inflammasomes are crucial innate immune signaling platforms implicated in immune defense against infections and autoimmune/autoinflammatory disorders. Despite their important physiological and pathological functions, the critical need for inflammasome-specific chemical probes has not been met and none of the reported inflammasome inhibitors directly engage the inflammasome receptor/sensor proteins. This not only impedes the progress of mechanistic studies in the inflammasome field, but also hampers the development of specific and potent therapeutics for inflammatory disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriasis, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), gout, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and atherosclerosis. My lab has made major contributions to our understanding of the structure and function of the AIM2 and IFI16 inflammasomes: we established the structural basis of sequence-independent dsDNA recognition by AIM2 and IFI16, characterized the autoinhibition mechanism that regulates the AIM2 receptor, elucidated the signaling mechanisms mediated by the pyrin, CARD and TIR domains from the inflammasome receptors and signaling adapters. We will leverage our expertise and experience and test the hypothesis that chemical compounds that bind the inflammasome receptors/sensors or adapter at critical domain interfaces will stabilize different conformational states of their structures and thus modulate ther functions. To this end, we will explore a two-pronged approach to identify chemical probes specific for the AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. In aim 1, we will perform structure-based virtual screening for chemical probes that specifically bind AIM2, NLRP3 or ASC. We anticipate that small molecules that bind and stabilize the intramolecular domain-domain interfaces and the autoinhibited structures of AIM2 and NLRP3 may serve to suppress their activation. On the other hand, disruption of the ASC PYD oligomerization interface using chemical compounds that competitively inhibit the ASC filament formation may also inhibit inflammasome activation. In aim 2, we will carry out three independent in vitro assays that allow us to screen and validate inflammasome-specific chemical compounds that bind and regulate the ASC polymerization and speck formation. These assays include the thermofluor assay and the ASC polymerization assay using purified AIM2, NLRP3 and ASC proteins, and the ASC speck formation assay using a bone marrow-derived macrophage cell line stably expressing fluorescent cerulean-tagged ASC protein. We anticipate that chemical probes that specifically modulate the activities of either the AIM2 inflammasome, the NLRP3 inflammasome, or both through ASC, will be identified and validated. Importantly, the success of this project will fulfill unmet needs for hig quality and novel chemical tools to probe the function of specific inflammasomes, as well as to stimulate the development of specific and potent therapeutics against inflammatory disorders."
"9246576","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competing renewal application seeks to understand and develop treatments for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease. SCA3 is one of nine inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode abnormally long polyglutamine tracks in the disease proteins. A fatal and incurable disorder, SCA3 may be the most common polyglutamine disease in the world. Thus, the unmet needs are great for this particular disorder and for all other polyglutamine diseases. The current proposal moves from our prior exclusively mechanistic focus to a complementary set of mechanistic and translational studies. Our central hypothesis is that the mutant SCA3 disease protein, ATXN3, is toxic due to its tendency to misfold and aggregate, implying that efforts to reduce levels of this toxic protein will be an effective route o preventive therapy. Our primary objective is to identify strategies to reduce levels of this toxic disease protein so that we can achieve our long-term goal of developing effective preventive therapy for SCA3 and other polyglutamine diseases. Aim 1 will address a central, unanswered question in all polyglutamine diseases: What is the relationship between the process of polyQ disease protein misfolding and aggregation on the one hand, and the process of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration on the other hand? Aim 1 leverages newly developed knock-in mouse models of SCA3 to test the hypothesis that the aggregation propensity of mutant ATXN3 directly contributes to toxicity, driving downstream molecular events that contribute to disease pathogenesis. Aim 2 seeks to define the genes and pathways that regulate cellular levels of ATXN3 in neurons. Aim 2 builds on our recent RNAi screen to identify genes that modulate ATXN3 and on a growing understanding of how specific ATXN3 interactors influence levels of the disease protein. Druggable genes and molecular pathways identified in Aim 2 are likely to include attractive targets for therapeutic strategies to reduce levels of the disease protein in SCA3 and possibly related polyglutamine diseases. Aim 3 takes the view that a particularly effective therapeutic strategy for SCA3 and other polyglutamine diseases is to target proximal steps in the pathogenic cascade. Aim 3 will test the efficacy of broad CNS delivery of antisense oligonucleotides targeting human ATXN3 in SCA3 transgenic mice expressing the full human ATXN3 disease gene. The complementary nature of the aims, coupled with the combined mechanistic and translational emphasis, enhances the potential impact of the proposed studies."
"9271055","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a family of devastating neurodegenerative diseases resulting from mutations in as many as 14 different genes. Researchers have long sought a molecular link between various NCLs. Recent studies suggest a common NCL pathway associated specifically with membrane associated protein forms of the disease (CLN3, CLN6, CLN5, CLN8) may be intracellular transport via disrupted interaction with the cytoskeletal network. In support of this concept, we have identified a novel complex containing the ER-associated CLN6, whose mutation results in a variant late infantile NCL (vLINCL), the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), and the kinesin motor protein, KLC4. Acting through a network of protein interactions, CRMP2 regulates axonal/dendritic specification and extension during neurodevelopment and contributes to maintenance/regeneration in the mature brain. We hypothesize that the CRMP2/CLN6/KLC4 (CCK) complex utilizes CLN6 as a molecular tag on ER-vesicles for segregation of cargo to distal sites in dendrites and axons. Disruption of this signaling complex could contribute to the pathogenesis of vLINCL through altered neuronal process outgrowth and maintenance. To test this hypothesis, we propose aims that will 1) determine how the CCK complex regulates ER-vesicle transport development and maintenance of neurons; 2) define how CCK complex transport is linked to early events in neuronal differentiation and identify what cargo is transported by CLN6-tagged vesicles; and 3) determine if stabilization of CRMP2-associated complexes, independent of CLN6 rescue, could ameliorate neurological deficits in a pre- clinical NCL mouse model. These studies will expands our understanding of CLN6's contribution to crucial cellular processes and start to unravel the biological significance of the CCK complex in developing and mature neurons, as well as its role and the role of intracellular trafficking in neurological disorders such as the NCLs."
"9466320","It is very important to uncover therapeutic strategies to combat the chronic effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) because currently, there are no effective treatments to prevent these cognitive deficits. Unfortunately, TBI is a very common affliction of military forces that have served in recent combat operations. At least 15% of deployed personnel receive a TBI and the total number of such injuries has been estimated as high as 320,000. In the US alone it is estimated that at least 1.7 million people suffer a TBI each year and the worldwide incidence is approximately 0.5% per year. The vast majority of TBIs experienced by military personnel are classified as mild injuries, but these do result in significant, chronic effects. We seek to demonstrate an effective treatment that could reduce or reverse the long-term cognitive dysfunction that is produced by mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Because these injuries involve multiple effects, it is necessary to further characterize the treatment effects on the lasting dendritic and spine changes induced by TBI and add to our knowledge of therapeutic changes that are possible so that TBI patients will benefit. Over the past several years, our lab has discovered that an activator of an antioxidant transcription factor, Nrf2, can be neuroprotective by regulating molecular mechanisms that are important to the health of neurons. This has led us to formulate a hypothesis that treatment of mild traumatic brain injury with the Nrf2 activator will result in significant improvement on the connections between neurons, promote neuroprotective intracellular pathways, and result in greatly enhanced long-term outcomes following TBI. We will test our hypothesis with three specific aims: 1. Prevention of the chronic behavioral effects of mild closed head injury by tBHQ treatment, 2. Improvement of persistent connectivity changes produced by tBHQ treatment after mild TBIs, and 3. Identify molecular changes induced by the post TBI treatment that could influence long-term function. We will examine changes to molecular and long-term cognitive function after mild TBI accomplished by the closed head impact injury model in mice. We will use a well-established TBI model involving a closed head injury model that does include rotation. We will treat injured and sham injured groups with either vehicle or tBHQ. Behavioral tests will be conducted at 1, 6, and 12 months after injury. Brain samples will also be collected and examined for dendritic complexity, spine density, and neuron numbers. Finally, levels of neuropathological pathway markers will be examined at early and late (12 month) time points, all to study the effects of the post-injury treatment. In this way we will answer several key questions about the treatment of the long-term effects of mild traumatic brain injury, how the treatment will affect molecular events that have lasting consequences after injury, what happens to dendritic complexity after treatment at lengthy times after mild injury, and the extent to which the treatment induced changes in specific regulatory factors can have an effect on downstream neuronal function. Elucidating the effects of the treatment after mild traumatic brain injuries over a year following the injury will help us determine an effective therapeutic solution to the problem of chronic TBI effects."
"9295324","Project Summary Bipolar (BP) disorder is a chronic illness of profound shifts in mood ranging from mania to depression. BP is successfully treated by combining medication with psychosocial therapy, but care can prove inadequate in practice. With gaps in coverage and medication, along with imprecise guidelines on when, where, and how to intervene, promising psychosocial therapies require adaptive strategies to better address the specific needs of individuals in a timely manner (NIMH Strategy 2). To accomplish this, however, requires evidence-based practices for adapting a psychosocial therapy. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award aims to address this knowledge gap, by (1) establishing a mobile health platform for translating a psychosocial therapy in BP into an effective adaptive intervention and (2) facilitating the transition of a junior researcher, at the interface of mathematics and psychiatry, into an independent researcher of effective adaptive interventions. The research effort is founded on a mobile health platform that combines evidence-based markers of mood for long-term monitoring with a micro-randomized trial, designed for optimizing mobile health adaptive interventions. In Aim 1, we use modeling to characterize and test new markers of mood course that account for volatility, a feature that masks effects of a therapy on mood. In Aim 2, we explore the potential for long-term monitoring of BP with interpretable markers from actigraphy. In Aim 3, best practices from Aim 1 and 2 are integrated with a micro-randomized trial into a mobile health platform. We then test the feasibility of using the platform to translate a psychosocial therapy, clinical phone call, into an adaptive intervention. If successful, this work will advance the Candidate's independent goal of adaptive scheduling of phone-calls with BP individuals. To complement the research agenda, the award will expand the Candidate's background in Computational Psychiatry into the area of Translational Psychiatry by providing training in five strategic areas: (1) clinical assessments, (2) psychosocial therapy, (3) mobile health interventions, (4) adaptive clinical trials, and (5) open-access scheduling. Dr. Melvin McInnis, Thomas B and Nancy Upjohn Woodworth Professor of Bipolar Disorder and Depression and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan, will be the primary mentor and will guide clinical aspects of the training (Training Objectives 1?3); Dr. Amy Kilbourne, Professor of Psychiatry and Acting Director of VA/HSR&D's Quality Enhancement Research Initiative, will guide training in the application of adaptive trial designs that involve psychosocial therapy (Training Objectives 2,4?5); and Dr. Susan Murphy, Herbert E. Robbins Distinguished Professor of Statistics, will guide training into methodology for adaptive trial design and mobile health interventions (Training Objectives 3?4). The proposed K01 award promises to train a junior scholar to address technically-challenging problems in mental health. This work is aligned with the NIH and NIMH missions of providing precise clinical care."
"9253025","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Male reproduction is regulated by a number of essential and specific processes. The highly evolutionarily conserved piRNA pathway is essential for male fertility in mice. MOV10L1, a putative RNA helicase, is required for biogenesis of all piRNAs and thus is a master regulator of this pathway. MOV10L1 interacts with piRNA- binding proteins, including PIWIL1 and PIWIL2, and these interactions are critical for piRNA biogenesis, and thus male fertility. Meiotic recombination is responsible for exchange of genetic materials between homologous chromosomes and faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis. MEIOB, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, is a novel meiosis-specific factor essential for meiotic recombination. MEIOB interacts with SPATA22, another meiosis-specific factor, and we find that this interaction is critical for their mutual stability. Notably, all thes proteins (MOV10L1, PIWIL1, PIWIL2, MEIOB, and SPATA22) are germ cell-specific and knockout mutant mice for any of these genes are viable but sterile due to arrest in meiosis or spermiogenesis. As these mutant mice are otherwise healthy, their infertility demonstrates a pure sterile phenotype. Based on our genetic and biochemical studies, we hypothesize that the protein components in the piRNA pathway and meiotic recombination are excellent targets for male contraception with minimal side effects. Here, we specifically propose to validate MOV10L1/Piwi and MEIOB/SPATA22 protein-protein interactions as novel male contraceptive targets and to screen for small molecule inhibitors of these interactions. We will systematically map the binding domains in MOV10L1/PIWIL1/2 (Aim 1) and in MEIOB/SPATA22 (Aim 2), and develop powerful bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays to monitor MOV10L1-Piwi and MEIOB-SPATA22 interactions. In Aim 3, we will perform high throughput cell-based BiFC screens of libraries of small molecule compounds for inhibitors of MOV10L1-Piwi and MEIOB-SPATA22 interactions. With genetics as the foundation, our innovative cell-based screens will identify lead compounds that inhibit these novel male contraceptive targets for future development of an orally active non-hormonal contraceptive."

(PSI) and University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) propose to develop and commercialize an affordable optogenetics/two-photon (2P) imaging instrument that will enable simultaneous manipulation and recording of neuronal activity in genetically modified animals. The goal of this project is to bring this highly desirable tool into the hands of neuroscientists and expand their capability for investigating and deciphering neural circuits underpinning complex brain function and behavior. Currently, the access of neuroscientists to this technology is profoundly limited, because of both high cost, which is often beyond the affordability of neuroscience researchers, and difficulty of use on live animals (bench-top mounted microscope platforms are cumbersome for in vivo brain studies involving living animals). To reach this goal, PSI will use innovative technologies, including dispersion-compensated laser delivery through a fiber cord, coherent supercontinuum (SC) generation in a photonic crystal fiber that enables the use of multiple excitation wavelengths selected for optimal excitation of calcium-sensitive fluorescent proteins, and beam control with spatial light modulators, etc. The achievement of this goal will be supported by the expertise and a proven track record of developing the next generation biomedical devices of the investigators from PSI, as well as the engineering and neuroscience expertise of the leading research groups at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
"9281061","The neural circuits governing behaviors vital to mammals, such as locomotion and respiration, rely on the ability of motor neurons (MNs) to establish selective connections with target cells both centrally and peripherally. Motor neurons innervating specific muscle targets are specified by the large family of chromosomally arrayed Hox transcription factors. A key aspect of Hox gene function is to segregate motor neurons into topographically organized columnar and pool subtypes. While it has been suggested the somatotopic organization of MNs evolved to facilitate the activation of an increasingly more complex limb musculature, it is largely unknown how MNs cluster into columns, and what role MN position plays in shaping the specificity of connections within motor networks. In this proposal we will investigate the function of Pbx genes, essential co-factors of Hox proteins, in the formation of MN topographic maps and in the development of motor circuits. The major goals of this proposal are to: 1) to assess the role of Pbx genes in the organization and connectivity of spinal motor neurons, 2) to determine the mechanisms through which motor neurons are topographically organized, and 3) to define the role of MN position and identity in spinal circuit assembly. In Aim1 we will define the function of Pbx genes in MN differentiation using genetic manipulations and histological assays. In Aim2 we will identity the targets of Pbx proteins in MNs, and assess their function and mechanisms of regulation. In Aim3 we will assess how motor neuron position and identity influences the specificity of connections with presynaptic interneuron populations. By building off our in depth knowledge of motor neuron specification programs in mammals, these studies should provide basic insights into the mechanisms through which motor circuits are assembled."
"9256524","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a fivefold increase in the odds of developing a feeding problem compared with peers. Food selectivity (i.e., only eating a narrow variety of foods) is the most widely documented feeding issue associated with ASD, often involving strong preferences for starches and snack foods coinciding with a bias against fruits and vegetables. Estimates of food selectivity in children wit ASD reach as high as 95%, suggesting feeding problems may occur at near epidemic levels in this population. With autism affecting 6 to14 children per 1000, high prevalence of feeding concerns in ASD poses a significant public health concern. Food refusal can be treated with behavioral therapy, but at a significant cost to affected individuals and their families. Further, available interventions are also intended for children with severe feeding concerns. We will identify the utility of patient-training group intervention to address moderate food selectivity in children with ASD. A successful line of research in the treatment of feeding problems would expand the availability of empirically- supported, time-limited, and cost-effective interventions fr young children with ASD. This project, which combines behavioral parent training with specific techniques focused on feeding problems, is necessary step in the development of this treatment. We will examine the social validity, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a revised manual- based parent-training intervention for feeding problem behaviors in children with ASD. Our previous work focusing on the development of a behaviorally-based parent training program, the Autism MEAL Plan, is the only group treatment approach to address feeding problems in ASD. We propose to complete development of the Autism MEAL plan guided by this foundational pilot work by promoting generalization of skills in the home setting, replicating our preliminary findings (e.g., high social validity, reduced parenting stress), and evaluating additional outcomes (e.g. child and parent behaviors). This proposal holds the possibility to transform treatment of feeding problems in ASD by providing an innovative, cost-efficient treatment manual with the potential for broad application and rapid distribution in the ASD community. Emory is uniquely positioned to support this endeavor. Dr. Sharp is a pediatric psychologist and Director of the Pediatric Feeding Disorders Program at the Emory Marcus Center. The Program is one of the few treatment centers in the U.S. specializing in the treatment of pediatric feeding disorders and it treats over 400 children per year, thus it is well equipped to recruit and support feeding intervention trials."
"9253098","Project Summary/Abstract Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT, the fat immediately adjacent to blood vessels) is a fat depot just beginning to be appreciated for the contributions it makes to vascular function and human health, normally viewed as being anticontractile and vasculoprotective. PVAT in the splanchnic vessels is the visceral fat that is particularly important; visceral fat is associated with the greatest risk of cardiovascular disease. We have made the novel discovery that PVAT possesses an adrenergic system, defined here as the ability to synthesize, release, take up and metabolize catecholamines. This PVAT may be directly innervated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), adding an unappreciated level of vascular control exerted by the SNS. The novel observation that the sympathomimetic tyramine causes PVAT-dependent contraction supports that this adrenergic system is functional. These experiments add a new dimension to the physiological importance of PVAT, which naturally lends itself to the study of obesity in which PVAT burdens are increased and the SNS is activated. We connect with every project of this PPG to investigate the overall hypothesis that mesenteric PVAT/visceral fat contains a functional, active adrenergic system. We will use two important models. First, the rodent model of high fat (HF) fed obesity is an ideal choice of obesity models because of the way that it reflects human obesity and the role of the SNS as a driver of the elevated blood pressure observed in most forms of obesity. From the HF model, we will use the superior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein and small mesenteric arteries and veins (+/- PVAT) given that both circulations contribute to blood pressure determination and splanchnic function. Second, we use of PVAT of the human mesenteric vasculature (lean and obese). We use a suite of integrated techniques ? live cell imaging of NE transporter function, PVAT biochemistry, real time PCR, whole animal physiology, isometric contraction and pharmacology ? to examine three aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that PVAT possesses the ability to synthesize, store, take up, functionally release and metabolize NE, and is innervated by the SNS (adrenergic systems); identifying mechanistic process is the goal. Aim 2 is devised to identify whether NE turnover is elevated in the PVAT of HF vs control such that PVAT NE content is reduced while circulating NE levels are elevated. Aim 3 tests the physiological contributions of splanchnic PVAT adrenergic systems. Collectively, this work provides powerful support for a novel mechanism by which PVAT modifies vascular tone and ultimately blood pressure: through a local and neuronal adrenergic system."

In addition to the already detailed phenotyping efforts that occur at the time of study enrollment, in this coming cycle, this Core will re-examine IGD patients that are known to harbor mutations in newly validated IGD genes from P1 and 2 and perform re-phenotyping of these individuals based on the newly-uncovered biology. Because these phenotyping efforts will be juxtaposed against phenotypes uncovered in normative populations (P2), the Core provides important linkages between all three of the scientific projects."

In our modules, we use young learners' facility with language acquisition to our advantage by representing DNA as an instructional manual with specific directions for making each unique organism. We now propose to build on our success with students in the K-5 arena by offering these learning modules to families in an informal science setting. Under the auspices of the Bio-Bus, GSU's mobile laboratory program, we shall partner with public libraries to bring activities to children and their families that both educate and entertain. During the summer and on selected weekends and academic holidays, we will present the current series of eight 60-minute modules at our partner institutions. Families who complete the first four modules will qualify to continue with any of the remaining four modules as well as with new problem-based modules currently under development. Finally, families who wish to become deeply immersed in scientific experimentation can take part in a metagenomics project involving the identification of novel bacterial sequences from a soil-derived gene library containing over 80,000 clones. The likelihood is high that some of these clones will contain sequences representing species that have never before been reported, thus bringing the excitement of authentic scientific discovery within reach of the families we serve."

"9236186","Project Summary  Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with a high mortality in native kidneys, decreased allograft survival in transplants, and very high health care costs. Among the most common etiologies of AKI in both native and transplanted kidneys is ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Despite advances in medical care, the mortality and morbidity associated with AKI after IRI remain high, with no specific therapy. A major unknown is the role of different T cell types in either causing/preventing tissue damage or improving/worsening repair. Detailed understanding of the roles of different T cell types holds great promise in both elucidating mechanisms underlying IRI and also in devising new strategies to ameliorate AKI. One such strategy is to shift the T cell balance in favor of protective T cell types and away from pathogenic ones. Therefore, it is important to study different T cell types residing and trafficking to the kidney and investigate their roles in the steady state and IR conditions. Our team has had a long-standing interest in studying immune cells in AKI using experimental animal models with translational potential. We recently discovered a unique population of CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) CD3+TCRab+ T cells that occupies a large niche of the ab T cell compartment in the normal mouse kidney and undergoes marked changes during AKI. However, their functions in the normal kidney and AKI pathogenesis remain relatively unknown. Based on strong preliminary data on DN cells, our overarching hypothesis is that kidney DN T cells play a major and unique role in regulating renal immune cell homeostasis in the steady state and after AKI. Our specific Aims are: 1) Investigate mechanisms and significance of steady state proliferation of kidney DN T cells. 2) Investigate immunoreactivity of DN T cells to IRI induced AKI. 3) Test the ability of DN T cells to prevent AKI and/or accelerate repair using gain and loss-of-function strategies. Establishing a functional role for this previously unappreciated cell type in the kidney will substantially advance our understanding of the kidney immunology and could lead to paradigm shifting scientific concepts."
"9328466","Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders that affect 1 in 68 children in the United States. The severity and symptoms of ASD cases vary greatly, but the disorder is characterized by social impairment and repetitive behaviors. ASD represents a major health burden as there is currently no cure and treatments rely on intensive behavioral interventions which have varying efficacy. There is no known single cause for ASD, but it is clear that there are strong genetic and environmental components to the development of the disorder. Recent studies implicated the regulation of gene transcription as a crucial process in the etiology of ASD. Our previous findings identify the bromodomain and extraterminal domain containing (BET) proteins, as epigenetic regulators of neuronal and synaptic genes involved in ASD-like behaviors in mice. We found that the pharmacological suppression of BET proteins in the brain of young mice, leads to selective suppression of neuronal gene expression followed by the development of an autism-like syndrome. Many of the BET-dependent genes have been identified as risk factors for ASD in humans, suggesting a key role of the BET-controlled gene network in the disorder. In this proposal, I will address the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which BETs, and specifically Brd4, regulate the transcription of neuronal genes implicated in ASD and the development of abnormal social behaviors. These studies will elucidate how impaired gene transcription can lead to abnormal brain development and thus inform our understanding of ASD etiology."
"9272000","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career Development Goal/Plan: The long-term goal of the applicant is to contribute to scientific knowledge and improve quality of life for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The overall objective of the applicant is to become an independent physician scientist specializing in pulmonary vascular immunobiology. To achieve this objective, the applicant has designed a career development plan that incorporates the following: a curriculum involving formal classes and other didactic teachings that enhance basic science background, writing skills, and critical analysis; at least 75% protected research time with hands-on laboratory experiences to develop new technical skills; and close mentoring by accomplished physician-scientists to ensure a successful transition into independence. The proposed research project combines the applicant's background in immunology and interest in pulmonary vascular biology and will serve as a platform to develop an independent line of research. Research: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a group of diseases caused by abnormal remodeling and narrowing of small pulmonary arterioles, leading to elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure, right heart failure, severe hypoxia, and eventual death. Even with known treatments, mortality remains high. Better understanding of PAH pathogenesis is needed to identify potential therapeutic targets. Substantial evidence suggests that the infiltration of pulmonary vessels by myeloid cells, such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, have a critical role in the development of PAH. However, neither the specific myeloid cell population that infiltrates pulmonary arteries, nor the activity of these cells has been deter- mined. Using chronic hypoxia models of PAH, my preliminary data demonstrates that resident monocytes accumulate around the pulmonary arterioles and promote PAH. My hypothesis is that resident monocytes infiltrate pulmonary vessels and, in response to hypoxic stimuli, initiate inflammatory responses and differentiate into cells with vascular remodeling activity, thereby promoting PAH development. To test this hypothesis, we will take advantage of a novel line of transgenic mice that expresses Cre recombinase specifically in resident monocytes. Using these mice, we have developed models of 1) resident monocyte- specific fluorescent reporters, 2) inducible resident monocyte ablation, and 3) resident monocyte-specific gene knockouts. In Aim 1, we will specifically delete hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the central hypoxia- sensory molecules, in resident monocytes to determine the role of resident monocytes in sensing hypoxia and PAH pathogenesis. In Aim 2, utilizing our capacity to deplete resident monocytes in vivo, we will determine the contribution of resident monocytes to both the development and progression of this disease. We expect findings from the proposed experiments will improve our insight into monocyte biology, HIF regulation, and role of resident monocytes in PAH pathogenesis."
"9108881","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Despite standard care, 25%-50% of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) progress to chronic post- thrombotic syndrome (PTS) resulting in significant disability, loss of productivity, and healthcare costs. This is a problem encountered frequently among our numerous Veterans undergoing surgery, anesthesia, traumatic and acute injury, and surgical critical care. Venous valvular reflux from an organized thrombus is the primary cause of PTS. Veins with rapid and complete thrombus resolution have a lower incidence of reflux. We have observed that thrombus resolution is enhanced by increased blood flow and that moderate upper or lower extremity exercise result in increased venous blood flow. Hence, we postulate that a progressive exercise training program in patients with DVT will increase lower extremity venous flow, accelerate thrombus resolution, and decrease the risk of PTS. The primary hypothesis is that increased blood flow across the thrombus (induced by supervised exercise) will accelerate thrombus resolution and decrease PTS. The overall goal is to determine whether exercise can lower the risk of PTS in patients with acute DVT, and to investigate possible mechanisms by which this occurs. We propose a 2-year randomized clinical trial of standard therapy compared to standard therapy plus exercise in patients with acute lower extremity DVT. Aim 1 will test whether a 3-month exercise training program prevents PTS and improves quality of life over 2 years of follow-up. Patients with acute lower extremity DVT (iliac-femoral-popliteal) will be randomized to standard therapy (control group receiving: anticoagulation, compression, ambulation ad-lib) alone, or to exercise plus standard therapy. The study will recruit 164 patients to achieve 80% power to detect a 50% decrease in prevalence of PTS at 2 years, and a decrease in severity of PTS through 2 years of follow-up in the exercise group vs. standard care. Aim 2 will investigate mechanisms by which the exercise program may act to prevent PTS, namely systemic markers of fibrinolysis and thrombus resolution. Aim 3 will investigate alternate mechanisms of decreased PTS that are more direct results of the exercise therapy, namely: improving venous hemodynamics and functional capacity. Collectively, these results will allow us to understand the basis of a novel conceptual model that progressive aerobic and resistive exercise aids in the treatment of DVT and prevention of PTS through mechanisms of enhanced thrombus resolution, fibrinolytic and vascular repair, calf muscle pump action, and functional ability. This will be a novel therapeutic intervention for maintenance and restoration of tissue function after DVT."
"9294150","PROJECT SUMMARY Acute inflammatory signals associated with infection lead to HSC proliferation thus generating large numbers of immune effector cells. However, more severe and prolonged inflammation has been linked to bone marrow failure states, e.g. complications following bone marrow transplantation. Infectious as well as non-infectious inflammatory signals affect HSC homeostasis. Such effects can be mediated directly on HSC or indirectly via niche cells. CXCL12-expressing niche cells represent an important niche cell population forming distinct niches that support hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells. Utilizing complementary novel imaging approaches for 2D and 3D analysis of the bone marrow cavity, we show that inflammatory stress following administration of TNF-? and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) rapidly reduces the number of CXCL12 expressing niche cells and causes defects in niche cell cytoplasmic structure within 1-4 hours. We propose that understanding how inflammatory signals modulate HSCP niche cells may implicate a pathogenic role of niche cells in disorders of dysfunctional hematopoiesis associated with inflammation in the peri-transplant setting. In Aim 1 we will delineate the consequences of inflammation on CXCL12-niche cell number and/or growth factor expression in specific CXCL12 expressing niche cell populations. The analyses will be done at various time intervals following administration of TNF-?, LPS. In aim 2, the dynamic alterations in CXCL12 expressing niche cell cytoplasmic structure will be visualized and quantified at different time intervals by three complementary imaging techniques. The dynamic structural changes will be correlated with hematopoietic cellularity in BM and egress into the circulation. In aim 3, we will examine whether LPS and TNF-? mediate their effect on hematopoiesis directly or indirectly (e.g. by acting first on hematopoietic cells such as macrophages). To this end, 4 separate reconstituted chimeric mice in which the hematopoietic compartment/bone marrow microenvironment is either WT or deficient in TNFR/TLR4, will be generated. We propose that understanding the dynamic relationship between stromal cells and HSPC following inflammatory stress may lead to new therapeutic approaches for hematopoietic regeneration in bone marrow dysfunction states in the peri- transplant setting, which require significant blood product support."
"9250650","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): In the past fifteen years, since the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi), it has become clear that small RNA pathways play essential roles in the regulation of gene expression across the animal and plant kingdoms. Nowhere is this more true than in the germline, where specific small RNAs, the PlWl-interacting RNAs (piRNA), reside alongside small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNAs (miRNA). The field has evolved at an alarmingly fast pace, and it is now apparent that small RNAs are likely to be key to many human diseases, the etiology of which have hitherto been unclear. The field of reproductive medicine is likely to lead the way in such studies, both because ofthe huge interest in piRNAs, and also because ofthe availability of human gametes for study. In this regard, researchers and physician-scientists within Cornell Center for Reproductive Genomics (CRG) represent an outstanding resource to the clinical community at large for providing tools, techniques, and knowledge to their colleagues interested in small RNA biology in different physiological systems. At the same time, given that RNAi mechanisms are at the cutting edge of medical research, CRG researchers can provide an essential conduit for the flow of information from the research lab to the patient. Thus, the goals of this outreach core are two-fold: (1) to provide a scientific and technical resource for clinicians interested in embarking on research involving small RNA biology in their physiological system of interest, and (2) to provide outreach to the community by means of a state-of-the-art lecture series. The Innovation Seminars in Reproductive Technologies Series (InSeRT), in order to educate patients about the latest advances in our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis for human disease. In both aims, investigators from Weill Cornell Medical College and from the Colleges of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, will join forces to provide comprehensive education to scientists, physicians, and the public alike."
"9247919","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with autologous human saphenous vein (HSV) is the best available treatment for severe coronary heart disease, but long-term graft patency is problematic. The per patient vein graft failure 12-18 months after CABG was 45% in the recent PREVENT IV trial (N=1,920). Vein graft failure predisposes patients to additional operations, myocardial infarction, recurrent angina, limb loss, and death. Graft failure is primarily attributable to intimal hyperplasia (IH), the process by whic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) migrate, proliferate, and deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) into a neointima that causes stenosis. We have identified MAPKAP kinase II (MK2) as a potential target for pharmacological intervention for preventing vascular graft IH. MK2 is activated directly by p38 mitogen activated kinase (MAPK), which is triggered by the mechanical and environmental stresses on the graft during transplant. Because p38 MAPK functions are diverse, p38 inhibitors cause undesirable side effects. Thus, MK2 is a logical target for inhibitin a proximal trigger of IH, and the central hypothesis of this proposal is that sustained intracellulr pharmacological inhibition of MK2 will prevent IH and improve long-term graft patency. A cell- penetrating peptidic MK2 inhibitor (MK2i) developed by project collaborators has high specificity and low toxicity, but barriers against intracellular delivery hinder its efficacy. Mechanistic studies support the notion that MK2i has promising anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity, but its potency and longevity of action are limited by internalization into and sequestration within intracellular late endosomal vesicles. To overcome the endosomal barrier, a novel polymer-based MK2i nanoplex (MK2i-NP) design has been developed in the PI's lab that improves cell internalization and endosomal escape of the MK2i peptide. Our published data verify that formulation of MK2i into endosomolytic MK2i-NPs increases peptide intracellular delivery and produces more potent and longer-lasting bioactivity relative to treatment with the free peptide. Rapid uptake and durable intracellular retention of MK2i-NPs are key criteria for this application because a brief (30 minute) treatment of the HSV tissue at the time of explant, during the period when the surgeon is preparing the site where the anastomosis will be placed, must protect the graft throughout the post-surgery healing phase. This project seeks to optimize and better elucidate the mechanism of MK2i-NPs and then to test this therapy for efficacy in inhibiting IH pathogenesis in advanced preclinical models."
"9328581","Parathyroid hormone (PTH 1-34) is the only approved anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. Its mechanism of action is complex and not fully understood. PTH signals through the PTH1 receptor (PTH1R), as does PTHrp, another natural ligand for PTH1R. We have preliminary data that one downstream effect of PTH1R activation is a reduction in bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT), due either to a shift in lineage allocation of stem cells and/or lipolysis of existing adipocytes. We are now proposing a mechanistic ancillary study to an ongoing phase III clinical trial of a PTHrp analog, abaloparatide (BA058) to test our hypothesis that changes in marrow adipocytes are tied to the anabolic actions of PTH1R activation. The current randomized placebo controlled trial includes a PTH 1-34 comparator arm, and a sequential alendronate treatment arm followed by a two-year observation phase ( In our proposed ancillary study we will determine if BMAT is altered by activation of the NCT:01657162) for fracture efficacy. PTH1R, measureable on bone biopsies at 18 months by semi-quantitative indices, and test whether the earliest marker of marrow adipocytes , Pref-1, is altered in serum by treatment with PTH-1-34, abaloparatide, or alendronate. We will also examine for the first time if there is a spatial redistribution of adipocytes within the bone marrow that is associated with bone formation and aBMD. To test those hypotheses we propose two aims: Specific aim 1: To determine the impact of PTH 1-34 and abaloparatide on the volume of BMAT (AV/MV) and the number of adipocytes (ANo/MV) per marrow volume. We will assess this by comparing BMAT in 98iliac crest biopsies at 18 months in the BA058 randomized trial between placebo vs combined PTH 1-34 and abaloparatide-treated participants. We will test if aBMD changes from baseline to 18 and 60 months will be inversely correlated with the 18 month AV/MV and ANo/MV on biopsy. We will also explore if there is an inverse relationship between bone formation and ANo/MV and whether the spatial location of marrow adipocytes changes with anabolic therapy as well as their proximity to local bone forming surfaces and how this may impact final aBMD at 60 months. Specific aim 2: To determine if changes in Pref-1 predict BMAT differences in subjects treated with placebo, PTH 1-34, abaloparatide or alendronate. We will measure change in serum Pref-1 between 0 and 18 months and correlate those values with ANo/MV and AV/MV as well as aBMD and P1NP. We also plan an exploratory aim to determine if changes in Pref-1 between baseline and 36 and 60 months predict final aBMD and P1NP, a marker of bone formation. These proposed ground-breaking studies will provide a mechanistic framework for future work to define the cellular basis of anabolic therapies for osteoporosis."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K24 is to provide salary support for Dr. Singh to allow him to spend 40% of his time mentoring pulmonary and critical care fellows, junior faculty and other trainees in patient-oriented research on chronic airway infections. This proposal will enable Dr. Singh to expand his translational research program, integrate fellows and junior faculty in to the program, and provide protected time so that the can mentor additional MD fellows. The proposal also provides time and infrastructure to help Dr. Singh enhance his own mentoring skills. The two research projects described involve face-to-face interactions with patients Project 1 exploits preliminary findings which show that infecting P. aeruginosa strains evolve to produce genetically diverse but clonally-related populations within CF lungs, and that the relative abundance of subpopulations change as patients are treated with antibiotics. This is important because subpopulations that increase during treatment have phenotypes that enable them to resist treatment in vivo, while those that decrease lack resistance functions. Studying these subpopulations enable us to test novel hypotheses about the mechanisms enabling bacteria to withstand antibiotics in chronic infections. Project 2 exploits preliminary findings that show that upper airway contamination may confound DNA-based measurements of lung microbiota. Accurately identifying the bacteria causing CF infections is among the most important tasks in CF infection research. We propose using the novel 2-scope method, along with advanced analytic methods, to test the hypotheses that some of the taxa identified in upper airway samples from CF children using DNA-based methods are oropharyngeal contaminants, or are derived from non viable cells."
"9349229","The pathogenesis of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) remains unclear, though there is growing support for a synergistic relationship between vascular dysfunction and accumulation of amyloid-? and neurofibrillary tangles. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are prevalent in the VA population, have been linked to cognitive decline and higher risk for dementia, and may represent potential targets for remediating age-related cognitive decline. [CVD risk factors are associated with peripheral vascular (e.g., increased pulse wave velocity [PWV] indicating arterial stiffness) and cerebrovascular changes (e.g., reduced cerebral blood flow [CBF]; decreased cerebrovascular reactivity [CVR] indicating reduced ability of the cerebral vasculature to adjust CBF).] Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is tightly coupled with metabolism underlying cognition by increasing local delivery of oxygen and glucose to support neural function, and as such is an indirect measure of neural activity and vascular function. [Animal models suggest reduced CBF (aka, hypoperfusion) contributes to AD-like neurodegeneration by increasing amyloid-? accumulation and tau phosphorylation--the hallmark neuropathology of AD. Translating these findings to humans is critical to identify and refine biomarkers of AD and ultimately improve early detection and treatment.] We have shown altered CBF in prefrontal and medial temporal lobe regions in older adults at genetic (APOE ?4 carriers) or cognitive (mild cognitive impairment; MCI) risk for AD that is associated with memory and executive function, implicating CBF as a potential biomarker of AD. This application aims to elucidate the link between the vascular and neurodegenerative pathophysiological process of AD and the emergence of clinical symptoms to lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of cognitive decline. Thus, the current application: [1) examines the association between neurovascular (CBF) and cerebrovascular (CVR) function and cognition in at-risk older Veterans and tests potential AD-related mechanisms (e.g., cerebral spinal fluid [CSF] AD biomarkers) that mediate this relationship, 2) examines whether cerebrovascular function moderates the relationship between CBF and CSF biomarkers, and 3) examines moderating effects of individual risk factors (e.g., increased arterial stiffness, elevated sedentary time, APOE ?4).] This study will examine cognitive, vascular, and brain function in 120 English-speaking non-demented Veterans aged 65+ with at least 2 CVD risk factors, placing them at increased risk for cognitive decline. Assessments include well-validated and standardized cognitive testing (e.g., NIH Toolbox), state-of-the-art MR imaging (to measure CBF and CVR), comprehensive vascular function assessment (including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, carotid ultrasound), lumbar puncture to assay CSF AD biomarkers (including A?42, p-tau181, and total tau), accelerometry to assess physical activity/sedentary level, and APOE genotyping. [This novel proposal aims to test the central hypothesis that CBF and/or CVR support cognitive performance and this relationship is mediated by the presence of CSF biomarkers of AD neurodegeneration, suggesting a synergistic contribution of neurovascular and cerebrovascular dysfunction to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in older at-risk Veterans.] The completion of the proposed aims will achieve the following goals that could guide future research in early dementia detection and prevention: 1) refine the prevailing biomarker model of AD by more firmly establishing the independent or combined contribution of neuropathological and cerebrovascular AD risk factors in the cascade of events precipitating AD, 2) establish prognostic utility of imaging, neuropsychological, neuropathological, and vascular biomarkers to detect cognitive decline, and 3) improve mechanistic understanding of AD risk and identify potential therapeutic targets that will ultimately inform interventions to prevent or delay the onset of AD."
"9307328","Project Abstract Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a fatal disease characterized by increased pulmonary arterial pressure and abnormalities in blood vessel growth. While current therapies modestly improve functional capacity, they have marginal impact on long- term survival, perhaps because they neglect pathogenesis. Despite compelling evidence for thrombotic and inflammatory mechanisms in PH, no drugs have been developed to target these mechanisms. We recently reported that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is elevated in human and murine PH contributing to the pathogenesis via toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent mechanisms. We also reported on the role of the complement system in PH. Activation of the complement cascade or TLR4 induces a pro-inflammatory, pro-adhesive, pro-coagulant phenotype and studies point to a cross talk between TLRs and the complement system. Preliminary data suggest that (1) HMGB1 stimulates TLR4 on platelets thus contributing to PH, (2) there is cross talk between platelet TLR4 and the complement system and (3) that platelets are a source of HMGB1 in PH. These data form the basis of our overarching hypothesis that HMGB1-dependent activation of platelet TLR4 causes platelet activation, secretion, platelet-dependent complement activation, and HMGB1 release thus contributing to the pathogenesis of PH. In Aim 1we will characterize the effect of HMGB1 on human and mouse platelet activation, secretion and aggregation as well as the HMGB1 isoform responsible for this effect. The TLR4- dependence of HMGB1-stimulated platelet activation will be explored. A role for mitochondrial ROS as a downstream signaling mechanism in HMGB1/TLR4-dependent platelet activation will be investigated. Transfusion of WT platelets into TLR4-/- mice will confirm a role for platelet TLR4 in hypoxia-induced PH. A novel HMGB1 inhibitor that specifically blocks HMGB1/TLR4 interaction will further identify the role of HMGB1/TLR4 interactions in PH. In aim 2 we will examine if loss of platelet TLR4 attenuates complement activation in hypoxia-induced PH. We will test the ability of platelets activated by TLR4 agonists to activate complement and if these agonists can enhance platelet activation by complement components. Finally, we will explore the mechanism(s) by which TLR4 mediates C3a and C5a-dependent platelet activation. In Aim 3 we will explore whether HMGB1 released from platelets contributes to the pathogenesis of PH using platelet specific HMGB1 knockout mice. Transfusion of WT platelets back into platelet specific HMGB1-/- mice will confirm a role for platelet HMGB1 in hypoxia-induced PH. Intracellular and platelet surface HMGB1 levels will be measured in platelets from patients to determine if platelets release HMGB1 in human PAH. It is our goal to define the pathophysiology of the platelet and immune system abnormalities in PH, and in so doing, apply the knowledge to improve the care of PH patients."
"9244063","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impact and Cost-effectiveness of Safer Conception Strategies for HIV prevention This mentored research project will investigate an urgent public health problem that has been neglected in HIV prevention research: the reproductive needs of HIV-discordant couples who desire pregnancy. Across sub-Saharan Africa, the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals are adults of reproductive age. The HIV prevention literature has almost exclusively focused on strategies to prevent sexual HIV transmission in the context of promoting 100% condom use, which is not compatible with conception, and strategies to prevent HIV after conception has occurred, e.g., prevention of transmission from mother to child during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding. While several reviews on safer conception and HIV prevention have been published and clinical guidelines have recently been developed, there has been no systematic research to examine the costs, potential impact and cost-effectiveness, or actual preferences for different strategies of safer conception. My proposed mentored research plan will address this critical gap in HIV prevention research. It is comprised of two phases: the first phase a small mixed methods demonstration project to pilot test the safer conception guidelines in Kenya; and the second, a study to estimate costs and model the potential impact and cost- effectiveness of the guidelines.These phases will address the following aims: (1) Conduct a mixed-methods demonstration project to (i) characterize adherence to and preferences for different safer conception strategies, and (ii) estimate parameters necessary to model the impact of and design a large-scale evaluation of a combination safer conception program in this setting. I will, with a Kenyan research team, use quantitative and qualitative methodologies to characterize uptake, adherence to, and patient and provider preferences for different safer conception strategies, and generate critical preliminary estimates of process and impact outcomes, and inter-clinic variability in outcomes. The findings from this work will lay the groundwork for Aims 2 and 3; (2) Estimate the cost, and model the impact and cost-effectiveness of different strategies for safer conception for HIV-discordant couples in Nyanza Province, Kenya. I will carry out micro- costing and time and motion studies during the implementation of the demonstration project (above) to gather estimates on resources required for providing safer conception options. I will use data from the demonstration project and appropriate historical cohorts to model the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of different strategies of safer conception interventions for HIV prevention among discordant couples in this setting; (3) Develop a preliminary plan for a combination safer conception intervention to prevent HIV transmission among HIV discordant couples in Nyanza. In participatory workshops with local stakeholders, we will critically evaluate the research findings, identify potential challenges, define the safer conception intervention package, and develop an intervention plan.

"9331261","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Modeling Viral Infections and Immunity, organized by Drs. Alan S. Perelson, Rob J. De Boer and Phillip D. Hodgkin. The conference will be held in Estes Park, Colorado from May 1-4, 2017. Viral infection modeling has provided insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of HIV, HCV, HSV-2, CMV and other viruses. It has had impact in revealing the lifespan of infected cells, how rapidly virus is produced and cleared from the circulation, and the means for evaluating the effectiveness of antiviral treatments. For example, HIV remains a global health threat and there is great interest in revealing features of the main HIV reservoir, latently infected cells and mechanisms of reducing the size of this reservoir by pharmacological means. Similar questions revolve around many other viral pathogens. Thus, this conference will take advantage of the latest modeling approaches to address gaps in our knowledge of the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to viruses and the identifying the information needed to develop new vaccines and therapeutics. Since viral infections generally occur in tissues, the conference will discuss imaging techniques and methods of modeling and analyzing spatial infection data, the role of tissue- resident memory cells, and important features of immune regulation, such as immune exhaustion, cytokine signaling between cells, and viral subversion of innate responses and escape from adaptive responses. The conference will highlight what we believe are significant hurdles to curing viral infections and will bring together experimental virologists, physician scientists and modelers of various types and experience, groups that do not normally meet. We anticipate that this conference will foster new collaborations between experimentalists and theoreticians, and between theoreticians working on different viral infections or different aspects of viral infections, as well as help junior scientists formulate new research directions and make connections with established senior scientists. Relevance to NIAID: NIAID supports research on topics such as HIV, HCV and influenza infection and treatment. Modeling of these infections has provided and will continue to provide important information about pathogenesis, treatment strategies, drug resistance, viral evolution and vaccine strategies as well as epidemiological information about viral transmission and spread at the population level. Viral infection modeling is also being applied to emerging infections, such as Ebola and Zika virus infection and, by the time of the conference, will have provided fundamental and quantitative information about the interactions of this virus with its host, the effects of treatment and vaccine strategies. Supporting innovative modeling approaches and encouraging more quantitative modeling of biothreat agents is also under the purview of NIAID."

"9294145","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application of P01 HL095489, which provides support for a coordinated, multi- disciplinary program project entitled Molecular mechanisms of blood cell transfusion. The long-term thematic objective of this research program is to develop more efficient and effective Transfusion Medicine support for patients undergoing stem cell transplantation. Patients in the peri-transplant period require significant transfusion support (including red blood cells, platelets and granulocytes) because of the transplant-related bone marrow (BM) dysfunction state. In this application we hypothesize that bone marrow dysfunction is caused in part by a compromised hematopoietic stromal niche (project 1); that engraftment is limited by the quantity of transplantable hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) (project 2); and that the efficacy of granulocyte transfusions towards the treatment of peri-transplant (bacterial and yeast) infections can be optimized (project 3). The principal investigators, project leaders, and core leaders are all faculty of the Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine (JPTM) at Harvard Medical School. Project 1, Dr. Leslie Silberstein will elucidate the dynamic role of CXCL12 expressing stromal niche cells in hematopoiesis during inflammatory stress. This study will lead to new therapeutic approaches for hematopoietic regeneration in bone marrow dysfunction states, which require significant blood product support. Project 2, Dr. Li Chai will try to understand hematopoietic stem progenitor cell properties by investigating the interaction between transcription factors and epigenetic modulators (chromatin modifiers). This project will focus on SALL4, a zinc-finger transcription factor that interacts with both activation and repression epigenetic complexes. The hypothesis is that a newly identified SALL4 activation pathway is important for CD34+ HSPC expansion. Project 3, Dr. Hongbo Luo will study cell signaling in granulocyte transfusion. The ultimate goal is to identify cellular and molecular events that can improve granulocyte performance after transfusion. They try to achieve this by elevating intracellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling via targeting InsP6K1, an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of InsP7, a cytosolic molecule that negatively regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling. The three supporting cores are: Administrative Core, Animal Core, and a Cytometry Core. The Administrative Core will oversee and coordinate the day-to- day scientific and fiscal operation of the Program. The Cytometry Core will provide a cost-effective, centralized resource for the use of antibody based cellular pre-enrichment, flow cytometry based cell analysis and purification, as well as imaging and quantitative analysis of cellular and subcellular criteria within tissues using laser scanning cytometry (LaSC) technology. The Experimental Animal Core will assist with transgenic and knockout mouse production, multi-trait breeding, and animal husbandry. Collectively, this program will yield significant insight and information that will directly translate into optimizatin of Transfusion Medicine support of patients requiring transfusion in the peri-transplant setting.

"9242698","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hypertension involves elevated vascular resistance and only exists in a living animal, where the physiologic regulators of vascular tone (i.e. neuronal activity, blood flow, and endocrine factors) are intact. Therefore, hypertension research will greatly benefit from the in vivo exploration of the molecular regulators of arterial smooth muscle cell contraction. Our overall goal is to elucidate mechanisms of increased vascular resistance, for the first time, in conscious animals, during experimental salt-dependent hypertension. The use of conscious animals (as opposed to anesthetized) is key to understanding the putative role of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), increasingly recognized as a key mechanism of salt-dependent hypertension. This overall goal is to be achieved through the use of non-invasive, fluorescence imaging of molecular signaling in arterioles of conscious optical biosensor mice. Given that phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains is the critical determinant of smooth muscle contraction, Specific Aims 1 and 2 are to develop optical biosensor mice that express novel, genetically-encoded activity biosensors for the key molecular regulators of smooth muscle myosin phosphorylation; a) myosin light chain kinase, (MLCK), b) myosin light chain phosphatase, MLCP), and c) a key upstream regulator of MLCP, the small GTPase, RhoA. In Aim 3, we will use these optical biosensor mice to determine, in vivo, 1) the regulation of MLCK, MLCP and RhoA by certain vascular G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) putatively involved in hypertension, including adrenoceptors (?1-AR), Angiotensin II receptors (AT1-R), endothelin-1 receptors, (ETA), and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1P1). The regulation of MLCK, MLCP and RhoA by SNA will be determined through the use of complete autonomic ganglionic blockade (hexamethonium) in conscious mice. Mice will be implanted with telemetric arterial blood pressure transducers to allow continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure during imaging (and all other times). In Specific Aim 4, the time course of the activation levels of MLCK, MLCP and RhoA will be measured in ear arterioles of conscious individual mice (i.e. a `longitudinal' study) during 14 days of Angiotensin II/salt hypertension. Mice are infused chronically with Angiotensin II and fed a high-salt (NaCl) diet. Increased vascular resistance in this model of salt-dependent hypertension is believed to involve heightened SNA (`sympathoexcitation) emanating from salt-sensitive CNS cardiovascular control regions, mandating use of conscious mice. These Specific Aims will be performed in this multi-PI project under the direction of two Principal Investigators with the necessary expertise to generate the proposed sensors (Rizzo) and perform the physiologic experiments (Wier). In summary, we expect to achieve dynamic imaging of myosin phosphorylation regulatory processes during the development of salt-sensitive hypertension in a living animal for the first time. These studies will reveal new insights on the molecular basis of increased vascular resistance in hypertension, as it actually occurs in living animals."
"9252232","Project Summary The remarkable growth of vaccine biotechnology continues apace in basic science discovery, product development, market introduction, and adoption into immunization programs. New cytokines are identified, innate and induced immune regulatory pathways unraveled, novel adjuvants and antigen constructs prove effective, and recently-licensed products achieve high coverage, already yielding noticeable decreases in disease incidence. One can envision a growing number of challenging maladies- including chronic, non-infectious, and neoplastic - that may become vaccine-preventable or vaccine treatable in the years ahead. As part of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases' (NFID) mission to education healthcare professionals and support research and training in infectious diseases, the Annual Conference on Vaccine Research (ACVR) was first offered in 1998. The ACVR is a 3-day live educational activity that provides high-quality, up-to-date reports of scientific progress featured in both invited presentations and peer-reviewed submitted oral abstracts and posters. By drawing upon an international audience of scientists and researchers, healthcare professionals and trainees, veterinarians, vaccine manufacturers, and public health officials, the conference aims to encourage the exchange of ideas across a broad range of disciplines. International experts lead seminars and panel discussions on topical areas of basic immunology, product development, clinical testing, regulation, and other aspects of vaccine research. Opportunities for networking and scientific collaboration critical to advancing vaccine science and development will be available through audience discussions, poster presentations, meet the expert breakfast sessions, sponsored exhibits, and evening ceremonies and receptions. The ACVR aims to maintain its position as the largest scientific meeting devoted exclusively to research on vaccines and associated technologies for disease prevention and treatment through immunization. The conference is a premier venue for cutting-edge learning, effective data-sharing, and convenient networking for scientific collaboration. NFID is an accredited provider for continuing medical education (CME) by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME). !"
"9234419","ABSTRACT  22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) patients have feeding and swallowing difficulties that compromise their  nutritional status and increase nasal, ear, and respiratory infections due to aspiration and reflux. Unfortunately,  there are few, if any, therapies to alleviate these significant health problems, and there is no focused basic  research into defining the underlying pathology that will inform new therapeutic approaches. We will test the  hypothesis that disrupted brainstem motor circuits are a primary site for dysphagia pathology and a  primary target for therapeutic intervention. We will advance understanding of the pathology of feeding and  swallowing dysfunction in dysphagia using the LgDel animal model for 22q11DS. These studies will provide the  foundation for identifying feasible therapeutic approaches and novel drug targets that could improve feeding  and swallowing in 22q11DS patients and other children with dysphagia. In Specific Aim 1 we will use a  combination of quantitative 3D cellular imaging and cell-class specific analyses of transcriptional changes to  assess how diminished 22q11 gene dosage disrupts motor neuron differentiation and innervation in brainstem  cranial motor nuclei that regulate feeding and swallowing. In Specific Aim 2 we will use a combination of in  vivo behavioral and pathology assays for feeding and swallowing difficulties and quantitative 3D cellular  imaging of relevant brainstem CN motor neurons to test if a second mutation in Raldh2, a key synthetic  enzyme for production of the developmental signal retinoic acid (RA), corrects feeding, swallowing, and cranial  motor neuron differentiation anomalies and dysfunction in LgDel mice. In Specific Aim 3 we will test the  hypothesis that altered excitability due to disrupted balance of excitation and inhibition of cranial motor neurons  underlies dysphagia due to the 22q11 deletion. We will use a combination of patch-clamp and intracellular  recordings to identify changes in the synaptic neurotransmission elicited upon fictive swallowing to brainstem  cranial neurons essential for feeding and swallowing and, furthermore, test whether clinically useful drugs in  children, such as GABA(A) receptor agonists (benzodiazepines), and/or NMDA receptor antagonists  (ketamine) can be repurposed to restore normal activity of swallowing motor neurons. The results of PROJECT  1 will define pediatric dysphagia circuit pathology and provide new pharmacologic, genetic, and genomic  insights that will provide a foundation for identifying new targets for novel therapeutic interventions. These  results will define key outcomes whose developmental origins will be identified in PROJECT 2 and whose  prevention will be the focus of PROJECT 3."
"9250645","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Gene regulation, a fundamental process in biology, is typically investigated at the level of transcription, yet there is a growing recognition of consequential post-transcriptional control of gene expression. In animals, microRNAs (miRNAs) and other small RNAs direct much of post-transcriptional regulation. MicroRNAs are regulatory RNAs that repress gene expression by interacting with messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In humans, miRNAs contribute to most biological pathways, and mutations perturbing miRNAs are implicated in disease. The unifying theme of all small RNA pathways is the silencing complex, which contains a small RNA and an Argonaute protein, the core proteins ofthe silencing complex. We have recently discovered two novel roles for an individual Argonaute protein, AG04, in male gametogenesis in mice. Ago4 is required for both the correct timing of entry into meiosis, a specialized form of cell division in the germline, and, for silencing ofthe sex chromosomes in meiosis, which is essential to the male germline. These are the first specific biological functions attributed to Ago4. Moreover, our data suggests that Ago3 shares some of these Ago4 functions. Because AGO proteins always function with small RNAs, our data directly implicate small RNAs in the regulation of meiotic entry and meiotic silencing. Our major goals for this proposal are to identify the small RNAs that participate in meiotic entry and meiotic silencing, and, to define their regulatory targets. Our first aim is to use high-throughput sequencing to identify the small RNAs and mRNAs expressed at different times of germline development in mice. To gain insights into gene regulation in the germline, we will also perform sequencing of mouse strains deficient in Ago3, Ago4, or both. In our second aim, we will use the sequencing data from aim I, together with computational approaches, to determine the mRNA targets of germline small RNAs. In our final aim, we will explore the biological significance of specific regulatory events in germline function and development using transgenic mice. Because meiotic entry and meiotic silencing are fundamental processes in germline biology, our studies will contribute to a better understanding of human reproductive biology and health."
"9242662","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): We recently discovered that a mild elevation in testosterone (T) levels in prepubertal female monkeys led to a significant increase in the frequency of pulsatile LH secretion, as well as an increase in LH response to GnRH, and concluded that chronic exposure to mild hyperandrogenemia over the course of puberty triggers changes in the neural drive to the reproductive axis that resemble those of girls with PCOS in early adulthood. Subsequently, when monkeys were 5 years of age, we fed them a Western Style Diet (WSD) and after 14 months both T-treated and control animals had a faster than normal pulse frequency in the early follicular phase, as well as decreased LH pulse amplitude. T-treated animals also showed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity compared to control animals (2.6-fold lower), and changes in ovarian structure function, as detailed in Project II. These pilot studies demonstrate that a combination of T+WSD can lead to neuroendocrine, ovarian and metabolic abnormalities clinically associated with hyperandrogenemia and obesity. However, the specific roles that T and WSD played in the development of these abnormalities are unclear, as this pilot study did not include a T alone group, nor a normal monkey chow group. The overall goal of Project I is to use the pubertal female rhesus monkey model to further define the effects of adolescent and early adult (1) T, (2) WSD, and (3) T+ WSD treatment, compared to (4) control conditions, on function of the metabolic and reproductive neuroendocrine axes. Aim 1 will examine the effects of these four treatments on key metabolic systems and sleep patterns, measuring metabolic substrate and hormone levels, ivGTT, ITT, measurement of metabolic rate in a metabolic chamber, hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamps, dexascans, and activity. Sleep disorders are linked to both elevated T and obesity in a bi-directional fashion and could be partially responsible for the metabolic pathologies associated with PCOS. Aim 2 will examine the effects of treatments on reproductive neuroendocrine secretion (LH, FSH and responsiveness to GnRH), plus peptide levels and gene expression in KNDy (Kisspeptin, Neurokinin 8, Dynorphin) neurons in the basal hypothalamus. Aim 3 will test whether decreasing circulating T levels by removing T implants and/or reinstating a lower calorie, low fat diet will reverse neurendocrine and metabolic changes occurring with hyperandrogenemia and WSD."
"9312412","Project Summary  Infections of the human colon are difficult to study mechanistically because of the absence of in vitro model systems that mimic the limited oxygen environment of the colon. In this project, we propose to use a human intestinal model system based on cylindrical silk scaffolds that serve as the backbone for human epithelial and sub-epithelial tissues. This proposed bioengineered 3D model system will be used to address the details of infection by the major human diarrheal pathogen, Clostridium difficile. Steps in C. difficile pathogenesis, such as spore germination, vegetative cell outgrowth, adherence, toxin production and epithelial cell damage will be studied in the tissue model.  In Aim 1, further development of the tissue model will be pursued. The tissue models will be incorporated into perfusion bioreactors capable of passing media of variable chemical compositions and low oxygen tension through the lumens at regulatable rates. The central, hollow core of the tissue model will thus mimic an intestinal lumen in which bacteria and host tissue will interact.  In Aim 2, a combination of single cell analysis using fluorescent reporter proteins and genetic analysis of mutants using TnSeq will be pursued to analyze the importance of bacterial factors for infection in the tissue model. The experiments proposed are designed to validate the bioengineered 3D intestinal model system as well as generate new information about the pathogenesis of C. difficile.  Interaction between C. difficile and the human gut microbiota will be investigated in Aim 3. Microbiota will be established in the tissue model for these experiments.  Aim 4 will focus on testing the efficacy of several anti-infective strategies against C. difficile infection, using the scaffold tissue model.  This project will establish the bioengineered intestine tissue model as a novel system for detailed, mechanistic analysis of infection by virtually all colonic pathogens, thereby providing the potential for major breakthroughs in the understanding of multiple aspects of intestinal infection."
"9246508","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this grant is to generate data to understand and enable the development of a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is the third most lethal cancer in the US, with 220,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths projected to occur in 2015. While early detection, surgery and hormone deprivation therapies are effective, about 10-20% of localized prostate cancer eventually becomes metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The major driver of mCRPC is the androgen receptor (AR), as evidenced by the rise in the circulating levels of the AR target gene prostate specific antigen (PSA). Patients with these cancers treated with first-generation anti-androgens (flutamide and bicalutamide) as well as the second-generation anti-androgen agents (enzalutamide and abiraterone) have increased survival, but the majority of mCRPCs also develop resistance to these agents. Given the central role of AR in prostate cancer, agents that target AR with a unique mode of action are urgently needed. One approach is to use small molecules to degrade AR. We used a novel and innovative approach that employs bi-functional small molecules to bind and actively ubiquitinate and degrade AR proteins. In preliminary studies, these molecules, called AR PROTACs, have been shown to be potent, selective, and efficacious in both cell and animals studies. A clinical candidate molecule has been chosen to advance towards clinical trials. The goals of this grant support that process in several ways: they aim to establish the PK/PD/efficacy relationship for the clinical candidate, to demonstrate that this AR PROTAC inhibits the growth of mCRPC tumors that are resistant to current therapy, and to conduct Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies on the clinical candidate. Taken together, these studies will enable a novel agent to move into clinical trials for patients with mCRPC with a good awareness about its manufacture and safety, with a clear understanding of how to use this novel therapy, and, mostly importantly, with knowledge of which patients are likely to derive benefit from this new therapy."

The facility: 1) provides diverse recruitment services (developing recruitment strategies and materials; recruiting and scheduling subjects, etc.); 2) provides the necessary linkage between CCC researchers and surrounding communities; 3) maintains information systems with a Recruitment Data Base (RDB), a Recruitment Tracking System (RTS), a Health Profile System (HPS), to identify subjects of interest to investigators; and 4) tracks and promotes retention through the Patient Navigation System and the Recruitment Tracking system. Since 1997 the RRSF demonstrated success in recruiting participants primarily for large population-based clinical trials. More than 24,000 participants were recruited for more than 23 cancer studies; 32% of these participants were African American, and 78% were women. Census data show that Alabama residents are 26.6% African American and 4% Hispanic. Hispanics in Alabama are mainly young immigrants and have low incidence of cancer. Due to these factors, the RRSF decided to focus recruitment efforts on one of our minority populations. The RRSF continues to recruit for population-based studies, but has decided to address the needs of UAB-CCC investigators and focus on piloting new strategies to recruit participants for therapeutic clinical trials. A model program was implemented entitled, Increasing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials through Patient Navigation (IMPaCT-PN). IMPaCT- PN, which aims to provide equal access to clinical trials for low-resource and African American patients by helping them overcome barriers to participation and navigate the healthcare system. In 2009, the NIMHD awarded UAB a U24 grant to create a National Comprehensive Cancer Centers Consortium to implement and evaluate new strategies to enhance minority enrollment in clinical research with a main focus on patient navigation. UAB serves as the lead institution providing training to implement the IMPaCT Patient Navigation Program at the cancer centers of University of Minnesota, University of Texas-MD Anderson, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of California-Davis. RRSF is a unique shared facility that provides a centralized infrastructure, databases, and staff with recruitment expertise so investigators do not have to build recruitment teams for each new study."
"9250198","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) diseases, including heart attack (MI), stroke and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), are the leading cause of death in developed countries. Using transcriptional profiling of platelets, we identified the S100 calcium-modulated protein family member MRP-14 (S100A9) as an acute MI gene. Case- control validation studies demonstrated that elevated plasma levels of MRP-8/14 complexes predict increased risk of future CV events. Studies using MRP-14-/- mice determined that MRP-8/14 broadly regulates vascular inflammation. However, a key unanswered question is whether MRP-8/14 participates directly in thrombosis. In a recent report (Wang et al. J Clin Invest 2014), we showed that the time to arterial thrombotic occlusion was prolonged markedly in MRP-14-/- mice. We observed that MRP-14 and MRP-8/14 are expressed in and secreted by platelets, and that thrombus formation is reduced in whole blood from MRP-14-/- mice. Infusion of WT platelets or purified MRP-14 into MRP-14-/- mice shortened the carotid artery occlusion time, indicating that platelet-derived MRP-14 directly regulates thrombosis. We next identified CD36 as the platelet membrane receptor for MRP-14. Importantly, while deficiency of MRP-14 is protective of thrombosis, it has no effect on multiple parameters of hemostasis. The central hypotheses of this project are that platelet MRP-14 regulates arterial and venous thrombosis in a CD36-dependent manner, that this interaction can be exploited to develop a safer anti-thrombotic agent (i.e., reduced bleeding risk), and that plasma MRP- 8/14 levels are genetically determined and modified by CV disease activity. We propose 3 specific aims. First, we will characterize the molecular domains responsible for MRP-14:CD36 binding and the downstream signaling that leads to platelet activation. Second, we will investigate the role of MRP-14 in venous thrombosis and in arterial thrombosis in the context of atherosclerosis. Third, major genetic, cellular, and CV disease activity determinants of plasma MRP-8/14 concentration will be explored in collaboration with the Genes and Blood Clotting Study. The MRP-14:CD36 interaction represents a novel target for treating cardiovascular disorders, including heart attack stroke, and DVT. The results of these studies will provide important insights to exploit this interaction to influence thrombosis, but not hemostasis (i.e., reduced bleeding risk)."

"9250197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-induced QT-interval prolongation and resultant sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmia is an uncommon but devastating side effect of more than 70 currently marketed drugs, including multiple commonly-used antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. Most recently, the US FDA issued a warning that the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the US, citalopram, has been associated with QT prolongation, an effect confirmed in recent investigations using electronic health records. Prevention of drug-induced arrhythmia has focused on identifying at-risk drugs. However, there are also characteristics of the vulnerable patient, including common genetic variation, that place certain individuals at particularly high risk of QT prolongation and fatal arrhythmia. Identification of these at-risk individuals represents an important gap in current clinical knowledge. Electrocardiographic QT interval is heritable and has a graded relationship to sudden cardiac death and to arrhythmias from medications. In particular, 16 common genetic variants in twelve genes have been demonstrated to influence inter-individual variability in QT duration; individuals in the top and bottom quintiles of a score of 14 variants have an approximately 10-15 msec difference in QT interval, equivalent to the degree of QT prolongation of some non- cardiac medications withdrawn from the market for arrhythmias. To better estimate the clinical impact of the common variants associated with QT duration, the present study will investigate these variants in 3 complementary contexts. First, building on previous work by this group, electronic health records (EHR) will be used to identify patients with unusually long or short QT intervals; discarded blood will be genotyped for common QT variants. Second, 80 healthy volunteers will be identified on the basis of a QT genotype score to receive moxifloxacin, a marketed antibiotic that prolongs the QT interval. Finally, EHR will be used to identify individuals who were exposed to psychotropic treatments, had ECGs pre and post, and prospective collection of discarded blood samples will be genotyped for known QT-prolonging variants. These studies will allow more precise estimation of the risk associated with common genetic variation and their potential additive/synergistic effects of QT-prolonging medications. Existing medications as well as future ones may be used more safely if this risk can be quantified."
"9254460","IMAGING GROUP HUMAN IMAGING SHARED FACILITY (HISF) ABSTRACT The Human Imaging Shared Facility (HISF) enhances imaging-related research activities included in the UAB- CCC's collaborative group portfolio and other clinical trials through the provision of a standardized approach for reviews of each UAB-CCC protocol and coordination of non-routine imaging services. The protocol review is performed by two research imaging coordinators who provide quotes for routine and nonroutine research imaging services in compliance with institutional and national regulations. Other HISF services include image data transfers and protocol specific imaging techniques, phantom scan/site qualification imaging, physicist, radiologist, or radiology technologist time, and procurement of information for image data forms. Image data transfers meet all UAB Health System Information Security (HSIS) requirements and are audited periodically by the UAB HSIS. Accurate and timely analysis of conventional imaging studies used for response assessment in cancer clinical trials makes up the bulk of services provided to members of the UAB-CCC. With dedicated subspecialty faculty radiologist interpretations coordinated by the assistance of the two radiology research imaging coordinators and a metrics coordinator, protocol-specific metrics are generated by the same set of designated readers throughout the course of each therapeutic trial for consistent longitudinal metrics reporting. In cases of adjudication, the HISF Director works with the PIs and coordinators to resolve reporting issues. The HISF promotes the development and incorporation of novel response evaluation methods (imaging biomarkers) for cancer preclinical, translational, and Phase I-III clinical trials. Through scientific collaboration the HISF can facilitate the translation of more sophisticated imaging examinations, image analytics, and metrics utilized by the other imaging cores such as the Preclinical Imaging Shared Facility and Comprehensive Core for Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Analysis and Development. These non-standard advanced image analyses include physiologic MRI (diffusion weighted imaging, dynamic contrast MRI, MR Spectroscopy), investigational PET CT, PET MRI, and Spectral (dual energy) MDCT.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Results of our published and preliminary studies provide strong evidence that p21-activated kinase (Pak1) is a pleiotropic kinase controlling contractility via signaling that alters cellular Ca2+-fluxes and myofilament Ca2+- response. Pak1 also acts as a hub in pathways suppressing common modes of acquired and familial hypertrophy, remodeling, and fibrosis. Our hypothesis is: activation of Pak1 represents a novel cardio- protective therapy acting to suppress effects of maladaptive cardiac stressors leading to cardiac remodeling, fibrosis and dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms of Pak1 activation and its downstream mechanisms affecting signaling, Ca2+ fluxes and myofilament Ca2+ response is critical to overall understanding of cardiac signaling and to devising strategies for selective activation of Pak1 in the myocardium. Our overall objective is to determine Pak1 related mechanisms involving signaling cascades, Ca2+-fluxes, and myofilament Ca2+- response in the context of a physiological response (exercise), in acquired heart failure (Ang II stress), and in a genetic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Preliminary data strongly support the likelihood that our aims will significantly advance understanding of the control of cardiac function. In Aim #1 our objective is to determine mechanisms by which activators of Pak1 ameliorate maladaptive responses to chronic cardiac stressor - AngII and play a role in physiological hypertrophy with exercise. In Aim #2, we test the hypothesis that that activators of Pak1 are able to prevent and/or inhibit maladaptive responses associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy linked to thin filament mutations by activating Serca2a, reducing oxidative stress and blocking of NFAT and periostin/TGF? pathways. Our objective in Aim #3 is to determine effects of Pak1 signaling on molecular mechanisms at the level of sarcomeres in hearts stressed by physiological, maladaptive (Ang II) and familial (HCM) hypertrophy. Results of our proposed experiments provide insights into previously unappreciated mechanisms of cardiac remodeling and approach to cardio-protection. Our studies translate experimental findings into realistic and novel therapies for hypertrophic remodeling and fit the general theme of our approaches to fully integrate sarcomeric signaling into overall adaptive and maladaptive responses in the myocardium."
"9302766","ABSTRACT (Omics and Bioinformatics Core) Applications of next generation sequencing, protocols for targeted omics assays, and the number and breadth of publicly-available omics datasets all continue to expand at a rapid pace. As such, it is difficult for environmental health scientists to stay up-to-date on all of the technologies, analysis methods, and available data relevant to their research. The objective of the Omics & BioInformatics Core (OBIC) is to provide comprehensive and innovative support to investigators in the Michigan Center on Lifestage Environmental Exposures and Disease (M-LEEaD) for the study design, sample preparation, analysis, interpretation, and integration of a broad range of omics-based studies, and to educate them on available opportunities. OBIC streamlines the entire process of an omics study, allowing center investigators to dedicate more of their own resources to answering difficult environmental health science questions. Lifestage environmental exposures may increase the risk of later disease through a variety of molecular mechanisms, including epigenetic, genetic, transcriptomic, and metabolomics mechanisms. Technologies for which we provide expertise and analysis include pyrosequencing and Sequenom, RNA-seq, gene expression and DNA methylation microarrays, microRNA expression, HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and MeDIP-seq, and ChIP-seq. The OBIC objective will be accomplished through four specific aims. First, we will provide M-LEEaD investigators expertise in the design and implementation of a broad range of omics and gene target studies (e.g. genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic) and development of protocols, including technology platform choice, and sample collection and preparation. Second, we will provide M-LEEaD investigators with a broad-range of bioinformatics analysis services, including standard or custom analyses, support for data management and visualization, and pathway/network analyses. Third, OBIC supports the community through development of novel bioinformatics methods and tools and protocols for novel technologies staying apace with technological advancements. Finally, OBIC educates center faculty, staff, and students on omics assays and bioinformatics methods most relevant to environmental health sciences research, and connects environmental scientists with potential collaborators in omics and bioinformatics. M-LEEaD investigators benefit from free and/or reduced cost services. Our services include assistance in grants and manuscript preparation, individual training on the use of tools and resources, and Bioinformatics/Omics workshops targeted to M-LEEaD investigators."
"9361304","This proposal describes a request for funds to purchase a BD FACSAria Fusion cell sorting flow cytometer with 4 lasers. In this proposal, we describe our needs for obtaining the equipment, its technical specifications, the potential for new collaborations and new avenues of research that will aid veterans, and a plan for the administration of the equipment. Cell sorting flow cytometers are widely used in a variety of research fields and the use of this equipment is specifically outlined and used in VA funded projects at the VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS). A cell sorting flow cytometer does not exist in any VABHS research facility. However, since VABHS investigators currently must use affiliated institutions, there are added costs, time, and sample viability and procedures issues that limit our current abilities. Further, recent advances in technology are being applied in the diverse fields of research at the VABHS where cell sorting flow cytometry can be used to determine cell specific targets. The FACS equipment with 4 lasers will allow for cell sorting and analysis of up to 11 biomarkers simultaneously in cell population for an extremely diverse set of cells. The requested equipment has several capabilities that enhance its function and the safety of the operators. Having cell sorting flow cytometer capabilities will markedly enhance our abilities to understanding the pathophysiology of numerous disorders that affect veterans including cancer, sleep-related disorders, and schizophrenia. Possessing cell sorting flow cytometry capabilities at the VABHS will allow for new collaboration and attract and retain top-rate researchers. Also, this system is also contained in a protective hood that will enhance the protection of VA investigators."
"9244675","As a National FIB Resource, the Ligand Assay and Analysis Core will serve an essential role in this U54  Center, and other FIB-supported Projects and Centers. First, the Core will provide high quality, cost effective  assay services. Second, develop new state-of-the-art assay methods to accommodate investigator needs.  Third, the Core will provide assistance and consultation regarding assay methodology, data  reduction/analysis and data interpretation.  The accurate, precise and dependable measurement of reproductive hormones is an essential  component in the mission of Ligand Core. The justification for establishing a Core facility relates to the  savings in cost, resources and personnel to internal and external FIB-supported investigators, as they will  not need to develop and maintain these methods in each individual laboratory. The technical expertise and  equipment required to perform high volume or diverse testing by each investigator would be inefficient and  divert effort and resources from important research questions. Also, a central Core facility can implement  uniform standards for assay performance, quality controls and data reduction. The implementation of new  methods or enhancement of current assays require technical expertise that would be costly and inefficient to  establish in-house by each project investigator: One of the major rationales for establishing the Gore Is to  provide state of the art assay services in a cost efficient manner. This mission will include development of  assays with enhanced sensitivity and specificity, transferring methods from radioactive to nonradioactive  systems, implementation of automation equipment (for high volume tests). Assay automation can enhance  assay performance by improving assay precision and reducing costs by increasing the number of tests that  can be performed by the technologist. Finally, providing services to other FIB-supported Centers and other  reproductive scientists within the University of Virginia, promote a spirit of cooperation that may lead to future  collaborations between investigators"

"9253448","PROJECT SUMMARY (See insructions): The Intervention Core (Core D) will provide a range of services to Center investigators to link with our community partners and to train investigators and providers to implement a broad range of interventions for treatment of mental illness, HIV, and their comorbidities. Specifically, Core D will: (1) Provide expert consultation on the design of HIV intervention projects with consistent consideration of integration of both biomedical and behavioral science; 2) Assemble a library of manuals and other materials to facilitate access to and dissemination of evidence-based interventions for the treatment of mental illnesses and HIV; (3) Provide training for interventionists in the use of state-of-the-science interventions; and (4) Provide linkages with community-based providers for effectiveness trials. Many projects that Core D will support will be completed using established and standard methods, and we have an explicit preference for using manualized treatments in real worid settings and comparative effectiveness research methods. In some cases, however, it will be necessary to either adapt existing methods or devise new ones in order to achieve the goals of a particular project or initiative. In general. Core D will utilize personnel effort that is supported by the Core for pilot projects and preparation of funding proposals, with the subsequent funded grants providing direct support of the resulting collaborative research effort. Core D is dedicated to building a portfolio over time that will combine comparative effectiveness research, translation and implementation science, and community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. Building on the unique capacities available at Penn, the Intervention Core will collaborate with other centers and institutes such as the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics in the Wharton School and the Annenberg Public Policy Center to conduct cost-effectiveness and other policy relevant analysis in order to plan for targeted dissemination to influence public health policy regarding treatment of HIV among persons with psychiatric conditions. We will provide assistance in grant proposal preparation; and potential users of the Core will be alerted of the resources."
"9272876","ABSTRACT CORE B: Immunology Core Core Director: Roberto Calcedo, Ph.D. We are entering a new era for treating inherited genetic disorders where gene therapy holds great promise for their treatment. After several decades of research and development in viral vectors, we finally have the technology to efficiently transfer genes into cells. Unfortunately, several studies have shown that immune responses to the viral vector and transgene heavily influence in vivo gene therapy performance. The Immunology Core focuses its efforts on studying the natural existing T and B cell immunity to viral vectors used in gene therapy, Adenovirus (AdV) and Adeno-associated virus (AAV), in human and nonhuman primates (NHPs). We have also centered our studies on vector and transgene-specific T and B cell responses after systemic and local administration of various rAAV and rAdV serotypes carrying different transgenes in NHPs and in subjects from several ongoing clinical trials. This will help us to determine if rAAV and rAdV administration can re-activate existing or induce new T cell responses to the vector or the transgene and if these have any effect on the outcome of the gene transfer and the health of the patient. We are also interested in T cell responses to self-antigens especially in those subjects with genetic diseases where a significant portion of the gene is missing. Introduction of the correct copy of the gene in these subjects could induce an immune response to the transgene and compromise the treatment. We are evaluating these responses in CF subjects and found low to high levels of self-reactive CFTR-specific T cells directed to the mutated region of the CFTR. In all these studies, we isolated lymphocytes from blood, liver, intestine, primary and secondary lymphoid organs and characterized the T cell response by ex vivo IFN? ELISPOT, lymphoproliferation assay, in vivo CTL assay, and polychromatic flow cytometric analysis of antigen specific T cells.

"9260955","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ras proteins are molecular switches that in their GTP-bound state control intracellular signaling cascades. Ras signaling is inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), including the tumor suppressor NF1. NF1 loss of function mutations have recently been implicated in driving neuroblastoma, brain, lung, thyroid and other tumor types and implicated in resistance to therapy. In addition, inherited NF1 mutations result in Neurofibromatosis type 1, a disease in which patients develop incurable benign peripheral nerve sheath Schwann cell tumors called neurofibromas. NF1 patients are also predisposed to aggressive sarcomas, MPNST, which are a leading cause of death in NF1 patients. The goals of this application are two-fold. We shall use NF1 loss of function to delineate Ras-specific pathways in neurofibroma cells. This is because NF1 is a GAP for all Ras proteins: H-, N-, K-, M-, R-Ras and RRas2/TC21, and may have additional, non-Ras, functions. When there is complete loss of NF1, all Ras proteins are activated, so that NF1 models provide a unique opportunity to study the contributions of individual Ras proteins to tumorigenesis in vivo. In Aim 1 we will test whether loss of H-Ras specifically delays or blocks neurofibroma formation in mouse models driven by NF1 loss of function, alone or in combination with RRas2 loss. We will also determine if H-Ras activation is sufficient to promote neurofibroma formation. In Aim 2 we will test if Ras activation is sufficient for neurofibroma formation, using a new Nf1 mutant allele and use specialized Schwann cell systems to define Ras-specific effects in NF1 mutant cells. In Aim 3 we will validate our state-of-the-art exome sequencing to identify Ras-related signaling pathway mutations in Schwann cells that co-operate with NF1 loss of function to promote NF1 tumorigenesis. Together these studies will define Ras isoform specific functions in cancer cells, and clarify molecular signals that drive neurofibroma formation."
"9249582","ABSTRACT (Overall Component) The overarching goals of our Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC) are to prevent disease and improve public health through innovative programs of excellence in environmental health sciences research, to engage communities to address environmental health issues, and to enhance career development of talented environmental health investigators. The EHSC provides the framework for the generation of novel research findings and their conversion into effective resources for public health officials, medical professionals, and the community. This tradition of success is based on our ability to recruit broad multi- and interdisciplinary expertise, maintain a strong emphasis on basic science principles while incorporating clinical and translational approaches, and effectively interact with the community. The specific mission of the EHSC at Rochester is to improve public health through the generation of fundamental knowledge and elaboration of mechanisms by which chemical exposures, alone or through interaction with other modifying factors, contribute to cumulative health risk across the life span. As such, the theme that guides and integrates EHSC research and community engagement programs is the understanding of interactions of environmental and occupational agents with diverse individual contexts across the lifespan in modulating human disease and dysfunction. The goals of the Center are achieved through a major focus on three research programs: Pulmonary & Cardiovascular Disease Program, Neurodevelopmental & Neurodegenerative Disease Program, and Musculoskeletal Disease Program. While the Center is structurally organized into these Disease Programs, shared thematic biological processes, including immunological responses & inflammation, stem cell biology, early life sensitivities and mechanisms of adult disease, epigenetics, and nutritional/dietary factors, weave these programs together and synergize the research. These research efforts are supported by several structural units: Administrative Core, Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core, Biostatistics Facility Core, Community Outreach & Engagement Core, Pilot Project Program, and Career Development Program for Environmental Health Science Investigators."

The Core will reduce administrative barners by providing centralized accounting, budgeting, and administrative services to the Project and Core teams and to the overall Center. The Core will further ease the burden on the research teams by facilitating all grant renewals and providing regulatory support to ensure compliance for all projects and research personnel. The Core will also handle any human resources and immigration considerations. Utilizing established methodologies, the Core will foster team science to integrate the Center's research efforts and will support frequent and straightforward communication between the individual research Projects and Cores. The Core will organize in-person and virtual scientific meetings, which will increase collaboration and accelerate the pace and quality of translation research. The Core will also schedule and organize an annual meeting of Pis, to be coordinated with the established annual Oncofertility Conference, which attracts a national group of scientists, researchers, and clinicians to present advances in reproductive and endocrine science in the disease context. The Core will maintain a thorough and up-to-date website to disseminate research findings and resources to the larger community of researchers and clinicians in women's reproductive health, as well as host publications, video, and overviews of each of the Projects and Cores. In order to engage the next generation of independent researchers, a twice-yearly cross-center research training program will be organized by the Core to provide trainees with an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge techniques such as follicle isolation, manipulation, encapsulation in biomaterials, and culture for in vitro follicle growth. The Core will also evaluate Center progress by supporting Internal, External, and Community Advisory Committees and an Information Technology Strategic Development Committee, and by monitoring the progress of each Project and Core. The Core will manage requests for proposals for pilot projects and work with the Pilot Project Advisory and Assessment Committee to identify exemplary pilot proposals, recommend them to the SCCPIR pilot committee, and evaluate their progress. Through these means, the Core will facilitate and coordinate research efforts and support the dissemination of the Center's work to the reproductive health research community and the many medical disciplines that provide care for patients whose reproductive health is at risk from their disease or its treatment."

Dr. Corbie-Smith has made excellent use of the support provided in the first cycle of her K24. She has been highly productive, with an impressive trajectory of peer-reviewed publications in the emerging field of community engaged research. She has been successful in funding her work, obtaining a new R01 grant focused on dissemination of an evidence based intervention to reduce CVD risk in rural African American populations. She has mentored her first trainees to independence, and new trainees she has mentored with her K24 support have been successful in terms of publications and funding. She has successfully mentored trainees in diverse fields such as nursing, medicine, health behavior, and epidemiology and the vast majority of trainees are scholars of color. This renewal will make it possible for the candidate to further develop her research program, and use her research program as a platform for her mentoring.

"9247796","?    DESCRIPTION:  Cardiovascular disease remains as the Number 1 killer in western societies. Currently, ischemic damage to the heart cannot be repaired by conventional medical care therefore only palliative treatments exist. Stem cell transplantation is a promising strategy for therapeutic cardiac regeneration, but current therapies are limited by inefficient interaction between potentially beneficial cells (either exogenously transplanted or endogenously recruited) and the injured tissue. The development of new methods that achieve selective, targeted cell-cell interactions has the potential to revolutionize cardiovascular regenerative medicine. In this application, we pioneer the concept of magnetic bi-functional cell engager (MagBICE) for therapeutic cell targeting. Iron nanoparticles (Fe) are linked with Fab' fragments directed against the therapeutic cell (Fab1) and the injured cell (Fab2). The central hypothesis is that: MagBICE (Fab1-Fe-Fab2) delivered systemically will capture mobilized stem cells in the blood and redirect them to injured tissue via the circulatory system (see cartoon illustration). MagBICE enables molecular recognition (via Fab') and physical enrichment by external magnetic field (via Fe). Moreover, translatability of the proposed MagBICE approach to human patients should be straightforward, given that both the iron nanocore and recombinant human antibodies are in human applications. We have reduced the concept into practice in preliminary studies that form the basis for this application. We have shown: Successful conjugation of whole antibodies to FDA-approved Feraheme(r) iron nanoparticles to MagBICE; MagBICE displays desirable physicochemical features for intravenous applications; MagBICE exhibits minimal cytotoxicity and specific binding to stem cells and injured cardiomyocyte in vitro; In a proof-of-concept animal study using a rat model of acute myocardial infarction (MI), intravenously-infused MagBICE captures circulating stem cells and targets them to the injured heart, reducing scar formation and rescuing cardiac function of the animals; Antibody-mediated targeting can be synergistically coupled by magnetic attraction to further enhance cell homing and the functional benefit of MagBICE. Under the auspices of this R01 award, we seek to take advantage of the latest antibody processing technologies to create a new class of MagBICE using Fab' fragments and comprehensively study their therapeutic potencies in a rat model of acute MI. Furthermore, we plan to study the toxicity of MagBICE in animals and the synergistic benefits from magnetic focusing. Unlike conventional stem cell therapies which require exogenous cell processing and transplantation, the innovation of MagBICE is the potential to recruit a person's own endogenous stem cells and efficiently target them to the site of injury. By varying the Fab' fragments attached, and/or adding a drug payload onto the iron core, MagBICE becomes a generalizable platform technology broadly applicable to a myriad of tissue degeneration diseases involving the recruitment of endogenous stem cells to the site of injury."
"9294148","Project Summary  Genetically engineered mice are critical tools for uncovering basic biological processes and for modeling human disease. Mouse models are an integral element of this program, enabling each of the projects to test hypotheses and model human normal and disease states. The principal goal of the Experimental Animal Core is to house mice for all projects in the most cost effective and efficient manner in a readily accessible central facility. The animal core will continue to provide genotyping, help plan the number of mice required for experiments with each investigator and correspondingly, generate the appropriate number of mice required to carry out the proposed studies. Each strain of mice will be housed and generated in direct proportion to the need of the investigator, with a breeding algorithm that is supported by customized software. Statistical tools will be used to ensure that the fewest number of mice are used that can provide reportable results. The core will continue to import the relevant strains of mice required of each investigator and will verify both genotype and maintain the appropriate background genetic strain. In addition to activities associated with mouse husbandry, the core will test and provide preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transfers and for cell and organ harvesting. A central registry will be maintained for all genetically engineered animals and normal control mouse strains that will be housed in the core facility and used by all projects during the course of this proposal."
"9246469","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this research is to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of a noninvasive and quantitative tool for classification/diagnosis of breast masses. The general goal of this project is to apply a technique called Sub-Hertz Analysis of Visco-Elasticity (SAVE), to increase specificity in the characterization of breast masses. This technique is based on measurement of the strain retardance-time parameter, which characterizes slow deformation of tissue due to a constant force. This parameter is representative of tissue viscosity and elasticity. The novelty of this proposal lies in the fact tht, in contrast to other existing elasticity imaging methods, the SAVE technique explores tissue dynamic response in the frequency range below 1 Hz. To our knowledge, our sub-Hertz method is the only elasticity imaging approach that explores this range of frequency spectrum, and the proposed research will be the first study in which this technique will be tested on a large group of patients. Our preliminary results have shown that SAVE provides reliable discrimination of benign lesions (fibrocystic change, fibroadenoma) from focal malignancies (infiltrating ductal and lobular cancers) with a remarkable specificity of 100% in a relatively small group of patients with non-palpable masses. Our general hypothesis is that by using SAVE, we will be able to improve pre-biopsy breast lesion classification in select groups of patients. This project includes the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the specificity of SAVE by correlating its results with pathology in a population of patients with suspicious breast masses (BIRADS 4 or 5 lesions); (2) Determine the efficacy of SAVE in classifying non-specific masses in a group of breast patients on the follow- up list (BIRADS 3 lesions). Specific Aim 1 is designed to examine the efficacy of the SAVE method in patients with BIRADS 4 and 5 category lesions. In this Aim, the results of SAVE will be correlated to the biopsy results to evaluate the specificity of the proposed method in the high-risk group. Specific Aim 2 examines the patient population with probable benign breast masses, categorized as BIRADS 3 with recommendations for short-term follow up at 6-months intervals. This category is particularly challenging for both the clinician and the patient due to potentially prolonged diagnosis, stressful wait time, and the associated cost. In this aim, the results of SAVE will be correlated with the clinical results, which may include biopsy, at thei re-evaluation visit(s). Successful completion of this research will open the way for a new clinical tool that may be used for classification of breast masses. The proposed method is noninvasive, low cost, easy to use, and compatible with current ultrasound technology, which means that this technology can be readily translated to the clinic and become available to a wide range of breast patients. Consequently, this research has the potential to provide significant impact in breast cancer diagnosis and in reducing unnecessary biopsies."
"9328196","Abstract  Bacteria inhabit a diverse set of ecological niches, and can adapt their growth to a wide range of chemical and physical conditions via sensory/signal transduction systems. Although these systems are highly abundant in bacteria, we have limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which cells utilize these regulatory systems to integrate environmental information. This work aims to understand a conserved mechanism known as the General Stress Response (GSR), which enables Alphaproteobacteria to adapt and respond to changes in the environment. I will use the freshwater species, Caulobacter crescentus, as a model system to investigate how bacterial signaling systems function in bona fide environmental contexts. Recent results from clinical and environmental microbiome studies demonstrate that a complete understanding of microbial physiology requires the interrogation of cell growth in environmentally relevant conditions. Developing C. crescentus as a model system to study the GSR integration of sensory information will provide a novel approach to define the mechanism of bacterial signal transduction in an environmental context. Experiments from this proposal will define how bacteria interface with their environment in natural conditions, leading to a more complete understanding of how bacterial cells survive in a diverse range of niches, including human hosts. The Crosson Lab has a successful track record of utilizing techniques from a wide range of disciplines to pursue questions probing genetic and molecular function with regards to bacterial signaling systems. Their broad interdisciplinary approach will yield new insights to understanding how bacterial cells sense and respond to their environments. My postdoctoral training in the Crosson Lab, focused on characterization of a conserved regulatory process within the context of the natural environment, will help facilitate my successful transition into an independent research scientist with a focus on microbial communities."
"9257196","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now a disease with a number of highly effective treatment options that are leading to a greater number of cancer survivors who are living long and productive lives. Globally, there are 10 million people diagnosed with cancer, and 10% of newly diagnosed men and women are under the age of 40 years. While aggressive radiation and chemotherapies are able to save and prolong their lives, disruption of reproductive function-including fertility and endocrine function-can be an unintended consequence that is particularly relevant for these young cancer patients. We have also come to recognize that many young women have non-malignant conditions or must undergo treatment with drugs or procedures that can damage their reproductive function. The proposed Northwestern University Center for Reproductive Health After Disease will therefore extend the overall scope of work to ensure that these women are provided options for protecting their reproductive health and that providers are aware of the threat posed by specific diseases and treatments on reproductive function. Moreover, our Center will not be limited to the preservation of fertility but will also address the long-term endocrine health of women who lose gonadal function. There are 20,000 women between the ages of 41 and 51 who are diagnosed with cancer each year, and while these women lie outside the age limit for experimental fertility interventions, they are in need of  alternatives that will preserve ovarian endocrine support of various tissues, such as bone. The overall hypothesis of the Center is that effective options can be provided to young women with malignant or non-malignant disease who must undergo life-preserving cancer treatments and other medical interventions that will affect their reproductive health. By assembling a diverse, cross-disciplinary team of investigators, the Center will pursue both basic scientific research and  clinical research goals, as well as create and implement educational and community outreach initiatives to share the Center's findings with providers, patients, their families, and the public  Center researchers will investigate new techniques for producing healthy, mature oocytes from the pool of immature oocytes in ovarian tissue banked by young cancer patients. Another project will examine the cellular mechanisms that might be targeted to protect eggs from the damaging effects of radiation and chemotherapy; this work will be particularly important for preserving endocrine health in older women. Clinical research will be conducted to determine to what extent fertility concerns affect the medical decision making process of patients. With an expanded scope, a team-based approach to problem solving, and the goal of preserving not only fertility, but all aspects of reproductive health, our Center has the potential to impact the lives of many young women who are at risk of disease-related or iatrogenic infertility and endocrine dysfunction."
"9272734","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity afflicts one in three Americans and is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Current therapies do not address obesity as fundamentally deregulated energy balance and have largely failed to curtail the ongoing epidemic. Better understanding of hypothalamic control over energy balance should lead to improved therapy. While extensive work has shown that hypothalamic glucose-responsive neurons can stimulate or suppress feeding, less is known about specialized hypothalamic glial cells called tanycytes that modulate the energy balance circuit. Tanycytes line the ventral third ventricle wall and are uniquely positioned between the hypothalamus and cerebrospinal fluid. They project long processes into the hypothalamus that form extensive contacts with the diet-responsive neurons, modulate the activity of orexigenic neurons, and are neurogenic progenitors for new neurons added to this circuit postnatally. Experimentally enhancing or ablating tanycyte-derived hypothalamic neurogenesis in rodents affects weight gain. However, the precise identity of neurogenic tanycytes is unclear and endogenous signaling mechanisms that regulate tanycyte germinal activity are unknown. Using an imaging technique developed for en-face analysis of cells lining the cerebral ventricles, preliminary studies in mice and humans revealed two segregated subsets of tanycytes-bi-ciliated tanycytes with two long cilia and uni-ciliated tanycytes with a single short primary cilium. Intriguingly, glucose-sensing molecules expressed in pancreatic beta cells were found localized to tanycyte primary cilia, suggesting a possible feedback mechanism used by these cells to detect energy balance. Preliminary experiments showed that ablating tanycyte cilia resulted in a diabetic-like phenotype. Tanycyte subsets also displayed distinct molecular marker expression that permitted construction of two Cre-expressing adenoviruses to specifically target and lineage-trace the two populations. In Aim 1, this study will employ stereotactic 3rd ventricular injections of the Cre adenoviruses into Cre reporter mice to determine the identity of neurogenic tanycytes. In Aim 2, the same injections will be used to ablate cilia in conditional knockout mice with floxed alleles of Kif3a, required fo ciliogenesis. These mice will then be subject to a battery of metabolic tests including measurements of food intake and energy expenditure with or without additional metabolic challenges including diet-induced obesity and glucoprivic states. The proposed work will provide deeper understanding of tanycyte subtypes, tanycyte-derived hypothalamic neurogenesis, and the function of tanycyte cilia in glucose-sensing and energy balance. From a therapeutic perspective, these results may foster future pharmacological experiments targeting tanycyte cilia with intraventricular therapies to modulate states of energy imbalance."
"9328489","Project Summary Heterozygous deletion of neurexin-1 (NRXN1), a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule, is strongly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and psychosis. NRXN1 is highly alternatively spliced and recently a role for these splice isoforms in neuronal identity has been suggested; however, NRXN1 isoforms have not been characterized in human neurons. Animal models of NRXN1 deletion display deficits in behavior and neuronal activity. However, animal models cannot recapitulate the effect of myriad patient-specific deletions in the context of other risk variants within a patient?s genome; together, these effects likely influence the variable penetrance of NRXN1 deletions, which confer a diverse set of clinical diagnoses. Using hiPSC-neurons derived from a rare cohort of four psychosis patients carrying NRXN1 deletions, this proposal will investigate the casual contribution of these deletions on gene expression, alternative splicing and neuronal phenotypes in excitatory hiPSC-neurons. There are three aims: the first is identify differences in alternative splicing in NRXN1 deletion hiPSC-neurons, the second is to restore isoform deficiencies and manipulate NRXN1 expression in hiPSC-neurons, and the third is to establish the functional significance of NRXN1 deletion in hiPSC-neurons. My hypothesis is that excitatory hiPSC-neurons derived from four psychosis patients will exhibit differential expression of NRXN1 isoforms which are crucial for proper neuronal activity and morphology. We include strong preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of our proposal; moreover, we have already observed that NRXN1 hiPSC-neurons express both wildtype and deleted allele variants. Our hope is that these experiments will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9326622","PROJECT SUMMARY: The goal of this proposal is to determine the role of sensory neuron Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain, Leucine Rich Repeat And Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in postoperative pain. Acute postoperative pain is experienced by 80% of patients, where 43% of these patients still experience pain even after receiving the most current analgesic treatments. Twenty percent of patients out of the 80% develop chronic postoperative pain. Postoperative pain significantly impacts the outcome of patients by inhibiting them from performing rehabilitative exercises, which leads to increased hospital stays and longer recovery times. Postoperative pain is both inflammatory and neuropathic, which results in mechanical and thermal peri- incisional hypersensitivity. The NLRP3 inflammasome is known to be proinflammatory because it induces the release of the inflammatory and pain-inducing cytokine interleukin-1? (IL-1?). In addition, NLRP3 activation requires toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) stimulation, which is known to sensitize the pain-modulating receptor transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on sensory nerve terminals. Importantly, IL-1?, and TRPV1 sensitization have been linked to mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in animal models of postoperative pain. However, there is little known about the role of NLRP3 in sensory neurons and how NLRP3 activation contributes to postoperative pain. Therefore, this proposal will elucidate the mechanisms of NLRP3 activation after surgical incision, and how NLRP3 activation and TRPV1 sensitization contribute to the generation of postoperative pain. To achieve this, the project includes both molecular and physiological methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, calcium imaging, ex vivo teased fiber recordings, and behavioral assays. Aim 1 will determine the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in DRG neurons after perioperative incision and identify the mechanism of DRG neuron NLRP3 activation. Aim 2 will test the involvement of neuronal NLRP3 inflammasome activation in TRPV1-mediated sensitization to mechanical and thermal stimuli after perioperative incision. Since this proposal studies the mechanisms underlying postoperative pain, its aims fall under the NINDS mission of reducing the burden of neurological and painful diseases."
"9294612","Abstract The gastrointestinal tract harbors one of the highest densities of microorganisms on Earth. This collection of microbial genomes is an extension to the human genome, with clear implications on human health and disease. Early events in microbial colonization have a profound effect on physiology and immune education in the gut, thereby impacting disease susceptibility (including obesity, asthma, and other inflammatory disorders later in life). The human gut microbiota colonizes, stabilizes, and matures during the first few years of life, yet we know remarkably little about the natural history of how the microbiome forms in children. The study proposed here will provide fundamental knowledge about the newborn gut microbiome ? including its establishment; response to nutrients; and its implication for disease. This project aims to understand how maternal factors shape infant gut microbiome development and how early life microbial composition influence the allergy onset. Using newly established and future prospective birth cohorts, we will undertake metagenomic sequencing, strain-level analysis and bacterial isolation and characterization. (1) We will identify how delivery mode affects the abundant strains in the newborn gut, along with their potential parental sources. (2) We will isolate bacteria from newborn guts and determine if there is a personalized match between mother's breast milk and her child's gut microbiome. (3) We will examine the influence of the infant gut microbiome and early feeding on allergy to cow's milk. This research will illuminate how environmental factors modulate infant gut colonization and how the gut microbiota affect the onset of pediatric allergies. This will serve as a basis for the development of evidence- based interventions to colonize the gut of children born by C-section; supplement the diet of formula-fed children; and shift the infant gut microbiome to a less ?allergy-prone? state.  "
"9231477","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza-complicated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection has emerged as a leading cause of death during recent influenza pandemics and epidemics. Both heightened bacterial burden and exaggerated lung inflammation are believed to be responsible for high mortality in patients and animal models. However, a hitherto incomplete understanding of co-infection pathophysiology has slowed the development of effective treatment strategies. NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) is an enzyme complex predominantly expressed by phagocytes. NOX2 produces superoxide which reacts with nitric oxide and results in the formation of highly toxic peroxynitrite. Therefore, both NOX2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activities critically contribute to oxidative stress which has long been known to be involved in inflammatory lung damage. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species  (ROS) generated by NOX2 activity has been shown to exacerbate influenza virus-induced tissue inflammation  but to contribute to resistance to S. aureus lung infection~ whereas iNOS activity plays a detrimental role during  influenza infection, it is dispensable for pulmonary S. aureus clearance. Preliminary studies in the PI's laboratory revealed that influenza infection reduces phagocyte ROS level but increases IFN-?/iNOS expression. Therefore, it is hypothesized that dysregulation of oxidative burst following influenza infection  causes defective bacterial killing s well as excessive oxidative stress, and results in fatal influenza and MRSA  co-infection. The approaches to test the hypothesis include: 1) determine the influence of influenza infection on NOX2 activity and its contribution to influenza-suppressed phagocytic MRSA killing. Particularly, the molecular mechanisms for influenza-suppressed NOX2-dependent MRSA clearance will be examined in selected gene- deficient mice~ 2) determine the contribution of oxidative stress to lung injury during lethal influenza and MRSA co-infection. Specifically, the synergistic or overlapping contribution of NOX2 versus IFN-?/iNOS activity to oxidative tissue damage will be examined in NOX2, IFN-?R and iNOS gene-deficient mice~ 3) refine combination treatment targeting both intracellular bacteria and oxidative stress. Supportive data demonstrated that combination treatment with antibiotic and NOX2 inhibitor significantly improved the survival rate of influenza and MRSA co-infected mice compared with antibiotic treatment alone. Specific aim 3 is to optimize this combination therapeutic approach based on the findings from studies proposed in aim 1 &2. The ultimate goal of this project is to establish the treatment strategy to restore antimicrobial activity but to control inflammatory lung damage during influenza and MRSA co-infection. The results achieved from these proposed  studies will provide not only pivotal but also directly applicable information for the development of novel  therapeutics to reduce the high mortality in patients."
"9238774","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 convenience controls from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease."
"9324765","PROJECT SUMMARY Tuberculosis (TB) is an important disease globally and remains a threat to the United States. In some parts of South Africa nearly 1% of the population develops TB disease annually, partly because of the very high rates of HIV infection in that country, an infection that makes people susceptible to secondary infection by TB. The way in which the body resists TB via the immune response is only partly understood, which creates difficulty in understanding what properties a new vaccine against TB should have. Furthermore the body's own immune response inadvertently can make TB worse by reacting strongly to parts of the bacterium responsible. A collaboration between a leading basic Science group at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and a group of researchers in South Africa was therefore funded two years' ago. The aim is to investigate in humans recent findings in the mouse model that have the potential to improve our understanding and thus prevent and treat TB. We are assembling groups of TB patients from whom samples of blood and from the disease site will be made available. We will also track the progress of the patients during TB antibiotic treatment. We will use the materials from the patients to test several ideas that have arisen from NIH. Another aspect contributing to tuberculosis in South Africa is the legacy of apartheid: a policy that sought to segregate people of differing colors and associated with discrimination in all aspects of life such as housing, education and employment. Although South Africa became fully democratic in 1994, reversing the years of discrimination and providing opportunity to all is a long process. This revision program will specifically apply additional funding to provide educational opportunities via our research to scientists at two historically disadvantaged universities in South Africa: Walter Sisulu University and Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University. Through these studies and additional opportunities, this collaborative project will improve understanding of people's immune response to TB, enhancing our ability to tackle this devastating condition more effectively. In addition the revision program promises the chance to provide research training for previously underrepresented persons, thus increasing and distributing more equitably the expertise to conduct highly relevant public health research."
"9347994","ABSTRACT  Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States and millions worldwide. Symptoms appear shortly after birth, and in less developed countries the majority of children with SCD die before the age of five. In the U.S., SCD patients suffer chronic pain and fatigue, severe acute painful crises requiring hospitalization and opiates, strokes, and multi-organ damage, and have an average mortality in their 40s. The only FDA approved drug for adults with SCD is the anticancer drug hydroxyurea. New treatments are desperately needed for both children and adults with SCD.  SCD-101 is a botanical drug that has shown direct in vitro and in vivo anti-sickling activity. Our goal is to develop SCD-101 as a safe and effective oral treatment that prevents the inexorable progression of sickle cell disease in children and adults. In sub-Saharan Africa and India, where many millions suffer with sickle cell disease, 80% of the population depends on Traditional Medicine (botanicals) for primary health care. Therefore, SCD-101, as a botanical drug, is the solution for the millions with sickle cell disease worldwide.  We recently completed a 28-day repeat oral dose, dose-escalation study of SCD-101 in 23 adults with sickle cell disease. The Phase 1b results showed that SCD-101 was safe and well tolerated and established the dose and schedule to be used in a Phase 2 study. At the two highest doses, there was a profound effect on reducing fatigue and pain, the two most common symptoms of SCD. Building on the results of our Phase 1b study, we propose a double-blind, placebo controlled 2x2 crossover study in 18 patients with homozygous (S/S) sickle cell disease to establish the clinically relevant endpoints to be used in a Phase 2 and Phase 3 study.  A crossover study, where each subject is his or her own control, doubles the effective sample size, so the crossover study has the equivalent power of a 36 patient parallel design. The proposed crossover study has sufficient power to show a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in fatigue based our Phase 1b results, and may show a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in pain. The crossover study will also measure the effect of SCD-101 on sleep, red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis markers, inflammatory cytokines, and circulating sickled cells in venous whole blood."
"9108875","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Many people - and especially Veterans - have at some time sustained traumatic injury to the  joint, and this injury often leads to the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) in the  affected joint(s) years later. No treatments exist that can promote healing and prevent the development of OA following traumatic joint injury. Moreover, current therapies for those who have developed OA simply alleviate symptoms of advanced disease rather than inhibit the processes that drive the disease. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of post-traumatic OA would undoubtedly yield new therapeutic approaches.  Coagulation and fibrinolysis - two closely linked proteolytic cascades that regulate bleeding - are aberrantly activated in the joints of individuals with late-stage OA. We found that pharmacological inhibition of the key fibrinolysis factor plasmin attenuated post-traumatic OA and its attendant synovial inflammation in mice, as did deficiency in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), an endogenous inducer of plasmin generation. Conversely, deficiency in plasmin activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), the endogenous inhibitor of plasmin generation, had the opposite effect. In addition, carboxypeptidase B (CPB), an enzyme that links coagulation and inflammation was activated in the synovial fluid of individuals with OA and protected against post-traumatic OA in mice. Furthermore, the coagulation factors thrombin and fibrinogen stimulated the production of degradative enzymes and inflammatory cytokines by fibroblast-like synoviocytes from OA patients. We hypothesize that, rather than being an epiphenomenon of late-stage OA, deregulation of the coagulation-fibrinolysis systems is a primary event that is crucial to the pathogenesis of OA. We hypothesize that coagulation and fibrinolysis factors promote the low-grade inflammation that drives OA. We propose to elucidate the roles of coagulation and fibrinolysis in post-traumatic OA. The availability of several FDA-approved anticoagulants and antifibrinolytics means that success of these studies could, with relative ease, lead to development of the first-ever preventive therapies for post-traumatic OA. We propose to determine whether short-term administration of specific anticoagulants or antifibrinolytics after traumatic joint injury or after development of early signs of OA can reset the coagulation-fibrinolysis system in the synovial joints and thereby prevent or treat post-traumatic OA."
"9198731","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Individuals living with a lower extremity amputation (LEA) often experience relative motion between their residual limb and the prosthetic socket, such as vertical translation and axial rotation. This motion causes inefficient dynamic load transmission from the distal prosthetic components to the residual limb, which can lead to significant secondary consequences, such as pain, gait deviations, and discomfort that limit mobility and autonomy. Over time, inefficient load transmission can lead to elevated forces on the intact joints, which can result in higher risk  and incidences of degenerative diseases. There is a substantial gap in our understanding of the complex mechanics of the residual limb-socket interaction during dynamic activities that limit the ability to improve prosthetic design. Although assessments of the relative motion between the bone and the prosthetic socket have been performed, currently there is little existing data on dynamic, in vivo residual limb-socket kinematics. Dynamic Stereo X-ray (DSX) is the only currently available technology that can achieve sub- millimeter bone pose (position and orientation) estimation accuracy during a wide variety of functional movements, but current analytical methods and tools often rely on subjective input and are extremely time consuming. DSX is a 3D imaging technology for visualizing rapid skeletal movement in vivo. DSX combines 3D models of bone morphology derived from computed tomography (CT) scans (required to generate the subject specific bone models of the remnant femur for tracking skeletal kinematics) with movement data from biplanar x-ray video to create highly accurate re-animations of the bone moving in 3D space. It allows for the calculation of joint angles and range of motion (ROM) during activity. Utilizing DSX, our 2 year goals for this pilot project are to develop and validate  time-efficient 3D quantitative functional assessment tools to quantify the in vivo kinematics between the residual limb and prosthetic socket, in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) of motion for individuals with transfemoral amputation. To verify the analytical tools and their relevance to TFA, we will evaluate two socket designs: a traditional encapsulated socket and a Compression/Release Stabilization (CRS) socket. To do so, the investigators will address the following aims: (1) To quantify, in 6 degrees of freedom of motion, the relative motion between the residual bone and the prosthetic socket during dynamic activities using DSX; (2) To compare comfort, quality of life, satisfaction, perceived stability, and ease of use of two lower limb socket designs. To address these aims, 5 subjects with TFA will be randomly assigned to start the study with their traditional, encapsulated socket or a fabricated CRS socket. Each subject will wear the assigned socket for 4 weeks of home use. After 4 weeks, the process will be repeated with each subject utilizing the second socket. After each period of home use, subjects will be administered the Trinity Amputations and Prosthetics Experience Scale (TAPES) satisfaction scale, and items related to socket comfort and fit drawn from both the Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) and Prosthetic Profile of the Amputee (PPA). Furthermore, a qualitative assessment will be performed through semi-guided interview. Following 8 weeks of home use, each subject will then be transported to Providence, Rhode Island (Brown University), where a CT scan will be performed and DSX will be utilized to record dynamic X-ray sequences during walking at self-selected speed, fast walking (10% faster), and sudden stop. Gait and movement data will be collected simultaneously with the XROMM during each dynamic task. By developing the analytical tools for a highly accurate in-vivo assessment of residual limb-socket motion, we can provide vital foundational information to aid in the development of new methods and techniques to enhance prosthetic fit that have the potential to reduce secondary physical comorbidities and degenerative changes that result from complications of poor prosthetic load transmission."
"9263691","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common hospital acquired condition in patients with compromised compensatory mechanisms such as endothelial function. Consequences of AKI are several including longer hospital stay to increased risk of mortality. While prevention is feasible, it has remained elusive primarily because of the lack of a suitable marker to indicate who is at risk of developing AKI. The current clinical marker has a slow response (above 48 hrs) and misses the window of opportunity to intervene. Novel markers that can indicate kidney injury are becoming available with faster response (4 to 8 hours after insult). It is believed that physiological markers such as blood flow and oxygenation may be sensitive to changes even earlier. We have a long standing interest in evaluating renal oxygenation and its consequences to different disease mechanisms, primarily using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For AKI, we have demonstrated an animal model which is useful in studying the effects of iodinated contrast media, a well-known cause of renal injury in at-risk subjects. Our recent findings indicate that renal oxygenation changes happen almost in real time with the administration of iodinated contrast and these changes are indicative of renal injury as documented by one of the novel injury markers at 4 hours following contrast administration. This is the earliest known marker of risk of developing AKI. In the proposed study, we will validate a surrogate marker of renal medullary oxygenation that would allow for translating the findings to humans. This is based on measuring urine pO2. We will also extend our findings to- date to optimize the dose of preventive interventions and establish threshold values of hypoxia index that indicates risk of developing AKI, to generalize the findings to other animal models susceptible to iodinated contrast induced AKI. Ability to identify who is at higher risk of developing AKI following procedures such as coronary angiogram or computed tomography where iodinated contrast is used or in patients undergoing cardiac surgery will be of immense significance both in terms of improving outcomes, reducing costs and mortality."

"9248328","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal for a midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research for Dr. Gregory Lucas, Associate Professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Dr. Lucas is medically trained as an infectious diseases specialist and he completed a PhD in clinical investigation at the Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2004. His research career focuses on interventions to improve access to care and outcomes among injection drug users (IDUs), and on chronic kidney disease, a common HIV-related comorbidity that is especially prevalent among IDUs. Injection drug use remains an important mode of HIV transmission worldwide, is a consistent barrier to optimal HIV treatment outcomes, and is a risk factor for medical comorbidity and early mortality. The objective of this proposal is to support a program for mentoring junior investigators and for fostering innovative research. This grant discusses two active research platforms that will serve as a framework for engaging trainees in HIV-related patient-focused research. First, Dr. Lucas is PI of kidney disease cohort designed to assess the roles of HIV, hepatitis C, and active drug use on kidney and cardiovascular disease in a cohort of HIV-infected and HIV-negative subjects. This study includes longitudinal measurements of iohexol clearance (a gold-standard measure of glomerular filtration rate), surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease, and the opportunity to assess putative mechanisms and novel biomarkers through stored specimens. Second, Dr. Lucas is co-PI of a cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of IDU-friendly integrated care centers (ICCs) in India. After baseline data collection and stratification, 12 IDU-prevalent sites in India will be randomized to ICC or control. In the 6 ICC sites, IDU- oriented non-governmental organizations will be scaled-up to provide free HIV testing and on-site ART, in addition to counseling and risk reduction services. After 2 years of service delivery, community-level outcomes will be evaluated with respondent-driven sampling surveys of 1,000 IDUs in each experimental and control site. In addition to these research platforms, Dr. Lucas proposes plans to assist the entry of junior investigators into HIV clinical research through a major commitment to the Johns Hopkins Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) and through his role as kidney disease working group director in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA ACCORD). The outstanding environment for HIV research at Johns Hopkins is a key backdrop to this proposal. Dr. Lucas's training, experience, and career goals are well- suited to the objectives of the K24 award."
"9325805","Craniofacial defects are the second most common birth defect in the United States. A better understanding of the normal developmental processes that occur during craniofacial development is crucial. The neural crest is a vertebrate unique population of cells during development that gives rise to a diverse set of lineages, including craniofacial cartilage. Neural crest specification is controlled by a cascade of regulatory interactions between transcription factors, referred to as the neural crest specification gene regulatory network (GRN). Transcription factor activating protein 2 alpha (TFAP2A) is a key member of this GRN. Mutations in TFAP2A cause Branchio-occulo-facial syndrome (BOFS), which presents with cleft lip and or palate. The objective of my proposal is to dissect the regulatory interactions surrounding tfap2a in the neural crest specification GRN, using zebrafish as a model organism. First, I propose to dissect the cis-regulatory mechanisms used to control tfap2a expression in the neural crest. I hypothesize that pax, tcf, and tfap2 transcription factors act at an enhancer of tfap2a to activate its expression in the neural crest. To test this hypothesis, I propose the use of in vivo reporter assays to find enhancers of tfap2a. I will identify the necessary transcription factors by mutation of binding sites and in vivo reporter assays in loss of function backgrounds. I will use CRISPR/cas9 to delete the enhancer in zebrafish to determine its necessity for tfap2a expression in the neural crest. Second, I propose to identify the essential targets of tfap2a in the neural crest specification GRN. I hypothesize that sox10 and sox9b are the critical targets necessary for neural crest specification. To test this hypothesis, I propose loss of function and gain of function studies. I will analyze the craniofacial structures and gene expression changes in each of these paradigms. From these data, I will infer the relationships within this GRN. Finally, I propose to study the cis-regulatory mechanisms used for tfap2a to activate sox9b. These studies will reveal, in detail, connections in the neural crest specification GRN that are currently missing and further give a better understanding of the genetic underlying of the very early steps of craniofacial development."

The YIITP combines rigorous research training in a highly collaborative, interactive environment with a thorough academic program of instruction in immunology, microbiology, and related disciplines. The program offers training in virtually all aspects of immunology as well as host-pathogen interactions and a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Areas of particular strength include innate immune recognition and function, lymphocyte development, immunological tolerance and memory, antigen presentation, immune cell signaling, the immune response to infectious organisms, vascular endothelial cells, cancer immunology, and autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The 35 YIITP mentors, who have primary appointments in 8 different Yale departments, have an outstanding record of research accomplishment and training and many are leaders in their fields. The YIITP is overseen by the Program Director, David Schatz, and an Executive Committee of four additional faculty members. The principal training entity is the Department of Immunobiology, whose graduate program was the top ranked immunology graduate program in the United States in a 2010 National Research Council study. All students admitted to the YIITP have at least a Bachelor's degree in a relevant field and enter via application to the Yale interdepartmental program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS). Postdocs enter from the labs of YIITP faculty, and hold a Ph.D. and/or M.D. degree. Predoctoral training leading to the Ph.D. degree involves formal course work in Immunology and other areas of biology, research rotations, teaching, and the qualifying exam in the first two years, with dissertation research beginning late in year one and becoming the primary focus of activity after completion of the qualifying exam. Postdoctoral training focuses intensively on research in the laboratory of one or more of the mentors. Both predoctoral and postdoctoral training are enriched by intensive training in the methods, logic, and responsible conduct of research, and by the many opportunities for collaboration and interaction. The vast majority of YIITP trainees go on obtain independent research and teaching positions at academic institutions or research positions in biotechnology companies. Extensive efforts are made by YIITP mentors and Yale Graduate and Medical Schools to attract and retain trainees from diverse backgrounds, particularly under-represented minority groups. This proposal requests continued support for 10 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral trainees who will be supported by this grant for a maximum of 2 years. A major recent improvement in the program comes in the form of full institutional support from Yale for first year graduate students, allowing YIITP funding to be restricted to 2nd and 3rd year students."
"9250805","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Newborn infants are highly susceptible to lung infection and inflammation. In preterm infants, infection prevents normal lung development and leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Term newborns are also at risk, with bacterial pneumonia a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality both in the U.S. and worldwide. In older children and adults, a specialized innate immune system protects the lung from pathogens and injury related to infection. While innate immunity in the newborn lung is clearly diminished, we do not yet clearly understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms putting these populations at risk. Identifying these key mechanisms will allow development of new therapies for preventing and treating neonatal disease. In the lung, macrophages are the key immune cell responsible for ingesting and removing particles, killing pathogens, recruiting additional immune cells, and promoting healing following injury. However, the role of macrophages in newborn lung innate immunity has been uncharacterized. Our previous work demonstrated using innovative mouse models that macrophages populate the fetal lung from the earliest stages of lung formation. These fetal lung macrophages are capable of responding to microbial substances well before they would be expected to have contact with the external environment. We also showed that macrophage activation was required and sufficient for causing inflammation in the fetal lung. In addition, fetal lung macrophage activation was the key initial step in inflammation-mediated arrest in lung development. Subsequent work in our lab showed macrophage derived IL-1ß plays a key role in inhibiting normal epithelial-mesenchymal integrations during lung morphogenesis. However, multiple expression and function of multiple components of the macrophage immune response appear to be developmentally regulated, with increased expression in more mature lungs. We therefore hypothesize that developmental maturation of lung macrophages determines how the inflammatory response causes lung disease. To test our hypothesis, we propose complementary approaches to better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating normal lung macrophage maturation and differentiation. We will also test how exposure of developing macrophages to activating stimuli not only generates an inflammatory response but also alters the normal transcriptional program controlling macrophage differentiation and maturation. Because early activation appears to accelerate cell maturation, we will test how premature maturation affects macrophage cell biology. These experiments will identify key basic mechanisms regulating how the lung innate immune system develops in both normal and disease settings. Our findings will therefore lay the foundation for future translational and therapeutic discovery and applications to improve pediatric health."
"9235153","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Menisci are fibrocartilaginous tissues situated between the femoral condyles and the tibial plateau that are essential for normal biomechanical function of the knee. Meniscal injuries are a significant clinical problem as each year 850,000 meniscal surgeries occur in the United States and nearly twice as many worldwide. Tears, particularly in the avascular inner zone, do not heal well even with suturing or conservative treatments and frequently require menisectomy, which ultimately leads to the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), have been measured in injured and degenerative joints. In addition, we have shown that IL-1 significantly decreases repair strength, cell proliferation, and tissue formation at the interface of an in vitro meniscal repair model system. Tissue engineering strategies that use a combination of cells, biomaterials, and biologically active molecules to promote tissue repair have shown some success but fail under inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the novel combination of gene therapy and tissue     engineering in this application could harness the power of the reparative cells to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs during the repair process. Our primary goal is to develop combined tissue engineering and gene therapy treatments that will promote meniscal repair in the pro-inflammatory environment after meniscal injury. The central hypothesis for this project is that viral mediated drug delivery of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) from reparative cells in  biological matrix will promote integrative meniscal repair following injury. The primary goal will be accomplished by testing the central hypothesis with the following specific aims:          Specific Aim 1: Develop a cell and matrix based tissue engineering treatment to promote in vitro     integrative meniscal repair. We will use our novel in vitro model of integrative repair of the meniscus. In this model, two concentric and adjacent meniscal explants naturally exhibit interfacial repair over several weeks of culture in vitro. We will fill the repair interface with various acellular biological matrices, including type I collagen or fibrin. In addition, mesenchyma stem cells (MSCs) or chondrogenically differentiated MSCs will be seeded in the matrices and delivered to the repair interface. Meniscal repair will be assessed over 28 days in vitro by measuring the integrative shear strength of repair, visualization of the repair interface with safranin O and fast green histological staining and immunostaining for types I and II collagen and aggrecan. Microscopy will also be utilized to assess collagen structure and organization in the repair interface.          Specific Aim 2: Develop a combined gene therapy and tissue engineering treatment to promote in vitro integrative meniscal repair in the presence of IL-1. Using our in vitro model of integrative repair of the meniscus, we will directly transduce the injured meniscal tissue with lentivirus to deliver constitutively active or inducible enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or IL-1ra. As an alternative, we will transduce MSCs with the constitutive or inducible eGFP or IL-1ra and seed these cells in the repair interface. Non-transduced tissue or MSCs will serve as a control. In the presence of IL-1?, we will assess meniscal healing over 28 days by measuring shear strength of repair, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, nitric oxide (NO) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release, collagen degradation, and histology. IL-1ra production will be measured by ELISA and confocal microscopy will allow visualization of the eGFP transduced cells throughout culture.          Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the combined gene therapy and tissue engineering treatment in an in vivo longitudinal meniscal tear model. Using a porcine longitudinal tear model in the avascular inner region of the meniscus, we will assess meniscal repair in response to IL-1ra overexpression via lentiviral gene therapy. Meniscal tears will be treated with the combined gene therapy and tissue engineering treatment that resulted in the largest shear strength of repair in Specific Aim 2, the combined treatment expressing eGFP in lieu of IL-1ra as a control, or untreated. After 3 and 7 days confocal microscopy will be performed to track eGFP transduced cells. In the remaining animals, serum will be collected over time and twelve weeks post-operatively meniscal healing, osteoarthritis severity, and synovitis will be assessed by gross examination and histological grading. Serum and synovial fluid will be collected to assess biomarkers, including IL-1?, IL-1?, IL-1ra, TNF-?, IL-4, IL-     10, MMP activity, and collagen degradation.          The long-term goals of this study are to develop strategies to promote meniscal repair following joint injury and subsequently protect against the development of OA. Potential novel gene therapy and tissue engineering treatments identified in these studies could be translated to subsequent clinical trials in patients.          Relevance of the proposed work to United States public health and the VA patient care mission.     Meniscal injuries are highly relevant to the military and to the VA Health System. More than 100,000 meniscal injuries occurred in military personnel during the 1998-2006 period. Many meniscal injuries are treated by meniscectomies, and this procedure is almost invariably followed by osteoarthritis-degenerative arthritis in that joint, with resultant severe disability. Current methods of meniscal repair are clearly inadequate, and we need better approaches to this. Our studies of combined gene therapy and tissue engineering will lead to improvements in meniscal injury repair. They should result in better and faster recovery from meniscal injury and lead to a long-term decrease in secondary osteoarthritis for both active duty military personnel and military veterans."
"9346252","This SBIR Application is responsive to NHLBI Small Business Topics of Special Interest (therapeutics) that are of high programmatic interest (HL-16-332). Hemorrhage or bleeding is a serious or fatal complication of surgery. Antifibrinolytic agents that inhibit plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis can significantly reduce blood loss, emergency reoperation, morbidity and death in patients with severe hemorrhage. Antifibrinolytic agents have been reported to have value in cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, liver transplantation, vascular surgery, thoracic surgery, gynecological surgery, end-stage renal disease, peripartum bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, prostate surgery, neurosurgery, trauma, traumatic brain injury, intracerebral bleeding and subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, current antifibrinolytic agents have properties that limit their efficacy and may cause serious complications including: low potency, poor specificity, accumulation in renal disease and penetration of the blood brain barrier and placenta. Safer, more specific and potent antifibrinolytic agents may prevent thousands of deaths per year. To address this need, Translational Sciences, Inc. seeks to produce a safe, high-affinity, ultra- specific, antifibrinolytic monoclonal antibody as the first new agent to treat severe hemorrhage in more than 50 years. This novel antifibrinolytic acts as a non-competitive inhibitor and has greater specificity and potency than any known agent. It blocks fibrinolysis in human plasma with several thousand-fold greater potency than the currently used, small molecule antifibrinolytic agents such as epsilon amino caproic acid (EACA) or tranexamic acid. As a monoclonal antibody this antifibrinolytic is unlikely to cross the blood brain barrier, which avoids the risk of seizures associated with tranexamic acid. Also unlike tranexamic acid or EACA, this agent will not significantly cross the placenta, making it a more attractive agent for use in severe, pregnancy-associated hemorrhage. As a monoclonal antibody this agent will not be excreted by the kidney, making it a safer agent than tranexamic acid or EACA to use in patients that have, or are at risk for, kidney disease. By virtue of its exquisite potency and specificity, this antifibrinolytic agent has extraordinary potential for improving the treatment of severe and fatal bleeding. We project that, by comparison to currently available agents, this novel antifibrinolytic will significantly reduce the need for transfusions, reoperations and mortality in bleeding patients?without serious adverse events. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to follow FDA guidance to convert this potent monoclonal antibody into a humanized, first-in-class antifibrinolytic for the treatment of severe human hemorrhage."

"9277252","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanfilippo syndrome mucopolysaccharidosis type III; MPS III) is a devastating neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder of childhood for which there is presently no cure or effective treatment available. The fundamental cause of MPS III is an inherited mutation in one of the 4 enzymes required to catabolize heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan which plays important structural and functional roles in the brain and elsewhere. Each type of MPS III (A through D) is due to deficiency of a different enzyme in the HS breakdown pathway. We now propose to develop an enzyme replacement treatment (ERT) for MPS III that will ameliorate or reverse the catastrophic and fatal neurologic decline caused by this disease. As the symptoms of MPS III are largely localized to the brain any effective MPS III treatment must therefore gain access to the brain. Therefore, our strategy proposes to deliver recombinant human alpha-N- acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (rhGNS) intrathecally (into the spinal fluid) to effectively treat the underlying causes of the neurologic symptoms that dominate MPS III pathology. Phase I development met or exceeded all milestones. In this Phase II proposal, we will perform in vivo proof-of-principle studies using a novel MPS III mouse model and perform process development for scalable production and purification of rhGNS for preclinical and clinical development. Following successful completion of this phase II proposal, our therapy will be ready for pre-IND studies."
"9300955","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety is among the most common concerns in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who seek mental health services, causing suffering and family stress and exacerbating social disability. Cognitive- Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a promising treatment for anxiety in children with high-functioning ASD, but the neural mechanisms supporting response to this treatment have not been studied. We will investigate the neural-systems-level targets of CBT for anxiety in children with ASD by evaluating brain indices of socio- emotional functioning with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after treatment. CBT teaches emotion regulation skills, such as cognitive reappraisal, followed by behavioral exposure to anxiety- provoking situations. Because the goal of CBT is to replace automatic emotional reactivity with more controlled processing, we hypothesize that CBT aimed at the reduction of anxiety will enhance the neural circuitry that subserves the experience and regulation of emotions. This is a randomized controlled trial of CBT vs. Psychoeducation and Supportive Therapy (PST) in 100 school-age children with high-functioning ASD and moderate to severe anxiety. In addition, 50 matched typically-developing (TD) children will be scanned twice with a 16-week interval to enable interpretation of change in brain function in children with ASD after CBT vs. PST relative to TD children. CBT for anxiety will be provided using a structured manual that has been modified for children with ASD by increasing parental participation and addressing the role of core ASD symptoms in the experience and expression of anxiety. Subjects will be comprehensively characterized with regard to ASD diagnosis, IQ, adaptive behavior, and comorbid psychopathology. Primary measures of clinical outcomes will include the clinician-rated Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale completed by an independent evaluator who will be blind to treatment assignment. Functional MRI will be collected as the subjects perform tasks involving emotion regulation, emotional face perception, biological motion perception, and resting state. We hypothesize that a positive response to CBT vs. PST, will be associated with increased activation of ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices and increased amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity during emotion regulation, along with reduced amygdala activation during emotional face perception. We will also examine the moderating effects of fMRI biomarkers of social functioning in ASD on response to CBT, and explore the utility of resting state fMRI in developing biomarkers of treatment response. This study will contribute to the understanding of the neuro circuitry of anxiety in ASD by 1) comparing children with ASD and anxiety to typically developing controls and 2) examining the association of reduction in anxiety after CBT vs. PST with changes in brain activity. Consistent with the IACC Strategic Plan for ASD Research, understanding of neural mechanisms will inform treatment of anxiety in ASD and improve the ability to select patients who are likely to benefit from CBT toward the goal of personalized care."
"9391433","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is a trans-filament protein which, at its N'-region, connects thick and thin filaments to regulate cardiac contractility. The overall objective of the studies contained in this renewal of R01HL-105826 is to define the N'-region of cMyBP-C as a critical regulator of cardiac contractility. In particular, C0-C1f, which interacts only with actin, is generated by proteolysis of cMyBP-C during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and heart failure. On the other hand, C0-C2 interacts with both actin and myosin, connecting thin and thick filaments to regulate sarcomere function. On the basis of these findings, we will 1) use a novel transgenic mouse model expressing cMyBP-C (cMyBP-C110kDa) in which the C0-C1f region was ablated to study the necessity and sufficiency of this domain in regulating cardiac contractility and 2) use adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated expression of (i) recombinant C0-C2 to determine the sufficiency of N'-terminal C0-C2 in bundling thick and thin filaments in vivo and (ii) recombinant C0-C2?CTS, in which the calpain-targeted site (CTS) has been ablated, to determine its therapeutic potential in improving cardiac function pre- and post-I/R injury. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of cMyBP-C and, in turn, its impact on sarcomere structure and function, are largely unknown. Our short-term goal is to elucidate the specific role(s) of the N'-region of cMyBP-C in the regulation of cardiac function, whereas our long-term goal is to determine the mechanisms by which cMyBP-C stabilizes sarcomeric structure and function, thereby conferring cardioprotection during I/R injury.  SPECIFIC AIM 1 will test the hypothesis that the C0-C1f domain of cMyBP-C, which is cleaved and released during I/R injury, is necessary for regulating cardiac function. Transgenic cMyBP-C110kDa mice will be used to determine the critical role of the N'-region of cMyBP-C at the sarcomere and whole-heart levels, compared to the control non-transgenic mice. SPECIFIC AIM 2 will test the hypothesis that the C0-C2 domains of cMyBP-C are sufficient to bundle thick and thin filaments and to regulate normal cardiac function. AAV9-mediated expression of recombinant C0-C2 will be used to prevent or rescue contractile dysfunction in mouse models that lack either the N'-region (C0-C1f) or full-length cMyBP-C in vivo. SPECIFIC AIM 3 will test the hypothesis that expression of recombinant C0-C2?CTS in vivo confers cardioprotection during I/R injury. Recombinant C0-C2?CTS protein is protected from calpain-mediated degradation. We expect AAV9-mediated expression of recombinant C0-C2?CTS to significantly reduce infarct size and apoptosis, as well as preserve contractile function during I/R injury. Together, these studies will determine the necessity and sufficiency of the N'-region (both C0-C1f and C0-C2) of cMyBP-C to regulate cardiac function, and, hence, provide therapy for myocardial injury and heart failure occurring during I/R injury."
"9260712","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) Rasopathy patients are predisposed to macrocephaly and to enlarged white matter tracts. NF1 patient brains also have abnormal bright spots on imaging, possibly representing abnormal myelin. We hypothesized that white matter alteration contributes to the cognitive, behavior and/or motor/sensory deficits that are common features of NF1 patients. We genetically engineered mice with Nf1 mutant brain oligodendrocytes and found that they have aberrant myelin and enlarged white matter tracts. Remarkably, altered signaling in oligodendrocytes also resulted in non-cell autonomous effects leading to increased permeability of the critical blood brain barrier. The Nf1 protein, neurofibromin, is an off signal for Ras GTPases, and mice with elevated Ras-GTP had the same cellular phenotypes as Nf1 mutants and were hyperactive. Downstream of Ras, loss of Nf1 in oligodendrocytes caused high reactive nitrogen species and most cellular abnormalities were reversed by anti-oxidant or nitric oxide synthase inhibition. These new models provide a unique opportunity to study oligodendrocyte effects on brain function, and regulation of the BBB. We plan a multi-faceted approach based on a collaborative team with specialized skills. In Aim 1, we will use a new flow cytometry (FACS) approach and mouse genetics to delineate signaling pathways that cause high ROS/NO in oligodendrocytes, because identified pathways should be relevant therapeutic targets in Rasopathy patients. In Aim 2, we will test if oligodendrocytes contribute to behavioral changes in NF1, as in the Ras mice we studied, and genetically define the critical NOS enzyme. In Aim 3, we will compare brains in which all brain cells or only oligodendrocytes have mutations in Nf1 using cell-type specific control of activity (optogenetics), advanced imaging (whole-brain functional MRI of awake mice) and electrophysiology. These studies will define aspects of brain structure, impulse conduction and changes at the level of brain cell populations in functional connectivity mediated by oligodendrocytes. They will also begin to identify how oligodendrocyte NO signaling contributes to cognitive and motor/sensory function, and to homeostasis of the blood brain barrier. We aim to provide preclinical support for human Rasopathy therapies that can be tested using imaging endpoints we identify."
"9269614","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sickle cell trait (SCT) affects over 1 in 12 African Americans in the United States and nearly 300 million people worldwide. Although SCT has largely been considered a benign condition, emerging evidence suggests that acute and chronic sickling in the setting of low oxygen tension or stress may lead to clinical complications in affected carriers. In particular, the hypoxic environment of the renal medulla appears to induce local red blood cell sickling, ultimately resulting in vascular damage and chronic kidney disease (CKD). A similar process may also occur in the hypoxic venous system of the body, leading to coagulation activation and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The risk of both CKD and VTE appears to be higher in African Americans compared to other populations; therefore SCT may be an important and unrecognized genetic modifier of disease in this population. Dr. Naik is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Hematology at Johns Hopkins whose long-term aspiration is to become an independent investigator in sickle cell trait with the goal of developing evidence-based screening, genetic counseling, and treatment guidelines for affected individuals. The overall aims of her proposal are to elucidate the potential complications of SCT and to determine the impact of SCT on CKD and VTE risk in African Americans. She will first perform a rigorous systematic review of the published literature to identify important clinicl complications related to SCT, determine the strength of the existing literature, and identify gaps in current knowledge. Using advanced epidemiologic techniques, she will then analyze data from well-characterized cohorts with large numbers of African-American participants to characterize the risk of CKD and VTE in individuals with SCT. This research will contribute critical knowledge about the complications of SCT and will provide framework for future epidemiologic, translational, and treatment studies in SCT. In addition, with the support of this K08 Mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Naik will integrate a well-rounded, multi-disciplinary mentorship team, a focused training plan, and an innovative research strategy to ensure her successful transition to an independent investigator."
"9311486","We propose the first comprehensive characterization of sequence space around an ancestral protein. This work will 1) characterize the effects on function of all possible mutations and pairs of mutations across the protein's entire length and of all possible combinations of mutations at a key subset of sites, 2) illuminate how the distribution of function through this multidimensional sequence space would have affected the processes of protein evolution (a key goal in molecular evolution), and 3) quantify the complete set of main-effect and epistatic genetic determinants of DNA specificity in a transcription factor and elucidate their biochemical causes ? an important goal for protein biochemistry and molecular gene regulation. We use the steroid hormone receptor DNA-binding domain as an ideal model system, because it is of great biomedical importance; it is experimentally and phylogenetically tractable; and its specificity for DNA targets diversified through a well-understood evolutionary process, with a known set of historical mutations and biophysical mechanisms. The proposed work will reveal why this history occurred relative to the many other mutational trajectories the protein could have taken as it evolved its new specificity. With the map of sequence space in hand, we will then apply locus-specific, replicated experimental evolution to the ancestral protein, placing it under strong selection to explore sequence space and evolve the same novel specificity that it acquired during historical evolution. By identifying commonalities and differences among the historical trajectory, experimental evolution trajectories, and the many other possible pathways through sequence space, we will gain fundamental insight into the roles of contingency and determinism in evolution and illuminate underlying mechanistic factors that caused those phenomena. Specific questions include: how many ways were there to evolve the derived DNA specificity, and how many were accessible under selection and drift? Did the historical outcome evolve because it was the optimal genotype, because it was the best or only accessible genotype, or simply due to chance? If more optimal genotypes exist, what prevented the evolving protein from reaching them? To what extent must new specificities evolve through promiscuous intermediates, and how many mutations does it take to evolve a new specificity? We will also characterize sequence space and experimental evolutionary trajectories around ancient receptors that existed at different times during history; this will reveal how the protein's evolvability and robustness fluctuated over evolutionary time due to epistatically acting mutations. Finally, by fully characterizing the main and epistatic genetic determinants of the protein's DNA specificity, we will identify common biophysical mechanisms that underlie DNA recognition, contributing to an important goal in molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, and development. The methods and conceptual tools we develop will be applicable to studying other transcription factors and the evolution of many other protein families."

"9280319","Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (D/HH) scientists constitute an underrepresented group in the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research workforce. Due to its strong commitment to the postsecondary education of D/HH students, the Rochester Institution of Technology (RIT), attracts a significant D/HH population ? more than 1400 RIT students identify as being DHH (7% of the student body). While the freshman retention rate and the six-year graduation rate is comparable between hearing and D/HH students, only 22 D/HH RIT undergraduate students (or an estimated 11 students over 5 years) went on to graduate school in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research fields during the past 10 years. Based on a national average of 26% of graduate school enrollment in Ph.D. programs, we project that, over a 5-year period without intervention, only 3 D/HH RIT graduates (26% of 11) would enter biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research Ph.D. programs. To counter this trend, at program capacity, the proposed RIT-RISE Scientists-in-Training Program for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Undergraduates (RIT-RISE) will support 15 Pre-RISE D/HH freshmen and 17 D/HH RISE Scholars (6 sophomores, 6 juniors, and 5 seniors) annually. Over 5 years, we expect that 25 RISE Scholars will graduate and that at least 12 (approximately half) will gain admission into Ph.D. programs in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research disciplines within three years of graduation. These 12 D/HH doctoral students in 5 years would represent a minimum 4- fold increase over the estimated pre-RISE levels. RIT-RISE aims to address diminished career awareness/expectations of D/HH undergraduates as well as the consequences resulting from limited access to information from their environments, through a ?scientist-in-training? series that will focus on career awareness, professional development, self-efficacy, test- taking, and leadership competencies. RIT-RISE will provide intensive research training that will include: five new research skills-building courses, three years of mentored research experience, and opportunities for RISE Scholars to attend national conferences, present locally and nationally, and engage in a capstone project that could lead to publication. An Individual Development Plan for Research Training based on targeted core competencies necessary for admissions into Ph.D. programs will serve as the foundational blueprint for each RISE Scholar's RISE program. Enhanced advising/monitoring services will assure that each RISE student has the academic and psychosocial support necessary for success. RIT-RISE will also offer cultural competency training to intramural and extramural research faculty that focuses on the unique linguistic and cultural needs of D/HH Scholars. The project will also conduct a communication access study of the research labs to assure that D/HH Scholars have access to the lab environment. To address a need for specialized translation in English and American Sign Language unique to biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research laboratory settings, RIT will also develop and offer a new course for students and professionals that focuses on interpreting in lab environments. RIT-RISE will be evaluated through diagnostic, formative and summative approaches, to track and address project progress, challenges, and adjustments. Findings and best practices will be disseminated nationally to other institutions and training programs working with aspiring D/HH scientists."
"9256528","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury-triggered renarrowing (restenosis) of arteries treated with angioplasty to relieve atherosclerotic obstruction remains a challenge due to a lack of therapies combining adequate efficacy and safety. Strategies aimed at accelerated vascular healing and endothelium regeneration have potential to prevent restenosis while avoiding the side effects of the currently used therapies. However, in order to realize this potential a significant improvement in their efficiency is required. This proposal is concerned with an integrated drug-in-cell antirestenotic strategy based on dual functionalization of endothelial cell with drug-loaded magnetic nanocarriers to provide them with capacity for stent-targeted delivery and enhanced antirestenotic effectiveness. The latter is achieved by inducing and activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase with estradiol formulated in magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) in the form of its precursor, estradiol benzoate (E2Bz). The present studies will establish feasibilit of using this approach for preventing in-stent restenosis and achieving facilitated reendothelialization in a validated rat model of atherosclerosis reproducing key features of human disease .The following specific aims will be addressed: AIM 1: Drug-in-cell approach evaluation and optimization in culture and co-culture studies. E2Bz-loaded biodegradable MNP will be formulated, and their size, composition, magnetic properties and drug release profile will be characterized. Cell compatibility, internalization and degradation kinetics of MNP, as well as E2Bz-induced nitric oxide synthesis by MNP-functionalized endothelial cells and its growth inhibitory effect on co-cultured smooth muscle cells will be the main endpoints of the Aim 1 experiments. AIM 2: Targeting, reendothelialization and efficacy studies. Arterial localization, tissue distribution and endothelium recovery after magnetically targeted delivery of functionalized cells will be studied in the rat atherosclerosis/ carotid stenting model. The extent of restenosis will be determined two weeks post-delivery by computerized morphometry, and the pharmacological effect of cell functionalization will be delineated using animals treated with cells loaded with blank MNP as controls."
"9321577","Project Summary Health challenges linked to human aging take a tremendous toll on our society. Physical and cognitive decline limit the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers. Aging is the major risk factor for, and possible cause of cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease, and thus struggle with debilitating disease is a common health burden for the aging population. Without question, the promotion of healthy aging with extended resistance to decline should be a major objective of current medical research. To investigate healthy aging, simple animals models such as the nematode C. elegans have been studied, providing molecular insights into the genes and chemical compound interventions that can modulate conserved aging processes likely to act similarly in humans. The goal of the proposed work is to continue, and expand, efforts of a co-operative scientific group involving three closely interacting laboratories who coordinately test pharmacological interventions for the ability to extend healthy aging and promote longevity in nematodes. A specific emphasis of this integrated super-group is to test promising drugs on a collection of natural variants of the Caenorhabditis genus, which together represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population. The idea is that treatments that confer positive outcomes across a diverse population will have an increased chance of being efficacious in higher organisms and will be suggested as priority interventions for testing in pre-clinical mouse studies and possibly future human trials. The emphasis of this CITP Buck proposal is to report on progress in testing compounds and our proposed workflow as we open the CITP to the general biomedical community. Overall, we will participate in a unique team project that has the power to define pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population, with implications for development of therapies that promote healthy human aging."
"9331733","ABSTRACT Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea. OSA affects an estimated 18-40 million adults and 0.7-3% of all children in the US. OSA results in tiredness, depression and fatigue, and has several associated common comorbidities. It is believed that over 80% of OSA remains undiagnosed. The prevalence of OSA increases with age, and if untreated increases the risk of cardiac mortality as well as several comorbidities. An affordable, available, FDA-approved and easy-to-use over-the-counter OSA screening tool will allow greater screening of at-risk individuals, enabling a greater proportion of such individuals to seek treatment for their condition. The widespread availability of this device through drugstores and consumer health outlets will additionally allow underprivileged communities access to a high-quality screening tool for sleep apnea. Zansors has developed a bioengineered, semiconductor device that measures breathing and movement during sleep. It is a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.2 inch wireless package using four key technologies: (a) an adjustable microphone; (b) a 3-axis accelerometer; (c) embedded algorithms to measure sleep events; and (d) acrylic adhesive. The product is designed as a FDA-approved over-the-counter device that the patient can wear during sleep and wake up with a color score of red, yellow, or green depending on their sleep apnea risk status. The product features include home-based, easy-to-use, non-invasive, wireless, disposable, and low cost at less than $75, with easily understandable test results. A Phase I STTR award demonstrated that that this device can successfully screen for OSA in adults, with over 70% sensitivity and specificity against gold- standard polysomnography data. In this Phase II project, we will 1) implement Good Manufacturing Practice and quality systems control (ISO 13485); 2)develop and implement novel algorithms to detect hypopneas from sound and motion data ; 3)develop a wireless Bluetooth app that takes the wireless data from the wearable sensor and provides data visualizations on mobile devices ; and 4) validate our data and findings against home sleep testing and polysomnography in a clinical study at the University of Michigan Sleep Disorders Center. The worldwide OSA market will reach $8.4 billion by 2018. The marketplace currently does not have an affordable, easy-to-use over-the-counter home-based OSA screening device. Increasing awareness of OSA and its impact, and a strong unmet need in underserved populations favor market penetration. Partnerships with larger leading sleep treatment companies will help the sales and distribution of the Zansors product."

"9249086","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Resistant hypertension refers to patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension, generally defined as needing 3 or more blood pressure medications. It is a common medical disorder, affecting approximately 7-10 million Americans. Within this group of patients with resistant hypertension is a proportion of patients failing antihypertensive treatment in spite of maximum therapy. We propose referring to this antihypertensive treatment failure as refractory hypertension. In a preliminary analysis of our clinical experience over the last several years, we found that the prevalence of refractory hypertension was approximately 10% of patients initially referred for resistant hypertension. If generally true, this would translate int about 1 million Americans. Refractory hypertension has not been previously described. The current application is designed to test hypothesized mechanisms of antihypertensive treatment failure. In our initial analysis of this group of patients, we found evidence of increased sympathetic activity as an important contributing cause antihypertensive treatment failure. This hypothesized excess in adrenergic activity is suggested by higher resting heart rates and by higher levels of urinary norepinephrine levels compared to patients with controlled resistant hypertension. We will test for heightened sympathetic tone in this group of patients by prospectively comparing plasma norepinephrine levels in patients with refractory hypertension to patients with controlled resistant hypertension. We will also determine the antihypertensive benefit of blocking the effects of sympathetic activity with an agent that provides both alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockade. Persistent intravascular fluid retention has been shown by us and other investigators to be a common cause of resistant hypertension. To what extent refractory hypertension is volume dependent is unknown. In a second series of experiments, we will test the hypothesis that persistent fluid retention contributes importantly to the development of refractory hypertension by comparing cardiac volumes, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging, in patients with refractory versus controlled resistant hypertension. In a second experiment, will compare the antihypertensive benefit of dietary salt restriction in patients with refractory hypertension versus control patients, to determine to what extent salt sensitivity contributes to antihypertensive treatment failure. Lastly, obstructive sleep apnea is extremely common in patients with resistant hypertension and is thought to contribute to difficulty controlling blood pressure. The role that untreated sleep apnea plays in causing refractory hypertension is unknown. The third objective of this application is to determine the prevalence of moderate/severe obstructive sleep apnea in patients with refractory hypertension compared to patients with controlled resistant hypertension. If poorly treated obstructive sleep apnea is common in patients with refractory hypertension, it will indicate an important and potentially reversible cause of antihypertensive treatment failure."
"9461357","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competing revised renewal application for continued support of an NHLBI (Lung Division) Post-Doctoral Training Grant, which is currently in its 30th year in the University of Michigan Medical School, Department of Pathology. The aim of this program is to provide in-depth training in basic research to individuals that have successfully completed MD, PhD, or DVM degrees. The research areas of focus include lung inflammation (mediators and regulators), complement, apoptosis, DNA repair, epigenetics, immunopathology (including the roles of oxidants, proteases, cytokines, and chemokines), and cell biology. The pathogenesis of a number of pulmonary diseases are emphasized in our training program such as sepsis (ARDS), fibrosis, and asthma. Since inception, the program was originally led by Professor Peter A. Ward for 25 years. Dr. Nicholas Lukacs took over as director in the previous training grant cycle, from year 26-30. This experimental pathology program has extended to strong investigators in other departments throughout the University of Michigan Medical Center, including Pediatric pulmonary, adult pulmonary and Microbiology/Immunology. In this renewal we have further expanded the scope, adding not only new faculty trainers, but also the scientific expertise that will allow our program to examine epigenetic control of the inflammatory and pathogenic responses during lung disease. This expansion will serve to strengthen and enhance the training program. Trainees are able to interact easily between laboratories due to the close collaborative interactions between preceptors, further enhancing collaborative and training experiences. This program has had the distinction of training an impressive number of post-doctoral researchers, M.D. and Ph.D. that have gone onto strong academic and research careers. Over the past 10 years of the program we have had success recruiting outstanding trainees whom have gone onto academic careers. The setting of this program in the context of a large and diverse academic medical center provides special advantages to trainees related to relevant research endeavors of the preceptors that are closely linked to clinical disease. This latter aspect of translational researc effort in the Department of Pathology is central to the efforts at the Medical School. Thus, this T32 has a proven record of training researchers and will continue to successfully train post-doctoral fellows in research related to lung diseases that affect large numbers of patients."
"9246341","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults."
"9344815","Project Summary/Abstract  Radiation therapy is one of the primary therapeutic techniques for treating cancer. Nearly two-thirds of all cancer patients will receive radiation therapy during their illness, with an average of 29 radiation treatment episodes. Although largely effective, radiation therapy, like other forms of cancer treatment, has difficulty killing hypoxic regions within solid tumors.  Cellular hypoxia is associated with radiotherapy resistance, resulting in the incomplete killing of cancer cells, and leading to recurrence and relapse. Thus, developing techniques to target the hypoxic core of tumors is a major goal of cancer research. Nearly 40% of all breast cancers and 50% of locally advanced breast cancers are hypoxic, and their altered metabolism is strongly linked to resistance to radiotherapy and systemic therapy. In prostate cancer, hypoxia is associated with early biochemical relapse after radiotherapy and also with local recurrence in the prostate gland.  A variety of approaches are being used to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy and reduce dose. These include the use of nanoparticles to enhance the radiosensitization of tumor tissue, reversing radiation resistance in tumor tissue, and increasing the radioresistance of healthy tissue.  In this proposed effort, we will develop a new technique that enhances radiation treatment by using a sensitizer that both increases the energy deposited locally within the tumor and generates UV photons in the vicinity of the DNA in cancer cells. Our sensitizer consists of scintillating nanoparticles that emit UV radiation, capable of both directly damaging the DNA in hypoxic cancer cells. In addition, these particles will be composed of high atomic number elements with much higher radiation stopping power than the low atomic number elements that make up tissue. This will enhance the efficacy of the high-energy X-rays used in radiation treatment by down converting the X-ray photon energy into lower energy X-rays and particles, which have a much higher energy deposition rate (linear energy transfer, LET). We have performed a preliminary experiment, which gave encouraging results showing an increase in cell death using the LuPO4 scintillating nanoparticles.  In Phase I of this effort, we will model photon transport and energy conversion, for both X-rays and UV photons, and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the concept in vitro. In Phase II, we will develop size homogenous nanoparticles suitable for use in exhaustive in vitro cell experiments and preclinical studies."
"9294307","Project Summary Epithelial cells form a physical and biochemical barrier against the vast number of microbes inhabiting the gut. Secretion of mucus and antimicrobial peptides by epithelial cells enhance barrier function and shape the composition of the microbiota. Intestinal epithelial cells also monitor lumenal microbes and transmit information to underlying immune cells to shape mucosal immunity. Within the collective epithelium there are six specialized subsets of cells, including tuft cells. Previously, the function of tuft cells was unknown until our group and two others reported their role in parasite response and mucosal immunity. The mechanistic basis of parasite recognition by tuft cells is poorly understood, as both the receptors and microbial agonists are unknown. To close this knowledge gap, this proposal will build on our observation that tuft cells utilize taste-chemosensation to respond to parasite infections. First, we will identify the taste-chemosensory receptors that detect parasites. In parallel we determine the microbial agonists that stimulate tuft cell taste chemosensation. Using next-generation sequencing and gnotobiotic mice, this study will disentangle the role of the parasite-altered microbiome from direct stimulation of tuft cells by parasites and their products. This project will yield valuable information on specific interactions between tuft cell receptors and their agonists thereby expanding the understanding of taste receptors as novel intestinal microbial recognition receptors. Tuft cells and taste-chemosensation are fundamentally new form of microbial detection in the gut and represent a promising area to develop future therapies targeting intestinal inflammatory disease. In addition the data, training, and knowledge obtained from this proposal are critical for my continued development as an independent investigator."
"9271120","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competing renewal application for a Global Infectious Disease Training Program aims to enhance tropical infectious disease research capacity in Peru by focusing on research disciplines and diseases relevant to the Amazon region of Peru. The leadership and faculty of Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) and Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana (UNAP) have systematically delineated research priorities for this program in the next project period. This training program will continu to emphasize degree granting programs-MS and PhD) at UPCH and UNAP, and supplemented by diverse short- and medium-term training of postdoctoral scholars, students (undergraduate, post-baccalaureate), nurses, and technicians. The program explicitly understands that research capacity at UPCH and UNAP differs, and that UPCH has an important leadership opportunity to leverage its achievements to enhance UNAP's research success in Iquitos, Peru, while continuing to advance its institutional priorities in Lima. Sustainability is a key priority of this proposed renewal, with emphasis on grant and manuscript writing. Submission of new grant applications to newly available governmental funding opportunities in Peru is an important priority. The new project period proposes to emphasize recruitment on new trainees from underrepresented groups in Peru particularly in the Amazon region (via UNAP). With new and ongoing NIH-funded and Peruvian government-funded research projects focused on malaria and leptospirosis, this training program is designed to build upon past capacity building success to bring laboratory- and field-based research capacity in-country in Peru. The general scientific infrastructure and environment created by the current research projects will explicitly be leveraged to other diseases areas of articulated local priorit. Training in Peru (Lima, Iquitos/Amazon region) training will be the primary activities, supplemented by training of a small number of highly selected candidates for either short- or long-term training at the University in California (San Diego and Davis). Such training will be explicitly targeted at prioritized areas (i.e not available in Peru) by the UPCH and UNAP faculty-based Executive Committee. The new project period will include specific new areas of emphasis, including short-, medium- and long-term training in the following: medical entomology, laboratory animal science, pathogen genomics and bioinformatics, cell biology/microscopy techniques and innovative data management). A highly qualified faculty with international reputations has been assembled at UPCH in Lima and at the University of California (San Diego and Davis), supplemented by microbial bioinformatics from the J. Craig Venter Institute, which will be coordinated by the program leadership. Motivated scientists in the context of excellent research facilities at UNAP in Iquitos will leverage the UPCH and international faculty to advance research capacity building in Iquitos. Our goals are summarized as the advancement of two key institutions in Peru by developing the next generation of scientists for leadership in the international scientific community as well as in their home country."
"9275525","Project Summary Fluorescence signal level, photobleaching and phototoxicity are major problems encountered ubiquitously in live fluorescence microscopy applications. Because of limited of fluorophore signals, long term monitoring of live cells presents a major challenge to existing fluorescent microscopy technologies. Not only does low signal level affect detection precision over the auto-fluorescence background, the associated photobleaching and phototoxicity also restrict the temporal resolution and observation duration. Inspired by the recent development of the SunTag, we propose to develop a protein labeling scheme using split-fluorescent proteins. By arranged them into tandem arrays and demonstrated proportional signal amplification. This signal amplification can not only solve the signal strength challenge, but also reduce photobleaching / phototoxicity by correspondingly lowering the excitation intensity. Specifically, we plan to develop split-FP tags for multicolor imaging and apply it to live cell imaging of chromosome organization."
"9346988","Multiple myeloma (MM) is a debilitating and currently incurable hematological malignancy. While the median survival has increased to 5 ? 7 years, MM patients ultimately relapse and become resistant to therapy. Once they reach this stage, it is often a trial and error process until an effective therapy can be found. Furthermore, the MM bone marrow tumor microenvironment plays a significant role in disease progression and resistance to therapy. There is a critical need for a clinical tool able to predict therapeutic response to drugs for specific patients. We have developed an ex vivo microfluidic platform, MicroC3?, that can rapidly analyze the therapeutic response of a patient?s MM cells to various drugs in coculture with their own microenvironmental cell components. When MicroC3 was initially tested by measuring the ex vivo toxicity responses of patient MM cells to bortezomib, a drug commonly used in MM therapy, MicroC3 responses could be segregated into two groups which retrospectively correctly identified all patients as either clinically responsive or non-responsive to bortezomib-containing therapies. We propose to develop and automate MicroC3 as a companion diagnostic for bortezomib, and other MM therapies. To achieve this project, Lynx Biosciences is uniquely positioned through four key collaborations: 1) Dr. Natalie Callander as a collaborator and Director of the University of Wisconsin Myeloma Clinical Program, 2) Professor David Beebe as an expert consultant and pioneer of simple microfluidic devices, 3) Salus Discovery, as a collaborator to develop an automated sample processing workflow, and 4) Microfluidic ChipShop, a manufacturing partner with years of experience in development and fabrication of microscale medical device platforms. The proposal consists of two aims: 1) To develop a GMP process for fabrication of injection molded MicroC3 devices, 2) To automate cell isolation, seeding, and treatment within MicroC3. At the conclusion of Phase I, we will have developed a large portion of the framework for the clinical rollout of the technology. We will have a reliable and robust process for both the fabrication and operation of the MicroC3 ready to handle the larger scale required for Phase II. Phase II will include a prospective clinical trial to test the predictive capabilities of MicroC3 by using the automated assay platform to segregate patients for therapy containing bortezomib and potentially other therapies. Ultimately, MicroC3 may be applied for use in reviving drugs which were not successful in late stage clinical trials, identifying potentially successful preclinical drugs prior to initiation of clinical trials, and hematological malignancies other than MM."
"9228569","Project Summary Interventions are urgently needed to improve the delivery and impact of mental health services for persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI) in prison. Treatments addressing the symptoms of mental illness form a critical component of the continuum of services needed by prisoners with SMI. However, a growing body of literature shows that mental health treatments need to be combined with treatments that directly address criminogenic risk factors (i.e., those factors most closely associated with criminal activities). Despite their promising evidence, interventions that address criminogenic risk factors, such as Thinking for a Change (T4C), are not used with prisoners with SMI because of the neurocognitive and social impairments associated with SMI. This R34 involves a 2-phase pilot study that examines the effectiveness of a criminogenic intervention that incorporates a modified delivery system designed specifically to address the unique needs of persons with SMI in prison. Phase 1 consists of an open trial (n=16) in which we will finalize the T4C-SMI treatment manual. In Phase 2, we will conduct a small-scale RCT (n=60) to explore the potential effectiveness of T4C-SMI towards improving impulsivity, criminal attitudes, and interpersonal problem solving (treatment targets) and levels of aggression, and the amount of behavioral infractions and time spent in administrative segregation in prison (outcomes). Phase 2 will also examine whether the treatment targets for T4C-SMI mediate the intervention's impact on outcomes. Our long-term goal is to grow the evidence-base for interventions with the capacity to improve prison and community-reentry outcomes for persons with SMI. This R34 project will provide the data needed to implement a rigorous RCT in a future study and supports NIMH's mission to develop innovative interventions in mental health services."
"9271970","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Redox biology is increasingly being recognized as a key signaling theme in the cellular physiology field. Research in redox biology is greatly hindered by the lack of methods for monitoring defined redox processes in cells and cell subdomains. This project addresses this technical issue by engineering genetically encoded redox biosensors that selectively report the localization and molecular dynamics of specific reactive oxygen species (ROS). The following four specific aims are pursued: 1. Develop genetically encoded superoxide (O2?-) sensors. 2. Engineer genetically encoded fluorescent probes for singlet oxygen (1O2). 3. Engineer genetically encoded fluorescent probes for hydroxyl radical (?OH). 4. Use the fluorescent toolkit to examine reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in doxorubicin-treated tumor and healthy cells. The proposed work is expected to establish new capabilities for in vitro and in vivo detection of these highly reactive, underexplored ubiquitous molecules showing important roles in pathophysiology. We will also perform experiments to capitalize on the capabilities of our new fluorescent probes, in terms of multi-color time-lapse imaging and high selectivity toward particular ROS/RNS. We will use these new fluorescent biosensors to advance our understanding of the roles of ROS/RNS in the anticancer activity and the cardiotoxicity side effect of doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapy drug. The study may shine light on new strategies to reduce the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin without abolishing its anticancer ability. As UCR is one of only a few research universities in the U.S. that are also federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institutions, we will include undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in this project. The training they receive will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the STEM field."

"9245563","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): State-of-the-art upper limb prostheses are severely limited in their ability to provide sensory feedback to a user. The lack of sensory feedback forces  prosthesis users to rely on visual feedback alone in manipulating objects, and often leads to abandonment of the prosthesis in favor of the user's unimpaired arm. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop mechanisms that enable people with upper limb amputations to be able to receive sensory feedback from the environment. Through the use of techniques like targeted reinnervation, there has been significant progress in providing patients with intuitive neural control of their prostheses as well as sensory feedback. Studies have shown that patients receiving sensory stimulation over reinnervated sites while operating a prosthesis more strongly incorporate the artificial limb into their body schema. However, there is limited cutaneous space available over the reinnervated sites for both EMG sensors and stimulators to be placed. As a result, the overall objective of the proposed research is to clinically evaluate a flexible, stretchable epidermal electronic device that conforms to the skin and can simultaneously record EMG and provide electrotactile sensory stimulation at high density over reinnervated sites. We hypothesize that long-term, closed-loop sensorimotor control in prostheses enabled by epidermal electronics will improve fine motor control and promote incorporation of the prosthesis into the body schema, ultimately reducing prosthesis abandonment. We will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims, in which I will 1) Optimize and validate a single flexible epidermal device that can both acquire EMG and provide electrical stimulation simultaneously at high density, 2) develop methods for automatic calibration and modulation of electrotactile sensation intensity to enable long-term wear, and 3) improve fine force control, object recognition, and embodiment through the use of sensory feedback. In turn, we expect that daily usage of prosthetic devices will increase due to the incorporation of high resolution sensory feedback. With the training environment provided by Dr. Levi Hargrove at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, and Dr. Timothy Bretl and Dr. John Rogers the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, we will be able to effectively enable long-term, closed-loop upper limb sensorimotor prosthetic control through the use of epidermal electronic devices."
"9248424","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease are growing health concerns that can lead to impaired blood flow and tissue ischemia, though neovascularization and growth of collateral vessels can help to restore blood flow and preserve the tissue improving outcomes. Collateral formation includes both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis and is a complex process with many coordinating parts including inflammatory signaling and cell proliferation and migration. The balance of these inflammatory responses is important since too little or too much can impair vessel growth. One factor that has been associated with negative effects on collateral growth and may exacerbate the negative effects of inflammatory signals is the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE); however, the cellular source and the mechanism of its regulation in ischemic regions is not fully understood. The preliminary data show increases in RAGE expression mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in an ischemia model and that RAGE has a negative effect on collateral formation in a non-diabetic state. We hypothesized that satellite cells are a major source of RAGE in ischemia and that RAGE expression is H2O2-mediated. To test this hypothesis we plan to use both in vivo and in vitro models. Aim 1 will use a mouse hind limb ischemia (HLI) model to confirm if increased RAGE expression is upregulated in response to H2O2 and confirm that satellite cells express RAGE in response to H2O2. This aim will also investigate the mechanisms by which H2O2 mediates RAGE expression. In Aim 2, we will investigate differences in the production of several factors that mediate collateral growth in wildtype and RAGE knockout satellite cells. The effects of the different cell types on cell migration and proliferation will be studied as well. Fially in Aim 3, we will study the specific role of H2O2-mediated RAGE expression in the satellite cells using a transgenic mouse with satellite cell specific overexpression of catalase a H2O2 scavenger (TgCat-pax7). These studies will advance the understanding of the role of RAGE and its regulation. It is critical to understand how RAGE expression is regulated in non-diabetic ischemia and what the cellular sources of RAGE are in the ischemic setting because manipulating its regulation could help improve collateral formation and improve blood flow and clinical outcomes for patients with ischemic disease."
"9344871","PROJECT SUMMARY  ANNUAL CONFERENCE FOR TRANSLATIONAL EARLY STAGE HIV/AIDS VACCINE RESEARCHERS  This R13 application requests NIH support for three annual conferences for Early Stage Investigators (ESIs) conducting translational HIV vaccine research with nonhuman primates (NHPs). To accelerate progress towards a globally preventative HIV vaccine, there must be preclinical studies in relevant animal models that can be translated into clinical research and a well-trained and engaged research workforce to bridge these research worlds. NIH?s Office of Research Infrastructure Program (ORIP) has initiated an HIV/AIDS Vaccine Scholars K01 Award Program that will build experience for Scholars in translational research, but will not provide them with one inclusive venue to focus on building skills, knowledge, professional networks and career development strategies. The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the world?s largest publicly funded multi- disciplinary international collaboration facilitating the development and testing of vaccines to prevent HIV/AIDS, proposes to develop, implement and evaluate three annual conferences to build skills, knowledge, professional networks and career development strategies for these ESIs, starting May 22-23, 2017 in Washington, DC. Attendees at the ESI Conferences will participate in training and skill-building activities on important translational scientific topics (such as adjuvanting experiments and sieve analysis); mentoring opportunities with senior and peer investigators; career development training within the translational field (including finding funding and grantwriting); presentation opportunities; and organized networking opportunities with other ESIs and senior investigators involved in preclinical, clinical and translation science. Conference topic selection will be guided by a needs assessment from K01 Scholars and mentors, an innovative practice used to great effect in the 2008-2012 NHP-ESI Scholars Program, collaboratively run by HVTN and the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI). Organizing efforts for these conferences will be led by a diverse, multi- disciplinary group of experts in the fields at multiple stages in their careers. To further integrate attendees with clinical research, we will additionally support ESIs to participate in the annual HVTN Full Group Meeting (FGM), which will precede or proceed the ESI conference. The HVTN FGM will include additional opportunities for learning, training and networking. Inclusion of women, underrepresented minorities and individuals with disabilities will be supported as speakers, attendees and organizers. We will fund attendance at these conferences and the HVTN FGM for talented ESIs, mentors, and organizing committee members, providing opportunities for these groups to continue to interact and support translational science. These conferences will fill a critical gap in HIV vaccine knowledge and workforce development by facilitating greater translation of HIV vaccine research between preclinical NHP studies and clinical trials."
"9317940","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antiretroviral (ARV) medications now allow persons living with HIV (PLWH) to age into late adulthood, although quality of life often remains impaired, in part due to development of chronic health problems. PLWH commonly report fatigue, insomnia, and poor sleep quality, though must studies of sleep in PLWH have been small, single-center studies. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has not been well studied in PLWH, despite the increasing prevalence of OSA risk factors such as obesity and older age in PLWH. OSA and its associated intermittent nocturnal hypoxemia have also been associated with comorbidities commonly seen in PLWH, such as cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment. Our preliminary data suggest that OSA is underdiagnosed in PLWH and that the presence of OSA is a strong predictor of fatigue symptoms. Although aging clearly increases OSA risk in the general population, the effect of aging on OSA risk in PLWH is unknown. Whether OSA and sleep fragmentation predict other clinical outcomes in PLWH, such as cognitive impairment, also remains unknown. Our study will address this knowledge gap by leveraging the ongoing Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Observations in People Over Fifty (POPPY) observational cohort study (NCT01737047) and quantify sleep in three groups of POPPY participants: PLWH >50 years of age (n=250), PLWH <50 years of age (n=125), and HIV negative controls >50 years of age (n=125). We will use wrist-worn, ambulatory overnight oximetry and actigraphy to characterize intermittent nocturnal hypoxemia, sleep efficiency, sleep duration, and other objective sleep measures. We will use questionnaires to assess patient-reported sleep outcomes. We will determine the prevalence of sleep abnormalities in older PLWH. We will also determine the relationships between objective sleep data, patient-reported sleep outcomes, and cognitive test performance, while leveraging the unique POPPY design to understand how aging and HIV affect such relationships. Lastly, we will determine how sleep abnormalities relate to immune activation, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in PLWH. We have organized a multi- disciplinary team of experts in HIV-associated lung and breathing disorders, sleep epidemiology, HIV medicine, HIV translational science, and HIV epidemiology to implement this study. To our knowledge, our study will be the first to comprehensively characterize objective sleep data in PLWH, especially older PLWH, with adequate sample size, multi-site representation, and appropriate controls to determine how aging and HIV infection affect these measures. This cross-sectional study will inform the design of longitudinal cohort studies and future trials targeted at sleep interventions to improve quality of life and other clinical outcomes for PLWH."
"9316161","Abstract  Results in our publication demonstrate for the first time that Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), a commensal bacterium of the human skin, functions as a probiotic bacterium that employs carbohydrate fermentation to restrain the over-growth of Propionibacterium acnes, a skin opportunistic bacterium associated with acne vulgaris. To intensify the ability of S. epidermidis to beat out its competitor (P. acnes), the ?-lactose monohydrate (ALM), a selective fermentation initiator, has been used to exclusively trigger the fermentation of S. epidermidis. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by ALM fermentation of S. epidermidis effectively suppress the growth of P. acnes in vitro and in mice. We thus hypothesize that SCFAs within acne lesions are key components to rein in the overgrown P. acnes. The deficiency of SCFAs in human skin may promote the progression of acne vulgaris.  SCFAs will act as adjuvants in the post-antibiotic adjuvant therapy for treatment of acne vulgaris. The post-antibiotic adjuvant therapy will reduce the required dose and side-effects of antibiotics. We have recently obtained acne biopsies in collaboration with Dr. Tissa R. Hata, a Director of the Dermatology Clinical Trials Unit at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). These acne biopsies have been used to establish ex vivo acne explants. The effectiveness of SCFA or the SCFA/antibiotic combination on suppression of P. acnes growth and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines will be evaluated by using ex vivo acne explants. Furthermore, we will explore the action mechanism of SCFAs on reduction of inflammatory acne vulgaris via inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC).  Three Specific Aims are proposed to validate our hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will obtain the P. acnes-selective SCFAs, and examine the role of the inhibition of HDAC by SCFAs in the reduction of P. acnes-induced inflammation. In Specific Aim 2, we will explore the essential roles of SCFAs in the inhibition of P. acnes growth using SCFA-deficient/germ-free mice, and quantify the concentrations of SCFAs in human ex vivo acne explants derived from different stages of acne vulgaris. In Specific Aim 3, we will {use the human ex vivo acne explants to evaluate the post-antibiotic adjuvant therapy using the combination of antibiotic and SCFA or ALM, and detect the possible anti-comedogenic and toxic activities of SCFAs.}  We here introduce a new concept that probiotic bacteria within acne lesions express carbohydrate fermentation and produce the SCFAs to rebalance the acne dysbiosis. If successfully, SCFAs naturally produced by commensal bacteria in the human microbiome can be used as antibiotic adjuvants for treatment of various human infections."
"9251313","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes 2,200 deaths in Americans every day with one death every 39 seconds. There is evidence that these deaths can be prevented with better risk factor management, however, many risk factors remain uncontrolled. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (Medical Home) which includes self-management, personalized health records and team-based care, has been proposed as a strategy to reduce these gaps in care delivery. Several Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses have found evidence that adding pharmacists to the primary care team improves risk factor control and physician adherence to guidelines. Managed care organizations have found that a centralized cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) managed by pharmacists can reduce mortality. It is not known if a comprehensive CVRS model would be implemented in typical office practices and this lack of evidence is a major gap in the literature.  The objective of this application is t conduct a multi-center, cluster-randomized study utilizing a centralized CVRS in medical offices with large geographic, racial and ethnic diversity to determine the extent to which the CVRS model will be implemented. We will randomize 16 primary care offices to the CVRS or usual care and enroll 400 subjects of which 220 subjects will be from racial minorities. We will also select 25 patients per office (n=400, total n=800) into a passive observation group which will allow us to determine the extent to which the intervention diffuses more broadly for unexposed patients. Our central hypothesis is that a centralized CVRS managed by clinical pharmacists will be implemented and significantly improve CVD guideline adherence using the Guideline Advantage metrics. The rationale for this proposed study is that implementation of a novel strategy to improve secondary prevention of CVD will lead to innovative strategies for broader adoption by health systems throughout the US. We will accomplish our objectives and test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims:  Our primary Aim is: To determine if a web-based CVRS managed by clinical pharmacists will be implemented within diverse primary care offices. We postulate that adherence to guidelines for secondary prevention of CVD will be significantly greater in patients from clinics randomized to the centralized CVRS group compared to the control group.  This study is expected to produce the following outcomes: guideline adherence will be 40% at baseline and increase to at least 60% in the intervention group at 12 months. We expect guideline adherence will deteriorate after the intervention is discontinued but will remain significantly higher than the control group."
"9311990","Our research seeks to uncover the psychological and linguistic factors that give rise to the structure of natural human language, within individuals and across a language community. Our primary objective is to discover the abilities all humans apply to acquire and use language, by capturing how those abilities create and shape language over generations, particularly when language exposure is initially incomplete. The recent emergence of a new sign language among Deaf children and adolescents in Nicaragua provides an opportunity to examine how grammatical systems develop without a pre- existing, complete language model. Over the past four decades, deaf Nicaraguans have been creating a new sign language. An initial cohort started with the gestures available in their environment and began to shape them into a new, grammatically complex system. Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL) has continued to develop and change ever since, as new cohorts of children enter the community and learn the language from older peers. Now with archived video data of NSL going back two decades, and comparable data from other sign languages, we have the opportunity to tease apart certain factors that led to the developments we have observed in NSL. Accordingly, our research aims first, to characterize the influence of learners on the emerging linguistic structure of NSL. We will systematically compare sequential age cohorts, at multiple points in time, from earlier in NSL?s development (from our archives) to present-day, focusing on the word order and spatial devices for indicating who-does-what-to-whom, and the creation of categorical expressions for spatial relations and semantic transparency in the lexicon. We will also test whether NSL changed diachronically as predicted by biases in the motor system and acuity constraints in the visual system, by comparing lexical signs and narratives collected across decades of NSL, and comparing NSL to matching data in our archive from the older British Sign Language (BSL). In the process, we will continue to build and share the archive of video and written documentation of NSL. This growing archive is the first and only recording of a language from its origin. We are making use of it in the present grant, and are sharing it with other research laboratories carrying out other work, such as testing models of community, language growth and change."
"9253022","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Abstract A reversible non-hormonal male contraceptive that is reliable, safe, and easy to use will provide a significant option for men who want to take an active role in family planning. The current primary choices for men are vasectomy and condoms, but each has problems with reversibility and surgical risk, or compliance, respective- ly. There is currently a paucity of druggable targets in drug development for reversible non-hormonal male con- traception. Protein kinases that are critical for cell cycle progression during spermatogenesis that are drugga- ble offer promise as targets for contraceptive development. In this regard, cyclin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CDK2) is such a target. CDK2-/- knockout mice are viable but sterile. CDK2 through its interaction with cyclins A and A1 targets retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and p53 for phosphorylation. Both of these proteins are present in human and murine testis, and play critical roles in testis development, and in regulation of transition through the spermatogenic cell cycle. Therefore, a drug that effectively inhibits CDK2 should block spermatogenesis, thereby causing infertility due to lack of sperm. Since CDK2 is an enzyme that effects meiotic division, once the drug is no longer taken, meiosis should resume and sperm production recovers.  The primary hypothesis for this research is that novel small molecule specific inhibitors of CDK2 can be developed as novel non-hormonal reversible male contraceptive agents. To prove this hypothe- sis, the following specific aims will be achieved:  Specific Aim 1. Identify and rank known inhibitors of CDK2 that reversibly inhibit spermatogenesis in rats.  Specific Aim 2. Develop novel CDK2 allosteric and type I and II kinase inhibitors as leads to improve CDK2 specificity, in vivo anti-spermatogenic efficacy, and minimize side effects.  Specific Aim 3. Demonstrate proof-of-concept reversible contraceptive efficacy of CDK2 inhibitors  To achieve specific aims, we will undertake two lines of research to develop novel CDK2 inhibitors as male contraceptives. First, we will improve the CDK2 specificity for potent nanomolar type I and type II kinase inhibitors that we recently developed. This approach of building in specificity has worked for us before. Second, we will pursue the development of novel CDK2 modulators via an allosteric site that we recently discovered, as these may provide greater opportunities to have CDK2-specific selectivity and minimize cross reactivity with other members of the kinase family. In order to be a successful and viable male contraceptive agent, efficacy, safety, and recovery of fertility will need to be comparable to the oral female contraceptive pill. Based on our experience and success in ongoing contraceptive development projects, one of which is currently in pre-clinical development under FDA guidance, we expect this project to produce novel CDK2 inhibitors with high promise to meet the goal of a safe, effective, and easy to use reversible male contraceptive agent."

The UCI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) will enable a wide range of translational research conducted at our institution and in our region in an environment of exceptional quality, safety and efficiency. We will empower programs and talent unique to our Hub that will foster innovation and continuous improvement enriching the entire national network. We will create and track novel programs in each of the essential areas outlined by NCATS: 1) Workforce Development: Trainees (at both the K and NRSA levels) will harness strengths at UCI, including existing immersive training programs in areas such as systems biology that can shorten and improve the training experience. Community-university externships will provide wide-ranging experiential learning including ?health and the judicial system? and ?drug discovery in local start-ups.? Our clinical trainees will play an integral role in workforce development of all staff, such as our recently developed certification program for study coordinators. Particular talent at UCI in both the science and implementation of team science resulted in a Team Science Core Curriculum, which will be integrated into all ICTS training. 2) Collaboration and Engagement: The ICTS ecosystem is one in which our academic health center actively collaborates with regional partners: the freestanding Children?s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC), the local VA, and a growing community-based accountable care organization in our region. The ICTS will lead an institutional and regional effort to improve quality and efficiency, preparing us as a Hub poised to excel in multicenter clinical investigations. By engaging the successful clinical trial experience of our faculty, building on years of effective community outreach, our integration with community clinics, and advanced EHR cohort discovery tools, the clinical trials Accrual and Retention Core is designed to optimally recruit from the youngest of the young (premature babies) to the oldest of the old (90+), and from typically underrepresented groups in clinical research. 3) Integration: Child health research will be fostered through: collaborations with the AAP Pediatric Research in Office Settings network; a formal Research Strategic Plan with CHOC; and through an Optional Module with nineteen other CTSAs (Child Health Research Acceleration through Multisite Planning). 4) Methods and Processes: Our involvement with the consortium of the five UC CTSAs (BRAID?Biomedical Research Acceleration Integration and Development) has served as a testing ground of novel approaches for multisite research.

"9234415","ABSTRACT  Each of the three PROJECTS in this Program will explore the cellular, molecular, and physiological  mechanisms that underlie pediatric dysphagia in 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS), using the LgDel  mouse, which is an accurate genetic model of the human disorder, as well as related compound mutants and  transgenics. CORE B, Animal Models and Dysphagia Pathology, will facilitate completion of all of the Specific  Aims of these PROJECTS by providing a reliable and consistent supply of thoroughly characterized mouse  models on a well-characterized single genetic background across all PROJECTS. CORE B will provide  standardized genotyping and documentation, training and consultation for PROJECT personnel on working  with mouse models. By centralizing these services, we can ensure the consistency and fidelity of each of the  mouse models across PROJECTS. CORE B also will work with PROJECTS 1 and 3 to perform standardized  assessment of feeding and swallowing, including acute feeding assays and the analysis of the respiratory  pathology resulting from dysphagia. By utilizing a uniform approach to each of these assays, we will ensure  that data from each PROJECT's aims are directly comparable to parallel experiments performed in other aims  by other PROJECT personnel. This will enhance the precise and rigorous integration and management of  genotypic and phenotypic data across PROJECTs in line with the NINDS ?Pre-clinical Rigor? guidelines,  prevent significant duplication of effort, and maximize the investment of Program resources. Consolidation of  the generation and phenotypic analysis of mouse models of dysphagia in CORE B will allow each research  group to focus on key analytic approaches that are their specialties, rather than investing significant time,  training, and effort in the genetic strategies necessary to generate crosses, follow compound genotypes, and  obtain sufficient numbers of experimental animals for rigorous analysis. In addition, we will facilitate phenotypic  assessment of dysphagia, and ensure that phenotypic measures obtained by each PROJECT can be  compared qualitatively and quantitatively to one another. Together, the services, facilities, and training  provided by CORE B will enhance the research productivity and quality of each of the three PROJECTS.  These Core services will result in significant time and cost savings, and permit PROJECT investigators and  laboratories to focus on their research specialties, with ready access to high-quality animal models and  phenotypic assessment of dysphagia.  NARRATIVE  CORE B, Animal Models and Dysphagia Pathology will provide high-quality genetic mouse models of the  human 22q11 Deletion Syndrome that will be used by all three PROJECTS in the Program. Because children  with this neurodevelopmental disability have significant difficulties feeding and swallowing, CORE B will  facilitate the accurate phenotypic assessment of mice that display these same problems. As a centralized Core  facility, we can provide these services with a high level of reproducibility that ensures standardization across  the PROJECTS, minimizes bias and prevents duplication of effort to conserve Program resources."
"9234080","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus (Established Status Epilepticus, ESE) is a relatively common emergency condition with several widely used treatments. There are no controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trials to compare the efficacy and tolerability of currently available treatments of ESE. This and the accompanying Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) application describe the ESE treatment trial (ESETT), which is designed to determine the most effective and/or the least effective treatment of ESE among patients older than two years by comparing three arms: fosphenytoin (FOS), levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA). This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Bayesian adaptive, Phase III comparative effectiveness trial. Up to 795 patients will be randomized initially 1:1:1 and response-adaptive randomization will occur after 300 patients have been recruited. Randomization will be stratified by three age groups, 2-18, 19-65, and 66 years and older. The primary outcome measure is cessation of clinical seizure activity and improving mental status, without serious adverse effects or further intervention at 60 min after administration of study drug. Each subject will be followed until discharge or 30 days from enrollment. This trial will include interim analyses for early success and futility. This trial wil be considered a success if the probability that a treatment is the most effective is greater than 0.975 or the probability that a treatment is the least effective is greater than 0.975 for any treatment. This will be the first phase III clinical trial of ESE in children and adults."
"9282646","ABSTRACT: We have demonstrated that the non-muscle isoform of myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK, 1914 aa, gene code: MYLK) is an essential, multi-functional cytoskeletal effector involved: i) in lung endothelial cell (EC) bar- rier-disruptive and barrier-restorative processes, ii) in lung inflammatory cell trafficking; and, iii) in lung vascular responses to mechanical stress. Each of these events is critical to the pathobiology of acute respiratory dis- tress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator?induced lung injury (VILI). We performed MYLK sequencing and identi- fied coding and non-coding MYLK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to ARDS suscepti- bility and to ARDS outcomes. In addition, many ARDS-associated MYLK SNPs were profoundly over- represented in individuals of African descent (AD), a population at risk for reduced survival in ARDS. As these studies indicate MYLK is a viable ARDS candidate gene, we will address the functionality of 29 methodically- selected MYLK SNPs that are potentially involved in the dual EC barrier-regulatory roles of nmMLCK both in the development of ARDS and VILI as well as in the recovery phase associated with EC barrier restoration. One potential influence of these SNPs is on the regulation of nmMLCK expression. SA #1 will extend our re- cently published studies to mechanistically characterize the effects of 5' promoter and 3' UTR MYLK SNPs on genetic/epigenetic regulation of nmMLCK expression. Continuing our structure/function interrogation of MYLK, we recently employed RNA sequencing analysis and corroborated our published studies that human lung EC exhibit substantial expression of a unique 1845 aa nmMLCK splice variant, nmMLCK2, generated by a splicing deletion of exon11. Exciting preliminary data demonstrate that lung EC exposure to inflammatory agonists and excessive mechanical stress both selectively increase nmMLCK2 expression with MYLK SNPs dramatically influencing these splicing events. SA #2 will define the impact of MYLK SNPs and splicing factors on nmMLCK mRNA splice variant generation. Effects of coding SNPs on post-translational modifications (PTMs) are yet an- other potential mechanism to alter barrier-regulatory processes in ARDS patients. Extensively utilizing Cores B & D expertise, SA #3 will evaluate the effects of PTMs (such as phosphorylation of Y464 and Y471 located in the spliced out exon 11) and N-terminal coding SNPs on nmMLCK1 and nmMLCK2 spatially-directed kinase activi- ties, structure/function relationships, and EC barrier responses (peripheral cytoskeletal remodeling, lamellipo- dia formation, paracellular gap regulation). Finally, with Core C support, SA #4 will validate the in vivo effects of selected nmMLCK coding SNPs and PTMs and define nmMLCK antagonism as a potential novel therapy in preclinical ARDS and VILI models. Thus, via the intense leveraging of highly integrated interactions with each PPG Project and Core, Project #1's system biology approaches will allow us to clarify the contributions of lung EC cytoskeletal variants, PTMs and SNPs to ARDS and VILI pathobiology, enhance therapeutic targeting of lung vascular barrier dysregulation, and increase knowledge of the genetic basis for ARDS health disparities."
"9257207","The Human Ovarian Tissue, Oocyte, and Data Repository Core of the SCCPIR Center for Reproductive Health After Disease will expand an existing integrated network of clinicians - the National Physicians Cooperative (NPC) - which cares for patients at risk of iatrogenic infertility due to cancer treatment, and provides access to human reproductive tissues and patient data to reproductive health researchers.  The Core will build on the nationwide NPC network, currently composed of 56 clinical fertility sites with a national referral mechanism that participate in an IRB-approved study protocol to perform ovarian tissue cryopreservation for young female cancer patients. The NPC provides these patients with the potential for a reproductive future and provides reproductive scientists with precious human tissue for research. The Human Ovarian Tissue, Oocyte, and Data Repository Core will leverage the successes of the NPC to increase the number of member sites, thereby expanding patient access to fertility preservation and increasing the amount of ovarian tissue available to Center researchers. While the NPC was initially developed to provide fertility preservation services to cancer patients, the expanded mission of the proposed Core is to provide quality care to a larger population of patients with diseases or undergoing treatments that may damage their reproductive health. The Core will also access human ovarian tissue and oocytes from patients who previously stored such tissues and now wish to donate them for research. Currently, these human tissues are difficult to obtain for research purposes, and the Core Repository will provide the critical bridge between clinical access to these tissues and their use in reproductive health research. Finally, the Core will develop a Data Repository to collect patient data from clinical member sites on disease diagnoses, fertility preservation counseling, and treatment information, which can be utilized by researchers to investigate clinical patterns among young patients with diseases or undergoing treatments that may impair their future reproductive health. Human ovarian tissue donated through the NPC or the new Repository Core will be applied to studies investigating new fertility preservation methods for patients who currently have no established options (Project 1) and to gain a greater understanding of the safety of experimental fertility preservation techniques (Project 11). Human oocytes from the Repository will allow researchers to identify the properties of high-quality oocytes, an integral step in advancing assisted reproductive technologies for fertility preservation patients (Project 1). Patient data acquired by the Repository Core will assist clinical researchers in the examining the fertility considerations of young patients before, during, and after disease treatment; specifically, the impact of reproductive concerns on the decision by young breast cancer patients to take adjuvant tamoxifen therapy (Project IV). This innovative Repository Core will provide human tissue and patient data essential to accelerate Center research and ultimately ensure improved clinical care for all young patients facing a loss of fertility due to diseases or their treatment."
"9209620","PROJECT ABSTRACT Until recently it was believed that hematopoiesis is driven by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the normal setting. However, studies using elegant methods for clonal tracking demonstrate that steady-state hematopoiesis in the unperturbed mouse is largely sustained by long-lived progenitors. Under the stress of bone marrow transplantation, these progenitors appear short-lived. In addition, transplantation of single, purified HSCs has revealed marked lineage bias, such that HSCs may be ?balanced?, lymphoid-, myeloid, or platelet-biased in their outcome. This project addresses the molecular mechanisms underlying clonal dynamics and lineage bias. We have developed an experimental platform to score lineage bias of HSCs and performed preliminary single-cell gene expression analyses that identify transcripts relatively increased or decreased in myeloid- vs lymphoid-biased HSCs. Among candidate epigenetic regulators are histone deacetylases (HDACs). In collaboration with other investigators in this program project, we will apply clonal tracking in the mouse by transposon tagging (Camargo) and rainbow fluorescent marker tagging (Scadden) to dissect the contributions of individual HDACs to lineage bias in vivo as compared with ex vivo and determine pathways through which they function. In addition, we will assess other candidate epigenetic regulators and specifically explore the role of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) heterozygosity in clonal dominance of HSCs. Results will be intersected with findings of the Zon group in the Zebrafish. In a parallel aim, we will establish a high-throughput genetic approach to identifying epigenetic regulators of HSC self-renewal through ex vivo gene modification and in vivo phenotypic readout by transplantation. We have created a new mouse strain in which the Cas9 enzyme is inducible. This strain will facilitate gene editing of HSCs and progenitors with the CRISPR/Cas9 platform. We will establish the parameters for CRISPR/Cas9 library screening of HSCs and progenitors, and determine the critical epigenetic regulators from among ~300+ known factors. In parallel, we will compare our findings with those of the Zon and Scadden groups, and test candidate regulators (including RNAs) identified in the project of the Tenen laboratory. Through this integrative genetic approach to HSC and progenitor function, we seek to improve methods for expansion of HSCs for both experimental and therapeutic purposes."
"9244673","The Administrative Core of the U54 Center Clinical and Basic Studies in PCOS has three main  objectives. First it will promote and integrate reproduction-related research between the subprojects -  Project I (UVA), Project II (U Wisconsin) and Project III (U Michigan); future pilot projects; inter-Center  training; and the Ligand and Outreach Cores. This will be achieved by regular email contacts, quarterly live  videoconferences, and annual meetings held in rotation at one of the three institutions. These regular  interchanges will allow rapid exchange of ideas between basic and clinical investigators with an overall goal  of rapidly transferring novel, basic observations to clinical application.  The second objective will be to facilitate research collaborations and interactions between investigators  in the U54 Center with those in other SCCPIR Centers. In the previous cycle, the Core established pilot  projects with investigators at UCSD and Oregon (OHSU). These studies provided new information on the  sources of androgen excess in girls, and the critical role of excess testosterone in modifying regulation of  GnRH secretion in a primate model and are continuing with both Centers. Interactions with other centers will  continue, fueled by scientific discussions at the Center Directors, Neuroendocrine Research Focus Group,  The Endocrine Society, and other meetings.  The third objective is to organize efficient Ligand Core access for all approved projects, maintain  accurate records of services provided and effect efficient chargeback for assays performed. The recent  expansion of Ligand Core access and activity has markedly increased the requirement for administrative  support, which now occupies the majority of the Administrator's effort.  Of particular import will be the role of the Core in promoting, facilitating, and integrating U54 research  activities by arranging regular communications between project Pis and Cores, facilitating the expansion of  the Outreach Core activities, and arranging the annual review meetings and Internal Advisory Board reviews.  The overall goal is to enhance research progress with rapid exchange of novel information and advancing  new directions through collaborative pilot projects."
"9247852","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study objective is to establish the efficacy of isradipine 10 mg daily to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) disability. This is a companion application to that of Kevin Biglan, MD, from the University of Rochester entitled Data Coordination Center for STEADY-PD3.  PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease that affects 1% of the population above the age 65. The principal motor symptoms of PD are attributable to the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Recent data demonstrated that the selective vulnerability of these neurons may be due to the reliance of these neurons on L-type Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels and, more importantly for PD, that blocking these channels with israpadine, a dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonist, protects these neurons in in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinsonism. Recent epidemiological data also points to a reduced risk of PD with chronic use of dihydropyridines.  Isradipine is an approved agent for the treatment of hypertension. Our Phase II clinical studies have found that isradipine is safe and tolerable at the daily dose of 10 mg or below in participants with early PD. Isradipine penetrates the blood brain barrier and 10 mg daily dose achieves serum concentrations within the range found to be neuroprotective in animal models of PD.  Based on these observations we propose to conduct a 36 month Phase 3 parallel group placebo controlled study of efficacy of isradipine 10mg daily versus placebo to slow the progression of PD disability in 336 participants with early PD. The study will include interim futility analysis thus eliminating the need to complete a standalone futility study. The proposed study is designed to address two specific aims. First, to establish the efficacy of isradipine 10 mg daily to slow the progression of PD disability as measured by the change in the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part I-III score over 36 months. Second, to ascertain effect of isradipine 10 mg daily on the progression of PD over 36 months as measured by a number of clinically meaningful and widely accepted measures of progression of disability in early PD including:1) Time to initiation and dose utilization of dopaminergic therapy; 2) Time to onset of dopaminergic motor complications; 3) Change in non-motor disability; Exploratory measures will include global measures of functional disability, quality of life, the change in the ambulatory capacity (sum of 5 UPDRS items: falling, freezing, walking, gait, postural stability) and cognitive function.  The proposed study design represents a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of a novel therapy to slow progression of PD disability and to determine if efficacy if such exists is associated with clinically meaningful benefits. The simple study design reflecting real life scenario and availability of low cost generic isradipine will facilitate the translatio of the study results, if positive, into a meaningful clinical application."
"9254459","IMAGING GROUP PRECLINICAL IMAGING SHARED FACILITY (PCISF) ABSTRACT The Preclinical Imaging Shared Facility (PCISF) fulfills a critical UAB-CCC priority by supporting over 50 members in five programs with preclinical imaging studies for detection of cancer and therapy evaluation. The facility provides detailed imaging evaluation of new cancer treatments, and thereby accelerates their translation to human trials. The specific aims are the following: (1) to provide state-of-the-art molecular imaging for preclinical studies in appropriate animal models, and support IND's for transition to human imaging studies; (2) to provide consultation and training to CCC members for molecular imaging in cancer models; (3) to establish methods for image analyses; (4) to maintain the instruments and keep them accurately calibrated; and (5) to develop novel imaging technologies and acquire new instruments. The facility will coordinate existing support mechanisms for imaging at UAB, and significantly expand the imaging effort with clinically relevant imaging that can be translated to humans. Imaging components include structural and metabolic imaging (MRI/MRS, high frequency ultrasonography and microCT), gamma-ray imaging (gamma camera, microSPECT/CT, microPET/CT, PET/MR), and optical imaging (bioluminescence and fluorescence). The PCISF has undertaken a multimodality imaging approach to provide a molecular understanding of cancer in animal models by integrating measurements of tumor mass (bioluminescence, ultrasound, CT, and MR), tumor specific targeting (SPECT, ultrasound, fluorescence, microPET), vascular parameters (ultrasound, MR), and specific therapy responses (ultrasound, bioluminescence, SPECT, MR, micoPET). Each imaging modality has advantages and their coordinated application is synergistic. The facility meets a critical need in evaluation of new therapies for cancer in animal models, thereby enabling translation of the new therapies to human trials. The facility will enhance the potential of other UAB-CCC shared facilities (High Resolution Imaging, Tissue Procurement, Mass Spectrometry/Proteonomics, Transgenic Animal, and Human Imaging) by providing real-time imaging of molecular pathways in the living animal, enabling precise tissue sampling and microanalyses, and facilitating translation to human studies."
"9278865","Abstract:  We have proposed a comprehensive program project that will continue to address fundamental questions  regarding the establishment and maintenance of the pluripotent state. Our four project components bring  diverse expertise ranging from epigenetics, noncoding DNA, noncoding RNA and computational biology to  understand the molecular circuits underlying reprogramming and pluripotent cells. There are however always  many possible extensions of this program to further enhance its impact on regenerative biology and human  health in general.  To allow a continual expansion into these unknown or newly emerging areas we propose an administrative  core with the objective to use a well-established pilot grant mechanism to attract new talent to the field and  also respond rapidly to new trends by providing seed funds. We further integrate these pilot programs within  and across our science through frequent interactions. Finally we aim to bring together scientists around our  efforts with intra-lab retreats, local meetings, workshops and our international symposium.  Given the interactions with the pilot recipients (including already several joint publications) we feel they are a  significant enrichment of the program as a whole. The benefit is mutual and the interactions with the program  PIs as well as the financial support is clearly helping the efforts of the pilot PIs, which are generally new to this  field. Our inter labmeetings, retreats and also the main Symposium are effective ways the integrate all of the  involved players and efforts into a high impact overall research program.  The use of the administrative core in the ongoing project has been highly successful on all levels and we  essentially propose to continue the program in the same structure in the current proposal.  In summary, we are thrilled about the opportunity to have the administrative component and will continue to  use it to the maximal benefit of the stem cell and larger scientific community."
"9464738","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         In the VA population, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, increases from <5% among adults 18-44 years old to nearly 50% among those >85 years old. CKD is associated with many adverse outcomes including the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as higher rates of mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), CKD- related complications and functional decline. While the presence of abnormalities in kidney function in older Veterans with CKD are clearly associated with adverse health outcomes, many of these patients have multiple co-morbid conditions and diminished functional reserve across a range of organ systems. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and CVD and the burden of frailty and disability are substantial in older adults with CKD. In the geriatric population, the presence of these other conditions may diminish the value of a purely disease-oriented approach that focuses only on the role of intrinsic kidney abnormalities in understanding trajectories of kidney function. In contrast, an individualized, patient-centered approach prioritizes patient goals and preferences and recognizes that observed signs and symptoms in older adults are often multi-factorial reflecting the complex interplay between one or more chronic predisposing and acute precipitating events. With this in mind, we propose an incremental research agenda to better understand the predictors, outcomes and significance of different longitudinal trajectories of kidney function in older Veterans. Only a few prior studies have evaluated longitudinal trajectories of kidney function. These studies demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity in kidney function trajectories in patients with CKD and that many patients follow a non-linear disease trajectory. Furthermore, qualitative work has suggested that uncertainty about the expected course of CKD appears to be an important concern among both patients and providers. In Aim 1, we will identify long- term predisposing factors and short-term precipitating factors associated with a decline in eGFR trajectory among older Veterans with CKD using multilevel change regression models. In addition to traditional measures of kidney disease burden, we will evaluate a range of time-varying factors of special relevance to older adults such as use and dosing of medications and intercurrent health events such as acute illness and hospitalization. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the association of different eGFR trajectories with both traditional CKD outcomes and nontraditional, patient-centered outcomes of relevance to older adults with CKD (e.g., nursing home admission). Finally, in Aim 3, we will examine how older Veterans view and prioritize challenges related to CKD self-management at specific points along different eGFR trajectories using the nominal group technique (NGT). Knowledge of these barriers will allow us to better engage patients in shared-decision making and problem solving strategies as well as design patient- and family-centered interventions directly targeting these barriers. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to changes in health status or acute insults. However, prior studies have not addressed how dynamic changes in the health of older CKD patients impact eGFR trajectory. Further we do not know the significance of eGFR trajectory from the patient's perspective. To fill these knowledge gaps we propose a comprehensive approach using both advanced statistical methods and an innovative qualitative component that will identify (1) time-varying and event-based factors associated with a decline in eGFR trajectory, (2) patient-centered outcomes associated with eGFR trajectory, and (3) patient-reported barriers to CKD self-management at specific points in eGFR trajectory."
"9344950","Project Summary The long term objective of this SBIR application is to develop and test a minimum viable product (MVP) of Rock Steady, a software application for adults with vestibular dysfunction. This product is relevant to the mission of the NIDCD because it addresses the request for, ?the development of technologies for the study, diagnosis, and treatment of balance disorders, particularly for the elderly?. The envisioned product is an elegantly simple mobile application that is designed to measure adherence to a home exercise program of gaze stability exercises based on recommendations from the 2016 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Vestibular Rehabilitation. This product was conceived in response to four main drivers: 1) the growing number of adults aging with balance impairments due to vestibular dysfunction, 2) the finding that vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) improves quality of life, 3) the need for developing engaging exercise programs that will improve adherence to VRT, and 4) a lack of commercially available low cost tools to support VRT. This application is very timely given the growth in the number of older adults and the ease of dissemination via smart tablets/PCs which are being adopted by older adults at faster rates than ever before. By deploying the app on common digital technology we will ensure its widespread adoption. Finally, it will be designed with end user feedback from all stakeholder groups including people with vestibular dysfunction. Broad Objective: We intend to translate existing evidence-based educational material, assessments and gaze stability exercises to a mobile device for widespread dissemination and adoption to increase adherence with home and clinic based VRT, promote health and wellbeing and improve patient care and outcomes through coordinated higher quality of care. Approach: In Phase 1 we will 1) employ user-centered design methodologies to develop and evaluate reliability, validity and usability of Rock Steady 1.0 for adults with vestibular dysfunction, over age 60, 2) integrate eye/head tracking and 3) identify and evaluate feature and content expansions/adaptations for Rock Steady 2.0. In Phase 2 we will employ user-centered, iterative design approaches to develop Rock Steady 2.0 and further feasibility, usability, and a pilot effectiveness study. Research Design: We will use a randomized trial design to evaluate reliability, validity and usability. All participants will complete two versions of standard evaluations of vestibular dysfunction using traditional paper/pencil method and via the app. Participants will be randomized to begin with either the app or traditional approaches. Reliability will be compared using interclass correlation coefficient, validity will be evaluated using Pearson/Spearman statistics and usability will be evaluated using the System Usability Scale questionnaire. Expected Outcomes: We believe that Rock Steady will be a valid and reliable adjunct to VRT. The app will provide healthcare professionals with important data regarding adherence, and function while also reducing the cost of care delivery."
"9362979","We are requesting funds to purchase a 10X Genomics Chromium System. This instrument allows investigators to perform gene expression analysis on single cells and structural genomic analysis of (SNPs, deletions, transitions, etc) through genome sequencing of large scaffolds. Currently, neither the research facility at the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center (OKC VAMC) or the affiliated University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center have the ability to measure gene expression/genomic integrity in single cells. It is well known that cell-cell communication is important in tissue function. However, it is only now becoming evident that changes in cell heterogeneity even between the same types of cells can be potentially harmful to tissues and an organism, i.e., conditions that lead to large cell to cell differences can compromise the function of a tissue. However, in the past there was no technology available that allowed investigators to study molecular processes in large numbers of individual cells.  The 10X Genomics Chromium System is a new approach to making next-generation-sequencing libraries. The Gemcode technology behind this system enables the instrument to simultaneously make thousands of mini-libraries per sample in oil droplets. One cell is captured in each droplet and the RNA-Seq library from each droplet is given a unique barcode. This allows an investigator to perform RNA-Seq on all the mini-libraries from a single cell simultaneously and separate the data after the fact. Therefore, one can characterize the individual transcriptomes on a large number of cells and determine the variance in the transcription profile of cells from a culture or tissue.  The 10X Genomics Chromium System can also be used to characterize the genomic integrity of individual cells, i.e., structural variation such as deletions, transversions, rearrangements, etc. within the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome through individually barcoded large genomic scaffolds (50kb to 10Mb). Unlike short-read sequencing currently used in genomic studies that can be difficult to assemble into whole genomes these scaffolds are large and are more readily assembled. With the large scaffolds important structural variations are readily resolved with important implications for DNA damage, transgenic animal validation and potential in development of novel epigenomic workflows.  A survey of all VA researchers at OKC VAMC showed over 80% of the researchers are interested in the potential of in using the 10X Genomics Chromium System to study the heterogeneity of cells in their research. This instrument will be used by eight major users who have VA Merit grants funded (7) or pending (1) and three potential users who have VA Merit grants funded (2) or pending (1). We also anticipate that researchers at other VA Centers will use this instrument."
"9233198","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive impairments in mathematics, which affect a substantial percentage of children, could be addressed earlier in development if we had an empirically-grounded theory of the fundamental algorithms that children need to become numerate. For instance, an understanding of the cognitive system supporting early numeracy could be used to focus interventions specifically to each child's representational or process-level problems. Previous research from our group and others suggests that some of the cognitive mechanisms underlying human verbal counting are derived from developmentally and evolutionarily more primitive processes. However, a formal theory of the logical principles that relate human counting to these earlier capacities is currently lacking. By using computational modeling and behavioral analyses in human children and non-human primates, we will assess the logical principles that serve as cognitive precursors to human counting. Our behavioral experiments will provide a new empirical basis for accounts of human counting acquisition and our computational approach will formalize the logical principles underlying this capacity. We ground our formal theories in behavioral data using a novel Bayesian data analysis method that permits us to statistically evaluate a wide range of alternative hypotheses. The proposed experimental aims are innovative in that they test a new frontier of unexplored relations between children's counting and evolutionarily primitive logical reasoning. The approach is innovative in the field of child development in its application of state-of-the-art computational methods to data from human children and non-human animals. The proposed research thus stands to break substantial new ground in the methods that are used to study child development. Insights about the logical architecture underlying counting acquisition will have broad implications for our understanding of learning and development, and will provide a a new empirical basis to describe the neurology behind learning impairments in children."
"9402737","Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8). Surgical expenditures are estimated to account for 29% of costs and consume 1/14th of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025 (2, 3). Time in the operating room is extremely costly, with estimates as high as $100 per minute(4). Surgical supplies alone represent up to 50% of operating room expenses(14). Historically, there has been little incentive to contain costs, but with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reimbursements are now linked to a diagnosis or a procedure, rather than individual components of a patient's care(10). This shifts the burden of reducing expenses to health care providers who must now deliver high quality care on a fixed income. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in particular, has an interest in evaluating, optimizing, and delivering valuable healthcare under this new framework. Surgeons have a direct impact on the cost of a patient's care as they pre-select items used for cases and open additional instruments as the operation progresses. It is common for a single surgical implant to cost thousands of dollars. Despite this, research describing intraoperative expenses is rare (16). This proposal seeks to remedy this information gap by (I) calculating surgeon-specific intraoperative costs for common general surgery operations across several academic hospitals, (II) identifying factors that drive these expenses, and (III) developing and implementing an intervention aimed to reduce these expenses. This project will retrospectively analyze electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital accounting data to determine average surgeon-expenditures for several common operations across multiple institutions. Multiple logistic regression analysis will identify the impact of patient and surgeon factors on costs. Semi-structured interviews of focus groups will shape development of the intervention. This will be followed by a six-month implementation phase and prospective analysis of the intervention's efficacy and feasibility. Results of this study will inform hospitals and health care systems about the relative costs of items used in their operating rooms and the factors driving these expenses. Importantly, it will introduce a methodology for institutions to analyze their own expenses and provide a generalizable, structured intervention that can be adapted for their use."
"9222781","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NIH - Linking language and cognition in infancy: Entry points and developmental change this proposal addresses fundamental issues of early language and conceptual development, and forges a precise link between them in infants' first year of life. Infants live in an enormously rich environment. Each day, they encounter new objects, while listening to a rich repertoire of sounds, including the sounds of their language. Amidst this richness, infants must identify the sounds of their native language and discover how these are linked to the world around them. Even before infants begin to speak, they identify the sounds of their language and link them to foundations of meaning. By 3 months of age, language supports infants' ability to form object categories. Initially, this link between language and cognition is quite broad: vocalizations of both human and non-human primates promote the formation of object categories. By 6 months, this link is tuned specifically to human vocalizations. The current proposal is designed to specify the scope of infants' initial link and t trace how it unfolds over the first year. Recruiting state-of-the-art analyses, this proposal will illuminate the developmental path infants take as they narrow in on the communicative signals of their species and link these signals to the foundations of meaning. Series I is designed to identify the range of signals that initially promote object categorization in human infants and how these are tuned over the first year. The studies examine infants' responses to vocalizations produced by human and non-human primates, mammals and birds, and also to manually-produced signals of sign language (ASL). Series II is designed to uncover how (and when) infants' exposure to language and other signals in the environment shapes the very possibility that they will link these signals to cognition. The studies, which examine infants' plasticity, wil pinpoint critical developmental windows for promoting language and conceptual development in all infants. Series III is designed to identify how infants come to interpret a signal (spoken or signed) as communicative. Taking infants' exquisite sensitivity to social cues (e.g., eye gaze) as a starting point, the studies consider whether infants interpret any signal (e.g., a tone sequence) as communicative if it is embedded within a rich communicative exchange. Humans are uniquely endowed with a natural capacity to build complex, flexible and creative systems of language and thought. This proposal, which forges a precise link between these systems, has far-reaching theoretical and practical implications. The proposed project broadens significantly the empirical and theoretical foundations of current research, and provides a window into the origins and evolution of infants' earliest links between conceptual and linguistic development. This work underscores the vital interaction between infants' natural endowments and the shaping role of the environment. It also builds a strong foundation for identifying infants with language delay or impairment, and serves as a springboard for designing targeted interventions to bolster their language and cognition."
"9453233","Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) containing reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) can only attenuate HIV and HBV replication, and has marginal therapeutic effect on advanced liver diseases, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons. The underlying mechanisms by which HBV-induced liver pathogenesis, and mechanisms by which HIV co-infection accelerate that process remain unknown due in large part to the lack of small animal models. We recently developed novel humanized mouse models carrying autologous human liver and immune system cells, which support viral hepatitis infections (HBV/HCV), HIV co- infections and associated liver diseases. Inflammation associated macrophages are mainly derived from circulating monocytes and represent a major component of the inflammatory milieu in many liver diseases; however, very little is known about their role in liver pathogenesis. Macrophages are broadly classified as M1 activated, which promote the Th1 associated anti-viral response, and M2-like activated which impair Th1 response and promote tissue pathology. We recently showed that chronic HBV/HCV-induced liver inflammation in both humanized mice and humans is associated with high levels of infiltrating M2-like macrophages which localized to fibrotic and neoplastic regions. Similar findings have been reported with other inflammatory diseases. HIV infection also results in increased M2-like macrophage activation in both humanized mice and humans. Our central hypothesis is that HIV accelerates liver disease in HBV/HIV co- infections by exacerbating M2-like macrophage pathogenesis in the liver. This proposal utilizes a novel humanized mouse model, and macrophage-hepatic stellate cell co-culture to address critical knowledge gaps on the role of macrophage activation in HBV/HIV co-infection and associated liver diseases. To elucidate the role of macrophage activation in HBV/HIV co-infection and associated liver pathogenesis, Specific Aim 1 will be to delineate the effect of HBV/HIV co-infection and associated anti-viral therapy on monocyte/macrophage activation and liver disease progression in the humanized mouse model. Specific Aim 2 will be to investigate the molecular basis by which macrophages modulate hepatic stellate cell activation and associated liver fibrogenesis in HBV/HIV co-infection using macrophage-hepatic stellate cell co-culture models and humanized mice. This work will elucidate the role of macrophages in HBV/HIV co-infection and associated liver pathogenesis, and lead to novel therapeutic strategies against inflammatory liver diseases."
"9321557","Project Summary Health challenges linked to human aging take a tremendous toll on our society. Physical and cognitive decline limit the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers. Aging is the major risk factor for, and possible cause of cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease, and thus struggle with debilitating disease is a common health burden for the aging population. Without question, the promotion of healthy aging with extended resistance to decline should be a major objective of current medical research. To investigate healthy aging, simple animals models such as the nematode C. elegans have been studied, providing molecular insights into the genes and chemical compound interventions that can modulate conserved aging processes likely to act similarly in humans. The goal of the proposed work is to continue, and expand, efforts of a co-operative scientific group involving three closely interacting laboratories who coordinately test pharmacological interventions for the ability to extend healthy aging and promote longevity in nematodes. A specific emphasis of this integrated super-group is to test promising drugs on a collection of natural variants of the Caenorhabditis genus, which together represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population. The idea is that treatments that confer positive outcomes across a diverse population will have an increased chance of being efficacious in higher organisms and will be suggested as priority interventions for testing in pre-clinical mouse studies and possibly future human trials. The emphasis of this proposal is to evaluate the diversity panel that the CITP has previously established to investigate sources of within and between strain variation, including possible food by compound interactions, and to use a panel of gene expression markers to identify genetic pathways that serve as targets of action for compounds identified during the testing phase of the project. Overall, we will participate in a unique team project that has the power to define pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population, with implications for development of therapies that promote healthy human aging.  "
"9275014","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the major mental illnesses of early adulthood, people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) (i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder) exhibit a continuum of impairment in social functioning. Treatment is minimally effective, and impairments tend to persist. Knowledge on the neurobiology of social cognitive (SCog) process impairment will foster therapeutic discovery. At each of our sites, pilot data show that people with SSDs who are among the most socially impaired have a low likelihood of functional recovery and manifest impairment in discrete brain circuits that are known to be involved in the neurobiology of SCog processes in healthy individuals. Leveraging our pilot data, which is consistent across three sites, and the expertise of our group in SSD research related to phenomenology, outcomes, multi-site neuroimaging, and treatment innovation, we propose to use the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) investigational framework in people with SSDs to comprehensively and definitively delineate the neurobiology of SCog process impairment. Our approach will employ advanced structural and functional neuroimaging approaches to identify the neural circuitry (along a continuum from healthy controls to people with SSDs) that predict impairments in SCog processes and concomitant social function. We plan to use advanced neuroimaging and network analysis approaches including: 1) gray matter morphology approaches to map the thickness of the cortex and examine cortical thickness network topology, 2) DTI acquisition and analytic approaches to map white matter circuits in the brain; and 3) fMRI-based approaches to engage these same circuits, including functional connectivity measures to obtain detailed measures of circuit function. We will then use our group's expertise in sophisticated multivariate neuroimaging statistics (partial least squares), to extract dimensional features relating brain structure ->brai function -> behavior and provide a comprehensive understanding of the neurobiology of social processes from circuit to behavior across normal and abnormal (SSDs) domains. Our proposal is modeled directly within the RDoC framework; specifically, we are using a Matrix of Analysis as our guiding structure to identify the neurobiology of SCog process constructs from normal controls across the entire schizophrenia spectrum. We anticipate identifying substantially abnormal brain-behavior relationships starting from the level of circuit characterization. The ultimate goal of our collaborative team is to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of social impairments by identifying the underlying neural circuitry and pathophysiology of impaired social function."
"9247712","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this proposed research is to increase our fundamental understanding of the interaction of high intensity laser radiation with dental hard tissues and apply that knowledge to the development of laser based methods that selectively remove dental caries and composite restorative materials using an integrated approach of computer-controlled laser beam scanning coupled with optical methods of feedback. In addition to eliminating the noise and vibration associated with the dental hand-piece, lasers offer several unique advantages over current surgical technology for conservative dentistry. Under the appropriate irradiation conditions, lasers are capable of achieving markedly higher precision and selectivity, are well-suited for electronic control, can induce beneficial chemical and morphological changes in the walls of the drilled cavity that can render the tissues more resistant to further dental decay with enhanced adhesive properties to restorative materials. The specific aims of this proposal are to test the following hypotheses: 1) that caries lesions can be safely and selectively removed from tooth surfaces at clinically relevant rates using image guided laser ablation, and 2) that composite can be safely and selectively removed from tooth surfaces at clinically relevant rates using laser ablation in conjunction with spectral feedback. These fundamental studies will significantly advance our overall knowledge of laser-tissue interactions and facilitate the development of safer and more efficient laser systems for the removal of dental caries and restorative materials. The use of highly selective laser systems for the removal of dental caries and dental composites is likely to lead to the practice of more conservative dental procedures that will reduce the amount of healthy tissue loss that is generally associated with conventional cavity preparations and the repair of existing composite restorations."

"9327490","PROJECT SUMMARY  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are prevalent, costly to society, and frequently co-occur. In fact, nearly half of individuals in treatment for AUD meet diagnostic criteria for current PTSD. Both AUD and PTSD are moderately heritable and have overlapping latent genetic risk; however, etiological models examining the shared risk between these phenotypes are lacking. The drinking to cope self- medication model is a promising paradigm to inform research in this area. Although it is well accepted that coping-oriented drinking is linked with problematic alcohol use and increased likelihood of AUD, there is a paucity of research examining drinking to cope with trauma-related symptoms specifically. To date, there are no studies, phenotypic or genetic, on trauma-related drinking to cope. The present study seeks to fill this void by leveraging a genetically informative longitudinal cohort study from a large urban university (NIAAA-R37 AA011408) in order to achieve three primary aims: 1) examine the relationships between AUD symptoms, trauma-related drinking to cope, and PTSD symptoms and determine if trauma-related drinking to cope mediates the relationship between PTSD and AUD symptoms; 2) examine genetic variation (i.e., genome wide association [GWA] analyses) and aggregate risk (i.e., genome wide complex trait analyses [GCTA], polygenic risk score [PRS]) associated with trauma-related drinking, PTSD, and shared variation between the two phenotypes; and 3) apply bioinformatics tools to investigate genetic pathways associated with, and probable overlap between, trauma-related drinking and PTSD. The results of this study will aid in elucidating shared genetic influences underlying trauma-related drinking and PTSD, an area which remains poorly understood. The ability to identify individuals with higher biological risk for trauma-related drinking and PTSD will inform targeted prevention and integrative intervention strategies, particularly among individuals at increased psychosocial risk for problematic alcohol use and PTSD, such as college-age populations.  The proposed NRSA study has been developed with four specific training goals in mind: 1) develop expertise in the empirical study of trauma-related phenotypes (e.g., AUD, trauma-related drinking, PTSD); 2) gain a solid foundation in molecular and statistical genetics; 3) gain knowledge and experience in bioinformatics techniques, such as genetic pathway analyses; and 4) further cultivate professional development skills that will enhance the candidate?s background in support of becoming a knowledgeable and well-rounded academic researcher. These research and training aims reflect the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism?s (NIAAA) mission, which emphasizes clinically relevant, transdisciplinary research, as well as directly align with the NIAAA Strategic Objective to ?identify genes associated with vulnerability for alcohol dependence by employing new and emerging technologies, particularly on samples from study populations previously recruited for genetic research on alcohol dependence.? !"
"9317606","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias and increased risk of progression to acute leukemia. Therapeutic options and development of new drugs for patients with MDS are currently very limited and there is a great need for new therapeutic targets. A major recent discovery from large-scale sequencing studies was that over half of MDS patients harbor mutations in genes encoding splicing factors (SFs), with the 3 most commonly mutated being: splicing factor 3B, subunit 1 (SF3B1), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) and U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1). SF mutations are the most common class of mutations in MDS and occur early in the course of the disease. These strongly suggest that SF mutations are key to the pathogenesis of MDS and can likely provide new therapeutic opportunities. However the mechanisms by which they drive the disease are not understood. These mutations are heterozygous ?hotspot? mutations, which strongly suggests a gain or alteration of function mechanism ? corroborated by recent biochemical studies showing altered RNA binding specificities of the mutant SFs. Their mutual exclusivity provides yet another clue, as it suggests convergence in one or a few downstream targets. Identifying those targets could have tremendous implications for MDS, but presents a big challenge due to the cellular and genetic heterogeneity of primary patient samples and differences in gene isoforms among species. We (Papapetrou laboratory) have developed the first induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of MDS and provided proof-of-principle of their use for studying genetic mechanisms of the disease. For the current proposal, we have derived isogenic iPSC lines with the SRSF2 P95L mutation and shown that hematopoietic cells derived from them capture disease-relevant phenotypes and the altered RNA-binding affinity of mutant SRSF2. We (Yeo laboratory) have developed an enhanced CLIP-seq method (eCLIP) and used it to characterize for the first time in preliminary experiments the direct RNA binding of mutant SRSF2. In this multiple PI application we will join forces to identify common downstream effects of SF mutations that may constitute promising therapeutic targets. The proposed studies, which leverage the unique expertise of the Papapetrou lab in iPSC modeling of MDS, combined with the extensive expertise of the Yeo lab in RNA biology and genomics, will generate new insights into the pathogenesis of MDS with SF mutations and identify new therapeutic targets for drug development.  "
"9237321","DESCRIPTION (provided by candidate):   Breathing is a vital motor behavior that relies on diaphragm muscle contractions in mammals. The frequency and amplitude of breathing movements is controlled by neural networks residing in the brainstem and spinal cord. Degeneration of these networks leads to respiratory disorders, such as central sleep apneas, and, eventually, respiratory failure. My long term goal is to uncover the basic principles underlying respiratory circuit assembly so that we can begin to consider alternative treatment methods for respiratory dysfunction. A conundrum in the study of respiratory neural networks is that while significant progress has been made in defining the rhythmogenic circuits in the brain stem, the developmental origins, molecular identity and connectivity of spinal cord respiratory neurons remain unknown. Overall, the proposed research aims to define the genetic and molecular pathways that underlie spinal respiratory network assembly. We have recently demonstrated that the development of phrenic motor column (PMC) neurons in the cervical spinal cord, which innervate the diaphragm, requires the sustained activity of Hox5 genes. Mice lacking Hox5 genes in motor neurons (MNs) die of respiratory failure at birth and exhibit defects in multiple aspects of PMC identity, including clustering, axon guidance and diaphragm innervation. During the mentored part of this award, the role of Hox5 genes in PMC MNs will be further explored. Differential gene expression analysis will be carried out in order to identify genes acting downstream of Hox5 proteins to regulate distinct aspects of PMC development (Aim 1). Additionally, transsynaptic virus-based tracing approaches will be implored to examine how Hox5 removal from MNs affects the establishment of premotor inputs to the PMC (Aim 2). During the independent phase of the award, the role of Hox genes and their downstream targets in spinal cord respiratory interneuron development and connectivity will be examined (Aim 3). Addressing this question will rely heavily on genetic approaches, transsynaptic circuit labeling techniques and physiological respiratory assays, in which expertise will be acquired during the K99 phase. The mentored part of the research will be performed at the Dasen and Fishell labs at NYU Medical Center, an outstanding research environment that will provide all the equipment and facilities required for the proposed experiments. In addition, Dr. Kinkead at Laval University will act as a consultant and will provide training in the technique of plethysmography. I have assembled a committee who will oversee my progress and provide technical and intellectual input during the mentored part of the award. My previous experience in molecular neuroscience, in combination with a rigorous training plan, will ensure the successful completion of the proposed research aims, while the career development activities during the K99 phase of the award will facilitate a smooth transition to an independent position."
"9291884","270,000 individuals have a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the US. Of these, ~42,000 are eligible for treatment in the Veteran Health System, resulting in direct annual medical expenditures exceeding $716 million per year. Walking impairment is a hallmark consequence of motor incomplete (i)SCI. Preventing neuromuscular deficits after iSCI has the potential to improve walking and positively impact functional independence and quality of life (QOL) in Veterans with SCI. The musculoskeletal decline primarily results from reduced neural drive after iSCI and disuse atrophy caused by reduced standing and walking (i.e., low muscle loading). These issues are exacerbated by the dramatic loss of testosterone (T) following iSCI in men. T replacement therapy (TRT) is a viable therapy to improve musculoskeletal function in non-neurologically impaired hypogonadal men. A prospective clinical trial has reported that TRT improves lower extremity lean mass after motor complete SCI, indicating the ability of TRT to produce musculoskeletal benefit independent of physical rehabilitation. Preclinical work by mentors Borst/Yarrow has shown preserved hindlimb musculature and improved locomotor activity in a rodent iSCI model following T administration. However, the ability of TRT to safely improve neuromuscular and locomotor function remains to be determined in men with iSCI, a population that exhibits impaired neuromuscular activation, reduced muscle mass/strength, and functional limitations after injury. Borst/Yarrow have also demonstrated that finasteride (F), an FDA approved 5?-reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of T to dihydrotestosterone, completely prevented prostate enlargement resulting from TRT without compromising the associated musculoskeletal benefits in hypogonadal elderly men, indicating that F co-administration improves the TRT risk-to-benefit ratio. This Career Development Award (CDA)-1 will embed itself in a recently funded VA Merit Award which is focused on evaluating the safety/efficacy of TRT plus finasteride (TRT+F) in hypogonadal men with iSCI who exhibit ambulatory dysfunction. The parent Merit Award is a 12-month double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial assessing: thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), knee extension (KE) neuro-muscular function including strength and voluntary muscle, bone mineral density/body composition, and safety measures. This CDA-1 will expand beyond the above evaluations by adding several unique gait-related measures (functional outcomes that were not originally proposed) that will be performed at baseline, and at follow-up times of 3 and 6 months of treatment, in order to gauge functional improvements following the TRT+F vs. placebo.  Twenty-six participants will be recruited and screened from the NF/SG VHS and will be treated according to the parent Merit protocol. Testosterone-enanthate (Delatestryl®) or placebo will be administered once weekly (i.m.) and finasteride (Proscar®) or placebo will be administered daily (p.o.) in FDA approved doses. The primary goal of this CDA-1 is to determine if TRT improves self-selected walking speed in hypogonadal men with iSCI. The primary outcome is 10m preferred walking speed and secondary outcomes will include walking features (i.e. cadence, step length, step width and step variability using the GaitRite® instrumented walking mat). Secondarily, we will evaluate whether walking speed is associated with thigh muscle quality (torque per unit CSA via MRI), KE torque (via dynamometry), and/or KE voluntary activation (via rate of EMG rise) after iSCI and whether TRT+F alters these associations. We hypothesize that walking speed will improve following TRT+F and that positive associations will be found between walking speed and thigh muscle quality, KE torque and/or KE neuromuscular activation. Analysis of covariance will be used where the dependent variable is defined as the average of the 3 and 6 month walking speeds, with baseline walking speed as a covariate. Pearson Correlations will be assessed for prognostic factors for improvement in walking speed at each time point correlated with baseline parameters."
"9332959","PROJECT SUMMARY Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease with compromised innate immunity as indicated by susceptibility to bacterial and viral infection. Despite the identification of genetic polymorphisms in genes in the innate immune signaling pathways, such as TLR1/2/6/9 and NOD1/2, the role of defective innate immunity in AD pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In this study, we provide new evidence to support the contribution of defective innate immunity in Th2 activation and AD pathogenesis with Trim32 knockout mice as a model. In response to topical application of imiquimod, a toll-like receptor agonist used in an established psoriasis model, we observed that Trim32-deficient mice instead developed AD-like phenotypes, including dermal infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells, increased Th2 cytokine production, and elevated serum IgE, compared to the expected Th17 response in Trim32-competent wild type littermates. Based upon this, we hypothesize that Trim32 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase with innate anti-viral activity) regulates homeostasis in the host response to infection and, further, that defects in Trim32 pathway proteins or functionality can predispose to Th2 atopic phenotypes. In seeking Trim32 substrate proteins potentially responsible for atopic features in these mice and in human AD, we provide novel evidence for Trim32 regulation of protein kinase PKC?, a known Stat6 activator of a signaling cascade culminating in IL-4/IL-5 expression in T cells and IgE production by B cells in allergy models in mice. We therefore propose to address the role of Trim32/ PKC? axis in the regulation of molecular signaling events that are responsible for the development of AD-like disease in mouse models, in parallel to validation of findings in human AD patient samples. In view of our discoveries, we propose the following aims: 1) Define the role of Trim32 in regulating a PKC? mediated IL-4/Stat6 signaling pathway in mouse models; 2) Investigate the molecular and structural basis of a homeostatic negative regulatory axis of Trim32 and PKC?; and 3) Evaluate the Trim32 and PKC? axis in association with AD severity and AD susceptibility to viral infection in humans. Our studies will incorporate Multiplex Immunohistochemistry Image Cytometry for analysis of human skin biopsies and advanced imaging technologies to identify localization of interacting proteins by super resolution microscopy, correlative light and electron microscopy, and molecular structure analysis. This study will provide new insight for better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Th2 polarization underlying AD pathology and promises to improve prediction of patient severity of disease and treatment response and to suggest novel intervention strategies to restore healthy immune and skin homeostasis in AD patients.  "

Students need exposure to research, clinical, and industrial environments to provide a solid foundation and understanding of the complex and diverse nature of biomedical engineering. To meet this need, we propose to expand our 6-credit team-based interdisciplinary senior design program to include clinically motivated projects identified during previous clinical immersion experiences. Within the context of the design project the students will identify the significance o the unmet clinical need and impact of finding a practical solution, outline the design constraints, and generate a working prototype as a solution to the unmet clinical need. The goals of this proposal are to (a) translate the unmet clinical needs into open-ended, team-based senior design projects to provide true bench-to-bedside problem solving opportunities, (b) broaden the students exposure and understanding of challenges that are specific to clinical environments while strengthening communication skills with clinical professionals, and (c) evaluate the effectiveness of the incorporation of clinically driven design projects into the senior design program. Ultimately we hope that exposure to guided but open-ended challenges from clinical professionals will broaden the students' understanding of the biomedical field, create effective engineering solutions to address clinical needs, and prepare students for careers in biomedical engineering."
"9332814","Project Summary/Abstract Osteoporosis is a progressive bone disease that reduces bone mineral density (BMD) leading to an increased risk of bone fracture. It largely affects women post-menopause who incur a sharp decline in estrogen production, which has a key role in the proper growth and maturation of bone. Alternative and integrative health approaches for preventing disease occurrence, primarily through use of natural dietary supplements, are currently being sought due to the adverse health risks associated with conventional hormone replacement therapies. To assess the effectiveness of these disease interventions, a well-established novel and sensitive screening technique incorporating a biological tracer, calcium-41 (41Ca), is used to rapidly and sensitively monitor bone resorption. Measured is the urinary 41Ca:Ca isotope ratio, monitored by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) to detect changes in bone calcium metabolism. This study proposes to develop a 41Ca simulation study to serve as a tool to investigate how inputs of sample size, number of control periods, and number of control samples per period will affect the output: (1) the accuracy (standard error) of reported mean estimates of treatment effect (2) the power of the study to detect given effect sizes and (3) the cost of the experimental study. Ultimately, this tool will determine ?optimal? 41Ca experimental designs, which are uniquely defined as the most efficient study designs that preserve the accuracy and reliability of the original experimental estimates but require a reduced number of experimental samples, which notably provides a cost reduction. In parallel, this study proposes to develop a 45Ca simulation tool using the ovariectomized (OVX) rat model to determine the optimal experimental design for treatment efficacy on bone calcium retention.

"9206915","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wolbachia are obligate intracellular bacteria and one of the great bacterial pandemics in the history of life. As germline specialists in millions of invertebrate species, Wolbachia manipulate sexual reproduction to increase the fitness of infected females, which are the transmitting sex of Wolbachia. The most common reproductive pathology, Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI), is expressed as a post-fertilization embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Wolbachia-infected females, however, rescue the paternally- delivered embryonic defects and thus gain a large fitness advantage over uninfected females. Despite several decades of intense research aimed at identifying Wolbachia's ability to encrypt the sperm genome and cause CI, the underlying genetic and molecular bases of CI remain elusive. Our lab is uniquely situated to solve this mystery as we recently identified, for the first time, two Wolbachia genes that induce CI-like lethality in embryos. These two genes, which we denote CI Candidate 1 (CIC1) and CI Candidate 2 (CIC2), are preferentially expressed in infected host testes, as expected for genes involved in CI. Moreover, transgene expression in Wolbachia-free host testes induces embryonic lethality. Most notably, the transgene-induced lethality is rescued by Wolbachia in eggs from infected females. Thus, CIC1 and CIC2 recapitulate the nature of CI. Here, we will validate these candidates as bona fide CI genes by benchmarking their modes of action against wild type CI induced by Wolbachia cells. In Aim 1, we will use fluorescent microscopy to compare the embryonic defects induced by Wolbachia transgenes with those induced by conventional Wolbachia infections. In Aim 2, we will test if the Wolbachia candidate genes are capable of rescuing CI induced either by the transgenes themselves or a native Wolbachia infection. In Aim 3, we will test whether CIC1 and CIC2 require Juvenile Hormone Inducible-26, a host protein that is partially required for CI. To the best of our knowledge, this project is the closest the field has come to validating candidate genes that cause CI. If successful, the scholarship will pioneer genetic studies of symbionts that induce reproductive pathogenesis, inform Wolbachia's efficacy and delivery as a tool to control diverse zoonotic diseases, and provide multiple lines of evidence for the discovery of the first CI genes."
"9276345","Summary My lab's work has been at the forefront of studies showing that nuclear organization and long-range chromatin interactions play an essential role in recombination and gene regulation. In this application we have incorporated two distinct projects that extend this work. The first project focuses on understanding the mechanisms underlying feedback control of RAG activity in individual lymphocytes and the consequence of de-regulated cleavage. V(D)J recombination has to be tightly regulated to ensure that cleavage does not continue in cis, or in trans on accessible target loci that undergo recombination at overlapping stages of development as well as on actively transcribed off-target loci with cryptic recombination signal sequence (RSS) sites that bind the RAG proteins. Our recent studies reveal that ATM and the C terminus of RAG2 have an important role in feedback control of cleavage in individual cells through modulation of nuclear organization. This limits the number of potential substrates for translocation and provides an important mechanism for protecting genome stability. Given that an absence of the C terminus of RAG2 and inhibition of ATM kinase activity lead to similar phenotypes we hypothesized they could act in the same pathway. In our most recent unpublished work we identified a conserved SQ target phosphorylation site on RAG2 (residues 365-366) that recapitulates the function of the RAG2 C-terminus and ATM in regulating cleavage. However, in contrast to these two mutants, RAG2-S356A has a stable RAG post cleavage complex. Thus, for the first time we have a tool to study feedback regulation in the absence of any confounding repair defect. Here we aim to determine!(i) the mechanism underlying feedback control of RAG activity in individual cells, (ii) the consequences of cleavage deregulation on allelic exclusion, genome instability and gene regulation and (ii) the mechanism by which deregulated RAG activity contributes to oncogenesis. The second project focuses on understanding the mode of action of enhancers in controlling gene regulation in the context of 3D chromatin structure. Enhancers play a fundamental role in ensuring precise control of transcriptional patterns in development and differentiation. Physical contacts between genes and these regulatory elements are essential for proper transcriptional control and maintenance of these interactions is critical for preventing aberrations in physiological processes that could manifest as disease states. Using new tools developed under the support of GM086852 and GM112192 we are now able to investigate these interactions using live imaging systems and high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (4C). Specifically, our aim is to investigate the mode of action of enhancers in the context of: (i) enhancers that control the regulation of more than one target gene, (ii) the functional relevance of clusters of enhancers that constitute super-enhancers in regulating target loci and the factors that contribute to their evolution, and finally (iii) the potential role of transposable elements in driving gene regulatory networks in health and disease."

"9246330","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Clinical Research Center (P50) proposal is focused on providing a neuroimaging-based examination of language recovery in individuals with chronic aphasia resulting from stroke. The goal of the Center is to bring together the expertise of clinical investigators with mutual scientific interest and complementary expertise in understanding the cognitive and neural correlates of stroke-induced language recovery, the effects of language treatment on these processes, and cognitive and neural factors (biomarkers) of language/brain recovery. The proposal includes three subprojects, which examine language recovery in three language domains, with experts in each serving as PI: Subproject 1. The neurobiology of recovery of spoken naming in aphasia, Swathi Kiran (Boston University) and David Caplan (Harvard, MGH); Subproject 2. The neurobiology of recovery of written naming in acquired dysgraphia, Brenda Rapp (Johns Hopkins); and Subproject 3. The neurobiology of recovery of sentence processing in agrammatism, Cynthia Thompson (Northwestern). Combining the expertise and efforts of the PIs on this project will allow us to study aphasia recovery in a comprehensive manner. At the heart of the approach is a common set of cognitive and neuroimaging measures, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural and perfusion imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which we will use as tools for identifying, monitoring and evaluating cognitive-brain changes at several time points, coinciding with treatment application and spanning a one-year period. Cross-project data will be deposited into a centralized Neuroimaging and Data Analysis Core (Core B) where they will be analyzed by an expert team of neuroimaging specialists and statisticians, led by Todd Parnsh (PI; neurophysicist at Northwestern), using state-of-the art neuroimaging acquisition and analysis methods. This will allow us to examine the effects of treatment designed to improve specific aphasic language deficits and to answer questions relevant to the relation between language and brain variables and treatment-induced versus natural recovery in chronic aphasia. The work will highly impact clinical intervention practices for individuals with aphasia, providing importan information relevant to the effects of treatment and prognosis for recovery, and contribute to knowledge about brain plasticity and the reorganization of language functions in the adult brain."

The progress presented in this proposal has required DF/HCC leadership, its combined resources, and, most importantly, its consortium structure. The overarching scientific vision is to unite the members. The research of the Center is carried out in Research Programs that cross both scientific and institutional boundaries. In addition, the Center supports Shared Resources dedicated to enhancing scientific efficiency available to all Center members. The unified clinical research infrastructure has made it easier for members to conduct clinical trials across the Center. Indirect indications of scientific progress are the substantial growth in the Center's grant portfolio, from $233 million in 1999 to $406 million in 2004, to $623 million in 2009, to $683M and the award of multiple translational grants that transcend organizational boundaries (e.g., SPOREs, SCORs, P01s, U01s, and SU2Cs). There is also an array of hypothesis-driven, Early Phase (pilot, I, I-II), and proof-of-concept trials, made possible through the development and execution of the Center, that are conducted daily across the consortium."
"9360725","The VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS) requires the purchase of an Atlantis Easy Cage and Rack Washer System, manufactured by iwt-Techniplast (Westchester, PA, USA), to support its Research Animal Facility. The current cage washer is over 13 years old, and has required approximately 15 service and repair visits over the last six months. The Atlantis Easy Cage Washer is a robust system that is capable of processing most of the equipment and material used in the lab animal facility such as: cages, trolleys, tables, racks, IVC racks, and bottles, all in the same machine. The proposed new system is compact, user friendly, easy to maintain, and has a high level cleaning performance. The standard microbiologically validated wash cycle can be completed in less than 10 minutes, giving it a capacity of up to 600 rodent cages/hour. It has 10 programmable washing cycles for multiple uses. The unit features a stainless steel washing chamber with two double-layer clear glass doors, as well as inflatable gaskets for water and air tightness. The machine features 120° oscillating arms fitted all along the side walls of the chamber, 48 wash nozzles, and 48 rinse nozzles; which assure a constant and consistent coverage of the load. The nested wash and rinse arms with separate circuits avoid cross-contamination. The Animal facility at the VAHMCS is an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Care (AAALAC)-accredited and occupies approximately 10,900 sq. ft. of space in the basement of the Baltimore VA Medical Center. The central wash area in animal facility is a major operational hub for the cleaning, sanitization, and sterilization of materials and equipment- entering, leaving, and re-circulating through the animal facility. Effective cage washing is an important aspect of an animal care and use program to control the possible spread of unwanted microorganisms. It supports ten to twenty funded VA animal protocols at any given time, with an average overnight census of 1000-1200 rodents.

"9312414","The intestinal Apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium (Crypto) is a leading cause of diarrhea and death in malnourished young children and untreated HIV/AIDS patients in the resource-constrained world and a major cause of waterborne outbreaks in developed countries Despite the global burden of Crypto, treatment options for cryptosporidiosis are severely limited. There are several constraints to drug development for cryptosporidiosis. The host parasite interactions that mediate pathogenesis and the pathways and molecules that can be targeted for drug development are poorly understood. The lack of a primary human intestinal model that recapitulates human intestinal structure and function and supports continuous infection of wild type and transgenic Crypto is a major limitation to understanding pathogenesis and pre-clinical screening for anti- cryptosporidial interventions.  We recently developed a bioengineered 3D primary human intestinal model in vitro using silk protein scaffolds seeded with human IEC lines and myofibroblasts. This model supported continuous C. parvum infection for at least 15 days and C. parvum from infected scaffolds could re-infect new scaffolds for up to three cycles. However, since IEC lines may not recapitulate normal human IEC structure and function, we incorporated human ileal enteroids (instead of IEC lines) into the system. Our preliminary data indicate that enteroids incorporated into this model which supports robust C. parvum infection.  The overall goal of this project is to investigate host-parasite interactions of human Crypto infection and develop drug screening for cryptosporidiosis using 3D human ileal enteroid-based models under flow, peristaltic and low oxygen conditions. Our central hypothesis is that this model is a breakthrough technological advance that will expedite investigation of human Crypto infection and facilitate pre-clinical testing of interventions for cryptosporidiosis.  The Specific Aims are to: 1) elucidate host-parasite interactions in Crypto infection in bioengineered primary 3D human enteroid-based tissue model under peristaltic, flow and low oxygen conditions in a bioreactor system and 2) evaluate an integrated 3D primary human enteroid-based ?mini-gut? model under the same conditions for selected host-parasite interactions and as a pre-clinical model of cryptosporidiosis for screening of drugs and probiotics.  Success in establishing 3D, enteroid-based human intestinal tissue models and achieving continuous propagation of infection will be transformative for Crypto research. The model can be used to study host- parasite-microbe interactions and test targeted interventions for cryptosporidiosis.    "
"9303378","GENOMICS AND IMAGING FACILITIES CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The CEHS Genomics and Imaging Facilities Core (GIFC) provides CEHS members with a broad set of instrumentation, training and expertise to address environmental health using systems biology approaches. This Core provides access to massively parallel sequencing, oligonucleotide arrays, automated fluidics, microscopy and bioinformatics and IT support. Over the previous funding period, this Core has expanded significantly with over $3 million in additional equipment and a significant increase in space allocation. These expansions include the acquisition of several Illumina sequencers and significant investments in bioinformatics and bioIT. The GIFC is comprised of the CEHS Imaging Facility, overseen by Dr. Robert Croy and the MIT BioMicro Center, a joint institutional shared resource that provides the genomics and bioinformatics resources in the core, overseen by Dr. Stuart Levine. The BioMicro Center is the central genomics and bioinformatics technology resource at MIT and it is jointly supported by the CEHS, the Departments of Biological Engineering and Biology, and the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. While over half of all CEHS members have utilized the GIFC in the current funding period, the CEHS only provides 5% of the support for the Facilities Core, and members have benefitted extensively from equipment donated from a broad variety of sources including charitable and institutional support. The GIFC activities can be divided into four major areas of technology for which the core provides both expertise and training. Genomics assays, including Affymetrix and Agilent microarrays, Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing and library construction, offer CEHS members the assay a broad variety of questions from how cells respond to environmental challenges to how the environment impacts the microbiome. High- throughput assays, including qPCR, plate readers and automated liquid handling allow CEHS members to significantly increase sample throughput. Microscopy, including flow-cytometry and the Cellomics Arrayscan, provide assays of changes in protein expression and localization, and bioinformatics and bioIT provide both infrastructure as well as assistance in the analyses of these large datasets. Services are offered as walkup services where the investigator will directly operate the instrument following training, fee-for-service services, where samples are processed or analyzed for the user on highly specialized equipment by the GIFC staff and instruments that can be operated in either way."
"9278867","One of the biggest surprises of the human genome project was the vast amount of transcription observed in  the noncoding genome, comprised of thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). In previous work, we  identified a few lncRNAs that contribute important functional roles in human reprograming and maintenance of  pluripotency. Our previous proposal, in collaboration with the Drs. Meissner's and Gnirke's proposals, has now  identified more than a hundred lncRNAs that are specific to the pluripotent state, dynamically regulated during  reprograming and enriched to reside near key developmental regulators. We have also identified an emerging  mechanistic theme of lncRNAs as regulatory factors in shaping nuclear architecture and, in turn, driving  pluripotent gene expression programs. Based on these studies we now propose to take the next leap forward  towards addressing the following pressing questions:  Aim 1: Do pluripotent specific expressed lncRNA loci that are in proximity to pluripotency and developmental  regulators functionally contribute to the maintenance of pluripotency? It is tempting to think that lncRNAs that  reside near key pluripotency and developmental regulators may function in cis to either activate pluripotency  factors or repress differentiation genes. Here we will systematically apply a transcriptional inhibition (CRISPR-i)  screen on a hundred of these lncRNA loci for those that are required to maintain pluripotency. We will further  perform numerous individual validation tests and RNase-H mediated depletion of lncRNAs in parallel. Finally,  we will determine influences on pluripotent and differentiation gene-expression programs upon lncRNA loss-of  function (LOF) using massively-parallel RNA-sequencing technologies.  Aim 2: What are the genome wide RNA-DNA and RNA-Protein localization properties of nuclear lncRNAs that  facilitate proper pluripotency gene-expression programs? We have revised the proposal for a deeper focus on  FIRRE and CISTR-ACT, two lncRNAs that, as determined in the previous proposal, share key properties highly  relevant to the proposed study: required for stemness, shared mechanism of facilitating nuclear architecture  and strongly linked to human disease. By performing loss of function studies on identified protein partners we  can begin to determine the underlying influences of RNA/DNA sequences, chromatin environments, three-  dimensional proximity and protein interactions on lncRNA nuclear localization.  Aim 3: What are the dynamics of FIRRE and CISTR-ACT mediated nuclear organization. We now have  adapted CRISPR-Display to Live Cell Imaging (CLING). With this approach we can monitor the 3D interactions  of up to 5 chromosomes through time in a living cell. We will investigate the WT and LOF and GOF states of  FIRRE and CISTR-ACT chromosomal dynamics in pluripotency and during reprograming. Collectively, these  studies will identify the molecular interactions of lncRNAs with DNA and Protein and how they facilitate three  and four dimensional organization of the pluripotent genome."
"9231509","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPSI, Hurler-Scheie Disease) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which the alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme is depleted or absent from the affected individual. Such individuals have a limited capacity to process glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) causing lysosomal buildup leading to cell and organ failure and eventually death at a young age. The prevalence of this disease is approximately 1:100,000. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) are currently the best options for MPSI patients, however HSCT carries a significant patient risk profile and ERT remains inefficient and costly (~$400,000 per year). There remains a significant need for additional MPSI treatments, both for reduction of peripheral and also brain GAGs, and to supplement ERT. We engaged in a high throughput screen to identify novel compounds to upregulate IDUA expression. We discovered that stilbene family of generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds (e.g. piceatannol, resveratrol) significantly increase in IDUA expression and activity. In this current application, we aim to develop stilbene related compounds to validate their activity in MPSI models, with a view toward eventual clinical translation. To do this we will first validate our findings within the compound family and identify and characterize natural product analogs that have potentially better in vitro and in vivo activity. We will validate our findings in additional patient derived samples, to identify the patient cohorts best suited to treatment, and identify those that do not respond. We aim to show that the brain penetrant compounds upregulate IDUA in vivo and improve both GAG clearance and behavioral outcomes (locomotion, cognitive ability, etc.). Finally, we will work to uncover the clinical potential of te compounds in order to enable translation for MPSI disease. As preliminary evidence to support this work, we identified one compound, piceatannol, that after one month of daily dosing showed a small, but statistically significant increase (~25%; p<0.05) in brain IDUA enzymatic activity and a considerable increase in plasma IDUA enzymatic activity (>500%; p<0.05) in wild type mice. These findings will need to be replicated in validated disease specific animal models, specifically the W402X-synologous mouse. This mouse model replicates the mutations found in the patient derived cells that were used for HTS and initial identification of piceatannol. The W402X premature stop codon mutation is found in some 40% of MPSI patients. We also show that piceatannol treatment of additional patient derived fibroblasts results in increased IDUA activity suggesting broader application of these compounds in MPSI patients. The underlying premise of this application is that upregulation of IDUA enzyme levels, even with enzymes that are inefficient due to mutation, will result in beneficial reduction of GAG levels in the periphery and possibly also in the brain that could translate to clinically meaningful outcomes in patients."
"9295277","Recent genome-wide studies revealed that the majority of the human transcriptome consists of non-coding transcripts, but their function and mode of action remains elusive (2-8). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) provide an exciting class of therapeutic targets to pursue in terms of breast cancer progression and metastasis. To identify lncRNAs that could function as drivers of tumor progression and metastasis in breast cancer, I performed an RNA-sequencing screen on transgenic mouse models representing both luminal B and HER2- amplified subtypes of human breast cancer. I identified hundreds of lncRNAs that are overexpressed in tumors compared to normal mammary glands. As metastasis is the main cause of breast cancer mortality, I will focus specifically on lncRNAs that can impact tumor progression and prevent metastasis. In the proposed project, I aim to assess a previously uncharacterized lncRNA, termed Mammary Tumor Associated RNA 20 (MaTAR20). I performed antisense knockdown assays of MaTAR20 in vitro and in vivo, leading to reduction of tumor cell proliferation and invasion as well as drastically reduced metastasis. I propose to further evaluate MaTAR20 as a driver of metastasis by generating genetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function models using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Aim 1). These will be used to further investigate which step of the metastatic cascade is impacted by MaTAR20. In addition, I will apply single-cell sequencing to elucidate the expression of MaTAR20 in the leading edge of the tumor, in circulating tumor cells and metastatic nodules (Aim 2). Analysis of the data will reveal differences of MaTAR20 expression in clonal populations throughout the course of tumor progression. Further, functional integration of single-cell transcriptomes, genomes and methylomes will reveal genetic and epigenetic factors regulating MaTAR20 expression. Finally, I will decipher signaling pathways and cellular interaction partners of MaTAR20 to identify the molecular function of the lncRNA (Aim 3). This project will investigate the great potential of MaTAR20 as a new therapeutic and prognostic target. During the mentored K99 phase, I will work closely with my mentor Dr. David Spector, a leader in the field of non-coding RNA biology, and collaborators Drs. Mikala Egeblad, John Wilkinson and Michael Wigler, recognized experts in mouse models of breast cancer, mammary tumor histology and single cell analysis respectively. Training in innovative new technologies like genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 and single-cell sequencing will enable me to successfully complete the proposed project and to establish myself as an independent investigator. My long- term goal is to become a tenured professor and develop a cutting edge research program studying lncRNAs in breast cancer progression and tumor evolution. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory provides an outstanding scientific environment for my research and training, being a conference hub for world-renowned meetings and courses. In addition, several programs are available here to assist transition into independence such as grant writing workshops and seminars on leadership in biosciences."

"9442906","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, thousands of patients in need of a kidney transplant find a live donor but are relegated to forego the benefits of live donor transplantation because of ABO or HLA incompatibilities. They can participate in kidney paired donation (KPD, also called kidney exchanges or chains), but >50% will not find a compatible match through KPD due to broad HLA sensitization or hard-to-match blood types. Without incompatible live donor kidney transplantation (ILDKT), the only option for these patients is the 90,000-patient deceased donor waiting list, where waiting times average 5-8 years and death rates average 5-10% per year.  ILDKT is an emerging practice in which patients can receive transplants across antibody barriers through the use of various pre- and post-operative desensitization strategies. We recently showed that close to 100 centers perform ILDKT in the US, although few have studied or reported their outcomes. While great gains have been recently made in this field, future growth is currently limited by inferences from single-center reports which suffer from publication bias, lack of statistical power, inability to compare protocol effectiveness within a single-center (because of protocol homogeneity within a given center), and lack of generalizability.  The only way to move this field forward is for centers to study outcomes collaboratively, but data collection burden is an obvious concern. A mandated, national transplant registry does exist, but data relevant to ILDKT are not collected. We propose a large, highly efficient, mixed retrospective/prospective multi-center linkage of minimal-burden ILDKT-specific primary data to rich, longitudinal national registry data, through which we can: (1) quantify patient, antibody, and treatment protocol factors associated with ILDKT outcomes; (2) identify patients who derive survival benefit from ILDKT compared with other available options; and (3) explore center-level associations with ILDKT outcomes, including center-volume relationships.  No single-center studies have been powered to study risk prediction in ILDKT. We will collect ILDKT- specific data of approximately 5800 recipients and link to the national registry for multivariate analyses of factors associated with outcomes. To compare ILDKT with the other available options, i.e. waiting for a compatible deceased donor or KPD, we will use a Markov decision process model that combine inferences drawn from observational data of the waiting list with inferences drawn from simulations of KPD. We will use interaction term analysis to identify factors that amplify or attenuate the effect of ILDKT on survival benefit.  This researh will establish a framework for patient selection and counseling for ILDKT that is evidence- based and in the best interest of patients. Robust quantification of the risk and survival benefit associated with ILDKT is novel and will be immediately useable clinically throughout the country. A better understanding of this emerging modality at a national, generalizable level will help improve the feasibility, availability, and quality of ILDKT for the thousands of patients each year who could potentially benefit from it."
"9246571","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low bone mineral density (BMD) has been linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) independent of traditional osteoporosis risk factors including steroid use, cachexia, and decreased physical activity. Although the increased prevalence of osteoporosis contributes to morbidity and mortality in COPD patients, little is known regarding indications for BMD assessment or osteoporosis mechanisms in this susceptible population. The rate of BMD loss is an independent risk factor for fracture. Yet, cross-sectional dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) assessment of BMD provides no information about rate of BMD decline. Immunologic alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of both COPD and osteoporosis but the role of autoimmunity in COPD-related osteoporosis has not been studied. An independent association between emphysema and low BMD has been supported by the literature, but the mechanism for this association is also unknown. This project's overall goal is to study how specific autoimmune processes relate to concurrent emphysema progression and accelerated BMD decline in male and female smokers with lung disease. This goal will be accomplished through extension to six years of an already established longitudinal cohort with pre- existing baseline and two-year assessments of BMD, radiographic emphysema, pulmonary function, and autoimmune biomarker levels. The association of an autoimmune biomarker, anti-glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) IgG, with emphysema progression, measured by quantitative CT scan, and BMD loss, measured by serial DXA, over the six-year time interval will be studied in smokers with emphysema or airflow obstruction. A series of in vitro osteoclast studies will be performed to assess the effect of autoantibodies to GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein intimately involved in the ER stress response, on osteoclast formation, proliferation, and activity. The findings from this project will identify criteria for smokers at risk of accelerated BMD loss in whom early and serial measurements of BMD may be warranted, provide insight into pathogenic mechanisms linking emphysema and osteoporosis, and provide novel targets for osteoporosis prevention and treatment strategies in patients with COPD."

We will recruit participants from Ph.D. students in their second or third year of study in any/all of these departments. Those accepted into the program will participate in an intensive year of training courses, seminars, and workshops, beginning with introductory seminars in late summer and ending with a capstone project by each participant in the spring. Each trainee will be assigned a secondary thesis advisor with biomedical Big Data science expertise complementing that of the primary thesis advisor. Specialized training will focus on three pillars: (1) translation of biomedical and experimental knowledge and scientific questions of interest into formal, realistic problems of causal and statistical estimation; (2) scalable Big Data computing; and (3) targeted machine learning with causal and statistical inference. Activities will include courses in machine learning targeted learning, statistical programming, and Big Data computing, as well as workshops led by the Berkeley Data Science Institute, Statistical Computing Facility, and Berkeley Research Computing. The capstone course will involve a collaborative project in biomedical science involving the integrated and combined application of skills acquired by the trainees in the three foundational areas. Trainees will also benefit from group seminars, retreats, and interdisciplinary meetings that build a core identity with the cadre and the program. This proposal dovetails with several data science and precision medicine initiatives at UC Berkeley and comes at an ideal time to influence how data science is taught to all graduate students, focusing on biomedical research across campus."
"9329010","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):¨Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major complication of systemic atherosclerosis which affects approximately 12 million Americans and puts them at risk for lower extremity amputation and death. The presence of diabetes (DM) in individuals with PAD further increases the risk of amputation and death compared to PAD alone. Current medical treatments target systemic atherosclerosis but are not able to improve perfusion to the ischemic limb and directly treat the problem in PAD. There is a pressing clinical need for therapeutic approaches for PAD.  Using an established preclinical model of PAD (hind limb ischemia), we previously showed that a quantitative trait locus on the short arm of mouse chromosome 7 (termed LSQ-1) determined perfusion recovery outcomes. Here we have further refined this locus to a region containing 25 genes. Through gene expression profiling we identified 5 genes that are differentially expressed in the ischemic hind limbs of the 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6 and Balb/c) that were used in the original QTL identification. Additionally, we identified ADAM12 as the most differentially expressed of the 5 genes and explored its role in perfusion recovery. We find that ADAM12 is : a) up-regulated in ischemic mouse hind limbs in C57BL/6 mice and in endothelial cells (ECs) exposed to simulated ischemia, b) a knock-down of ADAM12 in vivo in C57BL/6 mice was sufficient to impair perfusion recovery and in vitro decreased EC proliferation, tube formation and survival in simulated ischemia, c) over-expression of ADAM12 in vivo in the Balb/c mouse strain that had poor up-regulation of ADAM12 was sufficient to improve its perfusion recovery following HLI and in vitro increased EC proliferation and survival in hypoxia. These effects of ADAM12 were at least in part, through activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2. Additionally, we find that in humans with PAD a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ADAM12 is associated with critical limb ischemia, a severe form of PAD. This data suggests that ADAM12 may play a central role in PAD outcomes.  To better understand ADAM12 regulation in ischemia we explored the role of miR29a, a microRNA shown to suppress ADAM12 expression in fibroblast. We find that miR29a overexpression can suppress endothelial cell ADAM12 up-regulation in ischemia. Additionally, we and others have shown that the same C57BL/6 strain that upregulates ADAM12 robustly and recovers favorable following HLI, recovers poorly when DM1 or DM2 is superimposed. Therefore we analyzed miR29a and ADAM12 expression in ischemic hind limbs of C57BL/6 mice with DM1 or DM2 compared to DM C57BL/6 without DM. We found in C57BL/6 mice with DM1 or DM2 miR29a expression is not suppressed and the expression of ADAM12 is blunted. Consistent with these preclinical findings, we also found human skeletal muscle biopsy from PAD patients with DM show elevated levels of miR29a compared to those with PAD alone.  Taken together this results we form the central hypothesis that in the absence of DM, PAD/HLI suppresses miR29a expression, resulting in up-regulation of ADAM12. Dysregulation of this pathway in DM contributes to poorer PAD outcomes. Aim 1 Determine whether miR29a negatively regulates ADAM12 expression in the ischemic hind limbs and whether this is sufficient to impair perfusion recovery and increase tissue loss following HLI. Aim 2 will investigate the therapeutic potential of systemic delivery of anti-miR29a compared to systemic delivery of ADAM12 gene on perfusion recovery and tissue loss in mice with type 1 or type 2 DM following HLI. We will establish the effects of these therapeutic strategies on arteriogenesis in the abductor muscles, angiogenesis and circulating progenitors in the ischemic hind limbs. Aim 3 will use an existing human skeletal muscle bio-bank to determine whether a) miR29a and ADAM12 protein expression differs in skeletal muscles of individuals with PAD versus controls without PAD. b) In individuals with PAD we will establish whether miR29a and ADAM12 protein expression in the lower extremity skeletal muscles differ dependent on DM status. c) Across all subjects with PAD, determine whether lower extremity skeletal muscle miR29a and ADAM12 expression will correlate with clinical measures of PAD severity (ankle brachial index and peak walking time)."
"9249531","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging evidence suggests that patient-centered communication practices are essential to the delivery of high quality, reliable and safe patient care. However, despite trials demonstrating the efficacy of specific patient-centered communication strategies, implementation of practices within healthcare systems is poor. A reason may be that an organization does not prioritize or support patient-centered communication practices. Advancing research to determine the relationship between organizational patient-centered communication climate and patient outcomes is critical to demonstrate its value and to identify mechanisms whereby modifying organizational patient-centered communication climate will have the most impact. The goal of this proposal is to advance understanding of the practices, determinants and associated patient outcomes of organizational patient-centered communication climate. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the provision of life-sustaining dialysis treatment provides a unique and robust setting to examine organizational communication climate. Patients with ESRD are at significantly higher risk for mortality, hospitalization, and poor quality of life. Despite advances in the technology o dialysis care, outcomes are persistently poor indicating the need for novel strategies to improve patient health. We hypothesize that organizational communication climate contributes significantly to individual patient reported and clinical outcomes, and may overcome disparities in outcomes among vulnerable patients. We will leverage the resources of the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), a representative prospective international cohort study since 1996, in 21 countries, aimed to identify modifiable dialysis practices associated with improved patient outcomes. To address our hypothesis, the aims are: 1) To characterize organizational patient-centered communication climate and its association with patients' satisfaction with provider communication, dialysis knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-care behaviors in 200 dialysis facilities and 1400 patients; 2) To examine in a prospective cohort the association of organizational patient-centered communication climate with clinical outcomes in 465 dialysis facilities and 15,000 patients; and 3) To determine if dialysis facility organizational communication climate modifies associations of age, race, or health-literacy related disparities and outcomes. We are an integrated, diverse research team well equipped and uniquely poised to efficiently leverage existing infrastructure to advance health communication, organizational behavior and dialysis research. This proposal will serve future research by advancing our understanding of mechanisms and impact of organizational communication climate in dialysis care, evaluating a novel framework depicting its role, and also generating efficient assessment methods. This research will further inform the future development and testing of efficient and effective multi-level interventions to connect patients, providers and health systems to optimize quality programs and patient-centered care."
"9293350","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) is to regain walking ability, as limitations in mobility can affect most activities of daily living In addition, patients with SCI may experience a higher incidence of falls due to impaired balance and gait. Further, the consequence of falls in patients with SCI is much greater than that for healthy older adults. Dynamic balance control plays a crucial role during locomotion in human SCI. Thus, improved dynamic balance may facilitate locomotion in this population. Current balance training paradigms can be effective in improving balance during standing, but are less effective in improving dynamic balance during locomotion in humans with SCI. Thus, there is a need to develop new paradigms for improving dynamic balance and locomotor function in patients with SCI. The goal of this proposed research is to explore motor adaptation to a mediolateral force applied at the pelvis during walking in humans with SCI and test whether pelvis perturbation training paired with transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) will be effective in improving dynamic balance and locomotor function in humans with SCI. We postulate that providing a perturbation force to the pelvis during treadmill training will increase the activation of muscles used for maintaining lateral balance while walking. Further, repeated activation of particular sensorimotor pathways (through repeated exposure to a pelvic perturbation force) may reinforce circuits and synapses used for lateral balance control through a use-dependent neural-plasticity mechanism. However, the excitability of spinal cord neural circuitries may be depressed due to the reduced descending drive signals from the upper level control center after SCI, which may reduce the efficacy of neural plastic changes achieved following rehabilitation. The excitability of neural pathways is crucial for neural reorganization achieved following rehabilitation. Recently studies indicate that tsDCS may modulate the excitability of neural circuitries of the spinal cord in patients with SCI. Thus, we postulate that controlled pelvis perturbation training paired with tsDCS will be more effective than that paired with a sham in improving dynamic balance and locomotor function in humans with SCI. Results obtained from this study will lead to an innovative clinical therapy aimed at improving balance and walking function in humans with SCI. Improvements in balance and walking function may allow for increased participation in community-based ambulation and activities, and significantly improve quality of life in humans with SCI. The improvements of scientific knowledge obtained from this study may be extended to other SCI patients with lower walking function, or other patient populations, such as individuals post-stroke."
"9246591","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic nonvalvular Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a very common and costly public health problem. AF may reduce the quality and duration of life, both, particularly by increasing the risk of devastating thromboembolic strokes. Anticoagulants, including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, e.g., warfarin) and non-VKA anticoagulants (NOACs, e.g., dabigatran, -xabans), are very effective, but underused treatments. Anticoagulation underuse results form challenges clinicians face in prescribing these drugs and patients face in implementing their use in their lives. Recognizing these challenges, leading cardiovascular societies in 2014 formulated a class I recommendation of shared decision making (SDM) for the individualization of anticoagulation therapy in at-risk patients with AF. However, there are no proven interventions to support the implementation of this recommendation, and no evidence of the effect of SDM on the problem of initiating and implementing anticoagulation. With over a decade of experience, we have demonstrated the practical impact of SDM interventions in other contexts. Building on this experience, we propose to use an SDM tool we developed using user-centered design, ANTICOAGULATION CHOICE, to promote SDM about anticoagulation between patients with AF and their clinicians. Using a randomized trial design, we plan to determine the impact of using this tool on the quality of SDM and on the rate of anticoagulation and patient adherence to this therapy. By generating reliable practice-based evidence, this trial can provide feedback to the guideline panel about the impact of SDM on the quality of individualized anticoagulation care. We propose to enroll 999 adult patients with chronic nonvalvular AF deemed at high risk of thromboembolic strokes (CHA2DS2-VASc score ? 1, or 2 in women) and receiving care in academic, community, or safety net clinics. We plan to randomly assign them to care with or without a new SDM tool, ANTICOAGULATION CHOICE. Trial outcomes include the quality of SDM (primary endpoint, aim 1), the rate of anticoagulation, the distribution of anticoagulants chosen, and patient adherence to anticoagulation at 12 months (aim 2). If successful, this work will reduce the underuse of anticoagulation therapy and improve the care and outcomes of millions of patients with AF."
"9245652","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hand OA (HOA) is a painful, destructive and deforming polyarticular disorder that impairs an individual's ability to perform manipulative activities of daily life. Its high frequency and strong association with age has been the basis of attribution to inevitable joint degeneration, and of therapeutic nihilism. The severity of HOA can approach that of rheumatoid arthritis, yet in stark contrast to that rarer disorder has been the subject of little research and benefits from no treatments known to effect its development or progression. Involvement of hand joints is the commonest and most heritable manifestation of OA and is a sentinel for the `generalized' OA phenotype. While site-specific biomechanical factors are influential in its development, there is also evidence that bone health and constitutional factors predispose to incidence and progression of HOA. Risk of HOA is doubled in obese individuals, an association more plausibly attributable to systemic factors than the mechanical effect of overload. Indeed, recent epidemiological and clinical data indicate that metabolic syndrome rather than obesity has the greater impact on the initiation and severity of OA. The pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and OA involve abnormalities in common metabolic intermediates, however, the relationship of these pathways to the development and progression of HOA has been explored to only a limited extent. Recent investigations also indicate that the structural basis for HOA is broader than cartilage loss alone, with distinct pathological pathways that include osteophytosis, marginal and central joint erosion. Also, there is clinical controversy about whether erosive HOA is a separate entity, or simply more advanced disease. We will analyze annually-collected longitudinal radiographic, covariate and outcome data, and biospecimens from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, the largest most comprehensive cohort study of OA, and perform semi- quantitative and computer-aided image measurements across multiple hand joints to evaluate and contrast the roles of structural and metabolic characteristics in the development of radiographic, symptomatic and erosive HOA."
"9444919","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACKGROUND. Racial and ethnic disparities are pronounced in sexual and reproductive health outcomes. African American and Hispanic girls (young women of color), comprise 57% of all teen pregnancies1 and 79% of all new HIV infections2, although they represent only 26% of this population2. High rates of medical indigence, related to poverty in young women of color, limit access to quality sexual and reproductive health services3-4. Research has identified barriers that maintain health disparities in healthcare, in particular provider (e.g., lack of training and skills) and patient (e.g., perceived discrimination) level barriers as well as patient-provider communication barriers (e.g., discomfort with sexual health communication)5. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is a model of primary care that advocates for quality patient-centered care that is accessible, continuous, and comprehensive6-7. Over 50% of youth have medical homes, and those youth are less likely to have unmet needs and more likely to engage in preventative medical visits in primary care7, though little is known about sexual health care in this context. This model was designed to help underserved communities achieve health equity through culturally-responsive care8. For example, the PCMH model has built-in financial incentives for providers to decrease racial and ethnic health disparities, such as participation in learning collaboratives, including e-learning courses8-9. The PCMH model has already been effective at decreasing healthcare costs and health disparities10. Therefore, the PCMH model is an ideal vehicle by which to reduce the sexual and reproductive health disparities of young women of color. SPECIFIC AIMS. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct a mixed-methods needs assessment with PCMH providers and young women of color to understand the needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare (on provider and patient levels). The knowledge gained will be used to create a detailed content outline, which will inform next-steps or the development of an e-learning course for time-limited healthcare providers to enhance cultural competency and progress towards health equity. METHODS. A sequential multilevel mixed-methods needs assessment will be conducted with providers and young women of color. The quantitative phase will include survey methods to quantify needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare and to identify major topics and themes to guide discussions during the qualitative phase. The qualitative phase will consist of in-depth individual interviews with physicians and iterative focus groups with young women of color to explore the meaning of these themes and how they may be addressed. During the integration phase, the quantitative and qualitative data will be integrated to create a detailed content outline for the e-learning course. LONG TERM GOAL. My long term goal is to develop a program of health services research focused on culturally-responsive healthcare interventions for youth to address health disparities of major significance."
"9238784","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ß-thalassemia is a group of inherited blood disorders that result in defects in ß-globin chain production. Cooley's anemia (CA), or ß-thalassemia major, is the most severe form of the disease and occurs when an individual has mutations in both copies of the adult ß-globin gene. Patients with CA fail to make adult hemoglobin, have ineffective erythropoiesis, suffer from severe anemia, and are transfusion dependent for life. Currently, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the only cure; however, few patients have suitable donors for this high morbidity/mortality procedure. This application outlines studies to establish a new BMT protocol that avoids the potentially lethal myeloablative conditioning of standard BMT. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using a non-cytoreductive conditioning regimen to rescue a preclinical humanized mouse model of CA from lethal anemia. These studies apply to several NHLBI Division of Blood Diseases and Resources stated goals: improving thalassemia treatment and management; development of hematopoietic transplantation; developing animal models for preclinical studies; and testing of novel cell-based therapies for the correction of thalassemia. The first main objective and specific aim of this project is to rescue humanized CA mice from lethal anemia by the use of non-cytoreductive bone marrow transplantation from a MHC-mismatched donor. The next main objective and specific aim is to determine the effect of adding an additional antibody treatment to the non- cytoreductive conditioning regimen. This study will employ a preclinical model of humanized CA by monitoring survival, HSC engraftment, disease and treatment-related pathology, and the donor marrow cell dose required after non-cytoreductive conditioned BMT. Together, these objectives would increase the clinical feasibility of utilizing bone marrow transplantation without cytoreductive conditioning to cure CA in human patients. Successful completion of the aims of this project will have a significant impact on the clinical management of CA patients. Furthermore, these ideas may be translatable to other hemoglobinopathies and blood disorders. The objectives in this proposal are the next step in developing a safe treatment for all patients with CA."
"9313431","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), a first line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), have limitations particularly in treating hyperarousal symptoms. It is, therefore, imperative to identify strategies to improve effectiveness of treatments for PTSD. Disturbed sleep is common in PTSD. Sleep has been implicated in learning processes that are a key to adaptive processing of trauma memories. Findings of our preliminary study of people with PTSD suggest that sleep characteristics indicating increased nocturnal arousal compromise therapeutic effects of written narrative exposure (WNE) intervention (writing about one?s traumatic experience). Orexins (hypocretins) are neuropeptides implicated in regulating both sleep/wake and stress responses and emotional behaviors. A dual orexin receptor antagonist, suvorexant, has been found to enhance sleep characteristics associated with emotional adaptation in humans. Administration of an orexin receptor-1 antagonist to mice facilitated extinction of conditioned fear, an animal model of recovery from PTSD and anxiety disorders. The long-term objectives of the candidate?s research program are to elucidate neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the potential for sleep to contribute to resilience and PTSD recovery and apply this knowledge to improve PTSD prevention and treatment. To accomplish these objectives, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1) to examine effects of pharmacologically blocking the orexin system after WNE on sleep, PTSD symptoms, and intersession habituation; and 2) to use an animal model to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying the effects of inhibiting the orexin system on sleep and memory consolidation following fear extinction. In the proposed clinical project, adult participants with PTSD will complete WNE in the evening and morning with intervening sleep, and either suvorexant (FDA-approved for treatment of insomnia) or placebo will be administered prior to going to bed following the evening WNE. This proposed study is the first to investigate the contribution of the orexin system to therapeutic effects of exposure-based treatment for PTSD through sleep. In the animal study, orexin neurons in the hypothalamus will be inhibited using optogenetic methods following a fear extinction training. For the career development plan, the candidate will participate in didactic and in-lab training activities in neuroscience and advanced research methodologies of both clinical and animal studies. The new skill set to be acquired during the K01 period will complement the candidate?s current expertise and enable her to develop an independent translational research program that strategically utilizes clinical and animal study methods to elucidate mechanisms underlying sleep?s contribution to resilience and PTSD recovery."
"9285809","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Signaling pathways in which GCK group Mst/hippo kinases regulate AGC group Ndr/LATS kinases are ancient controllers of growth, proliferation, and architecture of eukaryotic cells. Our broad goal is to define the diverse intracellular processes these pathways regulate and determine the mechanisms underlying this control. Forms of Mst/hippo signaling (hippo-warts pathways) that suppress metazoan cell proliferation in metazoans by inhibiting YAP/yorkie-related transcriptional co-activators have been the subject of intensive recent interest. However, the distinct and highly conserved hippo-trc form of this pathway in which large furry related proteins mediate Mst/hippo kinase activation of Ndr/tricornered kinases have dramatically different functions; comparatively little is known about them, and they are the focus of this project. The hippo-trc pathways are important for polarized growth and organization of cellular extensions, neuron morphogenesis, mitotic spindle organization, and positive regulation of cell proliferation. We have successfully studied the system in budding yeast, which use a conserved hippo-trc pathway known as the RAM network to control cell division and polarized growth. Under close regulation by mitotic exit machinery, this pathway directly drives asymmetric localization and activity of a transcription factor that turns on expression of genes involved in the final step of cytokinesis. In addition to this primordial cell fate decision, budding yeast hippo-trc signaling promotes maintenance of cell polarity and regulates translation of proteins required for physical expansion of the cell during rapid growth. This project aims to define the regulatory mechanisms and downstream targets of Cbk1. Through combined computational and experimental work we have discovered that a novel docking motif peptide recruits this Ndr/LATS kinase to in vivo substrates through interaction with the kinase catalytic domain. We have crystallized the Mob2-Cbk1 complex and solved its structure, the first for any Ndr/LATS kinase, and will use this information to guide analysis of the kinase's activation mechanisms. We will define how the docking motif binds to Cbk1's kinase domain, analyze effects caused by disruption of this interaction in vivo, and determine if the novel substrate docking behavior we have discovered in budding yeast also occurs with metazoan orthologs. When combined with existing interaction and phosphoproteomic data, our analysis of substrate docking and consensus motif conservation at least triples the number of high confidence Cbk1 targets. In addition to extending our analysis of the pathway's regulation of mRNA translation, we will explore this expanded regulatory network to gain a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of this hippo-trc pathway's control of cell division and morphogenesis."

"9362754","The observation and quantitation of cell behavior is a fundamental aspect of biomedical research. Traditionally, these assays have relied on time and labor intensive end point measurements which have significant limitations that can compromise the rigor and reproducibility of results. This application requests the acquisition of the IncuCyte ZOOM System Package, a live-cell imaging and analysis platform that enables quantification of cell behavior over time by automatically gathering and analyzing cell culture images around the clock. The IncuCyte System supports over 300 different standard tissue culture plates, T-flasks, and micro slides. With three configurable trays, one can mix and match multiple plate, monitor different experiments running concurrently, and acquire >2000 images per hour. Data can be accessed remotely through the local network to view real time-data at the investigator's convenience. There are no comparable systems or related equipment available at the Durham VA. Four VA funded investigators have been identified as major users, each with studies that are examining cell growth (migration, proliferation, and apoptosis) in a variety of cell types. These investigators propose to utilize the IncuCyte System to accelerate and strengthen ongoing studies to prevent or treat diverse diseases. These include studies examining the activation of vascular smooth muscle cells that contribute to atherosclerosis and restenosis (Dr. Francis Miller); meniscal cells and chondrocytes in joint disease and repair (Dr. Brice Weinberg); red blood cell adherence to endothelial cells in malaria (Weinberg); chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Weinberg); glomerular podoycytes contribution to kidney disease (Dr. Robert Spurney); and motor neuron regeneration (Dr. Roger Madison).

"9234411","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric dysphagia-chronic difficulty with feeding and swallowing-is a serious complication in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Dysphagia can be recognized in between 35% and 80% of newborns, infants and older children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and the incidence is currently increasing. The consequences of pediatric dysphagia include failure to gain weight, malnutrition, acute choking, food aspiration and naso-sinus, middle ear, and lung aspiration related infections including pneumonia. Current therapies aim at relieving symptoms or modifying food to ease difficulties; however, there are neither cures nor preventive strategies for pediatric dysphagia. The lack of new approaches reflects a lack of fundamental understanding of neural and oro-pharyngeal mechanisms that are disrupted in pediatric dysphagia, and their developmental causes. Our research program will provide this fundamental understanding by defining the pathology, developmental origins, and approaches for prevention of pediatric dysphagia. Our goal is to provide a new foundation for better diagnosis and therapy for dysphagia in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders and new clinically tractable approaches for preventing or diminishing dysphagia. Achieving this goal is now possible because our group has established the first genetically defined, behaviorally and pathologically validated model of pediatric dysphagia. We have found that the LgDel mouse model of 22q11 Deletion Syndrome, a genetic deletion neurodevelopmental disorder in which at least 45% of affected children have pediatric dysphagia, accurately recapitulates key dysphagic features: LgDel mouse pups fail to gain weight, aspirate milk acutely, and have a high incidence of naso-sinus, middle ear, and lung inflammation and infection. We will now use this powerful research tool to determine contributions of disrupted brainstem neural circuits versus oro-pharyngeal mechanics to pediatric dysphagia (PROJECT 1), how the pathology of pediatric dysphagia arises during development of the embryonic hindbrain (PROJECT 2), and how neural circuit or oro-pharyngeal pathology can be prevented by restoring disrupted development to normal status via maternal nutrition (PROJECT 3). These three projects will be supported by a core for administration (CORE A), animal models and dysphagia pathology (CORE B), genomics and bioinformatics (CORE C), and microscopic imaging and analysis (CORE D). Our research team has established expertise in cellular neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, developmental biology, genetics and genomics. We will work closely with our clinical partners at Children's National Health System to maximize translation of our results to viable new therapies for children with dysphagia. Thus, we are uniquely positioned to undertake the first truly integrated biological mechanistic analysis of pediatric dysphagia. Our results will be transformative: they will define new diagnostic criteria, therapies, and prevention strategies to improve the vital capacity of feeding and swallowing in children with neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9324409","SUMMARY The lysosomal storage (LSDs) disorders comprise ~50 fatal diseases due to genetic lysosomal enzyme deficiency, which affects most tissues and associates to broad inflammatory phenotype. Treatment is by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), where recombinant enzymes are i.v. infused in hospitals, with high burden to patients and the health system (?$150,000/patient- year). Still, ERT success is restricted to a few diseases that affect the liver, spleen, and kidneys, since the enzymes access these blood clearance organs. Yet, delivery to tissues separated from the blood by a tight endothelial barrier (mainly the brain, to some extent the lungs) is hindered. An example is that of types A-B NPD, a sphingomyelin storage due to acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency, which leads to premature death. NPD-A has a strong neurological involvement, not improved by ERT. NPD-B mainly affects the lungs and, although helped by ERT, high and frequent dosage causes immune reactions and resistance, along with other side effects. Our original award focused on targeting recombinant ASM to ICAM-1, a protein overexpressed in inflammation and associated to a new route of transport across the endothelium and into lysosomes of tissue cells. Through the previous period we successfully achieved our goals and improved: brain and lung targeting, transport across the endothelium, uptake in subjacent tissue cells, lysosomal enzyme activity, and substrate reduction (38 articles, 5 journal covers and/or editorials, 17 awards). To move this promising platform toward translation, we now will focus on: (a) enzyme encapsulation in biodegradable polymer nanocarriers and safer targeting moieties to minimize immune recognition, (b) incorporation of anti-phagocytic signals to minimize clearance, (c) tuning of the formulation parameters to optimize the balance between brain-lung targeting and explore combination therapy for enhanced effects, and (e) optimization of carrier degradation within lysosomal to avoid ?polymer storage? upon chronic treatment. We have key results supporting these new directions and completion of a renewed project will significantly advance the opportunity for a more effective and safer treatment of NPD, and likely other LSDs.  "
"9303748","Project Summary Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious mental illness that confers the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Current treatments are inadequate and no pharmacologic agents have proven effective. A better understanding of the development and pathophysiology of AN is greatly needed. We propose a longitudinal, multimodal MRI study of reward and habit circuits in youth (ages 14-18) with AN, compared with age-matched healthy controls (HC), followed over two years. We focus on adolescence because this is a critical, yet understudied, period in AN. Pathological dieting typically emerges during adolescence, and the course of AN is often determined during this period with approximately half of teens showing full recovery, whereas the rest endure persistent illness. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms by which some teens develop persistent AN, while others remit, is critical to developing the most effective interventions. Our study will examine neural mechanisms guiding food choice and neural connectivity in mesolimbic and habit-related circuits among youth with AN who continue with illness compared with those who remit, and compared with HC. We will examine these neural circuits at baseline and study their developmental trajectories. Our Food Choice Task captures restrictive intake, a core behavioral disturbance in AN, and therefore we can directly examine the link between brain activity and eating behavior. Using longitudinal, multimodal MRI at 3- time points, we will first test whether the function and connectivity of mesolimbic reward and dorsal habit circuits predict the longer-term course of AN. Second, we will examine longitudinal changes within these two neural circuits of interest. We predict that at baseline, restrictive food choice in youth with AN will be mediated by mesolimbic reward circuitry; however, at year-2 follow-up, in teens for whom the disorder persists, restrictive food choice will be mediated by dorsal striatal habit circuitry. The study will (i) chart the developmental trajectories of reward and habit circuits in youth with AN; (ii) advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which AN persists to chronicity, and (iii) help develop targets for novel therapeutic strategies."
"9249972","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Illness self-management programs like WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Planning) help adults with serious mental illness (SMI) learn and enact autonomous strategies to pursue recovery26. WRAP is a peer-led intervention providing a framework by which people develop personal plans to achieve wellness and pursue recovery goals. Extant research reveals WRAP's success at enhancing participants' hope, quality of life, perceived recovery, and self-advocacy; the magnitude of changes, however, is relatively modest, and participants show no increase in hope for personal ability to develop strategies to reach identified goals11,12,15. The proposed mixed methods investigation seeks to examine how participants learn and utilize WRAP's framework for pursuing recovery, including barriers and facilitators of effective mastery and implementation of WRAP tenets, guided by social cognitive theory. [The research will take place in two phases. Phase one: the trainee will recruit 24 WRAP users to engage in focus groups and 8 WRAP graduates to participate in in-depth interviews to explore the lived experience with WRAP and develop an operational definition of WRAP utilization. Phase two: the trainee will recruit 75 participants accessing WRAP intervention. Pre- and post- measures will quantify 1) problem-solving strategies and 2) social network size, satisfaction, and reciprocal problem-solving supports, and 3) WRAP utilization to investigate correlations with variance in outcomes of perceived recovery, hope, quality of life, and symptom severity.

"9253450","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Biostatistics and Data Management Core (F) will be established in recognition of the critical need for statistical and data management expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of clinical and basic research related to mental health in HIV/AIDS. The Core will provide Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC) investigators with statistical collaboration for planning of exploratory investigations and proposal development, and data management and informatics expertise for research planning. The overall mission of Core F will be to encourage and facilitate high quality innovative, interdisciplinary and translational mental health in HIV/AIDS research in the PMHARC. The Core will promote the use of rigorous statistical and analytic methodologies and effective data management by working across the Core boundaries. The Core's specific aims will be to: Advise and collaborate with PMHARC investigators on study design, data management, and data analysis issues, including qualitative research and mixed model approaches; Evaluate feasibility of intervention studies and facilitate conduct of precursor pilot studies; Collaborate on the design, implementation, data management and analysis for up to four pilot studies per year, and develop and maintain a central database of longitudinal assessments on a core set of assessments of biomarkers related to HIV, mental illness, and co-morbidities across all pilot studies. Once a participant is enrolled into a pilot study, the core data collection will continue on that participant until the administrative end of the P-30; Provide statistical collaboration for research funding applications (e.g. ROI, R21, R34); Adapt or develop new statistical methods. Many projects on which Core statisticians provide collaboration can be completed with the use of standard statistical methods, but in some cases it is necessary to either adapt existing methods or develop new ones in order to achieve a satisfactory analysis. Mental health data carries with it substantial structural burdens that tax standard statistical methodology, issues of inference, and issues of appropriate design. These burdens include highly correlated data over time and correlation among various outcome measures. Thus Core F for this Center will be dealing with interesting but complex issues that might not present themselves in other environments (e.g. CFAR). It is expected that as individual ROIs are awarded, that Drs. Ellenberg, Morales, and Barg, the Biostatistics Analysis Center (BAC) and the Clinical Computing and Research Unit (CRCU) will be part of the research team as appropriate to size and complexity of study. In general, the Core's model will be to utilize personnel effort that is supported by the Core for pilot projects and preparation of funding proposals, with the subsequent funded grants providing direct support of the resulting collaborative research effort. Methodological work will also be financed by PMHARC core funding as well as from outside funding generated from external awarded grants."
"9431262","The overall goal of this project is to generate fine-structure RNA maps in human and mouse (C57BL/6NJ) tissues and primary cell lines using a variety of high-throughput sequencing platforms, to evaluate the biological importance of novel transcripts by determining if evidence of their translated products can be identified. From each sample analyzed, we propose to isolate long (>200 nucleotides) and short (< 200 nucleotides) RNA in biological duplicate. Illumina-based maps for these samples will initially be generated using (1) RNA sequencing (-seq) of ribosomal (r-)RNA depleted long total RNA. (2) RNA-seq of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) pre-treated short RNA (3) Pair-end Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (PE-CAGE) of total RNA. Additionally, for a subset of primary cell lines we will generate the above libraries from nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular fractions. Long RNA-Seq data will be distilled down into functional elements consisting of splice junctions, polyadenylatio sites and de novo genes and transcripts. The short RNA data will be distilled into contigs representing the 5' ends of short RNAs up to the read length. PE-CAGE data will be analyzed to form clusters representing the 5' ends of transcripts linked to a tag internal to the transcript body. Importantly, each element will be assessed for reproducibility using a nonparametric Irreproducible Detection Rate (nplDR) script. Collectively, these data will allow for the detection  of novel transcribed regions and supportive information as to the location of promoter regions and subcellular residence of transcripts. In aggregate, these data will be used to generate models of both noncoding and protein coding transcripts and to distinguish isoforms at complex loci necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of mammalian transcriptomes. For a subset of these samples we will simultaneously collect the genome sequence of the human donors to provide a reference map that will be used to map the RNA data against and derive information concerning allele-specific expression and RNA editing. Unannotated transcript models will be tested using long-range (PacBio/454) sequencing. Lastly, proteogenomic analysis will be done and the results compared against the unannotated transcripts."
"9363040","ABSTRACT Nine Investigators from the RR&D Center for Limb Loss Prevention and Prosthetic Engineering are requesting funds to acquire a new biplane fluoroscopy system. This system will support a variety of projects that are working towards the Center's core mission of improving the quality of life and functional status of both veterans who are at risk for lower extremity amputation, and veterans and service members who have undergone lower extremity amputation. The biplane fluoroscopy system consists of a pair of fluoroscope components mounted to a number of free-standing adjustment gantries. Each fluoroscope is comprised of an X-ray generator, which produces and emits X-ray radiation, and an image intensifier (II) which collects the X-rays and converts them to visible light. Mounted behind each II is a high-speed video camera, which captures the visible-light images appearing on the II at a high acquisition rate (up to 1000 frames/sec). The X-ray generator and II's are mounted to a floor-mounted stand which provides for motor-driven vertical adjustment of the position of the X- rays and II's. A system interface synchronizes the X-ray acquisition with the video cameras, and provides triggering capabilities with external hardware. The requested biplane fluoroscopy system is a major upgrade to our current system which was purchased in 2007-08 and uses outdated technology. As noted above, there are three major components to the biplane system: 1) the X-ray generators and IIs, 2) the support stands or gantries, and 3) the high speed video cameras. Each of these subsystems will be replaced. The biplane fluoroscopy system will support a number of projects that span the Center's research portfolio:  · Quantitative Prescription of Foot Orthoses: A Dose-Response Study of Kinematics in Patients with  Foot and Ankle Pain using Biplane Fluoroscopy. A biplane fluoroscopy assessment of the dose  response of foot kinematics to varying degrees of hindfoot posting will be conducted.  · Do Rocker Bottom Shoes and Ankle-Foot Orthoses Reduce Pain and Improve Mobility for Ankle  Osteoarthritis Patients? A biplane fluoroscopy assessment of foot kinematics in response to rocker  bottom shoes and ankle-foot orthoses will be conducted.  · Residual Limb Skeletal Movement During gait. A biplane fluoroscopy assessment of residual limb bone  kinematics will be conducted.  · The Biomechanics of Lateral Wedge Insoles. A biplane fluoroscopy assessment of foot kinematics in  response to lateral wedge insoles will be conducted.  · Reducing Internal Stresses in Deformed Diabetic Feet. A biplane fluoroscopy assessment of foot  kinematics will provide high resolution images of foot and ankle bone motion for model validation.  · Improving the Detection, Classification and Treatment of Misaligned Arthritic Ankles. A biplane  fluoroscopy assessment of foot kinematics of ankle osteoarthtitis subjects will be conducted.  · Mapping The Soft Tissue Artifact of the Foot and Ankle and Evaluating Site Specific Errors based  on Subject Characteristics. The biplane system will be used to determine soft tissue artifact at optical  marker locations, in order to build error-mapping databases.  · Comparing Surgical Treatments for Hallux Rigidus Using a Biomechanically and Anatomically  Realistic Foot Model. The biplane system will be used to collect validation data on patients that were used  to generate HR models."
"9234421","ABSTRACT  22q11Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) patients have feeding and swallowing difficulties that compromise their  nutritional status and increase nasal, middle ear, and respiratory infections due to aspiration and reflux. The  causes of these clinically significant difficulties are unknown. Using the genetically accurate LgDel mouse  model of 22q11DS, which has similar phenotypic features, we found that retinoic acid-mediated anterior-  posterior patterning of the hindbrain is altered, and that several of the cranial nerves that control feeding and  swallowing have aberrant growth patterns early in development. These observations suggest that aberrant  development of the hindbrain motor and/or sensory neurons leads to dysfunction of the network of cranial  neurons that are needed to execute feeding and swallowing. We will test the hypothesis that diminished  22q11 gene dosage disrupts anterior-posterior (A-P) hindbrain patterning via retinoic acid (RA)  signaling, and thereby re-specifies brainstem and/or neural crest precursor cells, leading to dysphagia.  Our experiments in Specific Aim 1 will quantify RA production to assess excess ligand availability, measure  hindbrain RA responses to evaluate enhanced RA sensitivity, and determine changes of additional patterning  centers and their targets in LgDel embryos where anterior CNs are compromised, Tbx1+/- where they are  spared, and LgDel:Raldh2+/- where they are rescued. To identify genes that, if mutated, predispose at-risk  fetuses to dysphagia, in Specific Aim 2 we will compare transcriptomes from the hindbrains of WT embryos,  LgDel embryos in which RA signaling is enhanced, and LgDel:Raldh2+/- embryos in which it is returned to WT  levels. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will characterize position, molecular identity, frequency, proliferative,  and/or migratory capacities of anterior versus posterior hindbrain motor neuron, interneuron, pre-migratory and  migratory neural crest precursors in LgDel embryos in which anterior CNs are compromised, Tbx1+/- in which  they are spared, and LgDel:Raldh2+/- in which they are rescued. The results of PROJECT 2 will establish the  developmental origins of pediatric dysphagia pathology defined by PROJECT 1, and determine how these  mechanisms contribute to specific aspects of disrupted feeding and swallowing. Our data will define new  molecular pathways for fetal and early postnatal diagnosis, and targeted therapeutic interventions.  Experiments in PROJECT 3 will evaluate the precision of these targets for correcting key aspects of dysphagia  pathology in fetuses at risk for perinatal feeding and swallowing difficulties."
"9326631","Project Abstract Cellular differentiation is a fundamentally important process, whereby highly-diverse cellular phenotypes are derived from a single underlying genome through the differential regulation of gene expression across time and space. Epigenetic information, non-genetic heritable changes in gene regulation, is integral to proper cellular differentiation and organismal development, with many developmental disorders characterized by errors in epigenetic regulation. Fundamental to both cellular differentiation as well as organismal plasticity is the appropriate epigenetic regulation and demarcation of cell- or phenotype-specific enhancer elements. Despite this, our current understanding of how enhancers are epigenetically poised, activated, and remembered during differentiation is still quite limited. Without a better understanding of the differential epigenetic regulation of enhancers, our ability to treat complex developmental disorders such as Rett syndrome and Autism, as well as fully understand plasticity-associated pathologies such as obesity will remain limited. The eusocial insect Harpegnathos saltator provides an excellent, experimentally-tractable system within which to study the epigenetics of differentiation and dynamic plasticity, as H. saltator workers possess the ability to transition between physiologically-distinct reproductively inactive and active (gamergate) states, based entirely upon environmental cues. Our preliminary data indicate that this reproductive plasticity seen in H. saltator is underlain by preferential epigenetic activation of worker- and gamergate-specific enhancers (often bound by CBP). Furthermore, we observe that enhancers active only in gamergates show preferential enrichment for H4K16 acetylation in workers. Importantly, emerging evidence in vertebrate systems has implicated H4K16ac and its associated acetyltransferase MOF, in the regulation of key developmental enhancers and maintenance of pluripotency. The goal of this proposal is to use the experimentally reversible reproductive plasticity seen in H. saltator workers to test the hypothesis that H4K16ac is integral for the marking of plasticity-associated eukaryotic enhancers, poised for activation upon differentiation. We will assess our hypothesis by evaluating the extent to which H4K16ac and its mediator (MOF) establish and maintain poised enhancers for reproductive plasticity in ants (Aim 1), as well as test how observed age- dependent decreases in worker reproductive plasticity relate to changes in H4K16ac and other histone PTMs at these enhancers (Aim 2). For both aims we will use the inducible reproductive plasticity of H. saltator workers as a model to study the epigenetics of differentiation. We will also utilize targeted manipulation of histone PTMs (using drugs and RNAi) to evaluate the causality of our findings, and comparative techniques to assess their generality. These experiments will greatly inform our view of enhancer activation as it relates to differentiation, as well as deepen our understanding of the epigenetic regulation of metazoan plasticity."

"9256553","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dominantly inherited nucleotide repeat expansion disorders are thought to elicit neurodegeneration in one of two ways: 1) The repeat as RNA can bind to and sequester specific proteins, preventing them from performing their normal functions; or 2) If the repeat is translated into protein, the repetitive amino acid expansion can trigger toxicity through a variety of mechanisms including protein misfolding and aggregation. Traditionally, the dominant contribution of each pathogenic mechanism has been suggested by the repeat's location within the disease gene, with exonic repeats exerting toxicity primarily as protein and non-exonic repeats presumably acting via RNA-mediated mechanisms. Recent data, however, indicate that repeats in non-coding regions of transcripts can be aberrantly translated into proteins through Repeat Associated Non- AUG initiated (RAN) translation. In light of this new finding, defining the relative contributions of RNA- and protein-mediated toxic processes in each repeat expansion disorder has surfaced as a critical issue in the field. Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that results from a CGG repeat expansion at the beginning of the fragile X gene, FMR1. It is characterized pathologically by the formation of proteinaceous inclusions in the brains of patients. Work to date suggests that the repeat is toxic as RNA, but our group recently showed that the CGG repeat expansion also elicits RAN translation (CGG RAN translation) to produce an aggregation-prone, homopolymeric polyglycine containing protein. This protein aggregates in model systems and is present in inclusions in FXTAS disease brain. In this proposal, we will determine whether the CGG repeat in FXTAS triggers neurodegeneration as RNA, as a toxic protein, or both, and then interrogate how this newly discovered RAN translation occurs mechanistically. To address these questions, we will utilize new fly models of FXTAS to determine the relative abilities of CGG repeats as RNA and as RAN translated proteins to elicit neurodegeneration. We will then extend these findings to pathological and behavioral assessments of two knock-in mouse models of FXTAS that differ in their ability to support CGG RAN translation. In parallel, we will employ a series of biochemical and cell-based approaches to explore the mechanisms underlying CGG RAN translation. These studies should provide critical insight into FXTAS pathogenesis while offering a relevant case-study for other repeat expansion disorders, and in the process facilitate the identification of proximal therapeutic targets based on improved understanding of disease mechanisms."
"9333671","PROJECT SUMMARY Memories can last the entire lifetime of an organism. Dynamic communication among billions of neurons at synapses underlies information processing and enables the coding and storage of memory. Changes in synapse strength and structure through synaptic plasticity are widely speculated as the cellular basis of memory formation and storage. Studies have identified cellular signaling events and molecular rearrangements underlying the initiation of synaptic plasticity. However, considerably less is known regarding the molecular basis enabling synaptic strength and memories to persist for extended periods of time. While initial synaptic plasticity and long-term memory coding requires protein synthesis, following a period of consolidation, memory storage becomes independent of protein synthesis or neural activity, suggesting that the memory is stored in a remarkably stable molecular entity. During this time, however, most of the individual proteins that are known to make up the synapse will turnover, being degraded and replaced within hours to a few days. Therefore the question remains as to what physical substrates underlie the persistence of long-lasting memories. One possibility is that exceptionally long-lived proteins (LLPs) reside in synapses and act as molecular anchors to maintain the synaptic strength or a network property that defines a given memory. While previous studies have demonstrated the existence of LLPs in the central nervous system, particularly in the nuclei of non-dividing cells, no studies to date have addressed whether such proteins exist at synapses and contribute to the establishment and maintenance of long-term memories. To investigate this hypothesis we designed an unbiased, proteomics-based approach to identify LLPs resident in synapses and characterize their neuronal function. Stable isotope metabolic pulse-chase labeling will be used both in vivo and in vitro to measure the half-lives of the neuronal and synaptic proteomes. These experiments will further be combined with behavioral and pharmacological manipulations to examine how memory formation and neuronal activity influence protein turnover. Identified candidate proteins will be characterized using biochemical, cell-biological, electrophysiological, imaging and behavioral methodologies to determine how these LLPs contribute to synaptic/neuronal function and memory. Within the metabolically active environment of the cell it is known that proteins can undergo oxidative damage. Such damage to LLPs could be a source of vulnerability that may contribute to functional decline during aging. The experiments described in this proposal will significantly contribute to our understanding of LLP functions in the brain and their potential role in for memory formation, long-term storage and age-related cognitive decline."

"9248423","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in information and high-throughput technologies have set the stage for the 'big data age' in biomedicine. However, there remain unresolved challenges that could limit the impact of big data exploration in the basic, clinical an biomedical sciences. These challenges range from assuring privacy and security in cloud computing environments to establishing the integrity and reproducibility of quantitative analysis tools to proving the validity and generalizability of common probabilistic frameworks used to interpret big data in a biomedical context. Our community can prepare for these challenges by developing a workforce that studies data as a science and engineers scalable technologies. Vanderbilt University is uniquely positioned to establish such a program and train the next generation of brightest minds in data science. The proposed program lays a foundation in, and emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between, biomedical informatics, Computer Science, and Biostatistics. Data scientists must be highly knowledgeable in 1) computational techniques, technologies, and infrastructure for collecting, processing, and analyzing data on a massive scale, 2) statistical methodologies that accommodate large-scale, complex, high-dimensional biomedical data (e.g., model building and validation, false discovery rates, missing data imputation, recalibration for measurement error, and assessing the strength of statistical evidence) and 3) the scientific method and the specific biomedical and clinical contexts that led to data capture, downstream discovery and next-generation decision support systems (which governs the generalizability of results and quantitative tools). Because this field is evolving quickly, it is paramount to provide students with pragmatic training environments that emphasize and develop critical thinking skills and expose them to modern biomedical data analysis in real systems. For over a decade, the biomedical informatics doctoral program at Vanderbilt University has provided students with these experiences, leading to innovations in big data analytics with high impact in the underlying scientific applications in real clinical environments. Despite this, there is no formal program dedicated to big data science where students can study this area in the context of real biomedical collaborations (previous students have managed to do this via a patchwork of goodwill and determination, which is necessarily inefficient in coursework and laborious research collaborations). This proposal seeks to build on Vanderbilt's strength in this area to establish the Vanderbilt Training Program in Big Biomedical Data Science (BIDS) for the next generation of data scientists. This program will be managed as a track within the existing biomedical informatics doctoral program and led by the three PI's with complementary expertise in 1) computational infrastructure, 2) statistical methodologies, and 3) management of NIH-sponsored training programs. The program's mentorship comes from an impressive collection of well-established university faculty and ensures students have exposure to novel biomedical problems and interdisciplinary team-based investigations."

"9244670","Hyperandrogenism is a core feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is associated with  reproductive abnormalities that include accelerated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, LH  excess, oligo- or amenorrhea, arrested ovarian follicular maturation, and development of follicular cysts.  Clinical and animal studies have provided evidence that hyperandrogenism contributes to the manifestation  of these abnormalities by inducing resistance to steroid negative feedback of pulsatile GnRH release. Little is  known, however, about the neuronal mechanisms, including steroid receptors, signaling pathways, and  neuronal populations, that mediate the negative feedback actions of estradiol and progesterone in the  hypothalamus of female primates. Moreover, the pathogenic mechanisms by which androgens impair  neuronal responsiveness to estrogen and progesterone feedback remain obscure. Project II studies will  make use of viral vector-mediated gene silencing and a validated nonhuman primate model of androgen-induced  reproductive PCOS phenotypes to address these major gaps in our understanding of the  mechanisms that mediate the pathogenesis of PCOS. Using these methods, we will directly test the  hypotheses that 1) estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) in hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) neurons mediates  physiological negative feedback in the rhesus macaque, 2) androgen excess attenuates estrogen-induced-expression  of progesterone receptors A and B (PR A/B) and confers resistance to negative feedback actions  of estradiol and progesterone, and 3) reduced PR A/B expression in the ARC recapitulates the reproductive  abnormalities of PCOS. These studies will thereby establish the normal physiological receptors and target  cells that mediate steroid negative feedback in a primate, identify androgen-induced resistance to estradiol  and progesterone actions as a fundamental pathological mechanism underlying PCOS-like reproductive  dysfunction, and directly test the validity of the concept that hypothalamic resistance to progesterone is a  determinant of reproductive abnormalities in PCOS."

The Health Economics Group at BWH will work closely with the DCC to address assessment of quality of life and cost-effectiveness (C-E). The trial will be conducted at approximately 120 sites in the U.S. and Canada, builds upon prior feasibility data and endeavors to address limitations of current research in this area.  Peripheral artery disease prevalence is 15-20% over 70 years, with higher rates in smokers and diabetics. In the subset with CLI, 40% require limb amputation and annual mortality exceeds 20%. With the advent of endovascular techniques for revascularization, we demonstrate from our completed surveys that there is current equipoise among practitioners with respect to best therapy in the majority of CLI cases. The BEST trial will provide, for the first time, urgently needed clinical guidance for CLI management in the context of C-E by using: a pragmatic design, including a range of established techniques; a novel primary endpoint - MALE (major adverse limb event including limb amputation or major re-intervention, bypass graft/graft revision or thrombectomy/thrombolysis) - free survival; multi-disciplinary recruitment of vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists and radiologists; and an innovative, cost-efficient C-E approach. Additional endpoints include other clinical event rates, functional status and QOL and C-E, all using standard definitions and instruments. 140 eligible centers in North America will be approached to ensure 120 are initiated and 80 sites each recruit 1 subject/month over 27 months accrual. Trial duration is 4.25 yrs - 2.25 yrs accrual and 2.0 yrs minimum follow-up. Two cohorts will be studied: All-Vein (N=1620) and Prosthetic Conduit (N=480). Within each cohort, the trial is stratified on 2 factors (4 strata): tissue loss vs. isolated rest pain and infrainguinl with/without significant infrapopliteal occlusive disease. In the All-Vein cohort, BEST has 85% power to detect an EVT vs. OPEN hazard ratio of 1.25 in the primary endpoint (MALE-free survival) with crossover rates accounted for, as well as 2% loss to follow-up. In the Prosthetic Conduit cohort, there is 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 for the primary endpoint. This resubmission fully addresses all prior reviewer concerns, to successfully and efficiently execute a trial that will provide important information for the CLI community."
"9385173","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to an NIH NHLBI K01 Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Faculty Diversity in Biomedical Research (RFA-HL-12-030).  Candidate: I am an exercise physiologist and 3rd year postdoctoral fellow within the Division of Cardiology at the University of Colorado Denver (UCD) Anschutz Medical Campus (AMC).  I am currently funded through an NHLBI F32 individual postdoctoral fellowship based on my pilot project titled A community-based exercise program following endovascular therapy for patients with peripheral artery disease for which I also received a Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CCTSI) grant (project support). I have begun the process of receiving training in community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to enhance my proposed research agenda of creating innovative exercise programs in community settings for patients with PAD. This was accomplished when I attended the 2010 Physical Activity and Public Health Practitioners (PAPH) course held in Park City, UT. I also participated in the Colorado Immersion Training in Community Engagement program, American Indian track. As a Tribal member of the Cherokee Nation, I am in an excellent position to continuing moving toward independent investigator status while also providing a unique perspective to clinical research based on my heritage and past training.  Mentors/Environment: My mentor team is composed of national level research experts in PAD, CBPR methodology and built environment evaluation, cardiology as well as motivational interviewing. Dr. Judy Regensteiner is my primary mentor and has extensive experience in exercise training for patients with PAD and diabetes as well as in mentoring junior faculty. Dr. William Hiatt is a leader in clinical trials for PAD patiets and is the President of the Colorado Prevention Center which is a clinical trial design research organization. Dr. Deborah Main has expertise in community-based health research and has played a critical role in the CBPR methods of the proposal. Dr. Ivan Casserly is an academic cardiologist who is a leader in the field of peripheral vascular intervention. He will provide his expertise with regard to PAD patient care as well as aid in recruitment of PAD patients into our trial. Dr. Paul Cook is a consultant on this proposal for the motivational interviewing aspects of the design. He has a number of publications in using this technique in a variety of patient populations and will aid me in my continued training in motivational interviewing to improve PAD patients' adoption and adherence to exercise in community settings.    Training: My plans are to continue my training in CBPR practices and motivational interviewing as well as in public health. This will be accomplished by participating in local and national level training opportunities for junior faculty in community-based and clinical outcomes research (e.g., CCTSI and PAPH programs). I anticipate completing a Master of Public Health degree during the proposed award period, specifically in the Community and Behavioral Health concentration. Additionally, I will be completing a Certificate in Public Health Sciences at the time of this application review.  Research: Although supervised exercise programs for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are highly effective, few people are able to successfully utilize these programs. Barriers that prevent patients from adopting and adhering to supervised exercise programs include lack of insurance reimbursement for walking exercise and poor proximity to hospitals and clinics as external barriers. Community-based exercise programs for PAD have to date met with inconsistent results possibly due to lack of training and follow-up. Thus, more consistent and directed programs need to be established for exercise training programs based in community settings that incorporate the strengths of supervised programs but also remove the barriers associated with exercise in the community. Our pilot project used novel training, monitoring and coaching (TMC) components in community settings that have been implemented successfully in supervised settings. We also evaluated the local walking environment for each PAD patient prior to community-based exercise. However, our previous pilot methods were designed from the researcher perspective and did not formally engage the actual PAD patients to gain their perspective on how to create effective interventions. Research programs that involve community members in developing the intervention to be used in the community setting may: 1) highlight additional barriers to walking using experiential knowledge of patients and 2) improve compliance by adjusting exercise prescription components that patients may have previously resisted completing. Thus, our project will use CBPR practices in the early design phase of the intervention to improve our piloted TMC intervention components in an effort to increase PAD patients' exercise performance. In addition, evidence supports exercise based motivational interviewing as an effective communication strategy for providing directed resolutions to problems while exercising and may improve self-efficacy of PAD patients. Thus, the primary aim of the proposed study is to determine the effect of a community-based exercise program with training, monitoring and coaching (TMC) components that are enhanced by CBPR practices and motivational interviewing (TMC+) to improve peak walking time (PWT) in PAD patients, which is the primary outcome of the study.

"9290647","Antigenic landscape of the human anti-helminth IgE antibody response Scott A. Smith ABSTRACT Despite its perceived central role in helminth immunity, very little is known about the naturally occurring human IgE antibody response, the dominant helminth target proteins or even the size and complexity of the functional antibody repertoire. Most of our knowledge of the IgE antibodies targeting helminth infection and/or allergens has come from studies using polyclonal sera or inferred from murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We hypothesize that the human anti-helminth IgE antibody response is complex but is comprised of B cell clones which target helminth proteins that are homologues of known allergen proteins and are capable of mediating key effector cell functions in vitro. Here we employ a human B cell hybridoma method newly created in my lab, immortalizing growing memory B cells to generate for the first time ever, naturally occurring full-length human IgE mAbs. Patient clinical information is used to select samples that contain cells directed toward important helminth pathogens. In the initial studies described in this proposal, we selected three helminth infected subjects, one having strongyloidiasis and two with filariasis. The frequencies of IgE encoding B cells was found to be approximately three per million mononuclear cells with great variability seen in their reactivity to helminth lysate. These B cell frequencies and our technical efficiencies are sufficient to greatly expand this work and make hundreds of IgE mAbs. Due to funding restraints our initial characterization studies were performed on a small panel of six Wuchereria bancrofti IgE and three Strongyloides stercoralis IgE mAbs. Purified IgE mAbs were also found to have variable reactivity to helminth lysate in both ELISA and Western blot. Specific helminth protein targets were identified by immunoaffinity chromatography/mass spectrometry and fell into known allergen protein families. Crude allergen protein cross-reactivity studies were performed using Phadia diagnostic technologies and found in some cases to be positive, suggesting that allergens can resemble helminth proteins. IgE sequence analysis demonstrates significant degrees of somatic hypermutation. Initial functional studies show that each IgE helminth-specific mAb is capable of dose dependent mast cell mediator release in the presence of lysate - functional potency studies are underway. Ultimately helminth- specific IgE mAb panels will be assembled to reflect a hierarchy of immune dominant helminth protein targets and effector cell functionality. In addition to improving our basic understanding of this poorly studied branch of human immunity and allergic sensitization, the information obtained through studies outlined in this proposal will allow for the design and development of new helminth vaccines."
"9224987","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Candidate: Dr. Robert Kotloski is a staff neurologist in the Epilepsy Center of Excellence and in the Traumatic Brain Injury/Polytrauma (TBI) clinics at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital. He is also a research fellow and instructor in the Department of Neurology at the University of Wisconsin. Dr. Kotloski has completed a combined MD/PhD degree at Duke University School of Medicine, during which time he studied molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis. He has completed a residency in Neurology at Wake Forest University and a Clinical Neurophysiology fellowship with an epilepsy focus at the University of Wisconsin. He is applying for a VA CDA-2 award in order to obtain the career development training and support for scientific study to become an independent VA researcher.  Environment: Dr. Kotloski will complete the proposed research at the VA and the University of Wisconsin. Both organizations provide an exceptionally collegial atmosphere and strong institutional support including protected time, research space, and equipment. The unique strains of in-bred rats are only available through the laboratory of a mentor, Dr. Thomas Sutula, and have not been used for TBI research previously.  Career Plan: Dr. Kotloski's long-term career goals include the establishment of an independent, productive research laboratory focused on understanding TBI, post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), and its comorbidities. Through his mentors, he will enhance his knowledge of animal models of epilepsy and TBI including cellular (Dr. Rutecki) and network (Dr. Sutula) mechanisms of epilepsy, and molecular mechanisms of TBI (Dr. Vemuganti). During the course of this proposal, he will hone his skills in manuscript and grant writing, mentoring, presentation, and laboratory management. Dr. Kotloski expects the proposed research and training will allow him to independently compete for VA Merit Review funding prior to the end of the CDA-2 award.  Research Project: Current understanding of devastating residuals of TBI such as epilepsy is limited by a paucity of useful animal models. However a unique, plasticity-susceptible strain of rat, selected for increased rate of kindling, has demonstrated frequent post-traumatic seizures following moderate-to-severe TBI. The immediate goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that, following a traumatic brain injury, the development of epilepsy is preceded by changes in electrophysiologic activity and protein expression which are predictive of the later occurrence of PTE. Aim 1 is to characterize spontaneous electrographic changes and post-traumatic seizures after TBI in unique rat strains and out-bred rats. Two complementary strains of in-bred rats, one selected for increased rate of kindling (plasticity-susceptible) and another selected for decreased rate of kindling (plasticity-resistant), as well as out-bred Sprague-Dawley rats, will be studied. TBI will be induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) and electrophysiologic activity will be recorded from the time of injury through the development of PTE. The goal of this aim is to identify changes in electrophysiologic activity following TBI and prior to the appearance of seizures, which would advance our understanding of this critical but clinically silent period, and which could serve as biomarkers for post-traumatic epileptogenesis. Aim 2 is to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying post-traumatic epileptogenesis. Protein expression patterns from the brains of rats from the three genetic backgrounds at various time points following the CCI will be correlated to the presence or absence of PTE. Molecules known to be involved in the response to TBI and in epileptogenesis, including BDNF, TrkB, Tau, A?, and GFAP, will be studied. The goal of this aim is to identify molecular mechanisms and brain structures underlying the development of PTE, which could guide the development of potential therapeutics. As TBI and PTE impact a significant number of Veterans and civilians, and current diagnostic and therapeutic options are severely limited, improved understanding of this prevalent and challenging disorder will greatly advance our ability to care for these individuals."
"9262204","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disease in the Caucasian population. It is caused by mutations in the CF gene, encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. The most prevalent CF mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (?F508) impairs the posttranslational folding, gating characteristics, and the biosynthetic and endocytic processing of CFTR. The functional expression defect of CFTR at the plasma membrane leads to impaired chloride, bicarbonate and fluid transport in secretory epithelia, manifesting in recurrent lung infection, the primary cause of mortality in CF. A major focus of CF research is the identification of small-molecule correctors of defective CFTR processing and potentiators of defective gating that target that the ?F508 and other CFTR mutations. The efficacy of the best correctors available (VX-809) is low, such that treated cells show only ?15% of chloride conductance compared to non-CF cells. We and others have demonstrated that chronic exposure to gating potentiators (e.g. VX-770) destabilizes ?F508-CFTR and reduces correction efficacy. Phase III clinical data, indeed, showed only modest but significant clinical efficacy of combination VX-809 and VX-770 therapy. This competitive renewal builds on our recent discoveries of: a) corrector and potentiator molecules by high throughput screening (HTS) assays; b) the correction requirement of both primary folding defects of ?F508-CFTR, including destabilization of the NBD1 conformation and the NBD1-MSD2 interface in the context of cooperative domain folding; c) preliminary identification of novel potentiator molecules that do not destabilize ?F508-CFTR; and d) correction of the functional expression defect of the W128X-CFTR nonsense mutation synergistically by corrector and potentiator combination. To identify corrector-potentiator combinations that restore ?F508-CFTR folding and chloride channel function to >50% of its wild-type counterpart, we propose to identify and validate efficacious potentiators that lack destabilizing effect of the ?F508-CFTR in Aim 1. In Aim 2 we will utilize novel localized structure defect-targeted (LSDT) screening approaches to identify distinct, structure-specific correctors as pharmacological chaperones that stabilize NBD1 and act synergistically with interface stabilizing drugs (e.g. VX-809). Engineered primary airways epithelial cells will increase the success rate of these screens. The mechanism of action of novel correctors will be established by biophysical, biochemical and cell biological assays. Based on the results of Aim 1-2, in Aim 3 novel mechanistic studies on the W1282X-CFTR functional expression defect, mutation-specific biochemical and functional HTS assays will be implemented to identify small-molecule correctors and potentiator and establish their mechanism of action."
"9250644","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common disease afflicting premature newborns who receive mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. In the United States, there are more than 500,000 babies born prematurely each year, of which ~ 49,000 are BPD patients. The pathology of BPD is consistent with an arrest of lung development, characterized by impaired angiogenesis and alveolarization. Importantly, the defects of lung development in BPD patients cause persistent impaired lung function in adulthood, leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The underlying mechanisms of BPD are still unknown and the current therapy is not effective. The objectives of the current proposal include: 1. Reveal novel mechanisms of pathogenesis of hyperoxia treated mice (BPD mouse model). 2. Provide new therapeutic strategies of hyperoxia treated mice. Since both endothelial cell (EC) specific G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2-interacting protein-1 (GIT1) knockout (ecGIT1-KO) mice and hyperoxia treated mice resemble BPD, these two mouse models are ideal tools to study the mechanisms of BPD. Our preliminary data demonstrate that there is enhanced Delta like 4(Dll4) mediated Notch signaling in lungs of both models. Notch signaling is strictly cell type and context dependent. Our findings also imply that Dll4 activates Notch4 in EC to inhibit angiogenesis, while Dll4 activates Notch1 in airway epithelium cell (AEC) to inhibit alveolarization through EC-EC and EC-AEC crosstalk. These inhibitory effects possibly occur through decreased cell proliferation and cell survival. Based on these exciting findings, we hypothesize that enhanced Dll4 mediated Notch signaling contributes to the angiogenesis and alveolarization in BPD as modeled by ecGIT1-KO mice and hyperoxia treated mice. To test our hypothesis, three Aims are proposed. Aim 1: Determine the functions and mechanisms of EC-EC and EC-AEC crosstalk initiated by Dll4 mediated Notch signaling in ecGIT1-KO mice. Aim 2: Define Dll4 mediated Notch1/4 signaling in hyperoxia treated mice. Aim 3: Evaluate the therapeutic effects of inhibiting Dll4 on lung development of hyperoxia treated mice. Accomplishing the aims of the proposal will fill the specific knowledge gap regarding mechanisms of postnatal lung development and pathogenesis of hyperoxia related lung dysfunction. We also intend to discover novel therapeutic strategies for BPD and related lung diseases, such as COPD and PAH. Broadly, the results will provide insight into mechanisms of both normal and pathologic angiogenesis that may be important in cancer, diabetes, ischemic cardiac and cerebral vascular disease."
"9362638","ABSTRACT Nine Investigators from the RR&D Center for Limb Loss Prevention and Prosthetic Engineering are requesting funds to acquire a CurveBeam pedCAT foot and ankle scanner. The scanner will be used in a series of research projects aimed at improving the quality of life of Veterans at risk of amputation and Veterans and service members who have undergone lower extremity amputation. The pedCAT scanner has a number of advantages over our current approach to obtaining imaging data of the foot and ankle or residual limb, which requires the use of a conventional, full body computed tomography (CT) scanner. Weight-bearing scans of the foot and ankle allow key clinical conditions that affect these joints and are prevalent in the veteran population to be more readily diagnosed. The pedCAT provides higher resolution images and also a significant reduction in radiation dose ? equivalent to just a few hours of background radiation ? which will result in reduced research participant burden, easier recruitment, and the ability to carry out more extensive analysis protocols using our biplane fluoroscopy system, which requires scans of the anatomy of interest to analyze the movement of the underlying bones. Furthermore, access to this equipment will reduce our reliance on clinical imaging services, which in the past has led to a number of logistical issues in terms of scheduling and cancellations, resulting in a more efficient research workflow, benefiting both investigators and research participants. The scanner will support a number of projects that span the Center?s research portfolio:  ? Quantitative Prescription of Foot Orthoses: A Dose-Response Study of Kinematics in Patients with  Foot and Ankle Pain using Biplane Fluoroscopy. The scanner will be used to image of the foot and ankle  bones. These data are required to analyze the kinematics of the bones via biplane fluoroscopy while the  subjects are walking with different insole designs.  ? Do Rocker Bottom Shoes and Ankle-Foot Orthoses Reduce Pain and Improve Mobility for Ankle  Osteoarthritis Patients? The scanner will image the foot and ankle bones, and these data will subsequently  be used to analyze the kinematics of these bones via biplane fluoroscopy for different interventions.  ? Residual Limb Skeletal Movement During gait. The scanner will image the bones in the residual limb.  These data are required to analyze the kinematics of these bones relative to the prosthetic socket via biplane fluoroscopy.  ? The Biomechanics of Lateral Wedge Insoles. The scanner will be used to image the foot and ankle bones  for subsequent biplane fluoroscopy studies of the effects of different insole designs.  ? Reducing Internal Stresses in Deformed Diabetic Feet. The scanner will be used to obtain high resolution  images of the foot and ankle bone geometry for computational model components.  ? Improving the Detection, Classification and Treatment of Misaligned Arthritic Ankles. The scanner will  be used to image the foot and ankle bones for subsequent biplane fluoroscopy analysis.  ? Mapping The Soft Tissue Artifact of the Foot and Ankle and Evaluating Site Specific Errors based on  Subject Characteristics. The scanner will image foot and ankle bones for subsequent biplane fluoroscopy analysis.  ? Comparing Surgical Treatments for Hallux Rigidus Using a Biomechanically and Anatomically  Realistic Foot Model. Foot and ankle CT scans will be carried out using the pedCAT to determine the  geometry of foot and ankle bones. These data are required to produce 3D printed replications of the hallux  rigidus feet to test various surgical treatments."
"9260943","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder involving motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances present in more than 1 in 10,000 persons but, as a family disorder with a long, costly, debilitating course, with an indirect impact on a far greater proportion of the population at great cost to the individul and society. While some palliative treatments are used, there is currently no effective treatment for preventing clinical onset of the disorder or for delaying its inevitable progression toward premature death, ~15 years after diagnosis. In past decades, genetics provided the tools to map the HD gene to chromosome 4 and ultimately to identify its mutation as an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding sequence of a large protein, dubbed huntingtin. The length of the expanded HD CAG repeat is negatively correlated with the appearance of diagnostic motor signs but does not explain all of the variance in this phenotype, as other genetic factors also influence the disease process. We have used genome-wide association analysis to identify regions of the human genome which harbor disease-modifying genetic variation that acts to alter age at motor onset in human patients of European ancestry. Identification of the actual modifier genes at these locations will highlight processes occurring before clinical diagnosis to alter the course of HD and therefore to provide new, human-validated targets for traditional drug development. Our aims are to capitalize on existing genetic data and carry out focused additional genotyping of subjects to determine whether 1) these modifiers also modify cognitive and psychiatric onsets; 2) overlap with genetic factors in other disorders; and 3) show enrichment for pathways/processes that could provide targets for intervention. These findings, combined in each associated region with dense haplotyping, sequencing and expression analysis of the loci involved and testing of candidate genes in established disease-relevant assays in human induced pluripotent stem cells and precise genetic HD mouse models will converge to identification of the gene responsible for disease modification and its functional variation. The product of this work will be a knowledge of specific genes and pathways that can delay HD pathogenesis in human patients, of the degree to which they broadly affect both HD motor and other phenotypes and of the potential mechanisms by which they act. We will also provide critical cellular and mouse model resources necessary to rapidly drive the findings toward translation for the HD community. It is our belief that the identification of novel targets, implicated by the natural variation in biological processes ongoing in HD patients themselves, will provide a firm foundation for developing effective pharmaceutical interventions to push those processes toward a strong therapeutic benefit in HD patients. Thus, the promise of this grant is a new and powerful route to fulfilling the greatest need of HD patients and families: an effective treatment to delay of prevent onset of the disease."

"9363371","Abstract  The Bedford VA hospital requests for fund to acquire the Helios CyTOF time-of-flight atomic Mass Spectrometer (MS), manufactured by Fluidigm. Currently, our hospital MS laboratory is equipped with a Q Exactive hybrid Orbitrap MS, a Quantiva Triple Quadrupole MS, and a QSTAR MS/MS system. The new Helios CyTOF MS will combine cell cytometer, inductively coupled plasma, time-of-flight MS into a single instrument. It is completely different from existing MS instruments. With the addition of Helios CyTOF MS, we will expand core biomarker detection capability at the Bedford VA Hospital Research and Development program. This instrument will play an important role in multi-disciplinary clinical studies that are supported by VA, providing us with an unparalleled ability to phenotypically and functionally profile cells from normal and diseased states. The Helios CyTOF MS will be used for multiple VA funded studies directed by Drs. Xia, Stein and Hanlon (major users), along with other principal investigators (minor users) at the Bedford VA Hospital (Drs. Moo, Morin, Wells, Semenov), Boston VA Health System (Drs. Driver and Rasmusson), and Columbia VA Hospital (Dr. Gu). The Helios CyTOF MS will be used to analyze a large variety of biological samples for studies related to central nervous system disorders. Specifically, it will be used to characterize induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and to understand and facilitate the reprogramming process from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to iPSC. Response to therapeutics will be predicted (Aim 1). The Helios CyTOF will be used to help establish peripheral biomarkers from subjects with chronic traumatic encephalopathy or Lewy Body Dementia and correlate to neuropathological and Near Infrared (NIR) spectra based analysis (Aim 2). Single-cell proteomics obtained by Helios CyTOF will be profiled with metabolomics and lipidomics in blood samples from Alzheimer?s disease (AD) patients (Aim 3). Finally, multiple biomarker studies supported by VA and NIH will be corroborated by single-cell proteomic profiling with Helios CyTOF (Aim 4)."
"9295331","PROJECT SUMMARY  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and other sexual minority youth (SMY) are at greater risk than their heterosexual counterparts for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB), nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), and myriad health problems. Specifically, SMY endorse both STB and NSSI at rates 3 times greater than heterosexual youth. NSSI, while a major public health concern in its own right, significantly exacerbates risk for suicidal behavior. Thus, examining suicidal and self-injurious behaviors among SMY is a federal public health priority, as acknowledged by NIH PA-15-263.  The psychological mediation framework, an adaptation of the minority stress (MS) model, posits that MS (i.e., stressors ranging from daily slights or insults to more overt forms of bullying and discrimination related to marginalized sexual orientation) leads to impaired general psychological processes, such as emotional dysregulation, maladaptive cognitive processes, and social and interpersonal difficulties, as well as sexual minority group-specific processes (e.g., internalized homophobia).Consequently, these processes put SMY at increased risk for psychopathology. The proposed research seeks to address gaps in the field by examining potential mechanisms that may account for the relationship between MS and STB/NSSI in SMY. Informed by the psychological mediation framework as well as our own pilot research findings, we seek to investigate mechanisms across four areas of functioning: affective (affect intensity, affect dysregulation, rumination, and attention bias to negative affect), cognitive (low self-esteem), interpersonal (insufficient social support and interpersonal rejection sensitivity) and sexual minority-group specific (internalized homophobia and sexual orientation concealment). Very importantly, each of these hypothesized mechanisms have been found to be associated with increased risk for suicidality, and each represent potential targets of intervention.  We propose an innovative exploratory study, administering subjective self-report measures and objective behavioral tasks to high risk SMY (N=60), recruited from various clinical settings. We will examine whether MS is associated with specific affective, cognitive, interpersonal, and group-specific mechanisms, and whether these are in turn associated with STB/NSSI in SMY (Aim 1). Using a daily diary approach, we will examine the extent to which hypothesized these mechanisms account for the relationship between MS and STB/NSSI in their natural environment (Aim 2). We will also conduct Timeline Followback interviews with all participants at the end of the daily diary phase. To inform the development of future interventions, we also propose conducting in-depth interviews with an at-risk subset of the same SMY participants (n=20) to better understand their experiences with these mechanisms, coping, and treatment. Findings from this study would demonstrate feasibility for a larger-scale, prospective R01 study to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased risk for NSSI/STB in SMY and pilot data to develop effective and culturally-sensitive interventions."
"9246340","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Embryonic neurogenesis is a tightly controlled process through which the cerebral cortex develops. During neurogenesis neural progenitors first undergo proliferative divisions, giving rise primarily to progenitors. As neurogenesis proceeds progenitor divisions increasingly give rise to neurons. Disruptions to this balanced production of progeny are associated with aberrations in cortical development, including microcephaly (reduced brain size). Recent human genetics studies reveal that mutations within components of the RNA binding exon junction complex (EJC) are clinically associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and in some cases microcephaly. We find that haploinsufficiency of EJC components in mice results in microcephaly, with precocious neuron production and apoptosis. Genetic ablation of p53 significantly, albeit partially, rescues microcephaly and neurogenesis phenotypes. This partial rescue implicates p53 as a major contributor to disease pathology, but suggests p53-independent mechanism also contribute. In this proposal we address two key questions: 1) What is the mechanism activating p53 following EJC impairment and 2) What are the p53- independent functions of the EJC which contribute to microcephaly. Recently, we have identified that ribosome biogenesis is disrupted in EJC mutant mice, an event which is well established to elicit a p53 response. Herein, propose to directly test if impaired ribosome biogenesis acts as a key mediator of p53 activation. Additionally, we will decipher the role of the EJC in modulating translation of fate determinant mRNAs as a p53-independent mechanism regulating neurogenesis."
"9464064","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insulin is essential to the treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and is often required for optimal management of Type 2 DM. Despite its many decades of clinical use, the complex post-receptor signaling properties of insulin include both therapeutic and non-therapeutic effects. The overarching objective of this Phase I SBIR application is to demonstrate proof-of-principle that the signaling properties of insulin at the cellular level may be selectively re-engineered to optimize glycemic control while avoiding undesirable biological actions. Such selective re-engineering, in general designated biased agonism, represents a key emerging frontier of molecular pharmacology. Nobel Laureates Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein have highlighted the importance of selective insulin resistance in T2 DM leading to the classic triad of hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. The concept of selective insulin resistance in the liver assumes increased importance with the realization that elevated fatty acids and triglycerides make detrimental contributions to the diabetic state, they note. Brute-force treatment of type 2 diabetes patients  with large doses of [wild-type] insulin... can overwhelm the insulin resistance and control the blood sugar, but at what price? (Brown, M.S., & Goldstein, J.L. Selective versus total insulin resistance: a pathogenic paradox. Cell Metab. 7, 95-6. (2008)). In this paradigm selective resistance to the glucose-lowering effects of insulin leaves intact undesirable signaling properties of insulin with respect to lipid synthesis and mitogenicity. That signaling through the insulin receptor can in principle lead to biased signaling outcomes has recently been demonstrated in animal studies of a phage-display-derived peptide agonist (Frikke-Schmidt, H., Pedersen, T.A., Fledelius, C., Olsen, G.S., Bouman, S.D., Fitch, M., & Hellerstein, M. Treatment of diabetic rats with insulin or a synthetic insulin receptor agonist peptide leads to divergent metabolic responses. Diabetes (E-pub Oct. 14, 2014)). This application builds on the recent structural elucidation of a conserved hormone-binding pocket in the ectodomain of the insulin receptor to design a non-standard insulin analog with biased agonist properties. Preliminary studies suggest that this novel analog retains glucose-lowering activity with marked attenuation of its mitogenicity in human cancer cell culture and that in an animal model (Sprague-Dawley rats) cellular signaling is shifted toward glycogen synthesis in muscle. Support is requested to enable a more complete analysis of these signaling properties and to characterize the structure and stability of the insulin analog."

"9321578","Project Summary Health challenges linked to human aging take a tremendous toll on our society. Physical and cognitive decline limit the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers. Aging is the major risk factor for, and possible cause of cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease, and thus struggle with debilitating disease is a common health burden for the aging population. Without question, the promotion of healthy aging with extended resistance to decline should be a major objective of current medical research. To investigate healthy aging, simple animals models such as the nematode C. elegans have been studied, providing molecular insights into the genes and chemical compound interventions that can modulate conserved aging processes likely to act similarly in humans. The goal of the proposed work is to continue, and expand, efforts of a co-operative scientific group involving three closely interacting laboratories who coordinately test pharmacological interventions for the ability to extend healthy aging and promote longevity in nematodes. A specific emphasis of this integrated super-group is to test promising drugs on a collection of natural variants of the Caenorhabditis genus, which together represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population. The idea is that treatments that confer positive outcomes across a diverse population will have an increased chance of being efficacious in higher organisms and will be suggested as priority interventions for testing in pre-clinical mouse studies and possibly future human trials. This CITP Buck Data Coordination Center proposal describes the creation of a centralized database a proposal for its continued development. We also describe the statistical methodology we propose to employ. Overall, we will participate in a unique team project that has the power to define pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population, with implications for development of therapies that promote healthy human aging."
"9249673","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a committed physician-scientist in Pediatric Critical Care, who aspires to become an independent investigator focused on developing novel ways to prevent brain injury and improve neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. Neurologic disability among cardiac arrest survivors is common, costly, and severe. Cardiac arrest affects more than 350,000 people in the United States each year, and more than half of the survivors have substantial neurologic disabilities. The candidate's published preliminary data indicate that neuronal circuitry in the region of the thalamus responsible for sensation, attention and arousal is dysfunctional after cardiac arrest. The current proposal builds on this discovery and aims to determine the specific mechanism of thalamic circuit dysfunction after cardiac arrest (Aim 1). Furthermore, the affected thalamic circuit exerts a profound influence on the cerebral cortex both during development and in adulthood, suggesting that abnormal thalamic input after cardiac arrest contributes to disruption in cortical function among survivors. Hence, the proposal will investigate the impact of abnormal thalamic input on development of cortical function after cardiac arrest (Aim 2). The proposed experiments combine a cutting-edge, sophisticated and reproducible rodent model of cardiac arrest with modern techniques in sensory neurophysiology and neuroanatomy. The findings will be novel and important, as they will help design mechanism-based and age- appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies in cardiac arrest survivors. This Career Development Award builds on the candidate's extensive experience in systems neuroscience by augmenting his current skill set with world-class coursework in Computational Neuroscience, Imaging and Analysis of Defined Cell Populations. A well-developed, formal Career Development program complements the scientific classwork by requiring the candidate to master skills in grantsmanship and ethics, to demonstrate national expertise in his field through conference attendance and peer-reviewed publications, and to leverage the NIH-funded infrastructure for career development at Washington University School of Medicine. The training plan defines a specific timeline for classes, conference attendance, grant submissions, and progression to independence. The candidate has assembled and has already fully engaged a superb Scholarship Advisory Committee composed of internationally-recognized, funded physician-scientists with a broad range of expertise in neuroscience, molecular biology, development and physiology. The Institution, Washington University School of Medicine, has fully committed to supporting the candidate by protecting his research time, by providing the necessary laboratory space and financial resources, and by limiting his administrative, teaching and clinical responsibilities. Th proposed Career Development and Research plans, combined with the intellectual environment and institutional support at Washington University School of Medicine, will propel the candidate towards becoming an independent physician-scientist and a leader in Pediatric Critical Care."
"9279522","Project Summary/Abstract The aim of the Georgia Veterinary Scholars Research Program (GVSP) at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine (UGA-CVM) is to immerse academically talented veterinary students from across the US in cutting edge research inspiring them toward careers in biomedical research, and fostering in them a deeper understanding of the myriad roles, and vital need, for veterinarians in research. Critical to this aim is the GVSP's commitment to broad, inclusive recruitment of students and careful pairing with strong, cross-disciplinary mentors who are not only capable of providing a thorough exposure to the principles underlying the conduct of research, but who also provide a scientific environment that instills a sense of community. A specific effort is necessary to recruit biomedical scientists with broad medical training, such as our veterinary graduates, as partners in the nation's biomedical research endeavors. Veterinarians are well equipped to provide a critically needed comparative organismal biology approach to the frontiers of biomedical research, including animal cloning, transgenics, development of medical devices, and translational medicine. Veterinarians are also ideally trained to recognize spontaneous animal models of human disease and are key players in the disciplines of public health, emerging infectious diseases and food safety. Nevertheless, veterinary students are often not aware of the wealth of career opportunities in research and in many cases do not recognize the role of veterinarians in these exciting areas. Clearly for the promises of ?One Health? and translational medicine to be realized in healthier people and animals, we will need more veterinarians engaged in research. The renewal of our training grant will help us accomplish the important aim of showcasing the excitement and wonder of research careers to future veterinarians with the intent to prompt them to choose research as their career. During the 12- week summer program seven pre-doctoral veterinary student trainees (35 total trainees for the five year project period) are welcomed into the discipline and camaraderie of the scientific community and challenged to think creatively. Fundamental skills are conveyed through seminars on topics including ethics, responsible conduct of research, scientific rigor, animal welfare, and communication skills. Relaxed journal club discussions, team building exercises and site visits to local research organizations contribute to a sense of community and excitement about future research possibilities. The central experience is full time hypothesis-driven research with a mentor of the student's choosing, culminating in written and oral presentations at the university and national levels. The PI is the Director of GVSP and 36 mentors spanning 12 departments in 6 colleges and schools within UGA support the program. An advisory and a mentoring committee further support the progress of the program and the enhancement of the mentor and trainee experiences. The GVSP is designed to capture the imagination of future veterinarians at a formative time to inspire them to develop into independent investigators."
"9436862","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide and is the third leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Clinical and preclinical studies suggest the importance of inflammation in acute and chronic neuronal tissue damage following ischemic stroke; however, the mechanisms and cells involved in neuroinflammation are not fully understood. There is currently no available treatment for targeting the acute immune response that develops in the brain during cerebral ischemia, and no new treatment has been introduced to stroke therapy since the discovery of tissue plasminogen activator therapy in 1996. We found that interleukin 21 (IL21) is a major contributor to acute brain injury after ischemic stroke. IL21 expressing cells were detected in perivascular regions and the infarcted parenchyma of ischemic human brain tissues. This raises the possibility that IL21?targeting therapies adjunct to current treatments might be beneficial in stroke management. The long-term goal of this work is to understand how to manipulate the acute inflammation following ischemic injury in order to inhibit stroke-induced tissue damage. The objective of this proposal is to define the mechanisms by which IL21 is involved in acute stroke-induced injury. The specific hypothesis is that the recently discovered circulating IL21-producing follicular helper T cells (Tfh) infiltrate into ischemic tissues in the brain, where IL21 contributes to tissue damage by inducing neuronal death and dysfunction of the neurovascular unit (NVU). Three aims will study how IL21 contributes to ischemic injury in the brain. In Aim 1, we will identify cellular source(s) of IL21 in the ischemic brain and determine the regulatory pathway(s) that are important for Tfh cell recruitment to stroke lesions. We propose that selective Tfh cell recruitment blockers could decrease tissue damage in stroke. In Aim 2, we will evaluate spatiotemporal expression of IL21R in the ischemic brain and test potential regulator(s) of IL21R expression on neurons. We propose that inhibiting IL21R expression on neurons could decrease tissue damage in stroke. Aim 3 will focus on the role of IL21R on neurons. We will study the role of neuronal IL21R expression in neuronal damage and subsequent dysfunction of the NVU. Successful completion of this work will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism by which IL21 promotes damage in ischemic injury and identify new therapeutic targets in stroke."
"9249581","ABSTRACT (Overall Component) The overarching goals of our Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC) are to prevent disease and improve public health through innovative programs of excellence in environmental health sciences research, to engage communities to address environmental health issues, and to enhance career development of talented environmental health investigators. The EHSC provides the framework for the generation of novel research findings and their conversion into effective resources for public health officials, medical professionals, and the community. This tradition of success is based on our ability to recruit broad multi- and interdisciplinary expertise, maintain a strong emphasis on basic science principles while incorporating clinical and translational approaches, and effectively interact with the community. The specific mission of the EHSC at Rochester is to improve public health through the generation of fundamental knowledge and elaboration of mechanisms by which chemical exposures, alone or through interaction with other modifying factors, contribute to cumulative health risk across the life span. As such, the theme that guides and integrates EHSC research and community engagement programs is the understanding of interactions of environmental and occupational agents with diverse individual contexts across the lifespan in modulating human disease and dysfunction. The goals of the Center are achieved through a major focus on three research programs: Pulmonary & Cardiovascular Disease Program, Neurodevelopmental & Neurodegenerative Disease Program, and Musculoskeletal Disease Program. While the Center is structurally organized into these Disease Programs, shared thematic biological processes, including immunological responses & inflammation, stem cell biology, early life sensitivities and mechanisms of adult disease, epigenetics, and nutritional/dietary factors, weave these programs together and synergize the research. These research efforts are supported by several structural units: Administrative Core, Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core, Biostatistics Facility Core, Community Outreach & Engagement Core, Pilot Project Program, and Career Development Program for Environmental Health Science Investigators."

"9242664","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The hyperandrogenemia that often occurs in association with polycystic ovary syndrome and the typical high-fat/high-calorie Western-style diet (WSD) can both result in obesity and metabolic and reproductive dysfunction. It is unclear whether these effects are independent of obesity, or if hyperandrogenemia and WSD together exert synergistic effects on metabolic control and reproductive competence. This is a critical issue for young pre/peripubertal girls who are subject to hyperandrogenemia in the context of a WSD. Adipose tissue is a prime candidate for a site of integration of the separate and combined effects of hyperandrogenemia and WSD; it is responsive to both androgens and WSD, and capable of elaborating adipocytokines that can (a) produce a feedback enhancement of inflammatory responses in adipose tissue itself, as well as (b) influencing other organs, including the reproductive system, though classical endocrine and neuroendocrine mechanisms. This project will examine the consequences of carefully controlled testosterone exposure and WSD, singly and in combination, in a unique longitudinal study of prepubertal female nonhuman primates. The study will also include an arm in which testosterone and WSD are removed in order to ascertain the persistence of androgen effects, which will inform the design of therapeutic approaches to attenuate the consequences of hyperandrogenemia and high-fat/high-caloric diet. We hypothesize that hyperandrogenemia and WSD induce synergistic, dysfunctional effects on female adipose tissue function that are manifested as altered cellular morphology, insulin responsiveness, inflammatory status, and adipocytokine secretion. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1. To determine the effects of hyperandrogenemia and WSD on adipocyte tissue morphology, differentiation state, and insulin action by exploiting our recently developed approaches for ex vivo analysis of adipose explants. 2. To determine the effects of hyperandrogenemia and WSD on adipose inflammation, fibrosis, vascularization, and adipocytokine secretion. 3. To determine the reversibility of the effects of hyperandogenemia on adipose tissue function."
"9253093","Project Summary/Abstract - Core B This core unit serves as a central resource for all control (C) and high fat (HF) fed animals used by all investigators in the Program Project. Core personnel are responsible for continuing and up-to-date assessment of animal requirements for all Projects. They ensure timely ordering, delivery, and proper housing of animals. All animal surgery (except some post-mortem tissue removal) is conducted and/or supervised by Core B personnel. This includes production of HF feeding induced hypertension and appropriate control or sham- operated rats, most routine tissue removal for in vitro analysis, and instrumentation of rats for chronic hemodynamic monitoring. All animals used in the Program Project have their blood pressure carefully and reliably quantified by Core B personnel either directly (implanted arterial catheter or radiotelemetry transmitter) or indirectly (systolic pressure by tail-cuff sphygmomanometry) prior to or as part of each experimental protocol. Daily animal husbandry, health surveillance and record keeping also are the responsibility of Core B personnel, in association with the staff of University Laboratory Animals Resources (ULAR) of Michigan State University. Core B personnel also are responsible for developing and implementing new physiological techniques for evaluating cardiovascular function in rats. A major advantage of the Animal Core is that it facilitates the most efficient use of animals by Program Investigators. Our in vivo protocols also are designed to maximize the amount of data collected from a single animal. This is achieved through use of long-term repeated measurements of cardiovascular parameters where possible, rather than studying separate groups of rats at each time point of interest. At the end of chronic in vivo protocols, tissue samples from the rats are distributed to one or more Program investigators for further study."
"9428525","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The electroneutral K+/Cl- co-transporter 2 (KCC2) allows neurons to maintain low intracellular Cl- concentrations, an essential prerequisite for fast synaptic inhibition mediated by type A ?-aminobutyric acid (GABAAR). Consistent with this, deficits in KCC2 activity lead to seizures and are believed to be central to the pathology of Status Epilepticus (SE). SE is the most devastating form of epilepsy, and accounts for 42,000 deaths per year in the US, and hundreds of thousands more cases of severe brain damage. SE becomes less tractable with time, leading to the development of drug resistant seizures, resulting in increased mortality and morbidity. SE is associated with a cost of $4.8 billion per year in the US. Consistent with its essential role in regulating neuronal Cl- homeostasis, deficits in KCC2 activity are seen in patients with intractable epilepsy, and in animal models of SE. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which SE leads to inactivation of KCC2 is of clear clinical significance. KCC2 function is subject to both positive and negative modulation via phosphorylation of key regulatory residues within the C-terminal intracellular domain of this protein. Specifically, phosphorylation of serine 940 (S940) by protein kinase C enhances KCC2 activity, while phosphorylation of the adjacent threonine residues 906 and 1007 by with-no-lysine kinases (WNKs) decreases transporter activity (Lee et al., 2007; 2011; Riehart, 2009). Thus, one mechanism that may contribute to KCC2 inactivation during SE is modifications in the phosphorylation of these key regulatory residues. To address this issue, we have utilized phospho-specific antibodies against S940 and T906. In addition, we have created mice in which the phosphorylation of these key regulatory residues has been prevented via mutation to alanines. Finally, we have made use of mice deficient in WNK3, the principle WNK isoform expressed in the adult brain. Preliminary studies using these novel reagents have allowed us to formulate an overarching hypothesis that will be tested here; Persistent elevations in neuronal activity during SE lead to dephosphorylation of S940, but enhanced phosphorylation of T906/1007, events that lead to rapid inhibition of KCC2, reductions in the efficacy of GABAergic inhibition that directly contribute to the pathophysiology of SE. Our studies will focus on the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that deficits in KCC2 phosphorylation contribute to the development and lethality of SE Specific Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that S940A mice exhibit enhanced T906 phosphorylation and a selective deficit in KCC2 activity during SE Specific Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that reducing WNK dependent phosphorylation of KCC2 prevents the development of SE. Collectively these experiments will provide key mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of SE, and may aid the development of novel therapeutics to limit the impact of this devastating disorder."
"9244667","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed U54 Center at the University of Virginia has a major goal of promoting translational research leading to clinical application of novel basic  findings. The Center theme is Clinical and Basic Studies in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), with a focus on the etiology of the hypothalamic abnormalities in pre- adult models. The etiology of PCOS remains uncertain, but involves abnormal regulation of GnRH secretion and disordered ovarian function, either primary or consequent upon continuous stimulation by gonadotropins and/or cogonadotropins. Our focus is specifically to elucidate the mechanisms by which excess androgens, prior to maturation, modify estradiol and progesterone regulation of the firing frequency of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator. Hyperandrogenemia (HA) is common in obese girls, with some 65-70% having an elevated free testosterone (T) in plasma. Adolescent HA is a recognized precursor of PCOS in adults. Thus we propose to assess the sources and effects of elevated T on sex steroid feedback in girls, on suppression of hypothalamic steroid receptor feedback mechanisms in primates, and on the evolution of the GnRH neuronal network in young rodents. The Outreach Core aims to enhance physical activity in overweight girls, through educational programs for adolescents in the community, enhancing their understanding of how exercise reduces obesity and decreases the risks of long-term metabolic complications. The three Projects are supported by two Cores proposed to operate in an open access format. The Administrative Core oversees overall integration of the research and provides fiscal and billing support to the Ligand Assay Core. Ligand Assay Core services will be available to all approved Fertility & Infertility Branch (FIB) projects and will continue t function as a national resource to the FIB.  The proposed U54 Center will build on prior productive, collegial interactions with Dr. S. Moenter (U Michigan) and Dr. J. Levine (U Wisconsin). The clinical and basic projects are closely linked and use optimum models to investigate the mechanisms of steroid regulation of GnRH secretion and development of the GnRH neuronal network in maturing animals. This linking will allow rapid transfer of basic information to clinical application, with the overall goal of enhancing our abilities to predict the disorder in adolescents and enhance therapeutic approaches to PCOS at an earlier age, with resultant improvement in health for some 6-8% of women in the U.S."
"9253424","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our training program in pulmonary disease provides comprehensive research training for individuals with a serious commitment to a career in lung biology and biomedical research, particularly as it interfaces with clinical pulmonary medicine. Lung diseases comprise a major source of excess morbidity and mortality worldwide, so our primary premise is that progress toward improved understanding of the pathobiology of these diseases is required to make progress toward treatment and prevention. The program has a long history (30 years) of training numerous physicians and scientists who have subscribed to this mission, and have become leaders in academic pulmonary and critical care medicine. Although the program is under new titular leadership, the leaders are not new to the program having received their training in it. We plan to maintain the previous scientific and training success, while adapting the next generation of researchers to the constantly changing state-of-the-art of basic and translational science. Recent changes have included expanded resources (recruitment of new faculty members, and increased laboratory space) and the creation of a new Lung Research Center. This has allowed us to broaden the scope of research questions related to lung biology, and attack the problems at the most basic and translational levels incorporating new core resources. We have also enhanced our didactic program and further solidified program organization for oversight and mentoring of trainees. We identify trainees with a demonstrated interest in a research career, help them locate a training environment to pursue a problem of interest and in which creative and rigorous thinking combined with state-of-the-art technology is being used to pursue the problem, and provide them with the tools and mind- set to attack related problems in the future. Finally, we provide a prolonged period of support so that trainees are prepared to ultimately become productive independent investigators, and future leaders in academic pulmonary and critical care medicine. Of the 43 trainees enrolled in the program over the last decade, 40 (93%) remain in academic medicine and research, which includes 3 trainees who are performing clinical research in industry. Only 3 trainees in the past decade are now in private practice. These T32 trainees obtained 33 grant awards consisting of 16 NIH mentorship awards (13 K awards and 3 F32 NRSA), 7 independent R-awards, 2 core leaders for 2 separate P01s, 1 site PI for the Framingham Heart Study, 1 site PI for a R01, 1 Site PI for a U10, 3 Parker B. Francis awards, and 2 foundation awards (Harvard Catalyst KL2, Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation). In addition, our T32 appointed trainees have published 331 papers during this interval with 211 of those articles published with their training grant mentors as co-authors. The new Program Director of this training program will continue to work with the utmost enthusiasm and energy to ensure that the trainees will continue to excel and contribute significantly to the academic pulmonary community."
"9320058","Muscle wasting is a hallmark of sustained alcohol abuse and the associated weakness represents the most common form of skeletal muscle myopathy. Over the past 4 years we have used genetic, biochemical and pharmacological approaches, both in vivo and in vitro, to generate definitive evidence pertaining to the mechanisms by which acute alcohol intoxication (binge drinking) and chronic alcohol consumption impair muscle protein synthesis under basal postabsorptive conditions and antagonize the anabolic response to amino acids and growth factors. The original 3 aims remain valid with experiments in the first phase of the R37 elucidating the cellular mechanisms by which alcohol down-regulates nutritional signals transduced via mTORC1-dependent and -independent transduction networks producing skeletal muscle myopathy, and comparing these to hormone- and contraction-induced regulation. Exceptional progress was made (27 publications) and the research environment leveraged for the successful training and F32 funding of a post- doctoral fellow who will continue in alcohol-related research. Our publications attest that the original aims have been largely achieved; although our new data also open previously unrecognized avenues of exploration. Unique tools have been developed that will permit us to identify and explore novel mechanisms and thereby validate specific proteins as therapeutic targets. Specific Aim 1 determined whether alcohol-induced changes in Deptor are responsible for the decrease in basal and leucine-stimulated muscle protein synthesis. This aim is now extended to investigate the relative importance of alcohol-induced changes in Deptor under in vivo conditions using our newly developed muscle-specific Deptor knockout mouse. Further, our new data reveal alcohol decreases the previously unrecognized binding of REDD1 with Deptor, a finding that will be expanded upon. Specific Aim 2 delineated the mechanism by which alcohol alters mTOR endosomal trafficking thereby impairing mTORC1 and protein synthesis. This aim will be continued by assessing alcohol-induced changes, with and without leucine, on Sestrin2 phosphorylation and binding with proteins of the GATOR2 complex. The goal of these experiments is to identify new components and modifiers governing the topology of mTORC1. Specific Aim 3 elucidated whether altered MAP4K3 signaling is in part responsible for alcohol-induced decreases mTORC1. These studies will be extended to examine the MAP4K3-dependent phosphorylation of Raptor that can function by mTORC1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. This R37 extension exploits innovative approaches, made possible by the availability of novel reagents and supported by our strong track record. While in vitro studies permit us to define cellular mechanisms and prioritize future work, state-of-the-art in vivo approaches permit us to definitively assign physiological importance ? thus filling knowledge gaps. The expected outcomes will contribute translational knowledge on nutrient regulation and provide seminal mechanistic insights into the clinically significant pathology of alcohol-induced muscle disease. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Alcohol excess, both chronic abuse and acute intoxication, exacts a staggering economic cost to society and remains a major public health problem. Alcohol use disorder is associated not only with increased mortality, but also with premature and preventable health concerns, and impaired rehabilitation. Our study focuses on the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which excess alcohol impairs basal skeletal muscle protein synthesis and produces a resistance to the normal beneficial effects of nutrients, thereby leading to the development of alcoholic myopathy, one of the most prominent muscle diseases."
"9251922","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebrovascular accumulation of the amyloid ß-protein (Aß), a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is an important driver of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and is a common comorbidity of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). CAA can promote VCID through a number of mechanisms including chronic inflammation, hypoperfusion and ischemia, loss of vessel wall integrity and hemorrhage. In addition to its prevalence in AD, several related familial CAA disorders result from specific mutations that reside within the Aß peptide sequence of the Aß precursor protein including the Dutch-type (E22Q) and Iowa-type (D23N) mutations. Despite the highly fibrillogenic nature of Dutch mutant and Iowa mutant Aß peptides, fibrillar Aß is restricted to te cerebral vasculature in these familial disorders. Recent evidence suggests the cerebral vascular amyloid is distinct from parenchymal plaque amyloid. However, there is a poor understanding as to why cerebral vascular amyloid forms and its unique structural features that promotes distinct pathological consequences leading to VCID. Thus, the focus of this proposal is to fill this critica void in knowledge. Accordingly, the overall hypothesis of this proposal is that fibrillar amyloid i cerebral blood vessels possesses distinct structural features compared to parenchymal fibrillar amyloid and unique anti-parallel structures, enhanced by CAA mutations, drives the cerebral vascular specific deposition of amyloid in brain.  To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims. First, we will determine the structure, assembly and membrane interactions of wild-type and the Dutch and Iowa CAA mutants of Aß in solution and model membrane systems that drive their compartmental deposition. Second, we will determine how familial CAA variants of Aß chronologically influence the structural features and assembly of wild-type Aß in the brains of transgenic mice. Third, we will isolate parenchymal plaque amyloid and cerebral vascular amyloid from post mortem brain tissue of AD cases, sporadic CAA cases and familial CAA cases and investigate their ability to promote assembly of wild-type and CAA mutant Aß peptides. These important studies will reveal the distinct structural signatures of cerebral vascular and parenchymal plaque amyloid deposits in human disease.  Presently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapies specifically for CAA and VCID. These deficiencies are complicated by our lack of understanding of the unique structural attributes of cerebral vascular amyloid and its early-stage oligomeric precursors, and their distinctive features and processes compared to parenchymal plaque amyloid. The present proposal will seek to fill this critical void in our knowledge and will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of CAA and provide the basis for the future development of novel therapeutic interventions and diagnostic markers for CAA and VCID."
"9265070","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain affects a large number of Americans, costing an estimated $600 billion annually. In particular, temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD), a complex chronic pain condition influenced by biological, psychological, environmental and social factors affects about 6% of the population. Recent studies suggest that genetics plays an important role in pain sensitivity, modulation and susceptibility to the development of chronic pain and TMD. Individual chronic pain experience is highly variable; some people are mildly affected, while others suffer debilitating dysfunction. Individuals also vary substantially n their responses to therapeutic interventions; for some, pharmacological treatments are highly efficacious while in others only modest reductions in pain occur. Up to 50% of the variability in clinical pain outcomes has been shown to be secondary to expectancy-induced analgesia, defined as the reduction in pain in an individual that results from his or her perception of the therapeutic intervention. In other words, patients' expectancies can modulate the individual pain experience, processing and response to pain treatments. Therefore, better understanding of the genetic effects on expectancy-induced analgesia and the variability in proneness to activate endogenous inhibitory systems is critical to optimize pain treatments. We developed a novel comprehensive genetic, behavioral and imaging approach to study the role of genetic variations on behavioral, psychological and neuronal mechanisms of expectancy-induced analgesia in patients with TMD. We address the following specific aims: 1. Test the hypothesis that variants in candidate genes are associated with expectancy-induced analgesia predicting chronic orofacial pain endophenotypes; 2. Test the hypothesis that individual psychological traits are unique modulators of the complex genetic moderation of expectancy-induced analgesia, regardless of the severity of the disease; and 3. Test the hypothesis that variations in the specific (identified) genes predict expectancy-induced analgesia and related neuronal changes in the prefrontal and limbic areas. The identified genotypes will serve as important markers to predict subjective (e.g. pain reports) and objective (e.g. neuronal) responses to expectancy-induced analgesia while controlling for modulatory effects of distinct personalities. We anticipate: a) to provide a new framework to study the pharmacogenomics of chronic orofacial pain, b) to identify genetic markers and mechanisms that can be used to develop new therapeutic targets and strategies and ultimately, c) to determine which patients are most likely to respond to specific treatments."
"9256490","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma, involve pathological changes in retinal photoreceptors and/or inner retinal neurons. It is well known that different diseases can target different cell types. In principle, physiological modification must occur in diseased cells, before detectable abnormality of retinal morphology. Therefore, functional evaluation of retinal physiology is important for early disease detection and reliable treatment management. At University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), we have developed several optical approaches, including functional optical coherence tomography (OCT) and line-scan confocal microscopy, to pursue optophysiological monitoring of physiological activities using transient intrinsic optical signal (IOS) changes correlated with retinal stimulation. We propose here to validate functional IOS mapping of photoreceptor physiology at high resolution (< 50 m). Success of this project can lead to better study and diagnosis of photoreceptor dysfunction associated with eye diseases, including AMD which is the leading cause of severe vision loss and legal blindness. Our preliminary study has revealed IOS abnormalities in one mouse model with inherited photoreceptor degeneration, and in vivo confocal-IOS observation of individual frog photoreceptors have been demonstrated. Fast confocal-IOS imaging promises a high-resolution method for functional examination of photoreceptor physiology, while simultaneously providing information of retinal morphology. However, before clinical deployments of the functional IOS imaging, there are several obstacles: 1) IOS mechanism in the retina is not clear; 2) IOS imaging protocol of rod and cone systems is not developed; 3) clinical relevance between IOS modification and retinal disease is not established. These problems will be tackled in our three specific aims of this project. The first aim is to investigate physiological sources of the IOS. A hybrid confocal-OCT microscope will be employed to dissect the IOS in the photoreceptor and inner retinal cells at sub-cellular resolution. Comparative measurement of normal and aspartate-treated retinas will be used to test physiological pathways of the IOS. The second aim is to develop stimulation protocol for functional IOS mapping of retinal photoreceptors. We anticipate that selective mapping of localized (e.g., 50 m) rod and cone functions can be achieved through quantitative controls of retinal adaptation and stimulation, without the requirement of resolving individual photoreceptors. The third aim is to establish clinical potential of functional IOS imaging. One inherited photoreceptor degeneration model rd10, i.e., C57BL/6J-Pde6brd10, will be used for comparative IOS, electrophysiological, and histological study. Success criterion of this study is to demonstrate that the IOS imaging allows early detection of photoreceptor dysfunction at the time point no later than detectable structural changes in the retina. By the end of this project, ultimate imaging modality (i.e., confocal or OCT) for clinical application will be identified based on quantitative comparison of confocal- and OCT-IOS images."

Additionally, the microscope can stitch images together with an automated, laser-focused tilescan feature for even higher resolutions. This new instrument will be used by a number of investigators at the VALLHCS to perform imaging work. Furthermore, the culture chamber included with this microscope and timed scans will allow for time lapse live imaging of cell motility, morphology, and differentiation in a sterile environment. Studies proposed in various funded studies require laser scanning confocal system for imaging both at the molecular, cellular and organ levels. The software that comes with the system allows automated and precise quantitation of various fluorescent signals employed. The system also allows for obtaining high quality images for data documentation and publication. A number of VA, DOD and NIH funded investigators at this VA Medical Center including Drs. Mohan, Lau, Rundle, Qin, Xing, Li and Edderkaoui require this equipment to perform studies related to their funded grant applications. Currently, no laser scanning confocal microscope is available for research use at VALLHCS. The requested instrument is needed for successful completion of funded studies that are relevant to the pathogenesis and treatment of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and hearing loss, diseases that are target areas of the VA research mission."
"9328615","Project Summary/Abstract  Latino adolescents in the United States face a number of mental health disparities. In particular, this group appears to experience an excessive disease burden due to social anxiety. In line with National Institute of Mental Health research initiatives, the present study seeks to examine how cultural factors relevant to Latinos are related to neural correlates thought to be associated with clinical dimensions of social anxiety, in an effort to inform the design of tailored prevention and intervention efforts aimed at mitigating mental health inequalities. Specifically, the present study plans to investigate the association of collectivism (an attitudinal cultural value in which group cohesion and interpersonal relationships are given great value and priority) and two event-related brain potential (ERP) components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and the feedback negativity (FN). The ERN and FN are negative deflections in the ERP that occur following error detection and receipt of feedback. Extensive literature links them to cognitive processes (exaggerated error-monitoring and feedback response) that contribute to social anxiety symptomatology. These electrophysiological measures have also been conceptualized as reflections of individual variance in threat sensitivity. Specifically, the meaning of a certain context to an individual can enhance the neural response to errors or feedback. In line with this understanding, for individuals who endorse adherence to collectivism, the social context is thought to have especially high importance. Thus, errors and negative feedback that take place in a social context are more salient, which is manifested in enhanced ERN and FN. We aim to test three manipulations of social context in samples of Latino (n = 37) and non-Latino Caucasian (n = 37) adolescents using electrophysiological research methods (ERPs). Each task will include an ecologically valid manipulation of social environment that reflects facets of the cultural and developmental group under study. The three experimental tasks are complementary in their ability to address the notion that culture interacts with neural mechanisms associated with cognitive processes that contribute to social anxiety symptoms. Consistent with a cultural neuroscience perspective, this research intends to explore how an individual?s view of themselves and their connections to others play a critical role in determining the implicit meaning and value of the social context and of one?s neural response to social stimuli. Findings may have translational implications and inform the science that guides the development of culturally appropriate anxiety treatment for underserved youth. The long-term goal of this project is to provide the applicant with training that will set the stage for a career in the field of pediatric cultural clinical neuroscience. Thus, the proposed fellowship is designed to promote acquisition of new knowledge and skills related to psychophysiological research methods, as well as to integrate training in cultural and developmental frameworks."
"9250048","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an R01 application in response to RFA-AI-13-013 Partnerships for Biodefense (R01). Rickettsioses represent some of the most devastating human infections. These tick-borne diseases are caused by obligately intracellular bacteria of the genus Rickettsia, including typhus fever (Rickettsia prowazekii), an NIAID Category B Priority pathogen. It has been forecasted that temperature increases due to global climate change will lead to more widespread incidence of rickettsioses. In addition, a high infectivity and severe illness after inhalation make rickettsiae potential bioterrorism threats. Although rickettsil infections can be controlled by appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy if diagnosed early, up to 20% of misdiagnosed or untreated and 5% of treated Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) cases result in a fatal outcome. In fact, a fatality rate as high as 32% has been reported in hospitalized patients with Mediterranean spotted fever. Strains of R. prowazekii resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been developed in laboratories. Therefore, novel mechanism-based treatments are urgently needed. Our recent studies reveal that exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac1) plays an important role in rickettsiosis. Deletion of Epac1 gene in mice protects them from fatal rickettsioses. Most importantly, we have developed first-in-class, small-molecule Epac specific-inhibitors (ESIs). Using these ESIs, we have further demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of Epac in vivo recapitulates the Epac1-null phenotype: wild-type mice treated with an ESI are protected from fatal rickettsioses. These results indicate that Epac1 is a novel therapeutic target for potentially fatal rickettsiosis. In te present proposal, we will design, synthesize and optimize the lead candidates discovered in our laboratory for the discovery and development of more potent and specific ESIs with minimal toxicity, desired pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties. Optimized ESIs will be further analyzed for preclinical testing for efficacy and safety to identify drug candidate in animal models in vivo for the development of effective therapeutics for rickettsioses."
"9247067","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main focus of our research has been to understand the biological functions of two highly related signaling molecules, myostatin (MSTN, GDF-8) and GDF-11, which we discovered in a screen for new transforming growth factor-ß family members. We showed that mice lacking MSTN have dramatic increases in skeletal muscle mass throughout the body, and we and others showed that systemic administration of MSTN inhibitors to mice can promote muscle growth, showing that MSTN acts to limit muscle growth postnatally. Hence, there is extensive interest in targeting MSTN to enhance muscle strength and regeneration, and at least 7 biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are in phase II/III clinical trials testing myostatin inhibitors in a wide range of disease settings. We showed that GDF-11 plays an important role in axial patterning and in kidney development, and other groups subsequently showed that GDF-11 also regulates the development of the nervous system and pancreas. Gdf11 is expressed widely in adult tissues, and recent studies have suggested that GDF-11 may play an important role in aging. Specifically, circulating GDF-11 levels were reported to decrease with age, and administration of GDF-11 protein to aged mice was reported to reverse age-related tissue dysfunction in the heart, skeletal muscle, and nervous system. Some of these findings have since been challenged by a paper reporting that GDF-11 levels increase with aging and that GDF-11 has a detrimental effect on skeletal muscle regeneration. These findings have raised new questions regarding the roles of MSTN and GDF-11 in adult animals as well as the potential strategies for manipulating the activities of these molecules for clinical applications. A major question in this regard is whether the distinct functions of MSTN and GDF-11 reflect the inherent biochemical differences between these highly related molecules or whether their distinct functions simply reflect their differing pattern of expression. The overall goal of this project is to understand the basis for the distinct functios of these molecules. This project is a continuation of our long-standing effort to understand the mechanisms underlying the regulation and signaling of MSTN and GDF-11 and will utilize the many genetic and biochemical tools that we have developed over many years to target the various components of this regulatory network. The Specific Aims are: to compare the activities of MSTN and GDF-11 in vitro with respect to the roles of known signaling components, including inhibitory binding proteins and receptors; to examine the roles of these binding proteins and receptors in regulating skeletal and cardiac muscle growth and function and skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo; and to carry out gene knock-in experiments in mice in which the MSTN coding sequence is replaced with GDF-11 (and vice versa). The results of these experiments should provide key insights into the mechanistic basis underlying the distinct biological functions that MSTN and GDF-11 carry out in vivo. We believe that these studies will be crucial for developing strategies to exploit the activities of these molecules for therapeutic intervention."
"9242509","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 15 and 20% of couples have difficulty conceiving; failures of the reproductive system thus affect many individuals. In females, understanding the control of ovulation is critical for helping those with infertility conceive singe, as opposed to multiple, births, and for developing novel methods to prevent unwanted pregnancy in manners that are consistent with the acceptable social mores of most of the population, while minimizing side effects. The goal of this proposal is to increase our understanding of the generation of the central neural signal that ultimately leads to ovulation. This signal is provided by a shift in output of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons from one that is strictly episodic, producing on/off GnRH pulses that drive pituitary hormone release, to one in which GnRH release is continuously elevated for several hours. Estradiol initiates this GnRH surge, which induces the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that subsequently triggers ovulation. To induce the GnRH surge, central estradiol action switches from negative feedback to positive feedback. Ovariectomized (OVX) mice treated with constant physiological levels of estradiol (OVX+E) undergo daily shifts from negative to positive feedback that are timed to the light-dark cycle, allowing mechanistic studies in a reduced variable model. In ovary-intact mice, this switch in estradiol feedback mode occurs on proestrus. Previous work in the daily surge model established several mechanisms engaged by estradiol that would lead to suppression of GnRH neurons during negative feedback and activation of these cells during positive feedback. In the proposed work, these findings will be extended with experiments that range from reductionist investigation of neurobiological mechanisms to whole animal studies, all aimed at elucidating the upstream neuronal networks engaged by estradiol to regulate GnRH neurons and surge generation. In Aim 1, we will study kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) region, postulated to mediate estradiol positive feedback. We will determine how their inputs and intrinsic properties change with estradiol and time of day. We will also study how estradiol feedback alters functional connectivity between kisspeptin and GnRH neurons using paired recordings in brain slices. Preliminary data indicate firing pattern, intrinsic properties and neurotransmission to AVPV kisspeptin neurons are altered both by estradiol and/or time of day. In Aim 2, we will study the mechanisms by which an acute stress disrupts the LH surge. This aim will test the neurobiological mechanisms that are disrupted by stress, and determine effector cells using genetic and surgical approaches. This aim will also expand our knowledge of mechanisms underlying the surge to the natural cycle. Preliminary data indicate a diurnal pattern to stress inhibition of surge generation, that the stress peptide corticotropin- releasing hormone inhibits GnRH neurons and that this is exacerbated by gonadal factors. Integration of the data resulting from the study of an excitatory and an inhibitory afferet network into existing knowledge will increase our understanding of the central neuronal control of ovulation by estradiol."
"9325153","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Following a traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients are predisposed to develop post-traumatic cortical network dysfunction and epilepsy. Chronic seizures can be a significant cause of disability for TBI patients, especially when the seizures do not respond to the currently available anticonvulsant therapies. We utilize a mouse model of TBI to study how the cortical network becomes prone to seizure activity, and we have shown cortical hyperexcitability and a loss of inhibitory interneurons following injury in this model. This suggests that there is an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance of the network, and that preserving the inhibitory cells may be able to prevent network dysfunction and seizure activity. Based on the knowledge that glycolytic activity is increased following injury, and that metabolism is a known anticonvulsive target, we are examining glycolysis as a potential therapeutic target to preserve interneurons following TBI. We propose a model of post-traumatic epileptogenesis in which glycolysis-dependent increases in excitation lead to excitotoxic cell death of interneurons and permanent losses in cortical inhibition. We hypothesize that 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), a competitive glycolytic inhibitor, is neuroprotective after TBI by attenuating the acute increases in glycolytic activity and excitatory neuronal activity that occur after injury. My preliminary data shows that in vivo 2DG treatment prevents the development of epileptiform activity following injury and attenuates the loss of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. In this proposal, I seek to examine the changes in synaptic activity (using electrophysiology) and interneuron survival (using immunohistochemistry and genetic labeling) that occur at early time points after TBI and may predispose the network to hyperexcitability. Additionally, I will examine whether glycolytic inhibition with 2DG can attenuate these pathophysiological changes. I have also used electrophysiological techniques to explore the effects of glycolytic inhibition with 2DG on neuronal excitability, and have collected preliminary results suggesting that 2DG decreases the excitability of excitatory pyramidal neurons, but not inhibitory interneurons. In the outlined experiments, I will further examine this idea as a potential mechanism for 2DG after TBI. Finally, I will use single-cell qPCR and immunohistochemistry to compare the mRNA levels and expression of metabolic proteins in excitatory versus inhibitory neurons after CCI. This research may provide evidence for a role for glycolytic inhibition in the preservation of interneurons following TBI and may reveal a novel cell type-specific coupling of metabolism to neuronal excitability. Importantly, the proposed experiments will provide excellent training opportunities to deepen my understanding of neural networks, improve my capabilities as an experimentalist, and support my development as a future neuroscientist under the mentorship of an experienced team of individuals."

"9253416","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is aimed at developing and testing methods that will enable automated, information--?rich studies of the subcellular organization of proteins     and other biomolecules.  We propose to develop the computational foundation for deciphering the spatiotemporal morphological pathways of different subcellular structures during important subcellular processes automatically from microscopy images.  We will leverage our progress in the previous project period, in which we established the Cell Organizer system for building image-?derived models of cell organization, to build new modeling capabilities for cisternal and reticular structures, for capturing the relationships between different cellular components, and for learning how aspects of cell organization change during processes such as the cell cycle.  Given the importance of the endoplasmic reticulum in numerous cellular processes (as well as diseases including hematological disorders, cranio--? lenticulo--?sutural dysplasia, chylomicro retention disease, etc.), we expect the modeling approaches we propose to provide important mechanistic clues as to the normal (non-- athological) morphological pathways of these structures and how they may be perturbed in disease.  To provide valuable images to drive the development of modeling capabilities, and to simultaneously identify candidate lead compounds for treatment of diseases with ER defects, we will conduct extensive compound screening studies on cells expressing normal and mutant alleles of atlastin (which plays a critical role in ER structure).  The computational methods we develop will be integrated into our open source CellOrganizer system (http://CellOrganizer.org).  In addition to the applications mentioned above, we anticipate the computational frameworks we develop will be valuable for a wide range of imaging assays including drug screens, RNAi screens, cytology, and pathology."
"9249933","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma Action at Erie Trial Asthma prevalence and morbidity has been increasing among children over the last three decades despite significant advances in environmental control and asthma care. The annual costs for children with asthma range between $2.0 and $3.2 billion. Asthma morbidity and its associated costs are not borne equally; they are highest for urban, low income, African American and Puerto Rican children. Community health workers (CHWs) have been growing in popularity as a potential intervention to combat these asthma disparities. CHWs are frontline public health workers who serve as liaisons between health and social services and communities to facilitate access to services and improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. The evidence on CHW asthma intervention efficacy has been growing but several critical gaps still exist. The Asthma Action at Erie Trial will test the ability of a CHW intervention with three important modifications to achiev asthma control in high-risk children: 1) CHWs will be integrated into both the clinical and the home setting, 2) A system for directly addressing mental health and psychosocial barriers will be provided, and 3) Participants will be provided only materials and equipment for trigger remediation that are supported by the current medical reimbursement system. A two-arm behavioral randomized controlled trial (N=220) will be conducted in partnership with a federally- qualified health center (FQHC) serving a low income, minority population that is at high-risk for significant asthma morbidity. The intervention arm will receive an integrated CHW home intervention for pediatric asthma education. The comparison arm will received clinic-based certified asthma educator (AE-C) services. Primary Aim 1 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention, relative to clinic-based AE-C education over 12-months, as demonstrated by asthma control. We hypothesize that the CHW arm will have at least 30% fewer days with activity limitation than the AE-C arm at 12-months. Specific Aim 2 is to assess maintenance of intervention efficacy, as demonstrated by asthma control at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the cost-effectiveness at 12-months of CHW and AE-C intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma exacerbations at 12- and 24-months. Specific Aim 4 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention relative to clinic- based AE-C education, as demonstrated by asthma control, among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or a post-traumatic stress disorder. This trial compares the current best practice in asthma self- management education (AE-C services) to an integrated CHW home intervention in which the real-life challenges of patients and the health care system are taken fully into account. This trial will provide clarity a to the expected effect size, cost savings, and resources needed to integrate asthma CHWs into clinical practice. ."
"9263696","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): (Revised text) This proposal seeks to identify and investigate molecular pathways that modulate adult neurogenesis in response to environmental stimuli. Following formative periods of early development, ongoing neurogenesis persists in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and contributes to learning, memory, and regulation of emotion. Adult neurogenesis can be modulated by environmental influences and experiences, including electroconvulsive shock (ECS) and voluntary running. Enhanced learning has been demonstrated in rodent models of wheel running, while electroconvulsive therapy is used in humans to effectively treat depressive disorders. Previous work has implicated a small number of molecules in transducing external stimuli into neurogenic effects, but few novel pathways outside of already well-established neurogenic factors have been functionally identified. Additionally, a major obstacle has been an inability to investigate biological pathways specifically within neurogenic cell types. Therefore, molecular mechanisms that facilitate environmentally induced neurogenesis in adult DG remain largely unknown.  To address the question of how molecular machinery in DG and specifically within newly formed neurons facilitates neurogenesis in response to extrinsic signals, I will utilize two complementary methods. Firstly, I propose that independent sources of data in the fields of epigenetics and neurodevelopmental disease can be integrated to inform a targeted screening of candidate genes likely to contribute to environmentally induced neurogenesis. I will characterize functional roles for candidate genes found to have altered expression in DG after ECS and/or wheel running. Secondly, I will utilize a novel Nestin-CreERT2/RiboTag mouse line to capture and characterize the translational profiles of enriched populations of newborn neurons as they mature in a voluntary wheel running paradigm, and genes of interest identified through this analysis will be functionally assessed. This research will yield significant insight into the inner  workings of developing neurons at the interface of environment and neuroplasticity. Additionally, novel mechanisms and pathways discovered may represent valuable targets for future regenerative treatments of brain injury and CNS disorders."
"9328274","PROJECT SUMMARY Inhibitory neurotransmission is of interest for its role in both disease and therapy. Dysregulated inhibitory neurotransmission is implicated in a broad range of psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and autism. Inhibitory receptors are also the target of diverse drugs, including those with clinical utility (benzodiazepines), abuse potential (ethanol), and lethal toxicity (strychnine). Clinical evidence suggests that defects in one inhibitory ionotropic receptor (glycine receptor, or GlyR) can be compensated by boosting activity in a distinct inhibitory ionotropic receptor (GABAA receptor, or GABAAR). The mechanism underlying this clinical phenomenon is not known, which highlights a key gap in our understanding of inhibitory synapses. Both receptors interact with the putative inhibitory scaffold protein, gephyrin, at synaptic sites, but it is unclear how this interaction impacts receptor localization and function. Two independent questions raised by these observations will be addressed here. Aim 1 will establish an in-vivo directional link between GABAAR and GlyR synaptic localization using immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology. Aim 2 will reveal the functional impact of gephyrin on GABAAR and GlyR channel properties, surface expression, and assembly in a heterologous system using electrophysiology and biochemistry. A deeper knowledge of the molecular regulation of the inhibitory synapse can change our view of the pathophysiologic basis of devastating psychiatric diseases, and will pave the way for better therapies in the future."

The Center is organized around the theme of critical windows of susceptibility to environmental exposures as important determinants of disease, forming the Michigan Center of Lifestage Environmental Exposures and Disease (M- LEEaD).  Lifestage, as used in this application, refers to clinically-recognized stages of development, mid-life, and aging that pertain to the preconception, prenatal, infant, child, adolescent, reproductive age adult, and aging adult periods of life.  The Center builds on a strong foundation of research activity and support at the University of Michigan in this emergent arena of environmental public health, with 16 NIEHS grants moving into the next funding period that includes a Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center and participation in a Superfund Research Program Center. The mission of M-LEEaD is to accelerate research that defines impacts of environmental exposures during vulnerable stages of life, and to promote translation of these findings to improve medical and public health interventions for the mitigation of chronic disease. The Center implements its mission through infrastructural support of established and new investigators applying novel transdisciplinary approaches that increase understanding of mechanisms by which environmental exposures target vulnerable stages of life. Support for research is provided through integrated Center programs that include a Pilot Project Program, three Facility Cores, and three Research Teams to create synergy for stimulation of innovative research. The Facility Cores are: 1) Integrated Health Sciences Core (IHSC); 2) Exposure Assessment Core (EAC); and 3) Omics and Bioinformatics Core (OBIC). Research Teams are organized around key mechanistic pathways of disease: 1) Inflammation & Oxidative Stress; 2) Genomics & Epigenomics; and, 3) Endocrine & Metabolic Disruption.  Research is coupled with the engagement of stakeholder communities through the Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) and training of future leaders in EHS through the Center Career Development Program.

"9297784","Project Summary. The world is heterogeneous with respect to danger and safety. While it is adaptive to be afraid when confronted with certain danger, an equivalent level of fear in safety or even uncertainty is maladaptive and detrimental to health. Precise control of fear is disrupted in anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, with those affected displaying exaggerated fear to safety cues. The goal of this project is to uncover how RRF neural activity permits precise control of fear. To do this, we have designed a novel and challenging fear discrimination procedure. In fear discrimination, three auditory cues are associated with different probabilities of foot shock: danger (p=1.00), uncertainty (p=0.25), and safety (p=0.00). Cue presentation is either random or blocked. Rats normally show precise control of fear as indicated by high fear to the danger cue, intermediate fear to the uncertainty cue, and low fear to the safety cue. In Specific Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that phasic RRF activity reflects an estimate of safety while tonic RRF activity reflects an estimate of danger. We will implant drivable microelectrode bundles in the RRF of adult male and female rats, and RRF activity will be recorded during fear discrimination. Analysis of phasic activity will focus on the cue presentation period. We predict that a significant population of RRF neurons will phasically increase firing in accordance with an estimate of safety: large phasic increases in activity to the safety cue, intermediate increases to the uncertainty cue, and low/no increases to the danger cue. Analysis of tonic activity will focus on the time period between trials. We predict that a significant population of RRF neurons will alter tonic firing levels in accordance with the current block: highest tonic RRF activity will be observed in the danger block, intermediate tonic activity in the uncertainty block, and lowest tonic activity in the safety block. In Specific Aim 2, we will use optogenetic inhibition and excitation to provide causal roles for phasic RRF activity underlying an estimate of safety and tonic RRF activity underlying an estimate of danger. Inhibition will be achieved by transfecting RRF neurons with viral constructs containing halorhodopsin, implanting optical ferrules above, and illuminating the RFF with green light. Excitation will employ the same general strategy, but will use channelrhodopsin in combination with blue-light illumination. Effects of RRF inhibition or excitation in the cue period will be compared to periods outside of cue presentation. We predict that phasic inhibition or tonic excitation of RRF activity will increase fear to all cues. By contrast, phasic excitation or tonic inhibition of RRF activity will decrease fear to all cues. Cumulatively, Aims 1 and 2 will demonstrate that RRF activity on multiple time scales is essential to the appropriate display of fear. The results of this proposal will uncover the RRF as a key brain region permitting the precise control of fear, as well as a locus of dysfunction and a compelling pharmacotherapeutic target for psychiatric disorders in which control of fear has been lost."
"9263953","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Continuous PTH (cPTH) treatment exerts a bone catabolic activity while intermittent PTH (iPTH) treatment induces bone anabolism. Our published data indicate that the differential effects of cPTH and iPTH is explained by the specific capacity of cPTH and iPTH to induce T cell production of the osteoclastogenic factor TNF? and the pro-osteogenic Wnt ligand Wnt10b, respectively. Preliminary studies in humans and mice show that cPTH and primary hyperparathyroidism expand Th17 cells and increase the production of IL-17A via a TNF dependent mechanism. By contrast, iPTH in mice and Teriparatide (a form of iPTH treatment) in humans expand regulatory T cells (Tregs), an immunosuppressive population of CD4+ T cells. Demonstrating a role for IL-17 and Tregs, we found that in vivo neutralization of IL-17A blocks the increase in RANKL production by osteocytes (OCYs) and osteoblasts (OBs) and prevents the bone loss induced by cPTH. By contrast, Tregs depletion blunts the bone anabolic activity of iPTH. We thus hypothesize that cPTH and iPTH polarize the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th17 and Tregs, respectively, and that the differential effects of cPTH and iPTH in bone are explained by the specific capacity of cPTH and iPTH to expand Th17 cells and Tregs. Consequently, in Aim 1 we will: a) determine if cPTH induces Th17 cell expansion by increasing TNFR1 and G?S signaling in CD4+ cells, b) determine the contribution of Th17 cell produced IL-17A to cPTH induced bone loss via conditional deletion of Th17 cells, c) investigate if IL-17A signaling in OCYs and/or OBs is required for cPTH to upregulate RANKL production and induce bone loss. In Aim 2 we will determine: a) if iPTH increases the differentiation of Tregs by signaling directly in CD4+ cells vi PTHR1, b) if PTH increases the differentiation of Tregs by increasing the sensitivity of naïve CD4+ cells to TGF? via a notch dependent mechanism, c) if Tregs deletion blocks the anabolic activity of iPTH, and d) if Tregs potentiate iPTH induced Wnt10 production and bone anabolism by blocking CD28 signaling."

In the last 5 year cycle (2009-2014), BADERC Transgenic Core- generated mice have been featured in 317 publication (131 authored by BADERC Core users and 186 authored by ?non users?, the latter demonstrating extensive sharing of BADERC Transgenic Core-generated mice with other labs). 30 of these publications were in the top tier journals, Cell, Nature and Science, and 101 appeared in other very high impact journals (Cancer Cell, Cell Metabolism, Genes & Development, J Clinical Investigation, Molecular Cell, Nature Genetics, Nature Immunology, Nature Medicine, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and PNAS). In addition, the BADERC Transgenic Core extensively leveraged and enabled NIH Principle Investigator research grant support (in total, Core users have 55 Research NIH Grants ? by funding mechanism from most common to least ? R01, R37,R56, R24, RC2, RC4, R03 and R21). With regards to development of new technology, the BADERC Transgenic Core is evaluating and implementing CRISPR/Cas9-related approaches to engineer the mouse genome. This will further expand usage by BADERC members as it bypasses the need for gene targeting in ES cells, and consequently greatly decreases the know-how required by users and, importantly, length of time required to generate engineered mice."
"9303373","COMMUNITY OUTREACH EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Community Outreach Education and Engagement Core (COE2C) enables two-way communication between the Core Center and community groups. The COE2C listens and responds to our communities who have concerns about environmental health. It communicates those concerns to our internal researchers, with the goal of informing their work and creating a platform for scientist-community dialog. One of our communities is composed of Native American Tribes in Maine who reached out to us to engage on issues of air and water pollution, as well as on issues involving how to explain, in a culturally sensitive way, the basis of environmental disease to their members. A second community is composed of the 22 towns in the Mystic River watershed in Massachusetts. These communities, some of which are environmental justice (EJ) communities, are concerned about water contamination from centuries of industrial activity. The two-way dialog with the CEHS, catalyzed by the COE2C, provides communities with important connections to scientific expertise to advise community members about their concerns. Additionally, the COE2C will continue to partner with health care professionals to optimize an innovative gene-environment toolkit to disseminate to this target audience. In the previous competitive cycle, the nurse community reached out to us to ask for such tools. Lastly, with funds independent of the NIEHS P30 program, the COE2C has created and will continue to develop other environmental health curricula in collaboration with research members; we plan to disseminate these materials locally and globally. The COE2C Director is Dr. Kathleen Vandiver who sits on the Internal Advisory Board of the CEHS. She will be responsible for convening the Community Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) meetings and maintaining multi-directional interactions with the communities, partner organizations, and with all research members in the CEHS."

"9403387","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Yale Interdisciplinary Immunology Training Program (YIITP) is to equip predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees with the intellectual and research foundations necessary to become independent scientists/educators investigating the immune system and its roles in human disease. The YIITP combines rigorous research training in a highly collaborative, interactive environment with a thorough academic program of instruction in immunology, microbiology, and related disciplines. The program offers training in virtually all aspects of immunology as well as host-pathogen interactions and a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Areas of particular strength include innate immune recognition and function, lymphocyte development, immunological tolerance and memory, antigen presentation, immune cell signaling, the immune response to infectious organisms, vascular endothelial cells, cancer immunology, and autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The 35 YIITP mentors, who have primary appointments in 8 different Yale departments, have an outstanding record of research accomplishment and training and many are leaders in their fields. The YIITP is overseen by the Program Director, David Schatz, and an Executive Committee of four additional faculty members. The principal training entity is the Department of Immunobiology, whose graduate program was the top ranked immunology graduate program in the United States in a 2010 National Research Council study. All students admitted to the YIITP have at least a Bachelor's degree in a relevant field and enter via application to the Yale interdepartmental program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS). Postdocs enter from the labs of YIITP faculty, and hold a Ph.D. and/or M.D. degree. Predoctoral training leading to the Ph.D. degree involves formal course work in Immunology and other areas of biology, research rotations, teaching, and the qualifying exam in the first two years, with dissertation research beginning late in year one and becoming the primary focus of activity after completion of the qualifying exam. Postdoctoral training focuses intensively on research in the laboratory of one or more of the mentors. Both predoctoral and postdoctoral training are enriched by intensive training in the methods, logic, and responsible conduct of research, and by the many opportunities for collaboration and interaction. The vast majority of YIITP trainees go on obtain independent research and teaching positions at academic institutions or research positions in biotechnology companies. Extensive efforts are made by YIITP mentors and Yale Graduate and Medical Schools to attract and retain trainees from diverse backgrounds, particularly under-represented minority groups. This proposal requests continued support for 10 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral trainees who will be supported by this grant for a maximum of 2 years. A major recent improvement in the program comes in the form of full institutional support from Yale for first year graduate students, allowing YIITP funding to be restricted to 2nd and 3rd year students."

"9263021","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that a network of interconnected GABAergic neurons is responsible for controlling and switching between the states of wakefulness, NREM sleep and REM sleep. When this GABAergic Switching Network for Sleep and Wakefulness is activated, wakefulness occurs and REM sleep is suppressed. The proposed GABAergic Switching Network for Sleep and Wakefulness is comprised of a primary population of GABAergic Executive neurons that reside in the pontine tegmentum (nucleus pontis oralis, NPO) and the hypothalamus (VLPO/MnPO). Wakefulness occurs when GABAergic neurons in the NPO are activated, i.e., these neurons inhibit both adjacent REM-on neurons as well as GABAergic neurons in other sites involved in promoting wakefulness, such as the dorsal raphe. REM sleep is controlled by glutamatergic cells in the NPO, called REM sleep-on neurons (that comprise the REM Generator). NREM sleep arises when GABAergic neurons in the VLPO/MnPO are activated which results in the inhibition of NPO GABAergic neurons as well as Wake-on neurons in sites such as the dorsal raphe. Therefore, the proposed studies will elucidate the circuitry and mechanisms that are responsible for generating, and switching between, the behavioral states of sleep and wakefulness.  These experiments are significant in light of the paucity of research that has addressed the manner in which each of the interdependent, but exclusively-occurring states of sleep and wakefulness arise and manner the fashion in which GABAergic inhibition provides for switching between these states. The information that will be obtained will significantly enhance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying the states of sleep, in general, and their interactions with wakefulness. In addition, a number of innovative concepts and novel technologies will be incorporated into the proposed studies which will further enhance their basic science and clinically-related significance, such as the use of a novel supraparamagnetic nanotechnology. The data that are derived from the proposed studies will provide a basis for future explorations into the development of therapeutics to treat disorders that are due to pathologies that involve disruption in the circuitry and mechanisms that control wakefulness and NREM sleep and REM sleep, such as cataplexy and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder."
"9254475","06 CANCER CONTROL AND POPULATION SCIENCES (CCPS) PROGRAM ABSTRACT The overall scientific goal of the CCPS Program is to reduce the burden of cancer through hypothesis-driven observational (epidemiological) and interventional translational research that spans the laboratory bench to the bedside and ultimately, the community at large (i.e., ?bench to trench?). This goal guides the research of 41 highly productive scientists who are members of this Program ? research that is supported by over $15 million in grant funding. Given UAB CCC's location in the Deep South, a region marked by poverty and large constituencies of underserved African-Americans and Appalachian Whites, an overarching theme of our program is to eliminate health disparities across the cancer continuum, from primary cancer risk to improved cancer survivorship. Additionally, since Alabama is a state with one of the highest rates of obesity, and that many of the most prevalent cancers within our catchment area are associated with overweight and obesity, we have worked diligently to develop a research focus in energy balance and cancer. The CCPS program is comprised of a cadre of multidisciplinary investigators who hold faculty appointments in 14 departments and 6 schools and who have broad expertise in areas of molecular and genetic epidemiology, health and cancer outcomes, cancer health disparities, behavioral science, nutrition and obesity, quality of life and end-of-life care, and cancer survivorship research. Long-term partnerships with Historically Black Colleges/Universities in our region, i.e., Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University provide a collaborative academic network that stretches across the Deep South and has resulted in research and training opportunities that are independently funded and have yielded publications in top-tier journals. The CCPS Program provides an organizational infrastructure that facilitates training for new and junior members, and active forums for collaborative interaction among all of its members. The CCPS also creates an active interface that enhances the integration of laboratory and clinical sciences, with population-based and behavioral science research. During this funding cycle, we have published 361 manuscripts of which 25% were intra-programmatic, 18% inter-programmatic, and 68% inter-institutional. Importantly, many papers and grant-funded research resulted from collaborations with investigators at other NCI-designated cancer centers, such as Fred Hutchinson, MD Anderson, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Moffitt, Mayo, Washington University in St. Louis, Dana-Farber and the Universities of Arizona, California, and Colorado."
"9430478","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Loss of vision in glaucoma is presumed to be due to compression of the optic nerve (ON) head by increased intraocular pressure (IOP), followed by ON degeneration and retrograde death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the RGC and ON degeneration is a prerequisite for developing novel neuroprotective treatments which is currently not available in clinics. Recently endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been shown to play a critical role in neuronal degeneration. Striking RGC-protection has been accomplished by manipulating two key downstream molecules of ER stress, deleting CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) or activating X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1). Of special interest, blocking the negative effects of ER stress also inhibited RGC death in a mouse glaucoma model. Thus targeting ER stress may have considerable therapeutic neuroprotective potential in glaucoma. This application will determine whether manipulating ER stress signaling molecules also rescue injured RGC axons in addition to RGC soma protection, through morphology and functional studies. Furthermore, efforts will be made to develop adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapies targeting ER stress to prevent neurodegeneration in mouse glaucoma models. New insights into the critical molecules that regulate RGC soma and axon survival can be translated into novel therapeutic approaches to prevent vision loss in patients with glaucoma."
"9228234","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positional cloning of mouse coat color mutations has provided a foundation for identifying and understanding paracrine signaling pathways that play fundamental roles in biology and disease. The phenomenon known as pigment-type switching-whereby hair follicle melanocytes switch between the production of red/yellow pheomelanin vs. black/brown eumelanin-has been especially informative for pathways used by the neuroendocrine, adrenal, exocrine, and pigmentary systems because of the central role played by the Melanocortin 1 receptor. Large-scale efforts in chemical mutagenesis and reverse genetics are gradually saturating the potential of the laboratory mouse as a tool for gene discovery, but advances in genomic technology have extended the reach of forward genetics beyond traditional model organisms. Although the pathways are evolutionarily conserved, the sensitivity of color variation as a phenotypic readout coupled with the opportunity to observe and select for unusual mutations in companion and domestic animals provides additional opportunities. The current proposal focuses on two classical coat color mutations in non-model organisms, Orange in the domestic cat and Sex-linked yellow (Sly) in the Syrian hamster; these are especially interesting because they are X-linked, yet mimic a loss-of-function mutation in the autosomal Melanocortin 1 Receptor (Mc1r). Our preliminary studies have identified a candidate mutation and mechanism for Orange, and a genetic map position and positional cloning strategy for Sly. Additional knowledge about the genetics and biology of melanocortin signaling will come from: (1) Experimental genetic studies in cultured cells and in transgenic animals to experimentally confirm and explore the molecular pathophysiology of Orange; and (2) Molecular identification and characterization of the hamster Sly mutation."
"9260043","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) accounts for 7-10% of acute ischemic stroke with a substantial risk of recurrent stroke in a setting of severe intracranial stenosis, approaching 12-25% over 1-2 years despite medical management. However, a risk stratification scheme is not available to identify this susceptible population for targeted treatment trials when intervention with more aggressive medical management and/or endovascular angioplasty/stenting could limit complications of ischemic stroke. The unmet need that we plan to address is to develop and study MR imaging modalities that may characterize vulnerable inflammatory and/or hemodynamically significant intracranial plaques, stratifying the mechanisms and potential predictors of primary/recurrent ischemic stroke in ICAD. Recently, we have identified unique intracranial plaque characteristics as well as hemodynamic parameters using quantitative MR perfusion techniques to stage cerebrovascular reserve failure that are associated with symptomatic intracranial stenoses. We propose a prospective study to recruit asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with severe ICAD and longitudinally assess them with a comprehensive and novel MRI protocol: high resolution 3T MR imaging, ferumoxytol molecular imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI to quantify the transfer constant (Ktrans) of contrast plaque permeability, and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR perfusion weighted imaging (MR- PWI) using the quantitative SCALE-PWI sequence. Our study hypothesis is that high resolution T1 plaque enhancement, T1/T2 plaque hemorrhage, early ferumoxytol uptake as a marker of macrophage infiltration/inflammation, intraplaque Ktrans permeability, and/or altered qCBF/qCBV perfusion based parameters with vascular territory analysis will assist in stratifying patient risk for thromboembolic versus hypoperfusion related ischemic complications respectively. This project aims to identify specific qualitative and quantitative thresholds with advanced high resolution, molecular, and functional MRI techniques that can be correlated to clinical presentations (asymptomatic, symptomatic, recurrent symptomatic), DWI infarct distributions (perforator, thromboembolic, hypoperfusion related infarcts), inflammatory blood markers, and clinical/imaging outcomes to inform an understanding of differential stroke mechanisms and to improve the selection of high risk ICAD patients who may be susceptible to primary or recurrent ischemic stroke despite aggressive medical management."
"9303127","Contractile cardiac patches offer the promise of improving mechanical function and clinical outcomes for diseased or damaged myocardium following a myocardial infarct (MI). However, currently available acellular scaffolds fail to couple with the host tissue and only provide passive structural support. As such, there remains a significant need to engineer an active cardiac patch that provides structural stability to damaged ventricular myocardium, generates cell-mediated contractility, and couples to the host myocardium, providing a substrate conducive to functional tissue regeneration. Recently, we developed novel methods for 3D printing fibrin microthreads. These fibers support human-induced pluripotent stem cell -derived cardiomyocyte (iPS-CM) attachment, providing up to 10% contraction. In addition, signal propagation along the lengths of the fibers has demonstrated a conduction velocity of 2.1 cm/s. These cell-seeded fibers have structural, mechanical and biochemical cues that can be precisely designed into hierarchically organized structures. From these observations, we hypothesize that cell-mediated contractile fibrin microthreads can be engineered into sheets of composite, contractile myocardial tissue that can be electrically coupled to provide signal propagation rates similar to native myocardial tissue. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:  In the first aim, we will maximize contractility of iPS-CM seeded fibrin microthreads with a physiologically relevant conduction velocity. We will systematically modulate fibrin microthread diameters and crosslinking strategies and we will determine the structural morphology that maximizes iPS-CM-mediated alignment, contractility and conduction velocities on the surfaces of the microthreads.  In the second aim, we will maximize contractile function of iPS-CMs seeded microthread-based composite layers. We will develop anisotropically aligned composite layers and we will modulate the packing density of iPS- CM seeded threads in the composite to determine the scaffold morphology that maximizes layer contractility and signal propagation rates  In our final aim, we will laminate iPS-CMs seeded microthread-based layers to produce electrically coupled contractile cardiac patches with dimensions of 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm x 0.3 mm thick. We will couple three individual composite layers with a cell-seeded microthread, creating scaffolds and we will determine the relative orientations of the layers that maximize the synchronous contractile properties.  The results of these proposed studies will enable us to systematically determine design parameters to maximize the iPS-CM mediated synchronous contractility of a physiologically relevant cardiac patch, composed of laminated sheets of aligned, microthread-based engineered myocardial tissue."
"9247826","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms underlying remodeling of cardiac t-tubules in response to various stresses associated with cardiac disorders. T-tubules are extensions of sarcolemmal membrane harboring essential elements involved in excitation-contraction coupling. While t-tubules appear to be constant features of adult ventricular myocytes under normal conditions they become disorganized or even lost during a number of pathologies including heart failure. However, despite finding strong correlation between t-tubular remodeling and changes in t-tubular structural proteins, it remains essentially unknown why and how t-tubular remodeling occurs. We have recently shown that t-tubules become constricted or even sealed off in response to removal, but not induction, of membrane stretch caused by brief hyposmotic shock. Preliminary data show that similar t-tubular remodeling also occurs in intact hearts after ischemia-reperfusion challenge which is associated with cell swelling and membrane stretch. Accordingly, this project will test an overall hypothesis that acute membrane stretch induced during various stress conditions leads to disruption of t- tubular system and consequent cardiac dysfunction. Aim 1 will determine molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying t-tubular remodeling in response to various acute stresses using a combination of 'state of the art' established approaches such as time-lapse 3D confocal microscopy as well as novel technology of electrophysiological recordings from whole individual t-tubules assisted by super-resolution Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy. Aim 2 will determine the cellular consequences of stress-induced t-tubular remodeling. It will provide detailed functional assessment of remodeled t-tubular system, including characterization of ionic homeostasis of sealed off t-tubules. In particular, this Aim will test a novel hypothesis that partially sealed t-tubules provide an unconventional pathway of Ca2+ entry into myocytes. Aim 3 will test a hypothesis that t-tubule sealing is a common mechanism leading to disruption of excitation-contraction coupling, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Here, we will employ an isolated mouse heart model to get mechanistic insights into the origins of cardiac dysfunction in response to acute osmotic stress, pressure overload and ischemia reperfusion challenge. Overall, results of this project will contribute significantly to better understanding of the origins of various stress-related disorders and thus will help in development of novel approaches in the treatment and prevention of relevant cardiac diseases."
"9245725","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shift work is associated with an increased risk for the development of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, which cannot be fully explained by differences in life style and socioeconomic status. Recently, we demonstrated that circadian misalignment, the misalignment between the central circadian pacemaker and the behavioral sleep/wake cycle (that is typical in shift workers), while keeping caloric intake and physical activity constant, leads to adverse metabolic changes. These findings may help explain the adverse health consequences of shift work. More recently, we also demonstrated in a prospective study that the timing of meals predicts the success of weight loss therapy, independent of caloric intake, activity and sleep duration. The importance of meal timing is consistent with animal experimental work showing that normalizing the circadian timing of the fasting/feeding cycle (without normalizing the sleep/wake cycle) prevents such adverse metabolic effects. Furthermore, misalignment between the central pacemaker and the fasting/feeding cycle leads to desynchrony between the central circadian pacemaker and peripheral circadian oscillators in the rest of the body, especially in metabolic organs such as liver and pancreas, a phenomenon known as internal desynchrony, which may relate to the adverse metabolic consequences of circadian misalignment. However, to date there exists no evidence for or against the development of internal desynchrony in humans, likely because of the demanding and complex circadian protocols required to test that hypothesis. In the current proposal, we will test whether manipulating the timing of food intake prevents the adverse metabolic effects of circadian misalignment (Aim 1), and whether desynchrony between the central circadian pacemaker and the behavioral cycle leads to internal desynchrony in humans (Aim 2). Because of the high proportion of the work force exposed to shift work and the grave consequences, this proposal has great clinical relevance and lays the scientific foundation for later development of a novel therapeutic approach against the increased risk for cardiometabolic disorders in this vulnerable population with chronic exposure."
"9242082","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Migraine is one of the most common neurovascular disorders. It is highly debilitating and difficult to treat. The disease mechanisms may involve abnormal ion homeostasis and neurotransmission. Multiple mutations in the gene encoding CaV2.1, the pore-forming subunit of human P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC), have been associated with familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM-1), a subclass of migraine with aura. Many of the migraine preventive and abortive drugs modulate the function of VGCCs but with poor specificity and efficacy. The overall goal of this project is to better understand th contribution of individual VGCC subtypes to the pathophysiology of migraine headache. In addition, the potential of VGCC blockers as anti-migraine therapeutics will be directly tested. Recent studies from our lab have found that loss-of-function (LOF) CaV2.1 mutations cause a decrease of P/Q- type current and a compensatory increase in N-type VGCC current in all subtypes of trigeminal ganglion (TG) and dorsal root ganglion neurons. Interestingly, a selective increase in LVA T-type VGCC current occurs only in small-diameter TG neurons that do not bind to isolectin B4 (IB4-). Moreover, LOF CaV2.1 mutations results in hyper-excitability of small IB4- neurons innervating the dura but not the facial skin. This is consistent with the fact that, other than migraine headache, FHM-1 patients do not show higher incidence of other somatic or orofacial pain. Importantly, pretreatment of wild-type mice with T- or N-type VGCC blockers significantly reduced the duration of head-directed nocifensive behavior in a mouse model of headache, indicating that VGCCs are involved in the activation of the neuronal circuit underlying migraine headache. In this project we propose to employ a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the mechanisms through which multiple VGCCs regulate the excitability and synaptic transmission of dural afferent neurons, thereby modulating the gain of the migraine circuit. First, we will test the hypothesis that P/Q-type Ca2+ channels regulate the excitability o small IB4- dural afferent neurons via functional coupling of the Ca2+-activated TRESK background K+ channels. We will investigate whether enhancing TRESK channel activity can reverse the hyper-excitability of dural afferent neurons and inhibit headache-like behavior in a mouse model. Secondly, we will use optical imaging technique to elucidate the contribution of N-type and other subtypes of VGCCs to Ca2+ influx synaptic transmission at dural afferent terminals. Finally, we will use a mouse model of headache to test the hypothesis that N- and T-type VGCCs in dural afferent neurons are potential targets for anti-migraine therapeutics. We will test whether N- and T-type blockers can be used for both abortive and preventive therapy of migraine headache. Taken together, the outcome of this project will offer new insights into the contribution of VGCCs to migraine pathophysiology as well as the therapeutic potential of trigeminal VGCCs and their downstream effector(s) in migraine treatment and prevention."
"9244819","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The fundamental relationships established between somatic cells and oocytes within germline cysts and primordial follicles during ovary development provide the framework for successful oocyte survival, maturation, and ultimate release upon ovulation. A long-term goal of our work is to discover the pathways and factors that facilitate oocyte-somatic cell communication during ovary development and early follicle formation. This issue is critical for us to develop the means to cultivate oocyte health during follicle development and maturation to ultimately preserve genetic transfer and species survival.  The fundamental hypothesis guiding this proposal is that Iroquois homeobox transcription factors, Irx3/5, which are tightly regulated by ?catenin, coordinate somatic cell-oocyte communication to promote oocyte survival and early stages of follicle maturation. In AIM 1, inducible mouse models will be used to knockout and knock-in gonad Irx3/5 activity to identify their critical juncture of temporal and spatial expression that regulates communication between somatic cells and the oocyte in germline cysts and primordial follicles to promote oocyte health and survival. Then in AIM 2, we will investigate the temporal and spatial transcriptional regulation of Irx3/5 by ?catenin in somatic and germ cells and the functional outcome of this pathway by evaluating whether re-introduction of Irx3 expression can rescue the germ cell death phenotype in ?catenin-mutant ovaries. Successful completion of these aims will uncover a novel pathway, ?catenin-Irx3/5, in the control of oocyte-granulosa cell communication whose disruption may contribute to causes of infertility and premature ovarian failure."
"9243273","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CPP RISE Program will integrate experiences in independent research, faculty and peer mentoring, role modeling and professional skill-building to prepare underrepresented minority (UR) science students for advancement to PhD careers in biomedical research. The goal will be to increase the number of UR students admitted to PhD programs by giving them the academic and research preparation that they need. We are focusing on four critical objectives: 1) increase Research-Specific Skills and Knowledge needed to become independent researchers; 2)increase student confidence in achieving their doctoral degree by integrating Mentoring, Advisement and Communities of Practice; 3) deepen student and family awareness of their career options through Career Discovery and Role Modeling; and 4) achieve competency in Research-Complementary Professional Skills. The Program includes both summer and academic year activities for three levels: 1) RISE Invitation (RIV) for undergraduates who want to do an introductory research project to determine their level of interest in doing research (1yr); 2) RISE Intensive undergraduates (RINUg) with a strong desire to pursue a research career (2 yrs); 3) RISE Intensive for Master's students (RINM) with a commitment to pursue a research career (2 yrs). Peer Mentor teams will be composed of an RIV, RINUg, and RINM, supervised by a Faculty Research Mentor (FRM). The summer session will be 10wks for RINUg and RINM, and 6wks for RIV. As one cohort, they will attend Friday summer workshops on topics including Biohazards/Chemical Safety, Animal Care, Time Management, Scientific Ethics, Guest Speaker seminars and RO1 Campus Coordinator visits. For RIV, from Mon.-Thurs. they will do discovery-based laboratory experiments (wks 1-3) and mini-research projects (wks 4-6). During the academic year, each RIV will be mentored by an FRM and a RINUg or RINM and execute a research project. During the 1st summer RINUg and RINM will spend Mon.-Thurs. doing an independent research project supervised by their FRM and continue their research during the next two academic years. RINUg and RINM students will spend their 2nd summer doing a research project at an R01 institution, becoming more confident in their ability to succeed in the R01 environment. Since there is a strong need to mobilize substantial family support to help the students' progress in their education, we will have two RISE Family Days, one at the start of the program to familiarize families with the overall program, and to hear from former RISE students who are in PhD programs or have earned their PhDs and one at the end of each academic year, for the students to present their research in lay language for their families. During the academic year, they will bring member(s) of their family to CPP to see what they are doing in the laboratory. Through these integrated activities, the Program will provide the support needed for the students to successfully transition into a PhD program and have successful biomedical research careers."
"9295355","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rates of PTSD, a chronic and debilitating mental disorder, are considerably higher in war-torn regions like Somalia, known for sexual violence and other human rights violations (e.g., 50.1%; Johnson et al., 2010). In the aftermath of substantial war- and refugee-related trauma, there is a clear need for effectiveness research addressing the significant, under-addressed mental health needs of Somalis and the broader Muslim community. While efficacious treatments exist for PTSD and related difficulties, such treatments typically require extensive training of providers prior to treatment delivery. Furthermore, there are significant barriers to dissemination of such treatments, particularly to the Somali community, due to Islamic beliefs that run contradictory to mental health interventions, language differences, and limited access to care (e.g., Bentley et al., 2011; Aloud & Rathur, 2009). For a population that is almost exclusively Muslim, a treatment that incorporates Islamic principles is essential. No existing trauma-focused treatments have an Islamic focus, despite the fact that almost a quarter of the world's population practices this religion. We have developed a brief, group-based, lay-led intervention, Islamic Trauma Healing, which specifically targets healing the mental wounds of trauma within mosques. The six-session intervention combines empirically-supported exposure- based and cognitive restructuring techniques with Islamic principles central to spiritual, social, family, and work life. Core intervention components include cognitive restructuring through Prophet stories, and exposure to trauma memories through talking to Allah. Tea, incense, and supplications are included as part of each group session to promote a sense of community and spirituality. We will examine the intervention in a small RCT and examine intervention mechanisms, specifically the effects of shifts in negative cognitions about self, world, and others and changes in connectedness with others and Allah. We also will demonstrate the initial feasibility of implementing the program outside of the U.S. to an Islamic country by conducting a small pre- to post-study design. Taken together, this work will serve as the foundation for a larger scale RCT within the U.S. Islamic refugee community and/or in the larger Islamic community outside of the U.S. The Islamic Trauma Healing program has the potential to provide a low-cost, self-sustaining model of faith-based intervention that can address the psychological wounds of trauma."
"9246507","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer metastasis is the major contributing factor to the majority of cancer-related deaths. Understanding the regulation and molecular mechanisms contributing to the promotion of cancer metastasis is paramount to developing new preventative measures and treatments. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental biological process where epithelial cells transform into fibroblastic mesenchymal cells capable of migrating and invading other tissues. Increasing evidence suggests that cancer cells hijack EMT in order to become metastatic. Much of the current research into the regulation of EMT and cancer metastasis focuses on transcription factors and signaling events, however alternative mRNA splicing is emerging as a major regulatory network that governs EMT and metastatic transitions. This proposal seeks to characterize the key splicing events that mechanistically drive EMT as well as the splicing regulatory components that control alternative splicing of these events in order to gain insight into the regulation of cancer metastasis. One of the most differentially spliced genes during EMT is APLP2, a member of the amyloid precursor protein family, which is expressed in many tissues and is involved in cell migration, adhesion, proliferation, and wound healing. However, the specific function of APLP2, especially its splice isoforms, is unknown. Exon 7 of APLP2 encoding a Kunitz Protease Inhibitor (KPI) domain is alternatively spliced during EMT yielding a long isoform (APLP2-L) and short isoform (APLP2-S). The central hypothesis of this project is that alternative splicing of APLP2 is essential for EMT and breast cancer metastasis. This hypothesis will be addressed through two specific aims that explore the mechanistic contribution of alternative splicing of APLP2 to APLP2 proteolytic processing, EMT, and cancer metastasis as well as the regulation of APLP2 alternative splicing. Aim 1 seeks to determine if APLP2 alternative splicing is essential for EMT and cancer metastasis and whether APLP2 alternative splicing causally controls switching of APLP2 proteolytic processing from an ?-secretase to a ß-secretase pathway. Aim 2 will determine the trans-acting splicing factors and cis-acting elements in APLP2 pre-mRNA that facilitate alternative splicing of APLP2. Together these aims will describe the critical role of alternative splicing in EMT and cancer metastasis as well as offering an exciting new therapeutic approach for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer by targeting the APLP2 splicing pathway."
"9267973","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Pancreatic islet transplantation has made great advances in the last decade marked by improved durability of islet function post transplant. These efforts are in part attributable to development of a standardized manufacturing process that has increased yield and consistency of the isolation. Recent advances can in part be attributed to the Clinical Islet Transplant (CIT) consortium effort through which an expert team of islet scientists and clinicians designed an islet manufacturing protocol for the phase III trials currently underway. Dissemination of this technology has made the production of high quality islets common at multiple US sites. Isolated human pancreatic islets are requisite not only for clinical transplant trials but also have become an invaluable material resource for investigators studying islet biology, physiology, beta cell proliferation, autoimmunity and Type II diabetes. The primary object of the proposed core is to provide high quality islets using the CIT manufacturing protocol to investigators working in the BADERC. The core will take advantage of: 1) an expert and well established islet isolation team with a proven track record of preparing islets for clinical and research purposes, 2) an existing MGH GMP isolation laboratory and islet core infrastructure, and 3) an abundance of available pancreata in New England as there currently is no competition for such organs. Based on these assets, we will be able to make available high quality human islets for research investigations to members of the BADERC tailored to their specific needs."

"9445920","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital deafness leads to significant language delays in children acquiring spoken language. Cascading effects of impoverished linguistic knowledge impact a wide range of psychological and cognitive behaviors including self-regulation, working memory, and reading. Cochlear implants (CIs) are a popular treatment option for deaf children. These devices deliver electrical stimulation to the auditory nerve, bypassing malfunctioning peripheral auditory mechanisms. Deaf children who receive cochlear implants early in life and engage in intensive oral/aural therapy often make great strides in spoken language acquisition. However, despite clinicians' best efforts, even under optimal conditions, there is a great deal of variability in language outcomes. The interplay of factors contributing to this lack of success is poorly understood. One mounting concern is that under conditions of deafness, the auditory system may be subject to maladaptive cross-modal plasticity (CMP). In cross-modal plasticity the processing demands of an intact sensory system, such as vision, may recruit nascent auditory cortex making it less available for speech processing. Animal models of deafness have shown evidence of functionally significant cross-modal plasticity with enhancements in visual processing tied to auditory cortical activation. Studies of deaf signing adults have also reported evidence of cross-modal plasticity including visual responsiveness within primary auditory cortex. The specialization of left-hemisphere auditory regions for visual sign language processing attests to the malleability of temporal lobe cortical networks. However, there are significant gaps in our knowledge. The conditions that precipitate CMP and the developmental time course of CMP are not known. There is an urgent need for studies that simultaneously assess auditory and visual processing in deaf children with cochlear implants during the formative stages of language development. Nor is it known how communication modality (signed or speech) impacts cross-modal plasticity. We use electrophysiology to obtain auditory and visual evoked potentials and assess functional integrity and development of the auditory cortex and the presence of cross modal changes in prelingually deaf children who have received cochlear implant. Using innovative behavioral testing and standardized measures of language function we will assess the impact of spoken and signed language experience in the expression of cross-modal plasticity. The proposed studies will advance our understanding of the determinants of CMP and its relation to language use. The findings will have a significant impact on clinical practices for deaf children."
"9220377","PROJECT SUMMARY Five-year survival among children with cancer now exceeds 80%. Late cardiovascular disease, including cancer therapy-related cardiomyopathy/heart failure (CHF), has now become the leading non-cancer cause of premature morbidity and mortality among childhood cancer survivors. Anthracycline and related drugs have been well-documented to be the single most important risk factor associated with subsequent development of CHF among cancer survivors. Anthracyclines, despite their known cardiotoxicity, continue to be an integral part of many contemporary pediatric cancer treatment protocols. Dexrazoxane (DRZ) is an EDTA-like bisdioxopiperazine that decreases oxygen free radicals via intracellular iron chelation, and is FDA-approved for use as a cardioprotectant in adults being treated with high-dose anthracyclines for breast cancer. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends considering its use for all adults exposed to high doses of anthracyclines. However, concerns regarding DRZ?s safety and efficacy have limited its use in children. Four national phase 3 clinical trials that featured upfront DRZ randomization were conducted among more than 1,200 children with leukemias and lymphomas from 1995-2001. Patients were treated with a range of anthracycline (specifically, doxorubicin) doses still commonly used today. While some short- and intermediate- term data up to 5-years from these trials suggest that DRZ-exposed children had less acute cardiotoxicity and pathologic left ventricular remodeling, longer term data are lacking. The proposed research will attempt to ascertain long-term cardiovascular health in this population of childhood cancer survivors now that 15-20 years have elapsed since cancer diagnosis. Specifically, we will leverage the study infrastructure we have developed within the Children?s Oncology Group (COG; a member of the NCI?s National Clinical Trials Network) in order to prospectively ascertain current cardiac function via echocardiography and overall cardiovascular health among at least 200 survivors. This sample size will allow us to definitively determine if survivors randomized to DRZ have decreased markers of CHF compared with those treated on the standard non-DRZ arms. We will then combine prospective echocardiographic data with archived data collected by the original clinical trialists and those available from participating COG institutions to examine whether DRZ exposure is associated with a differential trajectory of echocardiographic change over time. Finally, we will deploy a variety of approaches, including use of administrative and insurance databases, to capture long-term adverse health outcomes from almost the entire study population. We believe successful completion of the proposed research will allow us to determine whether DRZ provides long-term cardioprotection, with immediate clinical implications for current patients and drug regulatory policy."

"9249669","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aortic aneurysms account for 1-2% of all deaths in industrialized countries. Marfan syndrome (MSF) is a common genetic disease that represents the most well studied situation for understanding the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms. Currently, there are no proven drugs preventing aneurysm progression, dissection and rupture. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop effective therapies. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms should provide new targets for developing treatments to aneurysms. Marfan syndrome is caused by FBN1 protein mutations that activate TGF? signaling to drive aneurysm formation. Using a Marfan mouse model that harbors the FBN1C1039G mutation found in Marfan patients, losartan was discovered to prevent aneurysm formation. Distinct from the well-established TGF? signaling paradigm, recent discoveries of mutations in smooth muscle cell (SMC) actin cytoskeleton proteins such as SM ?actin (ACTA2) and ?-myosin (MYH11) in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection highlight a new mechanism of actin cytoskeleton contractile dysfunction in the pathogenesis of aneurysms. SM22, an actin binding protein, is known to significantly downregulated in the aneurysms of Marfan patients. Our published studies demonstrate that SM22 deficiency disrupts actin cytoskeleton and promotes oxidative stress and vascular inflammation upon vascular injury. Recently, a series of studies show that SM22 is a multifunctional protein that regulates VSMC phenotypic modulation via activating Erk1/2, and Oxidative stress-mediated NF-kB pathways. Here we propose to explore the role of SM22 in the pathogenesis of aneurysms. Our preliminary results show that deletion of Sm22 in the Fbn1C1039G/+ Marfan mouse background exacerbates aneurysm formation and rupture. The goal of this proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms of SM22 in the pathogenesis of aneurysm formation in a new Marfan mouse model. We hypothesize that SM22 deficiency with defective FBN1 aggravates aneurysm formation and rupture by stimulating the crosstalk of both the established TGF?Erk1/2 signaling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton contractile dysfunction-induced oxidative stress and inflammation signaling pathways. Aim 1: we will systematically characterize the pathogenesis of aneurysm formation and rupture in our Sm22-/-Fbn1C1039G/+ mice in vivo; Aim 2: we will determine the molecular mechanisms of SM22 deficiency on TGF?Erk1/2, oxidative stress and NF-kB pathway activation in FBN1 defective VSMCs using well established molecular, cellular and bioinformatics approaches. Successful completion of this research will shed light on the pathogenesis of aneurysm formation and rupture. SM22 may represent a target for new therapies for aortic aneurysms. Importantly, this study will provide validation for a new mouse aneurysm model that mimics closely human aneurysm formation and rupture."
"9322876","Project 1 Abstract  Using the human disease model of Isolated GnRH Deficiency (IGD), ~35 genes that control human  reproduction have been discovered, several from our Center. We now propose three new Specific Aims (SAs)  to accelerate these new genes discovery efforts dramatically. SA #1 will select subsets of our IGD cohort of  2,000+ IGD patients who: a) share a second rare phenotype; or b) are from multiplex IGD families, and provide  them facilitated access to our whole exome sequencing (WES) pipeline in which we can define new coding  sequence mutations. SA #2 will then use novel statistical enrichment analysis that will allow novel gene  discovery using WES in our full IGD cohort. Similarly, this aim will also employ novel copy number variation  (CNV) analysis pipelines to identify the role of CNVs in IGD. Finally, SA #3 will utilize whole genome  sequencing (WGS) combined with RNA sequencing in IGD patients who: a) harbor ?balanced? chromosomal  rearrangements; or b) are from multiplex families or trios whose WES/CNV analysis were negative in order to  define the full range of structural and non-coding variation in our IGD patients. Taken together, this  combination of contemporary approaches, unique populations, and advances in next generation (NGS) should  provide us with a fuller understanding of the mendelian genes that control human reproduction."
"9251857","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to describe in the language of genetics and biochemistry the feedback cycles and pathways that comprise intracellular circadian systems - how they work, how they are synchronized with the environment, and how time information generated by them is used to regulate the behavior of cells. This proposal focuses on the model system Neurospora, as well as on the mouse and mammalian cell lines, to understand the paradigms underlying circadian control of cell physiology and metabolism. We also continue a longstanding effort aimed at understanding circadian photoreception and photobiology in Neurospora and use this to break new ground on a salient fungal pathogen. Our work has three foci. One Focus anticipates a global analysis and description of the circadian output network in Neurospora, using RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and bioinformatics to describe the regulatory hierarchy governing circadian regulation of transcription in a cell. Then, using the exceptional background of biochemical genetics available in Neurospora, we will track the metabolic activities carried out by the proteins encoded by clock-controlled genes, and as foci of clock-controlled activities emerge, we will begin to lay the spectrum of clock-controlled processes on the Neurospora metabolic map to see how the clock regulates metabolism and physiology. In the second Focus, we will apply our knowledge of circadian output pathways to mammalian cells, using RNA sequencing to determine the circadian profile of clock-controlled genes in adipocytes and in macrophages from wt and RIP140 knockout mice. We will use RNA-seq to characterize the transcriptomes of WT and mutant cells and use chromatin immunoprecipitation to begin to dissect the role of this co-activator/co-repressor in the circadian biology of these important cell types. These experiments will probe the significance of circadian regulation to fat metabolism and to immune function in a mammal, with the hope of gaining insights into the incidence in humans of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, time-of-day differences in immune function. A third Focus is in photobiology. We will explore the mechanism whereby light activates the principal fungal photoreceptor, and extend analysis of photobiology in the important fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We envision and will test a way to exploit our understanding of fungal photobiology to enable a new treatment for hundreds of thousands of patients with aspergillosis. These projects are complementary and mutually enriching in that they each rely on genetic and molecular techniques to dissect, and ultimately to understand, the response of cells to their environment and the organization of eukaryotic cells as a function of time."
"9108871","DESCRIPTION         Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex disease process and the signature injury of current military conflicts, affecting 10-20% of those wounded during service in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Recent Institute of Medicine reports have recommended the Veterans Administration (VA) conduct research to develop protocols to improve management of symptoms and improve health and well-being of service members with TBI. There is a growing literature on the efficacy of self-management support (SMS) programs designed to support patients with chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, and diabetes; collectively, the results suggest that SMS is a key component to realizing optimized outcomes for individuals with chronic conditions. The VA commitment to telehealth is unrivaled, and though comprehensive SMS programs for mild TBI (mTBI) have not been studied, preliminary evidence from skill-specific training programs for TBI suggests that a comprehensive SMS telehealth program for mTBI could be beneficial.  The proposed project is designed to advance clinical telehealth practice for mTBI by completing the preliminary steps toward the development of a measure to assess self- management knowledge, skills and beliefs of veterans with mTBI, pairing it with new gold standard symptom and quality-of-life assessment tools, and linking both components to evidence-based intervention options. The mixed-method research approach was modeled after the comprehensive measurement development activities developed by the PROMIS network, a 100 million dollar NIH Roadmap effort, which is developing a new and comprehensive system of patient self-report symptom and quality of life measures. This approach incorporates expert panel and veteran focus group review of patient self-management information domains compiled through comprehensive search strategies. The conceptual model produced through qualitative review will be actualized through the creation of item pools for the subdomains of patient activation. The dimensionality of the construct and psychometric properties of the item pool will be evaluated using both multivariate statistical and modern measurement models (i.e., Item Response Theory). Finally, the scope and strategies of a measurement-based telehealth intervention will be defined and introduced to implementers.  Achieving the aims outlined in this protocol will immediately increase the functionality of the VA telehealth program. By leveraging and aligning with ongoing research efforts, the current project (1) transforms VA telehealth text messaging devices into precision assessment instruments while decreasing the response burden for patients, and (2) allows comparison of disease burden across different VA patient populations and between civilian and veteran patient populations, allowing the VA to prioritize clinical and research resources most efficiently. This application is significant because of the large number of veterans with mTBI that will require clinical care in the coming decades. The application is also innovative because of its development and validation of psychometrically sophisticated yet pragmatic measures to assess and monitor mTBI coupled with a strategy to create effective self-management strategies as step 1 care for delivery in telehealth programs."
"9362579","We have entered the post-genomic era. It is now more important than ever to understand the final output of genomic changes. In addition, there are many alterations that take place at the metabolic level than drive pathological conditions independent of genomic events. Therefore the key to understanding how cells and organs function under physiological and pathophysiological conditions necessitates deciphering the myriad of metabolic and regulatory pathways that govern how cellular and organism respond to various conditions and how it integrates multitudes of inputs and across vast dimensions (from subcellular to the individual to groups of individuals). This has been loosely defined as the field of Metabolomics. However, the study of metabolomics, which include thousands of lipids and small molecules, is difficult because of the chemical nature of many of these metabolites and because of the intricacies of metabolic interconnections and networking. Therefore, this field of study requires unique expertise such as advanced analytical and synthetic chemistry as well as bioinformatics and modeling. Nonetheless, the field has become fundamental to a modern understanding of human health and disease, whether it is how nutrients work, how exposure to foods interacts with the body and with diseases, or how metabolites can serve as key regulatory molecules and mediators of pathobiology. VA investigators need to be able to carry out hypothesis driven targeted metabolomic analysis based on the pathways they study. To this end, an Agilent 6495 triple quadruple mass spectrometer is required. In addition, due to the need of investigators to study lipophilic, non-polar and polar metabolites, dedicated HPLC equipment is required for analyte separation. Many projects have generated pilot data on the Agilent 6495 triple quadrupole instrument. For example, investigators studying cancer are interested in metabolic pathways related to glucose metabolism, glycolytic, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle intermediates. Non-polar lipid derived metabolites including phosphatidylinositol, ceramide and diacylglycerol in cancer, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases and neuropathology."
"9329190","Project Summary  Septic shock is a severe inflammatory reaction that occurs in response to infection and is a leading cause of death in intensive care. There are at least 750,000 cases of sepsis in the United States per year, with associated mortality estimated between 14.7% and 29.9%. The link between the inciting infection and the resulting organ damage is a severe systemic inflammatory response that is often more harmful than the original infection. Attempts to develop new treatments for septic shock have focused on inhibiting the inflammatory response, which has proven challenging. This may be because different molecular mechanisms can underlie the clinical syndrome recognized as septic shock. At present, shock syndromes are defined by clinical criteria such as the presence of an infection and the end-products of organ damage. Attempting to treat all patients in septic shock by targeting a mechanism that may only be active in a subset of these patients would account for this challenging history.  Redefining shock syndromes according to molecular criteria increases precision in diagnosis, and therefore treatment?not only for septic shock, but for related syndromes. Vasoplegic syndrome, a relatively common complication of cardiopulmonary bypass, is a related shock syndrome which also carries a high mortality when severe. Both syndromes result from release of a complex system of inflammatory mediators. However, it is unknown whether there may be subtypes in vasoplegic syndrome that resemble the molecular subtypes seen in septic shock.  One promising drug target in septic shock is matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP-8), an enzyme involved in tissue breakdown and regulation of other inflammatory proteins. High levels of this enzyme correlate with a poor prognosis in septic shock, and animal models support a causal relationship between high MMP-8 levels and poor outcome. The goal of this study is to define a subset of patients with distributive shock (septic and vasoplegic) and elevated MMP-8 levels. The clinical utility of this molecular categorization will then be tested through a trial of doxycycline, which inhibits MMP-8 activity. The use of an FDA-approved, generic medication minimizes any barrier to widespread access should treatment prove effective. Additionally, the work outlined in this proposal can be translated into an inexpensive PCR-based test to rapidly identify the relevant subgroup in clinical practice."

The KL2 Mentored Career Development Program (KL2 Program) will engage talented and motivated scholars in any health science discipline (including medicine, nursing, dental, pharmacy, public health) to join the clinical and translational science workforce to develop new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions for diseases with emphasis on addressing health disparities affecting our communities. We will train scholars to use an interdisciplinary approach to translate basic and clinical advances into improved healthcare. We will develop an ethnic/racial/culturally diverse workforce to overcome the growing divide between clinical and research careers, and to address health inequities in communities such as Buffalo. Buffalo is the 3rd poorest city in the country, where over 50% of its population belongs to traditional underrepresented [(AA (39%), HA (11%), NA/PI (0.8%)] (2010 Census) and/or underserved minorities. Refugees represent over 5% of the Buffalo population. The goal of this KL2 Program is to train at least four junior faculty/physician scientist scholars by supporting them for two years with the expectation that, with training and mentor assistance, they secure an additional three years of individual funding through K awards to complete the five-year training program. The program is complemented by and integrated with an institutionally funded Dean's Scholars program, which allows us to train 6 additional scholars under the same terms. There will be 5 scholars in the program in Years 1 and 2 and 10 thereafter. We will focus on recruiting individuals from underrepresented backgrounds in health science professions. The program has four specific aims: 1) Attract, engage, and train in state-of-the-art clinical and translational science and a broad range of health science disciplines talented and motivated early career investigators who come from underrepresented groups or disadvantaged backgrounds and/or bring new perspectives to health disparities challenges; 2) Develop comprehensive mentoring programs for mentors and trainees tailored to individual needs; 3) Promote pathways to independence by fostering inter-professional and inter-disciplinary training for scholars to master team science concepts; and 4) Empower our Community of Scholars to collaborate and identify new areas of engagement with other CTSA hubs. The program will train and develop KL2 Scholars' professional skills and facilitate a seamless transition to their next career level within the clinical and translational workforce pipeline. KL2 Scholars, as leaders of the CTSA Community of Scholars, will have the opportunity to give back by providing mentoring and guidance in the discipline to students and peers from our community, the region, and nationwide through the CTSA consortium."
"9249585","ABSTRACT (Overall Component) The overarching goals of our Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC) are to prevent disease and improve public health through innovative programs of excellence in environmental health sciences research, to engage communities to address environmental health issues, and to enhance career development of talented environmental health investigators. The EHSC provides the framework for the generation of novel research findings and their conversion into effective resources for public health officials, medical professionals, and the community. This tradition of success is based on our ability to recruit broad multi- and interdisciplinary expertise, maintain a strong emphasis on basic science principles while incorporating clinical and translational approaches, and effectively interact with the community. The specific mission of the EHSC at Rochester is to improve public health through the generation of fundamental knowledge and elaboration of mechanisms by which chemical exposures, alone or through interaction with other modifying factors, contribute to cumulative health risk across the life span. As such, the theme that guides and integrates EHSC research and community engagement programs is the understanding of interactions of environmental and occupational agents with diverse individual contexts across the lifespan in modulating human disease and dysfunction. The goals of the Center are achieved through a major focus on three research programs: Pulmonary & Cardiovascular Disease Program, Neurodevelopmental & Neurodegenerative Disease Program, and Musculoskeletal Disease Program. While the Center is structurally organized into these Disease Programs, shared thematic biological processes, including immunological responses & inflammation, stem cell biology, early life sensitivities and mechanisms of adult disease, epigenetics, and nutritional/dietary factors, weave these programs together and synergize the research. These research efforts are supported by several structural units: Administrative Core, Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core, Biostatistics Facility Core, Community Outreach & Engagement Core, Pilot Project Program, and Career Development Program for Environmental Health Science Investigators."
"9328269","PROJECT SUMMARY Skilled reading comprehension (RC) is a chief aim of education, yet 34% of fourth graders and 25% of eighth graders read below basic achievement levels. Poor comprehension is a major societal concern, as it negatively impacts educational outcomes, making these Americans less competitive for jobs and at greater risk of poverty. Remediation often focuses on mitigating problems with word recognition (WR), but RC also requires the integration of oral language comprehension (OLC) abilities (e.g. vocabulary and syntax) and executive function (EF), especially working memory. Understanding how these skills interact during RC is critical for predicting which children are most vulnerable to RC difficulty. Recent work using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), task-based fMRI (t-fMRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (dw- MRI) has described how the brain regions underlying WR, OLC and EF form neural networks capable of complex behavior. An efficient network architecture is thought to be central to integrative processes such as RC, and is disrupted in individuals with psychiatric disorders. However, how network properties relate to specific, educationally-relevant behaviors is unexplored. We propose to investigate how the network architecture of the brain is fundamental to the cognitive skills underlying RC in children. Specifically, we will investigate the brain's intrinsic resting-state networks (RSNs), which span areas responsible for component skills of RC, using rs-fMRI and dw-MRI from a longitudinal study of elementary- aged children, as well as task-fMRI from a to-be-collected sample of fourth graders. For our first aim, we hypothesize that individual differences in distributed processes such as WR, OLC and EF will be correlated with differences in specific RSN properties. For example, higher WR skill is associated with increased connectivity within visual areas (including the putative visual word form area), suggesting that a distinct visual RSN would also correlate with WR. However, we expect that differences in RC, which integrates these processes, will be most reflected in the interactions between RSNs. Our second aim is to determine if RSN properties in first grade can predict behavioral RC outcomes in fourth grade, especially in relation to extant behavioral metrics. Since decoding skill in first grade is a limiting factor for reading, RC metrics at that age may heavily reflect WR. However, network architecture differences may already be present and able to predict RC skill at an age where greater integration is required. In our final aim, we use t-fMRI to track how the network properties of the WR, OLC and EF RSNs dynamically change during the reading comprehension process. The results of these analyses will fill gaps in our understanding of how brain network structure is related to and predictive of behavioral indices of cognitive abilities, particularly RC. They will also lead to a better understanding of the systems-level neural mechanisms underlying proficient reading."
"9252603","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of cancer among persons with HIV infection has increased annually since the widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy. Cancer is now a leading cause of death among HIV-positive persons, as survival after a diagnosis of an HIV-associated malignancy (HIVAM) is poorer compared with HIV-negative cancers across the world. In regions with a high prevalence of both HIV and viral oncogens, AIDS-defining malignancies such as Kaposi Sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cervical cancer present some of the largest threats to the health of HIV-infected individuals; non-AIDS defining cancers such at hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer and anal cancer now comprise >50% of HIVAM. New strategies are needed for cancer prevention and treatment among persons living with HIV in resource-limited settings. Since 2004, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) has collaborated with the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) in Kampala, Uganda, to conduct research in HIVAM and develop new strategies for cancer treatment and prevention. Through several well-established training grants and strong relationships with our academic partners, the University of Washington (UW) and Makerere University (MU), we have trained >250 individuals in HIVAM research and care at all levels. Key informant interviews with academic, governmental and clinical leaders in Uganda find that a few gaps in the capacity to conduct HIVAM research persist. We propose to increase the capacity for independent research in HIVAM in Uganda through three Specific Aims: 1) Increase the number of Ugandan research scientists in HIVAM through the conferral of doctoral degrees with an established hybrid program between UW and MU; 2) Build the capacity for independent scientific research in HIVAM through a structured program of mentoring and career development; 3) Maintain capacity to implement HIVAM research in Uganda through ongoing short-term trainings in areas fundamental to research operations. The training activities will be overseen by an experienced and outstanding committee representing leaders in HIV and oncology research from the US and all Deans from three medical schools distributed across the country of Uganda, and will be rigorously measured and evaluated. By the completion of the five-year award period, >130 individuals will be trained in HIVAM research in Uganda, allowing for the conduct of a wide variety of research projects in HIVAM."
"9234416","ABSTRACT  The three PROJECTS in this Program will integrate transcriptional networks with cellular, molecular,  electrophysiological, and physiological mechanisms that underlie dysphagia in mouse models of 22q11  Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS). CORE C, the Genomics and Bioinformatics Core, will generate high-quality  cDNA libraries and RNA-Seq reads from RNA isolated from specific brain regions and nuclei, known to be  important for feeding and swallowing, using specimens isolated from mouse genetic models of 22q11DS. The  resulting RNA-Seq pair-end reads will be processed by our bioinformatics pipeline to generate the following  genomics resources: i) assembly of reads into transcripts and alternatively spliced transcripts; ii) assembly of  non-coding RNAs; iii) differential expression analysis; and iv) gene network and pathway over-representation  analysis. These genomics resources serve two major roles. First, this information will serve to validate or  invalidate hypotheses being tested in the Program PROJECTS. Second, we anticipate that our bioinformatics  approach will generate new foundations, not envisioned or anticipated a priori at the Program's outset, for  additional hypothesis testing at the molecular, physiological, and pharmacological (e.g., drug targeting of  pathways to ameliorate disrupted feeding behavior) levels. Moreover, the genomics resources generated by  CORE C will be deposited into a central repository (e.g., Sequence Read Archive of NCBI) for Data Sharing  with other investigational groups, allowing them to mine our data and generate their own testable hypotheses.  NARRATIVE  CORE C will process and assess RNA-Seq transcriptome data for all 3 PROJECTS using an integrated  computational pipeline. We will facilitate testing specific hypotheses defined in PROJECTS 1 and 2, as well as  generate hypotheses that provide a framework for further analysis of molecular, cellular, and physiological  mechanisms that underlie pediatric dysphagia (PROJECT 1), its developmental origin (PROJECT 2), or  prevention (PROJECT 3). Our computational approach is anticipated to identify new diagnostic signatures or  high priority pharmacologically accessible targets for intervention testing in animal models."
"9256555","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sporadic ALS (sALS) includes by far the largest ALS patient population, but very little is known about the causes of the disease. Patients affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have bioenergetic abnormalities, which can contribute to disease pathogenesis, and metabolic profiles could represent predisposing factors to develop ALS and affect disease course. Metabolic changes may also influence the response to therapeutics, and the lack of effective drugs for ALS may be in part attributable to insufficient understanding of metabolism as a disease modifier. To investigate energy metabolism we used a novel fluorimetric assay for mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial mass (MM), in primary sALS skin fibroblasts. We found that sALS patients have on average significantly increased membrane potential, which inversely correlates with disease onset. Furthermore, unbiased metabolomics studies identified unequivocal differences in intermediate metabolite profiles between ALS and control fibroblasts. To our knowledge, this is the first functional evidence in living cells that energy metabolism is altered in sporadic ALS. A major goal of the application is the identification of fibroblasts metabolism as a predictive factor for he evolution of ALS and for evaluating metabolic changes as disease modifiers. To this end, in aim 1, we propose to define a metabolite signature linked to energy metabolism in fibroblasts, in the extracellular medium, and in the plasma of the subjects from which skin biopsies were taken. We also propose to investigate the correlation of bioenergetic and metabolic parameters with disease status and progression. In aim 2, to understand if the changes in fibroblasts reflect a metabolic reprogramming affecting the cell types most involved in ALS, we will convert fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and then motor neurons, and study their bioenergetics and metabolic profiles. Importantly, to investigate if metabolic changes originate from genetic or epigenetic causes, we will determine if bioenergetic and metabolic changes persist or not after de-differentiation of iPSC followed by back-differentiation into fibroblasts."
"9254199","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Rationale: Approximately 15-20% of adults have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and evidence indicates that the prevalence of OSA is perhaps twice as high among veterans. OSA has been clearly linked to increased mortality and multiple morbidities, and undoubtedly contributes to the high prevalence of health problems among veterans. Current treatments for OSA are not well tolerated, often have limited efficacy, and often do not result in improvements in health. Our recent research demonstrated that 12 weeks of moderate exercise training elicited a reduction of OSA of ~25%, as well as significant improvement in mood, fatigue, quality of life, and cardiovascular health. Interestingly, as with other health benefits of exercise, our research is consistent with other research showing that exercise can reduce OSA independent of changes in body weight. These studies raise the exciting possibility that exercise training combined with modest weight loss could elicit a chronic reduction in OSA of 50% or more. Objectives: Our Objective is to compare the effects of 16 weeks of exercise training alone, weight loss alone, and exercise + weight loss on OSA severity and associated morbidity. Methods: Following extensive screening and baseline assessment, N=90 overweight/obese veterans (ages 18-60 years) with mild to severe OSA will be randomized to one of three 16- week treatments. (1) Exercise Alone (n=30) will involve training 4 days per week under supervision of a clinical exercise physiologist. It will include aerobic exercise (treadmill, cycling, elliptical) that will gradually increase to 30-45 min on 4 days/wk, as well as resistance exercise (15 min) on 2 days/week. (2) Weight Loss Alone (n=30) will involve a structured meal plan (including some meal replacement with shakes or bars), and weekly counseling designed to elicit a reduction in body weight of 10%. (3) Exercise + Weight Loss (n=30) will involve the same exercise and weight loss interventions as in the other treatments. Outside of the interventions, participants will be asked to maintain their usual exercise and diet habits, as verified, respectively, with actigraphic recording and a 24-hr food recall. Before and after the treatments, participants will undergo 5 days/nights of home-based actigraphic and diary- assessed sleep, and one night of laboratory polysomnographic recording of sleep, including OSA severity. Comorbidity measures will include pre- to post-treatment changes in blood pressure, heart rate variability, glucose, insulin, lipids, hemoglobin a1c, body weight/composition, and inflammation (e.g., CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha). Also measured will be monthly changes in self-reports of sleep quality, functional outcomes of sleepiness (FOSQ), and snoring symptoms. A 3-month follow-up will include home assessment of OSA, as well as sleep quality, FOSQ, and snoring. Mediation analysis will explore whether improvements in OSA are mediated by changes in percent of deep sleep, body weight, trunk body fat percent, trunk total mass, respiratory muscle strength, and upper airway obstruction assessed in the laboratory. Implications for Future Research. Demonstration of a reduction of OSA by e 50% would result in extensive subsequent studies. These would likely include studies of dose-response effects; comparisons of different modes of exercise; studies of the feasibility of telemedicine approaches to the interventions; comparative efficacy studies vs. PAP; further mechanistic studies, for example, of upper airway collapsibility and composition (e.g, via MRI); and studies of other positive health outcomes, such as extensive heart imaging."
"9361068","Brain injuries caused by stroke, trauma, and age related neurodegeneration in the CNS and retina are common in aging/aged populations including veterans. To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of brain/retina damage and functional deficits, several investigators at Atlanta VA Medical Center have been carrying out VA supported research projects focusing on the regulation of cell death and regeneration, trophic/growth factor expression, signaling pathways, and sensorimotor/cognitive functions. The ultimate goal is to develop novel and effective treatments/rehabilitative therapies for veterans suffering these disorders. In our investigations, research tools that allow for accurate examinations and in depth understanding of neural network integrity and functional activities are critical for the advance of the field and new discoveries. To this end, the newly developed multielectrode array (MEA) system provides a unique and innovative technology for VA investigators. The MEA system will give us unprecedented ability to perform electrophysiological and optogenetics recordings simultaneously in over hundred cells in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. Because of the versatile feature, excellent recording quality, and relatively easy operation of the system, the MEA technology is regarded as the future of electrophysiology in cell-cell interaction, brain slices and animal models. The system has been increasingly used for investigations of neuronal activity, neural network repair and cardiovascular function, but so far is not available for research labs in Atlanta. Five main users with major VA grants at Atlanta VAMC will be benefited from the system in their basic and translational research. The system will provide a platform for closer collaborations that have already going on among these investigators. We have developed an administrative plan to use the system as a core facility to promote and train junior faculties. The Center for Visual and Neurocognitive Rehabilitation (CVNR) has committed with administrative support and maintenance fund to ensure the sustainability of the system in foreseeable years. We are confident that the MEA system will greatly benefit VA investigations not only brain/retina injuries, but also neurologic and psychiatric diseases such as post- TBI depression and neurodegenerative disorders associate with many veterans."
"9256527","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), post ischemic microvascular obstruction (MVO) due to distal microembolization of atherothrombotic debris from the site of PCI commonly occurs and leads to failure of reperfusion. Post PCI MVO is associated with worse clinical outcomes, and effective treatments are lacking. Ultrasound (US)-induced cavitation (vibration) of intravenously injected microbubbles (MBs), offers an exciting new approach for treating MVO, which we call sonoreperfusion (SRP). While SRP has shown potential for treating venous-like thrombi in large vessels, its effects within the microvasculature, and on MVO comprised of arterial type microthrombi and atherosclerotic debris seen in AMI, are unknown. Furthermore, which US cavitational regime is most effective -- stable, inertial, or a combination thereof - is unknown. Accordingly, in this proposal, we will develop, optimize and translate SRP therapy, culminating in testing of the optimal SRP regime in perhaps the most clinically translatable large animal model of AMI and MVO available.  We will first test the relative efficacies of candidate SRP platforms using an in vitro flow model of arterial MVO (Aim 1a), in which we will manipulate US variables that encompass 3 regimes: (1) stable cavitation; (2) inertial cavitation; or (3) a sequential combination of both. To understand mechanisms of action underlying successful regimes, we will study the physical consequences of MB vibrations on local fluid dynamics and tPA clot penetration (Aim 1b). In testing this mechanical hypothesis, we will be the first to use an ultra-high speed microscopy system to delve into dynamics of MB-clot interactions and the resulting physical phenomena elicited by the SRP regimes tested in Aim 1a. Insights from Aim 1b will inform further refinements in the SRP regimes --to be iteratively tested in vitro in Aim 1a- from which 3 platforms (top performer for each cavitation category) will emerge for in vivo testing in a new rat hind limb model of arterial MVO in Aim 2a. Here, in addition to efficacy, the clinical safety of each SRP platform will be assessed and factored into the final selection of a single SRP platform-that balances benefit vs. risk -- for use in Aim 3. As the in vitro model in Aim 1a precludes study of bioeffects that may mediate efficacy of a given SRP platform, we will also use the rat hind limb model to study biological effects of US-MB interactions (Aim 2b): We will test the biologic hypothesis that MB vibration-induced endothelial shear stress modulates therapeutic NO release and increased activity of endothelial derived hyperpolarizing factor. In Aim 3, we will use the best SRP regime emerging from Aim 2, in a new, clinically relevant, atherosclerotic porcine model of AMI and MVO to assess for microvascular salvage. This systematic approach will culminate in a clinically translatable SRP regime and elucidate mechanisms of action which will inform strategies for optimization of efficacy and safety."
"9309539","Membrane proteins make up over 30% of the human proteome and are critical in biological functions, including transport and the transduction of cellular information. Membrane proteins also feature in the multistep pathways that lead to glycoproteins. For example, the human pathway for protein N-glycosylation, occurs exclusively at cellular membranes and is part of the essential process that ultimately affords all cell- surface and secreted N-linked glycoproteins. Likewise, bacterial, glycoproteins are generated through stepwise, membrane-associated glycan assembly pathways, which culminate in the biosynthesis of important virulence-associated glycoproteins. Despite the widespread importance of multistep membrane pathways in human health and disease and the extensive knowledge on the enzymes that make up these pathways, our understanding of how the enzymes function together and in an ordered sequence are greatly challenged by technical issues associated with the amphiphilic nature of membranes and the properties of associated membrane-bound proteins. Functional studies on membrane proteins are often simplified by extraction into detergent micelles. However, this treatment is highly perturbing and under these conditions, all but the most stable multiprotein complexes will dissociate and the cryptic information that is programmed in the native membrane will be lost. Therefore, a major current challenge is to develop strategies for understanding how proteins are recruited into functional complexes at cellular membranes. This challenge demands the application of synergistic in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches.  The proposed research will investigate the membrane-associated protein N-glycosylation pathway of the Gram-negative enteropathogen Campylobacter jejuni, which shares the logic of the more complex mammalian pathway. The research has three aims. In Aim 1 we will define the membrane protein interactome for bacterial N-glycosylation using styrene maleic acid lipoparticles (SMALP). SMALP will enable definition of a complete molecular description of the local membrane environment around target membrane proteins in vivo. In Aim 2 we will leverage the interactome information for in vitro studies in lipid bilayer Nanodiscs (NDs), which provide a native-like model membrane of defined composition, and enable in vitro experimental approaches to understand the rules defining the membrane protein interactions and coordinated function. In Aim 3 we will implement crosslinking studies to address a key question concerning the timing of glycan transfer to protein. Ultimately, the studies will deliver detailed information regarding the membrane environment and protein interaction network that supports efficient N-glycosylation in a representative bacterial pathway. If successful, the research will provide insight into the molecular logic underpinning the processes that lead to glycoprotein biosynthesis in all living systems and will inform on multidisciplinary approaches for investigating other physiologically significant multienzyme processes that occur at membrane interfaces."
"9208387","Project Summary  The specific aim of this proposal is to carry out an annual, full-week course in advanced gene mapping at The Rockefeller University in New York. The course is directed towards advanced researchers who are familiar with the basic aspects of statistical genetics but who need to become more proficient in the analysis of complex traits. The course will be held in the Great Hall in Welch which is equipped for the course with laptops running Linux. Thirty students will be accepted for each course.. Travel stipends will be provided to five of the participants who are either pre-doctoral students or post-doctoral fellows to cover the cost of airfare, hotel and board.  The course consists of two components: lectures on important, current topics in gene mapping, as well as hands on exercises to be carried out with the latest freeware software programs. The current emphasis of the course is association analysis of rare variants obtained from next generation sequence data. For the next Advanced Gene Mapping course held January 25-29, 2016 the topics will include: analysis of whole genome association studies; analysis of rare variants using next generation sequence data; analysis of qualitative and quantitative traits (population and family-based data); mixed linear models; eQTL mapping; prediction models using RNAseq and array data; inferences for heritability estimation and prediction; functional predication of variant sites, variant annotation; variant calling, controlling for population substructure/admixture (principal components analysis/multidimensionality scaling); data quality control of genotype and sequence data; meta-analysis; gene x gene interaction; sample size estimation and evaluating power for common and rare variants. Programs that will be taught and utilized by course participants include: ANNOVAR, BEAM3, CADD, GERP, GotCloud, GenAbel, PLINK, Polyphen-2, R, SEQPower, Variant Association Tools (VAT), etc. Since gene mapping is a quickly changing field, the topics and analytic programs will be updated and changed annually to reflect the latest developments in the field of statistical genetics. Given the large increases in the amount of genetic data being generated, and in particular sequence data, it is extremely important to train researchers and give them the necessary information and tools for data analysis to elucidate the etiology of complex traits."
"9384851","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application is for a T32 training grant which provides support for five predoctoral and three postdoctoral trainees in basic alcohol research at Wake Forest School of Medicine. The objectives of the training program are to 1) provide multi-disciplinary training in the neurobiology of alcohol abuse and addiction and 2) produce independent, productive scientists for the alcohol research community. Our rationale for the proposed training arises from our diverse training faculty - a group of well-funded alcohol investigators with solid expertise in basic, clinical, and human-population research - who have been successful for almost twenty years in training young scientists. Our environment is highly collaborative and multidisciplinary such that our trainees gather the necessary skills to become independent investigators and to operate within interdisciplinary teams that will increasingly characterize the future of biomedical research. The alcohol research that characterizes our training environment is also highly translational. First, virtually all of our training labs employand publish in alcohol self-administration; and this has characterized the training program from its inception. The training program also spans experimental model systems from mice and rats, through monkeys and individual humans, to human populations. And many of our training faculty employ overlapping experimental approaches, examine some of the same end points, and/or employ the some of the same behavioral models across multiple species. Our training design therefore consists of both rigorous didactic instruction as well as intensive laboratory-based research. It is augmented by a robust curriculum in career development, including teaching and grant- and manuscript-writing courses, and ethics. There are multiple opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows to hone presentation skills including journal clubs, data clubs, and required research seminar presentations at least twice or more each year. As a condition for reappointment to the training program, we require our all trainees apply for individual NRSAs (or independent private support) during their training and to publish in peer-reviewed journals. This requirement helps sharpen grant writing skills that are critical in today's research environment. We also attempt to limit predoctoral trainees to less than three years of support on the training grant. This time-limit ensures that the training grant provides support to the best, brightest, and most productive students and fellows at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Our program also benefits from distinct school resources that include a Translational Science Institute which offers courses in translational research, a nationally-recognized primate center with several different populations of monkeys including a fully pedigreed and genotyped vervet colony, and state-of-the-art imaging facilities that can accommodate humans, non-human primates, and rodents. Finally, we partner with resident psychiatrists and psychologists to give our students clinical exposure to current and long-abstinent patients. This enhances their understanding of alcohol abuse disorders and grounds their research in the real world."

"9250640","Basic and clinical research is revealing that various noncoding and small RNAs play important and diverse roles in germ cell development and quality, including X/Y silencing during meiosis, gene regulation, DNA damage responses, and protection of the genome against transposable elements. Indeed, mammalian germ cells are known to hart)or multiple small RNA species, including small interfering RNAs (siRNA), microRNAs (miRNA), and germline-specific PlWI-interacting RNAs (piRNA). However, their mechanistic roles in gametogenesis and human infertility are largely uncharacterized. The Cornell Center for Reproductive Genomics (CRG), established in 2006, has developed emerging strengths in the area of small RNA biology to address these gaps in our understanding. The goal of these studies is to elucidate the role of small RNA pathways in the events that give rise to viable euploid gametes. Four projects are proposed: Project I (PI: Andrew Crimson) will define the temporal profile of small RNA expression and small RNA targets throughout spermatogenesis, focusing on the onset of, and progression through, prophase I in the mouse; Project II (PI: Darius Paduch) will explore the roles and expression of microRNAs in human male germ cell and somatic compartments, and will examine changes in the profiles of testicular small RNAs In infertile men; Project III (PI: Paula Cohen) will explore the role of the Argonaute family of small RNA binding proteins in the critical process of meiotic silencing during prophase I in mice; and Project IV (PI: John Schimenti) will examine how the process of DNA replication licensing in mammalian germ cells is controlled by post-transcriptional control mediated by microRNA, miR34. Three cores are proposed: an Administrative core, and Outreach Core and an RNA sequencing core, the latter being open to all SCCPIR members. Collectively, these studies represent the most comprehensive analysis of small RNA pathways in mammalian gametogenesis to date, and will provide a cutting-edge program in small RNA regulatory processes that will be a unique and timely addition to the SCCPIR network. The combined focus on comparative analysis of small RNA pathways in the germline is likely to contribute greatly to the understanding of how these pathways may function to ensure the production of healthy gametes."
"9252071","Impact of Sugars and Human Milk Oligosaccharides on Infant Microbiome and Obesity Abstract Hispanic children are at high risk for obesity, a disparity that is already established by 2 years of age. Our prior work found that high dietary sugars in early-life contributes to this increased risk and that this adverse effect was obliterated in children who were exposed to extended (not exclusive) breastfeeding for >12 months. Thus, sugars and extended breastfeeding exert opposing effects on early obesity-risk, but the mechanisms are unclear. One way that dietary sugars and extended breastfeeding could impact infants? obesity-risk is by affecting gut microbiome development, which is rapidly evolving during the first 24 months of life. This is a plausible mechanism given that the gut microbiome is implicated in the development of obesity, and that gut microbial changes have been documented in response to dietary sugars and factors in breast milk. One factor in breast milk that may be directly relevant is the mixture of different human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which reach the colon intact and serve as prebiotics, shaping the diversity of the gut microbiota. Therefore, the effects of HMOs on microbiome development could be one mechanism by which breastfeeding protects against obesity in infants, a novel concept supported by our preliminary data. Exposure to high dietary sugars in infancy could also impact obesity risk by disrupting cognitive function and appetite regulation, and evidence suggests that these effects might also be mediated by the gut microbiome, and that HMOs, can protect against these impairments, but human studies are lacking. We propose to examine these concepts in a cohort study in 240 Hispanic women and their newborn infants. Participants will be followed from birth to 24 months, with frequent sampling and assessment of breast milk for HMO composition, maternal and infant microbiota, maternal and infant diet, and infant eating behaviors. The primary outcome will be infant body fat by DEXA and secondary outcomes will be infant cognition and appetite regulation, including gut-derived appetite hormones in a sub-set. We have 4 Specific Aims: 1) Determine the joint effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on development of the infant gut microbiome; 2) Determine the joint effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on development of infant body fat.; 3) Determine the joint effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on infant cognitive outcomes, eating behavior and appetite regulation; and 4) Determine whether the effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on infant outcomes are mediated by changes in the gut microbiome. This study will move the field forward by identifying how early-life dietary exposures (focusing on dietary sugars, breastfeeding and HMOs) affect gut microbiome development, and how this affects development of obesity, cognition and appetite regulation. Findings are expected to have significant implications for identifying specific HMOs and/or gut microbial changes that will be protective for obesity and inform future novel intervention modalities applicable to Hispanic women and their infants."
"9258489","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to translate a type I collagen-specific positron emission tomography (PET) probe for human imaging and to assess its potential for direct imaging of pulmonary fibrosis in patients. Pulmonary fibrosis is a scarrin of the lungs that can arise from radiation injury, drug toxicity, environmental causes (e.g. silicosis) or from unknown cause, i.e. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Despite the recent approval of two new drugs to treat IPF, it remains a deadly disease where average survival from time of diagnosis is only 2-3 years overall. Despite this rapid progression, the disease appears to be markedly heterogeneous both in its clinical course and pathogenesis. Current IPF imaging is carried out with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning, which may diagnose IPF non-invasively, however it cannot accurately predict prognosis or therapy response to any of the currently available treatments.  Molecular imaging of fibrosis may be more sensitive than HRCT in detecting early fibrosis, and may also be able to distinguish new, active fibrosis from stable disease. A sensitive test that can identify early onset of fibrosis may have great utility i guiding interventions to alter the course of this devastating disease. The ability to stratify patients based on imaging active fibrosis could 1) guide patient therapy, 2) select patients for clinical trials, and 3) monitor for treatment response. The ability to see fibrosis regression prio to changes in functional tests would be an effective means to monitor the efficacy new therapeutic approaches.  This proposal is in response to RFA-HL-16-001, Molecular Imaging of the Lung, Phase 2. In Phase 1 of this RFA we prepared a library of type 1 collagen targeted PET probes and screened them in the bleomycin mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis. We identified two similar probes that showed high specificity for pulmonary fibrosis and whose uptake in the lung correlated with increased collagen. We further showed that these probes could be used to monitor treatment response in a second mouse model of disease. Here, we will develop this technology for human use by performing preclinical studies to support an IND filing, and then evaluating the pharmacokinetics of the probe in healthy volunteers. To validate the probe, we will image lung cancer patients scheduled for lobectomy and correlate probe uptake with regions of lung histologically determined to be fibrotic. We will begin to implement this technology by imaging IPF patients and assessing whether increased probe uptake in IPF patients correlates with more progressive disease. The outcome of this 3-year research plan will be a collagen-specific PET probe that has been validated in patients with known pulmonary fibrosis. This research would enable further, larger trials to prospectively determine whether collagen-specific PET can stratify IPF patients, guide treatment planning, and/or monitor treatment response. The clinical course of IPF is very heterogeneous, and being able to accurately predict the prognoses of individual patients is a pressing need in both IPF patient care and research.

The initial indication for development is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where VBP15 holds promise for retaining or increasing efficacy of glucocorticoids, while reducing side effects (bone fragilit, stunting of growth). VBP15 is currently in Phase I clinical trials in adult volunteers. This proposed Phase II SBIR research is to carry out a Phase IIa clinical trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy boys, steroid naïve, ages 4-7 yrs. Aim 1 is to test four dose levels of VBP15 in a multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial design, with two weeks on drug. Patients completing the Phase IIa clinical trial will be offered enrollment into a six month extension study. The goal is t test pediatric pharmacokinetics, tolerability and safety in the Phase IIa clinical trial, and assessments of efficacy (time to stand velocity) and safety (change in body mass index) in the six month extension study to aid dose selection in the future Phase IIb registration trial. Aim 2 i to develop a pharmacodynamics biomarker panel that can assess safety and efficacy markers in acute time frames from peripheral blood. We have completed a natural history of DMD serum biomarkers using both SomaScan and proteomics discovery methods, and present preliminary data on glucocorticoid- associated efficacy and safety biomarkers. The Phase II SBIR research will compare VBP15 biomarkers to glucocorticoid biomarkers as a means of assessing comparative safety and potential efficacy."
"9294667","Extensor muscles of the leg are actively involved in weight support and walking activities. These muscles are extensively linked by inhibitory, bidirectional, force dependent pathways that contribute to the successful execution of a range of functional behaviors, including locomotion. These reflex pathways are thought to arise from Golgi tendon organs and are believed to regulate limb stiffness and promote inter-joint coordination during movements. The relative magnitudes of these linkages in the two directions between any two muscles vary across control decerebrate animals when quiescent, but obey a predominantly proximal to distal gradient during stepping on a treadmill. This finding indicates that the strength and distribution of these reflex pathways are subject to modulation in a task-dependent manner. Our preliminary data suggest that thoracic spinal cord lateral hemisection immediately and persistently alters the normal distribution and a dominant distal-to- proximal inhibitory gradient emerges. Animals with this lesion do not exhibit clasp-knife inhibition, a phenomenon known to be mediated by receptors other than Golgi tendon organs and that results from bilateral injury to the dorsal half of the spinal cord. The change in the strength and distribution of force feedback that we have observed is correlated with diminished limb stiffness and poor weight acceptance during locomotor tasks ? both of which are challenging problems seen in humans with spinal cord injuries. These findings provide new insight into potential mechanisms contributing to disruption of motor function following injury and identify a new, potential rehabilitation strategy. Our guiding hypothesis is that SCI-induced force-feedback dysregulation results in strong inhibition directed toward proximal muscles, contributes to inadequate limb stiffness during weight support phases of movement, and can be reversed using eccentric- focused training. The current application has evolved from collaborative work, using a large animal model, across two established laboratories, bringing together expertise in spinal cord injury, plasticity, force feedback and motor control. The proposed studies are divided into two sets of experiments. The first set will carefully characterize the impact of a low thoracic hemisection on gait kinematics during subphases where inhibitory force feedback is thought to be most active (Aim 1a). These phases typically are associated with coordinated eccentric activity and/or weight acceptance/support. Pre- and post-SCI data, across time, will be compared. In the same animals, a comprehensive picture of force-feedback organization following SCI will be developed during terminal decerebrate studies at two chronic time points (Aim 1b). Both standing and walking preparations, in combination with mechanographic approaches, will be used to test task-specificity of heterogenic force feedback responses in specific muscle combinations. In the second set of experiments, the basic experimental design is the same except that eccentric-focused training will be introduced at 2 wks post- SCI. This allows animals used in Aims 1a and 1b to serve as the controls for Aims 2a and 2b. Eccentric training will use different ?downslope? gait tasks to more strongly activate force feedback circuitry. Gait kinematics will be carefully assessed during select subphases to test for training effects during different flat and downslope tasks (Aim 2a) and decerebrate, mechanographic studies used to characterize training effects on force dependent organization at the level of specific muscle combinations. Histology will be completed in all animals to verify lesion characteristics. Data generated in the proposed work will be compared with an existing laboratory database containing force feedback findings from control decerebrate preparations, to reduce the number of animals used. Collectively, these studies will provide important information for evidence-based rehabilitation of motor skills by understanding the gait-associated impact of disrupting force feedback (Aim 1a), the extent of the disruption of this intralimb control system following SCI (Aim 1b), and the potential to alter this disruption at the voluntary gait (Aim 2a) and basic reflex levels (2b) using a physical training approach."
"9295392","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this research proposal is to identify patients with multiple myeloma at high-risk of developing venous thromboembolism through derivation and validation of a clinical risk prediction model. The clinical utility and risk-benefit ratio of the model will be assessed with decision analysis and will aid in determining the role of the model in clinical practice. Three aims will address the overall hypothesis that a multiple myeloma-specific clinical risk prediction model will be able to accurately identify patients at highest risk of developing venous thromboembolism and thereby guide selection for use of primary thromboprophylaxis. Ultimately, this will reduce the burden of venous thromboembolism in multiple myeloma and improve outcomes while balancing a risk-benefit ratio. The three aims that comprise this proposal include; Aim 1: To develop a risk prediction model for venous thromboembolism in multiple myeloma using a nationwide cohort of patients, Aim 2: To prospectively validate the risk prediction model and determine the impact of D-dimer on model discrimination, Aim 3: To quantify the risks and benefits of thromboprophylaxis on quality-adjusted survival in multiple myeloma using decision analysis. To complete these Aims, Kristen Sanfilippo MD, MPHS will receive training in the application of clinical prediction models, Bayesian statistics and decision analysis through dedicated coursework and guidance under the supervision of the primary mentor, Brian Gage MD, MSc, and secondary mentor, Kenneth Carson MD, PhD. In addition, the success of the proposal will be supported with collaborations from Jeff Gill PhD, David Calverley MD, and Gary Lyman MD, MPH. This project is in direct line with strategic goal 2 of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, as this clinical investigation will serve to advance the prediction and prevention of venous thromboembolism."
"9256384","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Veterans suffering loss of the larynx's vocal fold cover due to trauma or laryngeal cancer can suffer disabling voice difficulties, and treatment options are limited. A vibrating replacement tissue would revolutionize the treatment of laryngeal disorders. The work described in this proposal characterizes and optimizes a tissue-engineered vocal fold cover (TE-VFC). Adult human stem cells isolated from adipose tissue are cultured within fibrin hydrogel derived from the blood product cryoprecipitate. The result is a completely autologous three- dimensional tissue substitute. A significant innovation of this approach to vocal fold tissue engineering is th concomitant replication of the two layers (epithelial and mesenchymal) responsible for vibration in the native vocal fold cover.  This model will be employed to systematically study fundamental issues of tissue engineering, stem cell differentiation, and vocal fold physiology. It is controllable, with an optimized case that most closely replicates normal developmental conditions and produces bilayered epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. A control case is more typical of standard tissue culture conditions, and produces disorganized cell differentiation.  Three research arms are proposed. First, extracellular matrix and basement membrane deposition are determined in the TE-VFC and the non- epithelialized control using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Epithelial barrier function is measured by trans-epithelial diffusion. Mechanisms for a difference in ECM remodeling between the two cases are investigated, such as matrix metalloproteinase secretion and pro-collagen mRNA. Second, mesenchymal cell phenotype is defined in the two conditions by protein expression and contractility. Potential signaling mechanisms controlling the phenotype are investigated, including EGF receptor and TGF- ?1. Finally, vibration and phonation are assessed in both cases as well as in de-epithelialized TE-VFC to identify the role of epithelium in voice production. The constructs are attached to the vocal ligaments of excised larynges simulating implantation conditions, and airflow-induced vibration is recorded with high-speed imaging.  Successful completion of the proposed research will determine whether including an epithelium in a developing tissue construct offers benefit, by comparing the cell phenotype, microstructure, and function in epithelialized and control cases. It will also identify mechanisms by which epithelial cells influence adjacent cell phenotype and ECM remodeling, in a controlled system. Findings will be relevant in other epithelialized tissues as well as this vocal fold replacement. Finally, these in vitro studies of the TE-VFC will provide necessary information to proceed with animal and human implantation trials to treat severe vocal fold scarring."
"9036279","?    DESCRIPTION:     The project aims to develop a stem cell-based therapy to repair the chronically injured spinal cord and to maximize functional recovery. Success development of this work can lead to translation of pre-clinical observations from animal models into clinical practice. Moreover, we aim to develop innovative rehabilitation strategies to promote meaningful recovery of function, and objectively determine whether a combination of stem cell-based therapies with rehabilitation will optimize functional outcomes. We will focus on multipotent neural progenitor cells derived from approved embryonic stem cell lines, and on multipotent neural stem /progenitor cells directly transdifferentiated from adult fibroblasts (a form of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell, IPSC). The work will use both transection and contusion models of spinal cord injury in rodent and non-human primate species. Moreover, we propose replication studies by an investigator that is independent of the consortium of scientists in this project. This is an intensely collaborative effort among leading laboratories researching spinal cord injury located on the west coast of the United States, including the Tuszynski group at the San Diego VA Medical Center and UCSD; the Beattie/Bresnahan group at the San Francisco VA Medical Center and UCSF; the Edgerton group at UCLA; the Havton and Rinkensmeyer groups at UC Irvine; and the California Regional Primate Research Center located at UC Davis. Proposed experiments are collectively designed and performed by this collaboration, an unprecedented effort in spinal cord injury research to move the field forward through close collaboration and interaction on jointly performed experiments. Throughout, this project will benefit from a free exchange of information among the collaborators."
"9249475","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While abundant sarcomeric actin isoforms are famous for their essential role in striated muscle contraction, low abundance non-muscle cytoplasmic actin isoforms (?cyto- and ?cyto-actin) are also emerging as important in the maintenance of specialized structures in normal and diseased skeletal muscle. During this project, we generated and characterized muscle-specific mouse lines lacking either ?cyto-actin, or ?cyto-actin, or overexpressing ?cyto-actin to understand their endogenous functions and role(s) in dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Interestingly, each ?cyto-actin or ?cyto-acin single knockout develops a qualitatively similar phenotype characterized by a progressive myopathy with significant myofiber degeneration/regeneration and muscle weakness. We have shown that 2000-fold muscle-specific overexpression of ?cyto-actin in dystrophin- deficient mdx mice affords significant protection from eccentric contraction-induced force drop. Our new data suggest that eccentric contraction drives a rapidly-reversible, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated inhibition of sarcomeric contractility that may function to protect dystrophic muscles from myofibrillar damage caused by repeated, high force contractions. Finally, we have obtained new data suggesting that ?cyto- and ?cyto-actins collaborate to maintain the functional interaction between mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Going forward, we will make use of our unique animal models, isoform-specific reagents and biochemical and physiological methodologies to address fundamental questions about cytoplasmic actins in normal skeletal muscle function and in dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. In aim 1, we will investigate how loss of a key redox buffering protein contributes to eccentric contraction-induced force drop in dystrophic mdx skeletal muscle. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that stretch-induced ROS may cause eccentric contraction induced force drop in mdx muscle via reversible oxidative modification of sarcomeric actin or other myofibrillar proteins critical for contractile function. n aim 3, the roles of ?cyto- and ?cyto-actins at the interface between mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum will be investigated through characterization of mouse lines in which ?cyto-actin and ?cyto-actins have been knocked out in skeletal muscle individually, or in combination. The results of the proposed studies will definitively address the unique and important contributions of cytoplasmic actin isoforms to the function of normal and diseased skeletal muscle."
"9222037","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central pathophysiology of ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) is dynamic tearing and repairing of the lung epithelial cells during mechanical ventilation when the lung is inflated beyond its normal tidal volume. We have shown previously that wounding of alveolar cells plays an important role in the development of VALI symptoms. However, the molecular components to repair alveolar cell injury remain completely mysterious. Previous efforts of our research team identified Mitsugumin 53 (MG53) in striated muscle, which senses changes in oxidative status at the membrane disruption site and shuttles pre-assembled membrane-associated vesicles to patch plasma membrane breakage in skeletal muscle cells. Our pilot study has found that MG53 expresses in lung cells and mg53-/- lung is susceptible to VALI. In this study, we aim to identify the molecular component for the repair of alveolar cells and the contribution of MG53 in VALI. The overall goal of this project is to gain a greater understanding for the role of MG53-mediated membrane repair in VALI and to develop a recombinant protein-based therapy for the treatment of VALI. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to establish the role of MG53-mediated membrane repair in protection against membrane injury to lung epithelial cells in culture, 2) to determine the in vivo function of MG53 in the development of VALI, and 3) to explore the potential of using recombinant MG53 protein for the treatment of VALI. These studies represent a direct test to determine if MG53 is a central molecule for repair of deformation-induced injury to lung epithelial cells, and whether modulation of MG53-mediated cell membrane repair represents a potential effective mean for the treatment of VALI. In addition, our results will push the efforts for advancing a safe and potent therapy for VALI that involves in large-scale production of a protein naturally exists in the human body."
"9252444","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biological soft tissue consists mainly of light elements, and its composition is nearly uniform with little density variation. Traditional attenuation-based x-ray imaging cannot provide sufficient contrast for this type of materials. The cross-section of x-ray phase shift is three orders of magnitude greater than that of x-ray attenuation in soft tissue over the diagnostic energy range. Hence, x-ray phase-contrast imaging is sensitive to subtle features especially micro-structures of soft tissue and offers superior contrast for analyses of various normal and diseased conditions. X-ray phase-contrast imaging approaches face challenges in biomedical applications. Analyzer-based phase- contrast imaging requires monochromatic x-rays and high-precision crystals, being limited to the synchrotron radiation facility. Propagation-based imaging suffers from a low photon flux of a micro-focus x-ray tube. Grating-based phase-contrast imaging is a recent breakthrough. However, two main obstacles for this paradigm shift are (1) the large-area gratings of small periods and high aspects and (2) the long time needed for data acquisition. Technically, it is rather difficult to make large gratings especially when x-ray energy is high. Theoretically, it is extremely complicated to model the propagation of x-rays through large gratings from a point x-ray source. In this project, we will establish two enabling innovations that are (1) interior phase contrast tomography for accurate region of interest (ROI) reconstruction and (2) few-view phase-contrast reconstruction without phase-stepping for accelerated data acquisition and minimized radiation dose. The synergistic combination of these innovations will define a new frontier of x-ray phase-contrast tomography. Although the conventional wisdom is that grating-based phase-contrast tomography must use sufficiently large gratings to cover an object and capture projections completely, our main innovative thinking is to target theoretically exact reconstruction over an ROI from truncated data collected with relatively small gratings. It is underlined that the grating-based phase-contrast interior reconstruction takes truncated differential projections, while the typical interior reconstruction assumes truncated direct projections. Another new idea for this project is to utilize the reweighted L1 norm for fewer-view image reconstruction. The overall goal of this project is to establish x-ray-grating-based interior tomography theory, develop the associated few-view reconstruction methods and system without phase stepping, and promote its biomedical applications. The proposed technology will be characterized in numerical simulation and phantom experiments, and applied for musculoskeletal imaging in an animal model. Upon the completion of this project, the proposed grating-based system will have achieved 30?m resolution, shortened scanning time, and reduced radiation dose over a 3cm- diameter ROI, outperforming micro-CT in terms of contrast resolution yet delivering comparable ROI image quality relative to that of conventional grating-based phase-contrast tomography."
"9327134","Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and is poised to become a new epidemic in the 21st century. There is currently no cure for AD or means to stop its progression. Moreover, the basic molecular mechanisms responsible for AD remain elusive. Many essential cellular processes are affected in AD, including impairment of de novo protein synthesis (mRNA translation). Protein synthesis is required for long-term memory formation; several aspects of translation are dysregulated in AD. Recent evidence shows eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) activity is downregulated in the brains of AD model mice and human AD patients. During translation, eEF2 mediates the translocation of aminoacyl-tRNA from the ribosomal A- to P-site. Phosphorylation of eEF2 by its only known kinase, eEF2 kinase (eEF2K), blocks eEF2 activity and suppresses general protein synthesis. eEF2 is hyperphosphorylated in post mortem human AD brains and the hippocampi of AD model mice. Furthermore, the signaling pathways that regulate eEF2K have been implicated in AD pathogenesis. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to determine whether inhibition of eEF2K activity (and subsequent upregulation of eEF2) alleviates AD-associated deficits in protein synthesis and memory formation. This project will utilize a genetic approach in which eEF2K activity is downregulated in Tg19959 AD model mice. Using behavioral, electrophysiological, and biochemical methods, the experiments proposed here will 1) elucidate whether suppression of eEF2K activity rescues memory deficits in AD model mice; 2) determine whether inhibition of eEF2K can alleviate AD-associated synaptic plasticity impairments; and 3) establish whether reduction in eEF2 phosphorylation improves AD pathology, including brain amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. The experiments proposed here will help elucidate a novel mechanism for AD pathophysiology, potentially shedding light on novel therapeutic targets."
"9290961","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to  applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure."
"9456208","Chronic pain affects at least 116 million adults in the United States and exacts a tremendous cost in suffering  and lost productivity. While health systems offer specialized pain services, it is in the primary care setting  where most patients seek and receive care for pain. However, primary care providers often lack the specific  training, not to mention the time, to deliver effective pain-management care. To address this problem, we  propose a mixed-methods, cluster-randomized pragmatic clinical trial that will evaluate the integration of  psychosocial services into the primary care environment in three Kaiser Permanente regions: Georgia, Hawaii,  and the Northwest. Our intervention the Pain Program for Active Coping and Training, or PPACT includes a  variety of therapeutic modalities delivered by a multidisciplinary team charged with engaging patients in their  own care and helping them increasingly self-manage their condition. Through our participation in Collaboratory  Work Groups, we will strengthen our work and share resources throughout the two-phase project.  In the UH2 phase of the proposed study (Phase I), we will conduct an interview-driven formative evaluation to  identify potential facilitators and barriers to successful implementation of our pragmatic clinical trial in the UH3  phase (Phase II); ensure the adequacy of our IT infrastructure and EMR data for full implementation in Phase  II; and prepare Phase II intervention materials for use by a broad range of health professionals, such as nurse  case managers and behavioral specialists. In Phase II, we will build upon the systematic planning conducted in  Phase I to conduct a cluster-randomized clinical trial in 40 primary care clinics. Our primary aim is to compare  usual care to the effects of our intervention on a number of measures, including patients  pain symptoms,  functional ability, satisfaction with health care services, and receipt of opiate medication. We will also perform a  cost and economic-impact analysis of our intervention to maximize its potential for widespread adoption. Phase  II will include evaluations of the intervention s reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance  in the participating clinics, and will include the creation and dissemination of an implementation guide.  This cross-cutting project, which addresses the multifactorial nature of chronic pain, will provide important data  on an intervention that has previously been tested in multiple real-world settings. By testing the PPACT  intervention in diverse Kaiser Permanente regions and including federally qualified health centers in our  qualitative interviewing process, we will create a highly generalizable resource with strong potential to change  the paradigm for the treatment and management of chronic pain."
"9404266","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of anxiety on reward responsiveness in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN), and how this interaction predicts clinical outcome subsequent to intensive treatment. AN is notorious for its resistance to interventions and for the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric disorders. Variou forms of intensive treatment may succeed in restoring weight, yet overall benefits of treatment remain limited and early relapse is unusually high. While evidence suggests that genetic factors play a role in susceptibility, remarkably little is known about AN's mechanistic neural circuitry. Individuals with AN typically exhibit prodromal anxiety early in life prior to disordered eating. This phenotypic expression may manifest as exaggerated threat perception, and hypersensitivity to and avoidance of signals of weight and shape change. In parallel, individuals with restricting-type AN, beginning in early childhood, are reticent to exposure to novel and high reward environments. This is in line with most psychometric and neuroimaging studies that suggest low responsiveness to natural rewards, as well as aberrant reward system activity and dopaminergic function. However, the interaction between anxiety and reward circuits has never been interrogated in AN. There is substantial evidence of distinct yet overlapping neural systems mediating approach (related to reward) and avoidance (related to anxiety), which are integrated in balancing and switching between behaviors related to the predominant valence state. Thus, we posit that high degrees of reactivity of cortico-limbic circuits underlying anxiety may contribute to diminished capacity to respond to reward stimuli. This may translate clinically to lower motivation to engage in treatment; in effect, a lower drive to change behaviors and thought patterns necessary for improvement based on expectancy of benefits of future outcome, resulting in a course trajectory of weight loss and worsening of symptoms. Accordingly, this study investigates this anxiety and reward interaction in individuals with AN who have recently completed intensive treatment, and whom will be followed for degree of symptom relapse over 6 months. Forty two adolescents with restricting-type AN and 42 matched controls will engage in reward tasks in which individually- tailored anxiety provoking word stimuli are interleaved, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Reward and anxiety neural circuit activity, and their interaction, will be analyzed in relationship to their ability to predict trajetory of BMI and symptom severity changes over the subsequent 6 months. Using novel designs for interrogating the functionality of positive and negative valence circuits may thus lead to identification of dimensional phenotypes associated with disease persistence, a critical step towards developing individualized and targeted treatment strategies (such as reduction of stimuli-specific anxiety and/or enhancement of positive affect) for high-risk subgroups."
"9277548","Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are deleterious DNA damages in which both strands are covalently bound together, generating a stalled replication state cytotoxic to cells. Defective repair of ICLs is associated with Fanconi Anemia syndrome (FA) and predisposition to cancer. At least seventeen FA genes have been identified up to date. This proposal focuses on a specific FA protein, FANCA, a member of the FA core complex that is mutated in 64% of the entire FA patient population and does not have a clear function. Our preliminary study shows that FANCA destabilizes (unwinds) DNA helix and recognizes DNA interstrand crosslink damage (ICL) in a replication fork. Intriguingly, FANCA anneals single-strand DNA and catalyzes strand exchange as well. Furthermore, FANCA synergistically interacts with Rad51, the major recombinase in double strand break (DSB) repair. Based on these data, we hypothesize that FANCA directly participates in repair of interstrand crosslinks through its DNA-destabilizing (`unwinding') activity and facilitates subsequent repair of double strand DNA breaks by catalyzing strand annealing and exchange. In order to delineate the role of FANCA in DNA repair, we will use a biochemically defined in vitro system, a cell-based DSB repair study system, and a living cell imaging system to accomplish four aims: 1) Delineate the molecular mechanism of how FANCA catalyzes DNA `unwinding', single-strand annealing, and strand exchange. 2) Determine the role of FANCA in recognition and incision of DNA interstrand crosslinks. 3) Study the biological role of FANCA in double strand break repair. 4) Examine the physiological role of the DNA `unwinding', single- strand annealing, and strand exchange activities of FANCA in the etiology of Fanconi anemia. Understanding the role of FANCA in DNA repair will not only contribute to the overall clarification of the ICL repair process, but also provide novel insights into the etiology of Fanconi anemia and its associated cancer."
"9238801","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans depend on acceptance into groups and intimate relationships for survival and emotional well- being. Actual or perceived threats to this need such as social rejection (when one is not wanted or liked) can lead to marked changes in mood and behavior such as sadness, social withdrawal, and impulsivity. The experience of severe or repeated social rejection in those who are rejection sensitive is a strong contributor to psychiatric disorders such as major depressive, social anxiety, and personality disorders. The neurotransmitter mechanisms underlying rejection sensitivity (RS) are not known. It has been known for over 30 years in nonhuman animals that the endogenous opioid system, particularly the ?-opioid receptor (MOR) system, regulates social distress and social reward behaviors. Using positron emission tomography, we recently showed that social rejection and acceptance produced robust MOR- mediated neurotransmission in specific brain areas, which correlated with changes in mood and behavior. This study was the first to show that the endogenous opioid system responds to social cues in humans. The proposed project will examine the MOR system in the clinically important trait of RS. Since the neurotransmitter mechanisms of RS are unknown, we seek to first understand the basic neurobiology of RS in a healthy population, prior to studying clinical populations. The overall hypothesis is that RS is associated with MOR function. Those with higher RS compared to lower RS are hypothesized to have overall lower MOR activation during social rejection and acceptance, leading to greater distress and dampened pro-social behavior. Numerous animal studies have also established that the MOR system is strongly influenced by harmful social environments. Therefore, we will also examine the role of childhood maltreatment (CM), a negative early life experience known to be one of the highest risk factors for developing depression and anxiety. The goal of this project is to determine how RS and CM interact to determine patterns of MOR binding during baseline, social rejection, and social acceptance in a healthy population. We will also examine how RS, mediated through MOR activation, influences mood and behavior. The impact of this research is to provide the first major step towards understanding a neurotransmitter mechanism for RS, with the long-term goal of predicting and treating its associated disorders."

"9233121","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of blood flow is essential for the health and function of the retina. Flicker stimulation evokes increases in blood flow in the retina a response termed functional hyperemia. This response brings additional oxygen and glucose to active neurons. We have recently demonstrated that blood flow is differentially regulated within the three capillary layers in the retina. Flickering light evokes far greater increases in capillar diameter and blood flow in the intermediate capillary layer than in the deep and superficial layers. The goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms responsible for this differential control of blood flow and to establish whether this control is altered in diabetic retinopathy, where functional hyperemia is known to be disrupted. The aims of the project are: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that selective dilation of intermediate layer capillaries is driven by the activity f nearby neurons. The large flicker-evoked responses of intermediate layer capillaries may arise because synaptic activity near these capillaries is greater than activity near the other capillary layers, leading to greater release of vasodilating agents. This hypothesis will be tested by using local Ca2+ signals within Müller glial cells as an indicator of nearby synaptic activity. Calcium signals will be imaged in different retinal layers using transgenic mice expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3 in Müller cells. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that flicker-evoked dilations of capillaries is mediated by production of arachidonic acid metabolites. Flicker-evoked capillary dilations will be monitored in the rat in vivo in the three capillary layers as the signaing of candidate vasodilators is blocked by intravitreal injection of synthesis inhibitors. Candidate vasodilators will also be injected into the vitreous humor and the resulting changes in capillary diameter in the three capillary layers will be monitored. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that dilation of intermediate layer capillaries is compromised in diabetic retinopathy. Capillary diameter in the three capillary layers will be measured at 0.5, 1, 3 and 6 months after diabetes induction by streptozotocin injection. The effect of aminoguanidine, which reverses the loss of arteriole dilation in the diabetic retina, on capillary dilation will be investigated."
"9258464","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research is to understand the roles of axon guidance molecule Robo4 signaling and heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans in vasculature and gain new knowledge to guide development of Robo4- and HS-based novel therapeutics for human diseases. Our recent studies uncovered that Slit3 interacts with Robo4 to promote endothelial cell (EC) functions in vitro and neovascularization in vivo, and demonstrated that EC-HS promotes developmental angiogenesis in diaphragm by functioning as a co- receptor for Slit3-Robo4 signaling. These studies documented in vivo evidence that EC-HS is required for developmental angiogenesis in diaphragm and elucidated a positive regulatory role of EC-HS in Robo4 signaling. In our ongoing studies, we uncovered that Robo4 and syndecan-1 (SDC-1), the HS proteoglycan that functions as a co-preceptor by forming SDC-1-Slit3-Robo4 ternary complex on the EC surface, both are constitutively shed from the EC surface, and the shedding reduces cell surface levels of Robo4 and SDC-1 and attenuates Slit3-induced EC migration. These new findings revealed a shedding-based regulatory mechanism in Robo4 signaling and led to our first hypothesis that ectodomain shedding of Robo4 and SDC-1 both negatively regulates Robo4 signaling. In parallel, our new studies also generated and examined the EC- specific Ext1 knockout (Ext1ECKO) mice in which the expression of EC-HS is completely abolished. The Ext1ECKO mice exhibit profound and severe developmental angiogenesis defects and are embryonic lethal, revealing that EC-HS is essentially required for developmental angiogenesis in multiple organs. Phenotype characterization uncovered that the EC-Ext1 ablation disturbs EC functions, including tip cell sprouting and filopodia formation, and mural cell (MC) recruitment, phenocopying the vascular development defects displayed in mice that are deficient in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), respectively, leading to our second hypothesis that EC-HS facilitates both VEGF- and PDGF-B signaling to essentially modulate developmental angiogenesis. To vigorously test our new hypotheses we will pursue three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will delineate the regulatory roles of Robo4- and SDC- 1 ectodomain shedding on Robo4 signaling in angiogenesis by identifying Robo4- and SDC-1 sheddaes(s) and assessing if alteration of Robo4- and SDC-1 shedding affects Robo4 signaling. Aim 2 will determine the essential role of EC-HS in developmental angiogenesis and the underlying cellular mechanisms by characterizing vascular defects in the Ext1ECKO mice and assessing related EC- and MC functions. Aim 3 will decipher the molecular signaling, i.e., VEGF- and PDGF-B signaling by which EC-HS modulates developmental angiogenesis. The proposed studies will use both novel and established genetic, cellular and biochemical approaches in conjunction with in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis models. These serial investigations are anticipated to elucidate Robo4- and SDC-1 ectodomain shedding as a novel regulatory mechanism of Robo4 signaling in angiogenesis, to establish that EC-HS is essentially required for developmental angiogenesis, and to reveal that EC-HS facilitates both VEGF and PDGF-B signaling as the molecular mechanisms underlying the essential pro-angiogenesis function of EC-HS in development."
"9264583","    The brain continually processes streams of information that are coded at the neural level by temporal sequences of spiking activity. From this activity, the brain is able to extract behaviorally relevant data and form internal representations of the external world used, in turn, to create behavioral output. The brain also uses its internal state to make predictions about how external stimuli will change; these predictions play a critical role in executive behavioral planning. It is not known how this processing is accomplished in the brain. Establishing the relationship between activity sequences, plasticity and the neural coding of these internal representations will greatly inform our understanding of normal brain function and is necessary to understand the cognitive deficits associated with mental disorders.  Since animals cannot self-report their cognitive state it is very difficult to explore the high-level neural mechanisms of sequence learning using animal models. Generally speaking, the neocortex is organized according to a single common plan that imparts a characteristic local architecture and there is evidence suggesting that brain regions acquire functional differentiation as a result of their specific inputs. In this framework, visual cortex is ?visual? primarily because it connects to the retina and all regions of cortex are capable of solving similar information processing problems. This suggests that the same basic mechanisms used to learn sequences in ?higher? cortical regions should exist within ?lower? regions as well and leads to the hypothesis that primary sensory areas should contain the mechanisms necessary to locally encode sequence representations. A series of experiments testing this hypothesis demonstrate that it is possible to entrain visual sequences in primary visual cortex with both temporal and spatial precision.  This research aims to fully characterize and understand the mechanistic nature of this learning and its consequences for cortical processing. The proposed experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that visual sequence learning is encoded by NMDAR mediated synaptic plasticity between populations of neurons spread across the cortical layers locally within V1 using a combination of electrophysiological observation, 2- photon microscopy, pharmacological and optogenetic manipulation, and computational modeling."

The services of the Core are designed to develop interest and expertise among early career investigators and transitional investigators who have not yet conducted research on mental illness and HIV. This will be accomplished via skills training, structured mentoring and support for four pilot projects to be initiated in each year of Center funding. In all of the Core's services, priority will be given to early career investigators and investigators from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The Developmental Core will provide monthly training seminars focused on research and grant writing skills development and, during the first year, on making the research community at Penn and CHOP aware of the services offered by the Center's four other shared resource Cores. The Core will also serve as a clearinghouse for related seminars and trainings being offered both on and off campus. A structured mentoring program implemented by the Developmental Core will focus on linking Junior and transitional investigators with established investigators in specific areas of mental health and AIDS research. The Core will provide guidance and training materials to assist mentors in their efforts to provide meaningful research and career development support to mentees. The pilot projects program for the Center will be administered by the Developmental Core. A rigorous review process will be implemented in order to select pilot projects that are scientifically sound, feasible and promote the overall mission of the Center. Each application will be assigned two internal and one external reviewer and a scoring system modeled after that used in NIH grant reviews will be used to assess scientific merit and programmatic relevance. All investigators selected for pilot funding will be required to have a designated mentor. The Core will maintain a service delivery database that will be used to evaluate success in delivering training, providing mentoring and reviewing and implementing pilot projects. We will also carefully track publications, grant applications, presentations and new collaborations that emerge from these Core services."
"9244069","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a fundamental failure to translate preclinically-supported compounds into clinically-approved treatments. This failure generally reflects the profound differences between phenomenon assessed in the laboratory and those targeted in the clinic. Behavioral similarity is not enough to suggest translation. For novel treatments to emerge, they will require animal models with cross-species consistency. Hence, there is a critical need for: i) neurophysiological biomarkers of behaviors relevant to domains affected in psychiatric patients that; ii) can be conducted across species; and iii) that are alterd by drug treatment. Such biomarkers would prove stronger evidence that effective preclinical pharmacological manipulations could be effective clinical treatments. We developed the 5-choice continuous performance test (5C-CPT) to quantify cognitive control and response inhibition for use in rodents and humans. We also developed a probabilistic learning (PL) task for mechanistic understanding of reward learning across species. New endeavors here include the progressive ratio breakpoint procedure (PRBP), a task first developed to quantify motivation from physical effort and a rodent cognitive effort task (CET) both of which have recently been reverse-translated for human testing. In addition, action selection/preference-based decision making can be measured across species using the risky gains task (RGT), which quantifies responding to positive vs. negative feedback on a trial-by-trial basis. The UH2 component of this application (Specific Aim 1) will use electrophysiological biomarkers to test the following hypothesis across species: 5C-CPT 1A) Non-target (nogo) stimuli response levels (response inhibition) will inversely correlate with larger frontal event-related potential (ERP) components (e.g. P3a) and 1B) Parietal beta activity will correlate with the sensitivity index measure of cognitive control. PL 2A) the Reward Positivity ERP component, which scales with the degree of positive prediction error, will vary in strength according to probability ratio (80/20>70/30>60/40) and 2B) the strength of the Reward Positivity will correlate with the % correct within each ratio block. PRBP 3) Physical effort will be linked to frontal alpha power; CET 4) Hard cognitive effort choices will be linked to ACC activation as measured by frontal midline theta power. RGT 5A) A stronger mid-frontal theta oscillatory component (Feedback-Related Negativity) will correlate with shifting choices after punishment feedback while 5B) Parietal delta power (e.g. P3) locked to the imperative cue will correlate with the likelihood of staying at the same choice after reward Tasks fulfilling these hypotheses in both mice and humans will then move onto the UH3 component (Specific Aim 2) which will test whether elevating frontal dopamine levels via tolcapone treatment will influence behavior and neurophysiological markers during these tasks. For example, we would hypothesize that tolcapone would induce stronger frontal late ERPs and reduced response inhibition in the 5C-CPT, or increased ACC activation and hard-choice preference in the CET."
"9258985","PROJECT SUMMARY The mammalian visual system utilizes a powerful set of algorithms to extract crucial information from the environment that informs an individual's decisions. These algorithms require constant adjustment to match the individual's current needs ? a task achieved partly by neuromodulators such as serotonin. In some cases, these modulatory systems open the door for maladaptive changes to visual processing. For example, visual hallucination is a debilitating yet common neurological symptom arising in many distinct disorders, including schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Serotonin receptors are key mediators of these symptoms, and their blockade by antipsychotics disrupts hallucinations. However, these drugs cause numerous unwanted side effects, and the lack of therapies with greater specificity reflects the gaps in our understanding of exactly how serotonergic signaling modulates visual processing. Our fundamental goal is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying serotonergic modulation of visual processing to better inform models of visual function and therapeutic targeting of visual hallucinations. In this proposal, we use genetic tools in mouse visual cortex to determine how visual cortical computations are affected by serotonergic modulation. In our first aim, we will measure the effects of serotonin 5HT2A receptor activation on spontaneous and visually evoked activity, followed by identification and manipulation of specific cortical cell types. In our second aim, we will determine how contextual information from outside the classic receptive field is integrated, based on the computation of normalization, and modulated by these receptors. Together these experiments will reveal the role of serotonergic signaling in processing of both local and global information, which should in turn provide insight into disorders of altered perception such as schizophrenia."
"9258475","?    DESCRIPTION: The goal of this proposal is to develop a clinically feasible protocol for ultrasound (US) mediated gene delivery (UMGD) of factor VIII (FVIII) to treat hemophilia A (HemA). Current treatment for HemA patients involves costly and inconvenient repeated infusions of protein concentrations. In a recent clinical trial, adenoassoicated viral vector (AAV) mediated gene therapy has shown excellent promise for treating hemophilia B1-3. However the limitation of accommodating large size gene such as FVIII in the AAV vector, the immune responses to the vector2, 3 and associated transgene products4, and limitation of repeated treatment with pre-existing immunity to AAV vector5, 6 significantly hinder the development of an effective AAV-mediated gene therapy treatment for HemA. Previously we demonstrated that UMGD can significantly enhance reporter gene transfer into the mouse7-9 and rat livers10. This nonviral gene transfer strategy can bypass many obstacles encountered by viral gene therapy. Most significantly, we have recently achieved therapeutic levels of FVIII following UMGD into HemA mice11. In order to facilitate the eventual translation of these technologies into human application, many technical issues, including treatment procedures and protocols, appropriate MB volumes and types, and US parameters and instrumentation require exploration in large animal models. We have successfully developed prototype US systems including several unfocused and semi-focused transducers to treat large tissue volumes in canine12 and swine13. We have also developed several new neutral and cationic MBs to facilitate gene transfer14. The current proposal focuses on the development of a safe and clinically feasible ultrasound technology along with suitable surgery techniques to achieve efficient gene transfer in large animal models, leading to high levels of FVIII gene expression. First, we will explore the best US parameters that can enhance gene transfer efficiency with minimal tissue damage in mice. In addition, our data indicate that transgene is principally expressed by hepatocytes following UMGD into the liver. We propose to make liver-specific constructs carrying a high-expressing FVIII variant gene in a MIP plasmid to further increase and prolong FVIII gene expression in vivo, in order to achieve phenotypic correction in HemA mice. Next, we will improve our US technology and surgery techniques to optimize gene transfer efficiencies in large animal models. Importantly, we will develop minimally invasive interventional radiologic techniques to deliver plasmid DNA (pDNA)/MB mixture into the target liver lobe combined with transcutaneous US treatment procedures in pigs. Long-term experiments will be performed in normal dogs using our most effective FVIII plasmid and the optimized therapeutic US method in combination with immunomodulation to achieve persistent and high-level FVIII gene expression. If successful, this project will facilitate the phenotypic correction in the HemA dog model and the eventual translation of this novel technology into human application, and could change fundamentally the way HemA patients are treated, with better patient outcomes."
"9272872","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gene Therapy Program (GTP) at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) continues to provide critical technical resources and leadership to the evolving field of cell and gene therapy for genetic diseases that include CF. The NIDDK P30 Center currently entitled Molecular Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) remains the flagship of the GTP, having been in existence for the entire 20 years that the PI (James M. Wilson) has been at UPenn. For this new cycle, the original single center has been transformed into a four center consortium. The main theme of the Center [Gene Therapy Program - CF Translational Research Consortium (GTP - CFTRC)] is the progression of molecular therapies into proof-of-concept phase 1 clinical trials. The GTP - CFTRC consists of four renowned institutions with a long-standing history in basic and translational CF research: UPenn (Wilson), University of Massachusetts Medical School (Flotte), Johns Hopkins University (Cebotaru/Guggino) and the United Kingdom CF Gene Therapy Consortium (Alton). Each of these centers brings with it experience in vector development, animal models, airway gene delivery, design and support of IND-enabling studies and progression into clinical trials. The outstanding success of the Pilot and Feasibility Program since its inception in 1993 reinforced the importance of innovative research in advancing the field of CF. It also prompted the GTP - CFTRC to increase its commitment to the Pilot and Feasibility Program by proposing, in this renewal, four applications for funding. The outstanding academic environment at the four centers of the GTP - CFTRC, as well as the highly respected research faculty, will allow for the conduct of innovative research in CF through the well-documented mechanism of collaboration that remains the essence of our consortium."
"9275166","The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is an important human and veterinary pathogen. In humans, acute disease is caused by rapidly growing `tachyzoites' stage. In this context, we hypothesize that during this intense tachyzoite propagation, replication-associated DNA stress could appear to be generating fork collapse and DNA double strand breaks which should be repaired by homologous recombination repair (HRR). The hypothesis is supported by the presence of basal ?H2A.X, a marker of DSB, in the tachyzoite as well as the inhibition of its replication by the KU55933, an inhibitor of ATM, a key kinase in the HRR pathway. In addition, our analysis indicates that key molecules seem to be not present in HRR pathway in T. gondii. Differences in the HRR cascade imply an opportunity for the identification of novel and specific HRR components in T. gondii. If available, such factors could represent attractive candidates for the development of new drugs against Toxoplasmosis. Our goal is to identify novel components of HRR and analyze their importance in HRR pathway. In specific aim 1 we will develop a methodology named iPOND to pull down components of HRR in T. gondii and their identification and analysis by bioinformatics tools. In addition, we will analyze their biological significance in tachyzoite replication and DSB sensitivity, together with some HRR components yet identified by in silico analysis (Mre11, RAD51, ATM, BRCA2, BRCT domain containing proteins). In specific aim 2 we will design a model of HR in vivo by generating tachyzoites conditionally expressing the endonuclease I-SceI to generate DSB specifically in a plasmid incorporated by transfection. This plasmid contains two versions of GFP inactive genes in which the functional gene is expressed only after HR."
"9188782","?     DESCRIPTION:      Insomnia is a critical obstacle to the rehabilitation and recovery of Veterans with psychotic disorders. The VHA has made treatment of insomnia a high priority and has initiated a nationwide dissemination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) - an evidence-based practice and the first-line standard of care for insomnia - across the VHA system, but it is largely not provided to Veterans with psychosis and insomnia. This study involves developing empirically-derived guidelines for the clinical tailoring of CBT-I for Veterans with psychosis and insomnia, and testing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of CBT-I for improving sleep-related functional outcomes. This work will yield a well- specified behavioral intervention that has the potential to improve not only sleep but also physical health functioning more broadly.           Insomnia is highly prevalent among individuals with psychotic disorders and confers significant long-term negative impacts on their physical, emotional, psychosocial, and cognitive recovery. Many behaviors that contribute to insomnia (e.g., poor diet, exercise, substance use, and smoking) are associated with harmful medical conditions that are highly prevalent among Veterans with psychosis (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea). Improving sleep may improve these medical conditions, yet Veterans with psychosis are largely not provided with CBT-I, the current gold standard treatment for insomnia. The proposed research will develop guidelines for the clinical tailoring of CBT-I for Veterans with psychotic disorders and study the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and utility of the resulting progra in improving sleep and associated functional outcomes. The first step of this research will involve an iterative process of review of the extant literature, analysis and integration of information on sleep problems gathered through pilot work, and input from Veteran clients, expert consultants, mentors, and VA treatment providers to develop guidelines and materials for the clinical tailoring of CBT-I for Veterans with psychotic disorders. Using qualitative procedures we will complete an initial acceptability trial of CBT-I with six Veterans with psychosis and insomnia for further refinements of the guidelines. Finally, the proposed study will use a small randomized controlled feasibility and preliminary efficacy trial comparing CBT-I (n=30) to a Health and Wellness control intervention (n=30) to assess rates of recruitment, initial intervention engagement, attendance at intervention sessions, and therapist fidelity. Outcomes include insomnia symptoms and functioning (e.g., health-related quality of life, physical functioning, role limitations, life activities, social interactions, participation in society, and cognitive functioning). We will explore whether baseline clinical and sleep characteristics, physical comorbidities, and other health behaviors (e.g., smoking, caffeine use, physical activity)  moderate the impact of CBT-I on insomnia and functional outcomes, improve as a result of participation in CBT-I, or mediate the effect of CBT-I on functioning. In addition, we will assess the durability of effects of CBT-I on insomnia symptoms and functioning at a 3 month follow-up visit.           This project will include developing educational materials and guidelines for the clinical use of the CBT-I protocol, conducting an open trial of CBT-I in a small sample, and completing an RCT with 60 participants. We will monitor fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability; study Veterans' experiences; measure symptom and functional outcomes at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up; and evaluate potential moderators and mediators."
"9439835","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. It is characterized clinically by progressive cognitive decline, eventually resulting in death, usually within 10 years of diagnosis. The neuropathological features of the disease include depositions of amyloid-? (A?), neurofibrillary tangles (tau), and neuronal loss in affected brain regions. Currently, the predominant theory of the etiology is delineated in the amyloid cascade hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the accumulations of various forms of soluble and/or insoluble A? have a central role in the onset and progression of AD and lead to the formation of neurofibrillary tau tangles. However, recent clinical studies using biomarkers demonstrated that A? abnormalities precede the tau pathology and cognitive decline by 10 years or more, whereas accumulation of pathological tau correlates with the onset of clinical symptoms. Thus, there is a consensus in the field that A? - based immunotherapeutic(s) can be effective as a prophylactic measure in very early AD (prodromal) and/or in non-symptomatic subjects at risk for AD, while tau-based immunotherapeutic(s) can be used as a therapeutic measure in patients with mild-moderate AD. Accordingly, our team developed three recombinant protein- based epitope vaccines that target pathological A? (AV-1959R), tau (AV-1980R) or A? /tau (AV-1953R) simultaneously and tested the immunogenicity of these vaccines in wild-type mice. Of note, all these vaccines have been constructed on the proprietary universal MultiTEP platform (US patents submitted) that is highly immunogenic in mice, rabbits and monkeys. Based on these published results and preliminary data the goals of this competitive renewal project are to study the efficacy and safety of single and dual vaccines in 3xTg-AD mice that have both A? and tau pathologies. The following 3 aims will be pursued to achieve these goals: In Aim 1 we will test the efficacy of prophylactic vaccination initiated in young 3xTg-AD mice before the onset of AD-like pathology. More specifically, we will study the efficacy of epitope vaccines targeting either A? (AV- 1959R) or tau (AV-1980R) or A? /tau simultaneously (AV-1953R). In addition, we will optimize the vaccination regimen in these experiments. In Aim 2 we are planning to study the efficacy of a therapeutic/prophylactic vaccination regimen in 3xTg-AD mice with established A? -pathology but before the onset of tau pathology. The completion of these studies will allow us to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of AV-1959R, the prophylactic efficacy of AV-1980R, and therapeutic/prophylactic efficacies of AV-1953R vaccines. Again, in this aim we will optimize the therapeutic/prophylactic vaccination regimen. Finally, in Aim 3 we will study the efficacy of the therapeutic vaccination regimen in 3xTg-AD mice with established AD-like pathology at the start of vaccination. We believe that the completion of all three Aims by our stellar multidisciplinary team including immunologists, vaccine researchers, neuroscientists/cognitive scientists, and molecular biologists can help us to identify the best immunotherapeutic strategy and translate it to the clinic."
"9235152","DESCRIPTION:         Urinary incontinence, particularly stress urinary incontinence (SUI), is common and very bothersome among female veterans. Although not life threatening, SUI greatly reduces quality of life and, among female veterans is significantly correlated with a history of depression and sexual assault. SUI is also strongly correlated with vaginal delivery of children, which can injure the muscles, and organs of the pelvic floor, including the external urethral sphincter (EUS). In addition, the pudendal nerve, which innervates the EUS, can be injured in Alcock's canal during delivery, proximal to its innervations of the urethra. Thus, the injuries incurred during childbirt represent a unique neuromuscular injury: one in which both the target muscle (the EUS) and its innervation are injured simultaneously. These two injuries, along with injuries to the tissues and muscles of the pelvic floor are strongly correlated with later development of SUI. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) must be produced by the target muscle to regenerate motoneurons and reinnervate the muscle after peripheral nerve injury. However, if muscle is injured, BDNF inhibits neuromuscular junction (NMJ) repair. Therefore, when both a nerve and its innervated muscle are injured, as can occur during childbirth, BDNF downregulation by the muscle inhibits nerve regeneration. We have developed a novel animal model of simulated childbirth injury and have demonstrated that a neurotrophin- mediated mechanism could be responsible for delayed and possibly incomplete neuroregeneration after vaginal delivery. Electrical stimulation (e-stim) increases BDNF expression in injured neurons and promotes nerve regeneration. It may present an alternative therapy with fewer complications than treatment with BDNF. E-stim therapy to promote nerve regeneration has had mixed success, in part because it has only been utilized after nerve injury, not after a combination nerve and muscle injury, as can occur in childbirth. Precisely because of this, investigation of the mechanism of action of e-stim after a combinatorial nerve and muscle injury in a specific clinically related model is crucial for optimizing the therapy and the patient subpopulation to treat. We have recent data that e-stim of the pudendal nerve after simulated childbirth injury upregulates BDNF in pudendal nerve cells and promotes functional recovery of the urethra. However, this data is correlative rather than causative. Therefore, the hypothesis to be tested in this project is that e- stim improves recovery from simulated childbirth injury via a BDNF-mediated mechanism. This hypothesis will be tested via the following specific objectives (SO): SO1. Optimize an e-stim paradigm for improvement of recovery after simulated childbirth injury; SO2. Demonstrate that accelerated recovery of function with e- stim correlates with chronic improvement; SO3. Demonstrate that BDNF is necessary and sufficient for spontaneous recovery after pudendal nerve crush (PNC) and accelerated recovery with supplemental BDNF after simulated childbirth injury. SO4. Demonstrate that e-stim facilitates recovery from simulated childbirth injury via a BDNF-mediated mechanism. This project will provide critical pre-clinical data to initiate a clinical tril to assess e-stim as an adjuvant to rehabilitation for female veterans with SUI. Approximately 1/3 of women have postpartum SUI following delivery. Although this resolves in most women, almost half of these women redevelop it 5 years later and over half redevelop it years later, indicating that postpartum SUI is predictive of later SUI. Women with postpartum SUI could constitute the population for a clinical trial of e- stim, which could treat their current incontinence and preven redevelopment of SUI. This research directly relates to the Rehabilitation R&D Priority Area of Aging. In addition, women are the fastest growing segment of the veteran population, representing 14% of active duty forces and 20% of new military recruits, and are a priority for the VA research program. Since incontinence and depression are so closely correlated among female veterans, improvement of incontinence symptoms may help lead to recovery from depression."
"9218971","Project Summary/Abstract The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however only a moderate number of the hundreds of genes and genomic regions thought to be involved in ASD have been identified. Advances have come largely from the study of rare genetic variants, especially de novo varia- tion, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), insertion/deletions (indels), copy number variation (CNV), and larger chromosomal imbalances. A portion of the progress for ASD has come through the efforts of the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC), which represents a coordinated effort by more than 40 independent groups to rapidly identify ASD risk genes. Here we propose to continue the work of the ASC, largely by continued pro- duction and analysis of sequence data from ASD subjects and their families. The ASC benefits from substan- tial leveraging of resources, including the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) centered at the Broad Insti- tute (BI) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) of ASC samples, supported by an NHGRI Center Grant to BI, to make this renewal as low cost as possible. We also plan new avenues of research, such as integrating whole genome sequence (WGS) data and building on ideas that have emerged from the study of common variants to understand the interplay of common and rare variants to impact risk. Through this new research we will accel- erate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Moreover, such variants have direct implications for patients and their families in terms of etiological diagnosis, genetic counseling and pa- tient care. Our central hypothesis ? formulated based on results over the past decade ? is that rare and com- mon variation contributes additively to risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific Aims: 1) Produce and/or analyze WES of 30,000 new ASD subjects, parents and other controls, for a total of more than 50,000 samples; 2) Develop and apply approaches to find ?hidden? risk variants, and, 3) Use results from common and rare variant studies to describe the interplay of such variation in ASD risk. This contribution is significant because it represents the first step in research to understand pathogenesis of ASD and to the development of pharmacological strategies for treat- ment of core symptoms of ASD and etiologically related neurodevelopmental disorders. The research pro- posed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identify- ing risk variants and for integrating rare and common variation. This is a new and substantively different ap- proach to gene discovery in ASD that departs significantly from the status quo and provides the means to achieve these important goals."
"9327592","PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this project is to investigate the causal effect of sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic factors on patient safety outcomes in individuals on high-risk immunosuppressive medications. Patient safety events are a leading cause of morbidity and are a major health care quality problem, causing tens of thousands of deaths each year in the U.S. Although patient safety problems in the U.S. health care system are widely recognized, research to develop new approaches to improve safety is urgently needed. For example, individuals requiring immunosuppressive medications for high-risk conditions may face serious patient safety risks, including prescribing errors, monitoring errors, and preventable adverse events (AEs). However, research regarding which patients may be at a higher risk of experiencing an AE due to medication has not been extensively studied. The overall hypothesis of this project is that sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic factors will demonstrate a causal effect on patient safety outcomes in individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications. This project will utilize established electronic health record (EHR)-enabled registries to examine over 35,000 individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF, n=~23,000) and San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH, n=~12,000) to address three related hypothesis. First, factors such as socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, number of medical comorbidities and preferred language status will demonstrate a causal effect on process errors or AEs in individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications. State-of-the-art causal inference statistical methods, which account for missing data, time-varying confounding and censoring will be utilized to test for the presence of these effects. Second, genetic variants within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) will demonstrate a causal effect on AEs in individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications. Existing genomic information for patients with certain autoimmune diseases (n=~1,750) will be used for this analysis. Third, clustering and network approach analyses will identify significant sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, and genetic variants associated with subgroups of individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications. Using computational approaches, individuals will be classified to identify sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, and genetic variants associated with adverse outcome risk (e.g., those who experience an AE vs. those who do not). The importance of contributing factors to process errors and AEs in individuals prescribed high-risk immunosuppressive medications will be demonstrated through this research and provide new insight into monitoring and improving safety in the ambulatory setting."
"9332704","Ischemic stroke is one of the most common types of central nervous system injuries, and among the leading causes of morbidity in US adults. There undoubtedly remains few available treatment options, none of which is effective for tackling this debilitating vascular occlusive disease. Vascular occlusion has been shown to induce the immediate active remodeling of pre-existing collateral arterioles (arteriogenesis) into functional conduits for oxygen, nutrients and drug delivery. Although, arteriogenesis is an active therapeutic target for enhancing stroke recovery, the mechanism(s) regulating this response remain elusive. The research objectives in this pre-doctoral application focus on the cell autonomous role of Eph receptor (EphR) signaling in limiting the arteriogenic response following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). In support of our objectives we have determined there is a significant increase in arteriole remodeling, greater recovery of cerebral blood flow and reduced infarct in the absence of EphR on Tie2-expresssing cells after pMCAO. Based upon extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that EphR profoundly limits injury-induced arteriogenesis, blood flow restoration and tissue recovery by suppressing the pro-arteriogeneic response via regulation of key events on endothelial cells. We will test our hypothesis using cell-specific loss-of-function and reverse of function infusion approaches. These studies will shed light on a novel mechanism regulating cerebrovascular arteriogenesis and will provide support for future strategies aimed at targeting therapeutic enhancement of this adaptive process to improve neural functional recovery."
"9253376","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with facial paralysis have an obvious facial disability including facial disfigurement and impairment in soft tissue movements, particularly in facial expressive behaviors. These negative physical sequelae not only impact facial esthetics and function, but also patients' social and emotional quality of life (QOL). Treatments range from non-surgical interventions and facial reanimation surgery to new implantable facial pacing devices that would potentially initiate artificial movement on the paralyzed side of the face. Traditionally, surgeons' plan treatment based on isolated measurements made from 2D photographs and subjective grading of the patient's face, both of which are limited in scope and dimension. Our research has demonstrated the utility of novel, landmark-based, 3D dynamic and static quantitative (objective) measures for the evaluation of facial soft tissue function (NIH DE 013814, DE 016964, and DE 013814-08S1). These measures have been validated for use in the cleft lip/palate (CL/P) patient population. The measures are objective and quantitative. They provide a more precise diagnosis of facial soft tissue disability and evaluation of surgical outcomes. The main goal of this prospective, observational study is to determine the applicability of these novel 3D dynamic and static measures for quantification and measurement of impairment and disfigurement, as well as change over time, in patients with facial paralysis. We will also explore the utility of non-landmark based dynamic and static measures. The global research question is whether the use of the measures will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the severity of facial paralysis and the changes over time (recovery) when compared with current assessment methods. The specific aims of the study are: Specific Aim 1. To quantitatively evaluate the range of facial soft tissue disability (facial impairment and disfigurement) in patients with acute, unilateral, flaccid facial paralysis and track the changes over time (3 month recovery period), and to compare the facial disability in the patients with a group of age- and sex-frequency matched normal subjects. Specific Aim 2. In patients with acute unilateral, flaccid facial paralysis, to compare the current qualitative clinical assessment methods for facial impairment and disfigurement (House-Brackman Facial Nerve Grading System & Sunnybrook Facial Grading System ) with the objective quantitative assessments in order to assess the differential information provided by a quantitative zonal analysis versus a qualitative global assessment. Specific Aim 3. (a) To assess perceptions of facial appearance and QOL over time in patients with acute, unilateral, flaccid facial paralysis and to compare these perceptions with those of control subjects, and (b) To correlate the patients' perceptions over time with the quantitative measures of facial disability. Ultimately, this study is unique for the rehabilitation of patients with facial paralysis in that the focus is on generating novel, objective, 3D measures to characterize the condition and temporal changes, and on the generation of future hypotheses to optimize interventions and assess the outcomes of the different treatments."

This grant funding is intended to support the Oncofertility Conferences to be held in September 2014 - 2018. Expert speakers are invited to discuss the clinical implications of this research and provide information regarding the communication, ethical, and legal considerations needed to provide care to these patients. This meeting is the only one of its kind and serves the purpose of uniting prominent researchers, scientists, clinicians, and the patient community in an interactive discussion about emerging technologies, research, and real-world options for protecting reproductive health from the negative effects of disease treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and other disease- modifying agents. Conference attendees span the fields of cancer biology, immunology, reproductive biology, biochemistry, endocrinology, cryobiology, biomedical and tissue engineering, nursing, developmental biology, ethics, law, religion, economics, communication, public health, sociology, and psychology. Additionally, patients, providers, and patient advocates are invited to share their intimate experiences regarding reproductive health in the midst of disease. We aim to broadly disseminate this cutting-edge information to scientific and medical trainees and the global community of oncofertility professionals, many of whom may not be able to travel to the conference. We have developed an innovative approach in support of this mission; we provide web broadcasting of conference lectures in real time to audiences across the globe, with the opportunity to participate in bi-directional exchanges. Furthermore, materials produced from the conference, including video recordings of lectures and publications of conference reports are available to interested audiences on the Oncofertility Consortium website (oncofertility.northwestern.edu). In the past, the Oncofertility Consortium's annual conference has generated new research questions, initiated collaborations, cultivated the interests of the next-generation of oncofertility researchers and clinicians, and resulted in multiple academic endeavors. As our field continues to evolve, we remain deeply committed to our original goals of furthering research, education, and opportunities for patients and practitioners alike to access knowledge, techniques, and treatments. With advances in treatment for cancer and other diseases, survivorship issues are of increasing importance to this patient population and their providers. The Oncofertility Conference remains the leading opportunity to disseminate advances in research and clinical care to improve the reproductive health options, including fertility, of disease survivors."

Most PCOS women also have insulin resistance (IR) beyond that predicted by body mass index (BMI), increasing the risk for diabetes. Although many PCOS women are overweight, in nonobese PCOS women, breakdown of lipids (lipolysis) is decreased in subcutaneous (SC) abdominal fat cells (adipocytes), causing enlarged SC abdominal adipocytes that correlate in size with IR. This finding may be due to androgen excess, since androgen decreases lipolysis and inhibits SC abdominal adipogenesis, whereby adipose stem cells become preadipocytes and differentiate to adipocytes. Thus, androgen excess in PCOS may decrease numbers of adipocytes in SC abdominal adipose and reduce capacity of this adipose to safely store fat. When energy intake exceeds this capacity, SC abdominal adipocytes may overfill with lipid, mobilizing free fatty acids to ectopic locations (lipotoxicity), promoting IR and ovarian dysfunction. We hypothesize that androgen excess in lean PCOS women decreases adipogenic differentiation and increases adipocyte lipid content in a constrained SC abdominal adipose store, inducing lipotoxicity, IR and ovarian dysfunction. If so, antiandrogen therapy with flutamide for 6 months to lean PCOS women should improve SC abdominal adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity and ovarian function and morphology. We will 1) compare differences in SC abdominal adipogenesis in lean PCOS women vs. age- and BMI matched controls; 2) examine the effect of 6-month fiutamide therapy in lean PCOS women on SC abdominal adipogenesis, body fat distribution, metabolic function and ovarian folliculogenesis; and 3) determine the underlying mechanisms whereby androgen inhibits adipogenesis. Understanding if androgen excess in lean PCOS women disrupts SC abdominal adipogenesis to impair ovarian function will establish a crucial link between adipogenic and ovarian dysfunction, allowing development of new clinical strategies that improve reproduction in PCOS women and enhance safety of ovulation-inducing agents during infertility therapy."
"9245733","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanism whereby cardiomyocytes precisely regulate the assembly of their actin-containing thin filaments at the level of single molecules is still largely unknown. We have discovered that Leiomodin 2 (Lmod2), a striated muscle specific actin-binding protein, functions as the first described actin filament pointed- end elongation factor in mammals. Little is known, however, regarding the function of Lmod2 in the heart. Preliminary analysis of our unique Lmod2 knockout (KO) mice reveal that they die ~3 weeks following birth, with hearts displaying severe contractile dysfunction and ventricular chamber enlargement, consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Strikingly, Lmod2 KO hearts have shorter thin filaments. When we analyzed human heart samples with DCM and hearts from multiple mouse models of DCM we discovered that they too have shorter thin filaments. Remarkably, when DCM was rescued in the hearts of a well-studied mouse model of DCM (muscle LIM protein (MLP) knockout mice), proper thin filament lengths were restored. We hypothesize that thin filament length changes are a general mechanism of the complex remodeling that occurs in DCM.  The long-term goal of the proposed work is to discover common pathophysiologies of dilated hearts that can be used as therapeutic targets for the treatment of DCM. The immediate goals of this proposal are to determine mechanisms by which actin-thin filament architecture is regulated in cardiac muscle, the role Lmod2 plays in this regulation, and how defects in this regulation contribute to DCM. Using novel transgenic mice (with either abnormally long or short thin filaments), human muscle samples and primary cardiomyocytes, we will take a multidisciplinary approach to accomplish three Specific Aims focused on determining: 1) the effect loss of Lmod2 has on cardiac development and function; 2) the mechanism by which Lmod2 functions to elongate thin filaments; and 3) the role thin filament length dysregulation plays in cardiomyopathies, and whether heart function and remodeling can be rescued if thin filament regulation is restored in a dilated heart in vivo.  We predict that completion of this project will result in the discovery of one critical general mechanism and a novel structural biomarker (i.e., thin filament length dysregulation) of the complex remodeling seen in DCM. These discoveries will potentially facilitate early detection of DCM and lead to new therapeutic options."
"9362125","Non-invasive imaging modalities are crucial for clinicians and researchers to observe changes in organ/tissue structure, size, and integrity. Medical ultrasound (US) is widely used for clinical investigations and has a number of benefits. Compared with other non-invasive, tomographic modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), US scanning is more rapid and much more economical. Unlike CT, US does not utilize ionizing radiation and unlike MRI there are no absolute contraindications. Patients with implanted devices, which may cause image degradation on other modalities, can typically be readily imaged with US. In general, even the most difficult of patients tolerate ultrasound well. Furthermore, ultrasound can readily provide information on blood flow without exogenous contrast administration. Despite all of the well-known benefits of US, imaging resolution on clinical systems has been an issue for a number of decades. Using the highest available linear transducers (typically up to 18MHz), the best resolution that could be achieved was around ~0.6mm or 600 µm (characteristic resolution), which is comparable to clinical MRI. Although ultra high-resolution ultrasound systems have been available for a number of years, they have all been used for pre-clinical applications, such as on mice, rats, and rabbits. However, in April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the first and only ultra high-frequency clinical ultrasound system for human use (Vevo MD, FUJIFILM, VisualSonics). With transducers as high as 70 MHz, characteristic resolution approaches 30 µm, which is less than half the size of a grain of sand and 20 times better than existing clinical ultrasound machines. The Vevo MD system is the result of decades of experience gained on animals using preclinical systems, delivered to the bedside as an FDA-cleared device. With this system we can now non-invasively visualize human anatomy in a manner not previously possible. The Vevo MD is particularly useful for musculoskeletal imaging applications where many targets are relatively superficial to the skin surface. This includes certain locations of tendons (Drs. Chang and Murphy, Achilles and rotator cuff tendons), peripheral nerves (Dr. Shah, median, ulnar, and digital nerves), muscles (Dr. Rajasekaran, pelvic floor muscles and sphincters), and cartilage (Drs. Lee, Terkeltaub, and Liu-Bryan, femoral trochlea and digital cartilage). In addition, using this system, imaging of the anterior eye (Dr. Lee) and small crystals (Drs. Terkeltaub and Liu-Bryan) can be performed in vivo with unmatched resolution and speed. 1"
"9359317","The primary goal of this proposal is to establish a Small Animal Integrated Behavioral and Physiological Assessment Core that will provide clinically relevant tools and services necessary to support and advance research that directly impacts the health of our Veterans. The VA Small Animal Integrated Behavioral and Physiological Assessment Core is an integrated system of hardware (small animal behavioral testing components) that is driven by a central software control platform, created by Noldus Information Technology, Inc. The Noldus EthoVision XT System represents a state-of-the-art integrated system allowing for automated, quantitative, comprehensive behavioral and physiological assessment of small animals centrally controlled by the EthoVision XT platform. This system allows for a single animal to be analyzed for multiple, clinically relevant parameters to generate a behavioral and physiological profile for each animal as a function of time, injury model, disease progression, or intervention. These assessments are directly applicable to genetic disorders, diseases, and injury models that represent those affecting our Veterans such as cardiac disease, neurologic illness, musculoskeletal pathologies (fracture healing, osteoarthritis, multiple sclerosis), stroke, Alzheimer?s disease (AD), and spinal cord/traumatic brain injury (SCI/TBI). This core will complement the existing VA Animal Research Surgical Suite, the VA Cellular and Molecular Evaluation Core, and the VA Histology and Imaging Core facilities within Research Service at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center. Together, these comprehensive and unparalleled services will provide a turn-key suite of surgical, behavioral, physiological, and biochemical methodologies that facilitates model evaluation that spans from whole animals to single cells. Our investigators have identified three primary aims that will be accomplished through this integrative technology: 1) To facilitate basic discovery and establish relationships between behavioral and physiological deficits and the presence of disease; 2) To demonstrate efficacy of interventional methodologies and therapeutic strategies designed to treat disease; and 3) To integrate holistic assessments and biochemical outcomes to provide comprehensive analysis of disease models. Notably, the Integrated Behavioral and Physiological Assessment Core is broadly applicable across the diverse research efforts of our local VAMC investigators including studies in cardiology, neuroscience, immunology, stem cell development and function, in addition to behavioral science research focusing on post-traumatic stress disorders and addiction. Incorporating this Integrated Behavioral and Physiological Assessment Core will greatly strengthen the research capabilities of our station, facilitating basic scientific discovery leading to the rapid implementation of cutting-edge personalized medical treatment for our Nation?s Veterans, a specific directive outlined in the Secretary?s Blueprint for Excellence that is directly relevant to the VA Mission."
"9258515","Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes 12 major academic, research and healthcare institutions and 5 influential community partners in our region, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The distribution of underrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for our CTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a ?population of the future?. Improving health in our community and the nation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, the University at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility, including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facility and a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic Health Center creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries in the laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise and innovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to the CTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leading center on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developed with our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; and one of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium.  With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of new healthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1 through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translational researchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build a translational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methods to discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processes with a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups with health disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation. Building on our unique strengths will enhance both our local and national CTSA network capacity through collaboration and sharing expertise and resources.

"9258480","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposes a program of tailored mentorship, focused research, didactics and coursework to provide the candidate with the training in sleep medicine and perinatal neuroendocrine functioning necessary for independence as an investigator.  Candidate. The candidate's background and foundation in clinical research make her well-poised for this award. She completed her Ph.D. in clinical psychology at the University of Alabama, where she received training rooted in the scientist-practitioner model. An emerging interest in sleep and mood led her to pursue a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan, where she began to develop a niche in behavioral sleep medicine and perinatal mental health. She was recently appointed to the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan. Her goal is to receive additional training in sleep medicine and perinatal neuroendocrinology. The candidate has identified two key training objectives necessary to achieve full independence as a researcher: (1) experience in sleep physiology (including assessment and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy) and (2) neuroendocrinology in pregnancy.  Environment. The proposed project will take place within the University of Michigan Department of Psychiatry and the Sleep Disorders Center. Both departments have an extensive history of close collaboration with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The fifth largest research university in the United States, the University of Michigan provides extensive resources and a rich research environment. The candidate will have access to the large, accredited Sleep Laboratory within the Sleep Disorders Center, the well-established perinatal recruitment infrastructure within the Women's Mental Health and Infants Program (in collaboration with the Department of Obstetrics), and resources provided by the CTSA-funded Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research. The proposed primary mentor, Ronald Chervin, M.D., M.S., is a well-funded, highly productive expert in sleep-disordered breathing who has more than 20 years of experience in sleep medicine and a long history of mentoring K awardees and junior faculty. Two carefully selected co-mentors, physiologist Louise O'Brien, Ph.D., M.S., and psychiatrist Juan Lopez, M.D., will provide focused training in perinatal sleep and neuroendocrinology, respectively. The proposal is also bolstered by a tailored consultant team.  Research. The goal of this application is to understand the contribution of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) to one of the most common and debilitating adverse pregnancy outcomes, perinatal depression. It is our hypothesis that positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of SDB in pregnant women with comorbid depression will result in significant reductions in depressive symptoms and improved neuroendocrine functioning. This proposal will leverage our unique expertise with PAP for SDB in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including perinatal depression. The rationale is that a better understanding of the role of SDB and the impact of PAP treatment on perinatal depression will allow for development of targeted and critically-timed interventions which may have long-term benefits for both women and their offspring. We plan to test our hypothesis by randomly assigning 50 women with SDB to receive either positive airway pressure treatment (PAP group) or treatment as usual in obstetrics (non-PAP group). The following specific aims will be tested: AIM 1: Determine the impact of PAP treatment on prenatal depressive symptoms in pregnant women with SDB and depression. AIM 2: Identify the contribution of PAP treatment on the HPA axis in pregnant women with SDB and depression. An exploratory aim is to assess associations between PAP treatment and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in women with depression and SDB. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed work will demonstrate that SDB during pregnancy plays a role in perinatal depression, and that treatment of SDB during pregnancy will ameliorate depressive symptoms and HPA axis functioning, and improve pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Such findings are expected to have an important positive impact, because they will further our understanding of the role of SDB in adverse pregnancy outcomes and reduce the burden of the most common and debilitating adverse outcomes experienced by pregnant women. This will have long term health benefits for both women and their offspring.  Summary. The proposed K23 will provide key additional training for a promising early investigator to become a clinical researcher in perinatal sleep medicine. The project will also address important, testable questions about the relationships between a common sleep disorder and the debilitating adverse pregnancy outcome of perinatal depression, a major public health concern."
"9249112","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with weak currents is a non-invasive, low-cost, and well tolerated technique producing lasting functional changes in the central nervous system. There is increasing evidence supporting the use of tDCS to improve stroke rehabilitation. Behavioral and therapeutic outcomes of tDCS depend on the brain areas being targeted. However, conventional approaches are limited in that they insufficiently activate the target region and/or result in nonspecific stimulation throughout the entire head. To address this, High- Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS), which uses arrays of specifically designed electrodes, has been developed and is being tested for a number of indications, including stroke rehabilitation and central pain. The high-definition approach allows for exceptional flexibility in designing targeted and individualized electrotherapy. Preliminary work in a Phase I STTR demonstrated that the HD approach, when individualized using MRI and fMRI to account for the specific stroke anatomy, can achieve increased stimulation on active peri-lesional areas, which are hypothesized to mediate the gains of language rehabilitation treatment. A preliminary trial indicated that this may result in improved outcomes for the treatment of aphasia. Additionally, hardware and software development in Phase I STTR make a larger clinical trial now feasible. The present proposal is a direct continuation of the STTR work using the alternate SBIR mechanism. The first specific aim in Phase I is to adapt our existing HD-tDCS hardware technology to develop a HD device that allows true double-blinding. The second aim of Phase I is to establish the patient-specific modeling and targeting pipeline developed at City College of New York at Soterix Medical in order to execute a trial on a larger cohort of subjects. The first specific aim in Phase II is to perform a carefully controlled double-blind randomized prospective trial for the adjunctive treatment of aphasia with HD-tDCS. The primary outcome measure is an improvement in the ability to name common objects, which is a major impairment for persons with aphasia. The expected efficacy in naming corresponds to clinically meaningful improvements in language overall. The second aim of Phase II is to optimize treatment parameters to further increase this effect size and to elucidate the mechanism of action by assessing brain function with fMRI before and after treatment. The trial adopts an established treatment protocol and patient selection criteria so as to compare the results with conventional tCDS using unoptimized sponge-based electrodes. In addition, device technology and regulatory process will be developed to be ready for a pivotal FDA-regulated Phase III clinical trial. The long-term goal of this project is to increase the efficacy of this ne and versatile treatment option for stroke rehabilitation, and to make it broadly accessible to patients and clinicians by making it commercially available."
