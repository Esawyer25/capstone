"9391726","Lyme arthritis (LA), a common late manifestation of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, usually resolves after appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, in some patients arthritis persist for months or years following apparent spirochetal killing by 2-3 months of oral and IV antibiotic therapy, termed antibiotic-refractory LA. Joints in these patients are characterized by excessive synovial inflammation and proliferation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of various biological processes such as inflammation and proliferation, and mice with defects in miRNA function have significantly altered immune responses to B. burgdorferi infection and more severe Lyme arthritis. However, the role of miRNAs has not yet been examined in human LA. To determine how miRNAs modulate human LA, an unbiased screen was performed to measure miRNA expression in synovial fluid (SF) and synovial tissue from antibiotic-refractory LA patients. Patients with infectious LA (before IV antibiotic therapy), RA (a prototypic chronic joint inflammatory disease), or osteoarthritis (OA, a minimally inflammatory joint disease) were used as comparison groups. Synovial tissue and SF from patients with LA and RA, but not OA, contained an inflammatory miRNA signature, including miR- 146a and miR-155. In patients with antibiotic-refractory LA, this inflammatory miRNA signature correlated with elevated inflammatory markers and longer disease duration. In addition to an inflammatory signature, antibiotic-refractory LA and RA patients had a distinct proliferative miRNA signature, including miR-142 and miR-223. In contrast, infectious LA (prior to oral or IV antibiotic therapy) or OA patients lacked this proliferative signature. In vitro studies using fibroblasts, the predominant resident cell in the synovial lesion, demonstrated that miRNAs isolated from SF of LA patients are transferred to fibroblast-like synoviocytes, suggesting miRNAs may act as paracrine regulators of gene expression in resident cells during LA pathogenesis. Based on these preliminary results, it is proposed that after antibiotic therapy, patients with antibiotic- responsive LA appropriately down-regulate inflammation and repair damaged tissue, leading to resolution of arthritis. In contrast, patients with antibiotic-refractory LA fail to restore homeostasis following apparent spirochetal killing, and what starts as an immune response to infection develops into uncontrolled synovial inflammation and proliferation. In these patients, accumulation of inflammatory miRNAs indicates a failure to down-modulate immune responses, and accumulation of proliferative miRNAs indicates a failure to appropriately regulate proliferation and tissue repair. This proposal aims to determine the roles of miRNAs in regulating synovial inflammation and proliferation in human LA pathogenesis, and to explore the potential of miRNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for patients with infection-induced chronic inflammation."
"9204750","Project Summary/Abstract: Molecular Therapeutics (MT)  The goal of the Molecular Therapeutics (MT) Program is to identify therapeutic targets, drugs, and strategies,  and to facilitate the translation of Dartmouth-investigator hypotheses into clinical trials. The research interests  of the program faculty cover the full spectrum of investigations in molecular therapeutics and include synthesis  of novel compounds as research tools and potential therapeutics; investigation of novel targets for therapy;  assessment of predictors of disease progression or drug response; and proof-of-concept and therapeutic early  phase clinical trials. The MT program currently has 30 members from 9 different departments whose research  foci can be described under the following four scientific themes: (1) Synthesis and discovery of novel  compounds and potential cancer drugs, (2) Interrogation of potential new targets and therapeutic strategies, (3)  Development of biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prediction of treatment response, and (4) Development of  hypothesis-based cancer clinical trials. These four research themes do not exist as separate entities. There is  extensive interaction between them, as novel drugs and compounds are used to interrogate novel targets,  novel biomarkers are being identified, and these advances are being translated into molecular proof-of-  principle clinical trials. The interactions across this spectrum are catalyzed by the interactive environment  generated by activities of the MT program, its deep involvement in the Early Phase Trials Clinical Oncology  Group (EPTCOG), and by the continual nurturing and mentoring of program members by the Program Co-  Directors. This work results in extensive collaborations across the entire spectrum of molecular therapeutics,  as evidenced by joint grants and publications. Major contributions of the program to the NCCC mission have  been the facilitation of discoveries promising new therapeutic approaches, the translation of Dartmouth  investigator hypotheses into clinical trials, and the accrual of patients to such studies. In addition, NCCC has  made substantial commitment to improving the depth and breadth of research and clinical translation in the MT  program through support of shared resources, financially supporting many of the costs associated with early-  phase/proof-of-principle clinical trials, and strategic recruitment of new investigators. For example, over the  past 5 years, the membership of the program has evolved with the successful recruitment of outstanding new  faculty in the biological laboratory sciences (Miller, Kurokawa), chemistry (Micalizio, Wu), and in  clinical/translational investigations (Danilov, Lansigan, Smith). More than 363 cancer-related articles have  been published over the reporting period (54 [15%] in high impact journals), many of them representing intra-  program (69=19%) or inter-program (107=29%) collaboration. These collaborations involve 29 MT program  members and 63 NCCC members, almost equally distributed between the other 5 NCCC research programs.  Total funding for the program currently is $8.0M, of which $6.0M is peer-reviewed and $3.4M is from NCI."
"9271024","PROJECT SUMMARY With the most people ever in history currently living with HIV, stopping the HIV epidemic remains imperative. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) limits viral replication, but is not curative. Thus, there is an urgent need to design a functional cure via elimination of the viral reservoir. Timothy Brown, aka the Berlin Patient, remains HIV free in the absence of cART following leukemia-related, MHC-matched, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a CCR5 deficient donor. The mechanisms underlying this functional cure are not known, but may depend on the immune conditioning regimen, graft-versus-host immunity, or a reconstituted immune system lacking CCR5. Non-human primates are the best model of HIV infection, but previous transplant studies have used autologous or MHC-mismatched allogeneic HSCT due to the complexity of non-human primate MHC. Also, no CCR deficient macaque donors exist. Thus, no studies have been able to recapitulate the transplant of Timothy Brown. We have built an allogeneic HSCT model using a novel, Mauritian cynomolgus macaque (MCM). MCM have extremely simplified genetics due to a recent bottleneck approximately 500 years ago. Furthermore, we are currently using CRISPR technology to generate CCR5 deficient donors. Therefore, we are uniquely positioned to recapitulate Timothy Brown?s transplant in a clinically relevant animal model. In specific aim 1, we will measure the impact of myeloablative chemotherapy on clearing the latent viral reservoir in autologous HSCT transplants. In specific aim 2, we will perform fully MHC-matched HSCT, measure graft-versus host immunity, and correlate it to SIV rebound in the plasma and tissues. In specific aim 3, we will use our CCR5 deficient donors to perform an allogeneic HSCT with stem cells lacking CCR5. Overall, this study will allow us to map the determinants of HIV clearance following HSCT."

"9377731","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposal is to support Dr. Han Chen's career development in transition from a trainee into an independent researcher in statistical genetics and genomics with expertise in large-scale sequencing association studies for complex diseases and traits, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic diseases, including Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), hypertension, asthma, Acute Lung Injury / Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ALI/ARDS), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Dr. Chen is currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and he has developed statistical methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), sequencing association studies and meta-analysis. Minority ethnic groups in the United States such as African- Americans and Hispanic-Americans have previously been underrepresented in genetic association studies. There is an increasingly pressing need to design and conduct GWAS and sequencing studies to better understand, prevent and treat complex diseases in these ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, it is important to develop advanced statistical and computational methods to address the challenges in analyzing these data. Specifically, the applicant proposes to develop statistical and computational methods to 1) account for population structure and relatedness in sequencing studies; and 2) test for genetic heterogeneity and test for gene-environment interaction accounting for heterogeneous environmental effects in trans-ethnic sequencing studies. This will provide new insights into biological functional studies, more accurate disease risk prediction, and advance personalized medicine. The proposed methods will be applied to ongoing sequencing studies for OSA, a condition that affects more than 10% of the population in the United States, especially African- Americans and Hispanic-Americans, and is associated with profound cardio-metabolic morbidity. During the mentored period, the applicant will learn more about modern statistical models for correlated data analysis such as advanced parametric, semiparametric, and additive mixed models, and develop the new statistical frameworks for the proposed research under the guidance of Dr. Xihong Lin (primary mentor). The applicant will also expand knowledge on complex human diseases under the guidance of Dr. Susan Redline (co-mentor), and broaden his background in population genetics and computer science through coursework, workshops and seminars. With skills acquired in the mentored period, the applicant will adapt the statistical models to different data and research questions, and apply them in sequencing association studies to better understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases. Upon the completion of this award, the applicant will have become a productive and independent researcher in statistical genetics and genomics with expertise in large- scale sequencing studies with applications to complex human disease research."
"9192700","Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. This arrhythmia represents a major public health problem as it is associated with several adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Recently, psychological stress has been identified as important risk factor for AF development and interventions aimed at reducing psychological stress could help reduce the burden of this common arrhythmia. However, the mechanisms that link psychological stress with AF have yet to be fully elucidated. Transient changes in left atrial size and pressure during stress may signal increased risk of AF onset, and over time possibly lead to fixed structural changes which predispose to arrhythmia. Therefore, the identification of dynamic changes in left atrial abnormalities on the 12-lead electrocardiogram during stress will allow for the better characterization of at risk populations for stress-induced AF as it will help identify those who are likely to develop the arrhythmia. We hypothesized that acute psychological stress is able to alter left atrial structure and function as detected by left atrial abnormalities on the routine 12-lead electrocardiogram. The preliminary data showed that P-wave terminal force in lead V1 (PTFV1), a commonly reported left atrial abnormality associated with increased left atrial pressure and size, becomes more negative with acute psychological stress. This suggests that acute psychological stress is associated with adverse changes in left atrial pressure and size. To further characterize the association between acute mental stress and left atrial abnormalities, we will examine the change in PTFV1 during acute mental stress on a well-characterized cohort of 1,000 patients with stable coronary artery disease. Aim 1 will compare the mean PTFV1 in patients at rest, during stress, and at recovery. In Aim 2, we will compare mean PTFV1 in patients at the three time periods by participants who experience mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). Patients who experience MSIMI possibly have impaired left ventricular function that passively increases left atrial pressure and results in the abnormal substrate for AF to propagate. Aim 3 will determine if changes in PTFV1 during acute mental stress are associated with adverse cardiac events in this cohort after two years of follow-up. The goal of this study is to further evaluate left atrial abnormalities as a risk marker for AF during acute mental stress on a well-characterized cohort of patients with stable coronary artery disease. The proposed analyses will provide plausible evidence to link psychological stress with AF by using an experimental approach to study the effects of mental stress on atrial electrophysiology. Additionally, this research will improve our understanding of the role acute mental stress plays in the development of atrial arrhythmias by identifying those who are likely to develop adverse atrial remodeling and improve our understanding of AF susceptibility."
"9394202","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Screening is effective in reducing CRC mortality through the early detection of cancers as well as CRC incidence through the detection and removal of precancerous adenomatous polyps (adenomas). Colonoscopy is the most utilized CRC screening test in the US with an estimated 10 million performed annually. Unfortunately, up to 20% of procedures are incomplete due to inadequate bowel cleanliness, which is associated with missed neoplastic lesions, prolonged procedure duration, and higher complication rates. Despite the high incidence of incomplete colonoscopies due to inadequate bowel cleanliness (~2 million per year) and the potential down-stream consequences, there are limited data on the management of these patients and a paucity of guidelines to help clinicians. The optimal timing of rescreening following an incomplete colonoscopy is unknown, and it is unclear if patients should repeat screening colonoscopy or whether screening with a stool-based test would yield similar outcomes. The goal of the proposed research is to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) by identifying the optimal management strategy for patients who undergo a screening colonoscopy that is limited by inadequate bowel preparation cleanliness. Specifically, we will incorporate bowel preparation quality into an existing microsimulation model - the Simulation Model of CRC (SimCRC) -- and then evaluate the comparative effectiveness of alternative management strategies for patients who undergo a screening colonoscopy that is limited by inadequate bowel preparation. The management strategies will include repeating colonoscopy at varying intervals (e.g. 1, 3, 5, or 10 years) and switching to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), a stool-based test which does not require any bowel preparation and may have better adherence rates. We will evaluate health outcomes over a 10-year and lifetime horizon. The findings from the proposed research will inform future management recommendations for the large number of patients who undergo a screening colonoscopy limited by a less than optimal bowel preparation and serve as a basis for a future R01 application that tests the dominant strategies in clinical trials."
"9404584","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cardiovascular Sciences Training Program (CSTP) at the University of Chicago provides both pre- doctoral and post-doctoral training. The postdoctoral trainees who participate in the CSTP include both M.D. and Ph.D. trainees. The M.D. trainees are physician scientists most commonly recruited from the Cardiology Fellowship Program at the University of Chicago, and the Ph.D. trainees have received their graduate degrees in diverse areas and seek additional training in the cardiovascular sciences. The CSTP also supports predoctoral training, an element essential to this integrated training program. The postdoctoral training strikes a balance between clinically-trained M.D. fellows who plan careers combining research with clinical medicine, and outstanding Ph.D. fellows who are dedicated to cardiovascular research. The CSTP offers training in six core components: 1) Molecular Cardiology, 2) Genetics/genomics, 3) Development and stem cell biology, 4) Imaging and Translational Biology, 5) Systems Biology, and 6) Vascular & Inflammation. Each of these areas has as its scientific mission furthering our understanding of cardiovascular function in health and disease. To this end, participants in this training program receive didactic, laboratory-based, ethics, and analytic training in order to prepare for careers in cardiovascular research. We propose to continue supporting 3 pre-doctoral and 6 post-doctoral trainees. The range of experience for the post-doctoral trainees ranges from 0 to 6 years of post-doctoral training since M.D. fellows have often completed postgraduate medical training at the time they begin in full time research in the CSTP. In the last training period, we emphasized programs in genetic and genomics reflecting the growth in these fields and their successful application to the cardiovascular sciences. We also enriched training opportunities in regenerative sciences since important advances have been made for cardiac and vascular biology in this area. In this next interval, we have additionally enlisted trainers with accomplishments in systems biology and analysis responding to needs to take better advantage of emerging and existing big data and the expertise on the University of Chicago campus. Systems analysis will be integrated with cardiac genetics and development and regeneration biology, since these topics are critical to define the normal and abnormal function of the heart."

This is an area of enormous public health importance, as depression occurs in about 50% of individuals who have sustained a TBI, leading to high rates of long-term disability and significantly impeding recovery and rehabilitation. The training goals of this career development award are for the candidate to 1) acquire expertise in MDD in individuals with moderate to severe TBI, which includes greater understanding of the neurobiology of TBI; assessment of depression in TBI; assessment of neuropsychological functioning; and 2) become highly proficient in cognitive behavioral treatment development, which includes tailoring treatment to the needs of the population; developing advanced skills in biostatistics; and training in the responsible conduct of research. The stated objectives will be achieved through: 1) Resources at Massachusetts General Hospital, Spaulding Rehabilitation Network, and Harvard Medical School (HMS); 2) Expert mentorship from researchers in the Departments of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (Primary Mentor: Ross Zafonte, DO; Co-Mentor: Grant Iverson, PhD; Consultant: Denise Ambrosi, MS, CCC- SLP) and Psychiatry (Co-Mentors: Maurizio Fava, MD, Paola Pedrelli, PhD; Consultants: Kalo Tanev, MD, Lee Baer, PhD) at HMS, as well as the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine (Consultant: Charles Bombardier, PhD); 3) Targeted advanced coursework, seminars as well as supervised clinical experiences; and 4) Implementation of the proposed research project. The research component of this project will result in the development of a manualized cognitive behavioral intervention for MDD that has been adapted to account for the cognitive sequelae of TBI. The primary aims will be to develop the treatment manual following consultation with expert mentors and utilizing input from subjects and investigate the acceptability and tolerability of the intervention. Secondary aims will be to pilot test its potential efficacy for improving depression in patients with moderate to severe TBI and explore potential moderators and mediators of its effect. Results of this project will form the basis of an R01 grant application and will lay the foundation for a career-long research program focused on developing treatment protocols for depression after TBI and other neurological disorders. The candidate has demonstrated a strong commitment to a research career and excellence in her clinical and academic endeavors thus far. This research and training program will assist Dr. Fisher in making the transition to independent investigator and becoming an expert in rehabilitation psychology in an area with significant need and broad public health applications: the treatment of depression among individuals with TBI."
"9271694","The recent UNAIDS 90-90-90 guidelines set ambitious targets for scale-up of HIV treatment: ?By 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status?, 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART)?, 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression?.[1] Reaching these goals will require expansion of existing programs and implementation of new strategies. This proposed cost-effectiveness analysis will examine a novel test and treat strategy for achieving the first and second `90s' through early HIV diagnosis and rapid linkage to HIV care, including ART. This approach improves HIV detection through frequent testing using tests that detect both acute and established HIV infection as well as rapid linkage to HIV care through the use of peer health navigators. Our hypothesis is that early intervention (ART and risk reduction services), especially during acute HIV infection (AHI) when viral load is high, will be cost-effective due to lower health care costs and reduced HIV transmission among high-risk populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM). We test this hypothesis among MSM in Lima, Peru, where there is a concentrated epidemic with high rates of HIV. Our research in Lima indicates that identifying MSM with AHI is feasible and that there is a demand among MSM for such a testing program. Intervention effectiveness and cost data are available from the recently completed 4-year SABES study which followed over 2000 MSM with monthly testing for HIV RNA and antibodies to detect incident HIV infections shortly after acquisition. The SABES study used peer navigators to assure rapid linkage of HIV+ participants to care and same-day ART initiation. Our hypothesis is that increased detection of acute/early HIV infection and rapid linkage to HIV care and ART incurs fewer costs overall and improves health more than the current practice of semi-annual serologic HIV testing and patient referral to treatment centers. Moreover, the differences will be driven by HIV care costs avoided as well as longer and better quality lives. Aim 1. Model the transmission of HIV within the MSM population in Lima, Peru and estimate the number of new HIV infections averted through increased detection and rapid linkage to care of MSM with recently acquired HIV. Developing a detailed mathematical model of HIV transmission among MSM, parameterized with the data from SABES, will allow us to explore the population-level effectiveness of the intervention in scenarios of future expansion of ART and possible introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis. Aim 2. Estimate the cost-effectiveness of increased detection and rapid linkage to care of MSM with recently acquired HIV, detected during acute HIV infection, from the health system and patient perspectives. Aim 2A. Estimate the 10-year individual and health system costs with increased detection and rapid linkage to care of MSM with acute HIV. Aim 2B. Adjust predicted life years saved in Aim 1 for quality of life and estimate the cost per disability adjusted life-year averted compared to the national standard of care."

"9209325","Project Summary/Abstract Metabolic imaging using hyperpolarized (HP) 13C and 15N substrates offers the potential to monitor intermediary metabolism in tissues throughout the human body. HP-[1-13C]pyruvate is the molecule most widely used in HP studies, but there are several other TCA cycle intermediates that meet the requirements of a good metabolic imaging candidate probe. In this TR&D Project we propose to develop new 13C- and 15N-enriched compounds as reporters of tissue physiology and metabolism. We will apply these hyperpolarized sensors to measure important physiological parameters at sensitivity levels never before achieved by MRI. One of the main thrusts of this proposal is to develop HP-13C labeled mono-esters of TCA cycle intermediates to image whole-body glucose production because this could potentially have an enormous impact on development of new drugs to control glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patient populations. Thus, Aim 1 will focus on the design, synthesis and DNP hyperpolarization of monoesters of 13C-labeled TCA cycle intermediates such as [4-13C]oxaloacetate-1-ethyl ester, [4-13C]malate-1-ethyl ester, and [1-13C]-2-ketoglutarate-4-ethyl ester. The 13C-enriched carbon in these molecules should display long T1 values and these derivatives should enter hepatocytes quickly via mono-carboxylate transporters and hydrolyze to their respective dicarboxylate intermediates. 15N is another attractive nucleus for the design of HP-probes but its potential for metabolic imaging has largely remained unexplored. In Aim 2 novel 15N- labeled molecular design platforms are proposed that will yield HP-15N-agents for imaging pH and free Zn2+-levels in zinc-rich tissues.. Considering the fact that HP-[1-13C]pyruvate is the most popular molecule of choice for metabolic MR imaging, in Aim 3, a practical chemical approach will be developed to produce gram quantities of HP-[1-13C]pyruvate by starting with an ester of pyruvate and para-H2. If we are successful, this would make HP-[1-13C]pyruvate more widely available to MRI clinics across the country for molecular imaging of cancer and other metabolic diseases. The overarching goal of this core project is to develop and implement novel hyperpolarized agents in vivo to image important biomarkers and metabolic pathways in type 2 diabetes, cancer and other diseases."
"9241775","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies with a notoriously dismal prognosis and is the 4th leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Unfortunately, 80- 85% patients are diagnosed with unresectable, incurable advanced stage tumors putting the median survival at <6 months and the overall 5-year survival at <5%. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve the dismal outcome in PDAC patients. PDAC is characterized by a robust desmoplastic reaction. Desmoplastic reaction endows PDAC with a unique microenvironment that promotes tumor growth, metastasis and resists tumor cells to chemotherapy, collectively resulting in a dismal prognosis. Hence, new treatment strategies are urgently needed to inhibit desmoplasia where nanotechnology could play a pivotal role. Although the mechanism is still not clear and slowly emerging, a number of PCC/PSC secreted factors are recognized to play critical roles facilitating bidirectional crosstalk between PCCs and PSCs that promotes desmoplasia. We demonstrate in the preliminary data that AuNP inhibits proliferation of both PCCs and PSCs and efficiently disrupts the PCC-PSC crosstalk by reducing secretion of a number of critical factors. Therefore, AuNP provides potential opportunities to improve the dismal prognosis in PDAC by simultaneously inhibiting multiple pathways involved in desmoplasia. We also demonstrate in the preliminary data that an AuNP-based targeted drug delivery system efficiently targets and inhibits proliferation of both PCCs and PSCs exploiting overexpression of EGFR in these cells. Since the overproduction of ?-SMA positive PSCs which sometimes account for ~90 % of the total fibrotic mass, depletion of both PSCs and PCCs by AuNP-based targeted drug delivery system is expected to reduce the extent of cross talk and cut down the formation of the huge fibrotic tissue. Decrease in fibrotic mass will allow better drug penetration and delivery, thereby increasing drug sensitivity. Furthermore, nanoconjugates having higher circulation time will soak the fibrotic mass for a longer duration and hence penetrate more efficiently into the fibrotic tissue. Therefore, in the present proposal, we will use a two-pronged approach; 1) disrupting PCC-PSC crosstalk by gold nanoparticle alone and understanding the molecular mechanism, and 2) depleting both PCC and PSC by an AuNP-based targeted drug delivery system to inhibit desmoplasia. We will use three specific aims to accomplish these objectives; Aim 1: Interrogating disruption of PCC-PSC crosstalk by gold nanoparticles; Aim 2: Disrupting PCC-PSC cross-talk tuning pharmacokinetics of a targeted drug delivery system; Aim 3: Improving gemcitabine therapy by reprogramming tumor microenvironment by gold nanoparticle.  After decades of ineffective therapeutic strategies against the epithelial component in PDAC, it is only recently realized that the massive stromal tissue is not an innocent bystander but plays critical roles in PDAC progression. Bidirectional crosstalk between PSC and PCC is considered to be the key molecular event that drives desmoplasia. No effective therapeutic strategy currently exists to disrupt PCC-PSC crosstalk. Therefore, the two pronged approach, as proposed in this application, of disrupting PCC-PSC crosstalk (signaling blockade) and abrogating the key components participating in desmoplasia, namely PCCs and PSCs (cellular blockade) is thus highly innovative and provides an exciting opportunity to enhance therapeutic efficacy in PDAC. Successful completion of the aims proposed will help to understand the molecular mechanism of desmoplasia, provide a new and innovative way to inhibit it, and device new therapeutic strategies to enhance drug sensitivity that will inhibit tumor growth, metastasis and improve prognosis in PDAC where practically no effective therapy is currently available."

"9204735","Project Summary/Abstract: Trace Elements (TE) Shared Resource  The Trace Element (TE) Shared Resource is a specialized facility dedicated to determining trace element  concentration, and form of trace elements, in a wide variety of biological and environmental media. The  chemistry of inorganic elements inextricably is linked with the study of cancer. Whether determining the fate  and effects of known carcinogens (such as arsenic), the potential antagonistic effects of elements (such as  selenium), or the therapeutic effects of platinum or Fe nanoparticles, there is a clear need for routine advanced  trace element analytical methods to support cancer research. The critical nature of these services for the  Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) research program has led to designation of TE as an NCCC-supported  Shared Resource and to a request for future CCSG funding. In the TE core, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass  Spectrometry (ICP-MS) methodologies have been developed to provide analysis of trace metals in solids,  solution, blood, and toenails. TE services include arsenic speciation in solutions, mercury speciation in  solution, and ICP-MS tuning and operation for routine analysis. There have been notable examples of cancer  research using TE resources. For example, the TE core developed innovative methods for determining  Arsenic species in rice, juice, and toddler formulae. Also TE-developed spatial analyses show the distribution  of a trace element within tissue sections, which is determined 'in situ' at pre-determined resolution, creating a  2-dimensional elemental image map from biological thin sections using laser ablation-ICP-MS. Using this  technology, the TE core developed methods for detecting Fe, Cu, and Zn in rat brain sections. Analytical  expertise is provided by the TE Core Director and a staff consisting of a PhD level scientist and an advanced  Research Technician. The TE core has collaborated with NCCC researchers in 5 of the NCCC Programs  (Cancer Epidemiology, Cancer Mechanisms, Molecular Therapeutics, Cancer Imaging & Radiobiology, and  Immunology & Cancer Immunotherapy) to determine the concentration or form of trace elements in biological  samples."
"9392809","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, or IPF, is a terminal disease affecting as many as 500,000 Americans with no FDA-approved therapies capable of stopping disease progression. The disease is characterized by excessive assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM) by activated fibroblasts termed `myofibroblasts'. Recently, studies have demonstrated that tissue mechanics, specifically tissue stiffness resulting from myofibroblasts assembly of ECM and contraction, is capable of driving the differentiation of myofibroblasts and thus disease progression. In short, myofibroblasts are capable of recruiting more myofibroblasts leading to a disease that progresses unchecked. Despite these recent findings we still do not understand how the process is initiated, nor do we have any therapies that effective halt disease progression. In the current research proposal we hypothesize that an emergent fibroblast subpopulation displays dysregulated mechanotransductive phenotypes due to an inability of these cells to sense the stiffness of their environment. These fibroblasts are thus capable of assembling and contracting the ECM, like myofibroblasts, even in soft environments, thus skewing the matrix from normal to pro-fibrotic. We propose to define the aberrant phenotypes, identify the molecular mechanism, and propose a novel approach toward the normalization of aberrant fibroblast mechanotransduction. We will use a host of cell sources from human to mouse, model ECMs from purely synthetic to human disease-derived, and animal models of disease along with advanced biophysical and cell biological assays to complete the project. The research proposed in this application is significant not only in terms of its potential impact on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of IPF, but also in its impact on our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the transition from normal wound healing to fibrotic progression within the lung."
"9208428","Gastrointestinal Malignancies Program Project Summary / Abstract The overarching goals of the Program are to prevent, detect early, and manage more accurately and effectively the treatment of GI malignancies. The Program will take full advantage of cutting-edge genomic technologies to identify genetic and epigenetic changes that are important in initiation and progression of GI cancers, as well as their response to therapy. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of GI malignancies, the Program had historically emphasized pancreatic and colorectal cancers, two of the four leading causes of US cancer deaths. However, with the expanding expertise and accomplishments of the Program in the other GI cancers during the previous funding period, the Program has intensified efforts in hepatobiliary, esophagogastric, and neuroendocrine tumors. The program has 95 members, representing seven DF/HCC institutions and 12 academic departments. In 2014 peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $5.9 million in total costs from the NCI and $5.3 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, Gastrointestinal Malignancies Program members published 2,003 cancer-relevant papers. Of these 33% were inter-institutional, 24% were intra-programmatic, and 45% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members. Overall, when counted once, 27% of DF/HCC publications were inter- programmatic collaborations."
"9204752","Project Summary/Abstract: Immunology and Cancer Immunotherapy (ICI)  The overall goal of the Immunology and Cancer Immunotherapy (ICI) Program is to unite the efforts of basic  and clinical immunologists to explore the immune system's impact on cancer development and progression, to  develop novel strategies that use immunity to treat cancer, and to conduct clinical trials to test novel  therapeutics and approaches to improve patient outcomes and increase overall survival. There are twenty-one  members from six different academic departments and two professional schools. The current focus and  initiatives of the ICI scientists are centered on three themes: Immune regulation, Immune effector  mechanisms, and Translational immunotherapy. The immunotherapy approaches are focused on adoptive  T cell therapy, vaccination, and immune regulation blockade. While basic research is a key focus, many faculty  members actively are involved in translational bench-to-bedside research. Other members are clinicians  (hematologists, oncologists or oncologic surgeons) who actively are involved in clinical research and clinical  trials. This program joins established and experienced clinical trialists with NCI-funded cancer immunologists to  design, execute, and complete Dartmouth-initiated immunotherapy trials in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma,  glioblastoma, colorectal carcinoma, multiple myeloma and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. There are  extensive collaborations between ICI members around common areas of interest in immunobiology and  immunotherapy, as evidenced by joint publications and funded grants. Major contributions of the program to  the mission of the NCCC have been the facilitation of new insights into the tumor microenvironment and how  this is affected by leukocytes, the development of novel protein and cell therapies, the translation of Dartmouth  investigator ideas into clinical trials, and the accrual of patients to these trials. NCCC has made substantial  commitment to improving the depth and breadth of research and clinical translation of the ICI program through  support of shared resources, financial awards for new pilot grants, and strategic recruitment of new  investigators. More than 280 cancer-related articles have been published over the reporting period, with 46  (16%) appearing in high impact journals. Intra-programmatic publications (43=15%) involved 19 of our 22  members, and inter-programmatic publications (66=24%) involved 15 members. Total grant funding for the  program currently is $6.4M, of which $5.5M is peer-reviewed and $2.2M is from NCI."
"9402876","ABSTRACT Mechanical ventilation refers to the use of life-support technology to perform the work of breathing for patients suffering from respiratory failure. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are disproportionately older and suffer from multiple chronic conditions: Approximately half of these patients are older than 65, and half suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with a higher likelihood of death as a result of complications from ventilator associated conditions (VAC), the most lethal of which is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Approximately 10 to 20% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAP, and patients suffering from VAP are twice as likely to die compared to similar patients without VAP. In addition, approximately 80% of mechanically ventilated patients will develop delirium. Currently, most institutions take a one-size-fits-all ?bundled? approach to mitigate ventilator associated complications. This wastes healthcare resources on patients who will not benefit while simultaneously denying additional potentially life-saving resources from patients who are most likely to benefit from vigorous prophylactic interventions. In this Phase 1 SBIR study, we will design models to predict with a high degree of accuracy which patients will likely develop VAC, VAP and delirium. Current care focuses on the disease (i.e., respiratory failure) as opposed to the patient. Our vision is to put this tool into the hands of hospital caregivers, which we will do during Phase 2 of this SBIR. Successful completion of the proposed work will alter the current bundled approach to the care of mechanically ventilated patients such that the care becomes tailored to the needs of each individual patient. Furthermore, this work will facilitate the early application of targeted prevention interventions to reduce the frequency of VAC, pneumonia and delirium in mechanically ventilated patients, thus improving patient outcomes. Finally, the developed models will provide critical prognostic information for providers and patients, facilitating shared decision-making and care planning."
"9235260","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tumors are embedded into a surrounding microenvironment that consists of extracellular matrix and non- malignant body cells. The microenvironment strongly affects tumor progression by releasing factors that influence tumor growth, cancer stem cell function and metastasis. Identifying these factors and understanding their underlying molecular mechanism is crucial for the development of therapeutic approaches to treat cancer patients. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in breast cancer for many years and they have been considered as therapeutic targets to treat cancer patients. However, previous clinical cancer trials using synthetic small molecule inhibitors to interfere with MMP catalytic activity yielded disappointing results. My postdoctoral research has now shown that MMPs such as MMP3 may work in a non-proteolytic manner through their hemopexin domain. This may explain why compound inhibitors targeting the catalytic function of MMPs failed to improve disease outcome. In this proposal, I will explore the molecular mechanism underlying the role of MMP3 in breast cancer and ask whether the MMP3 hemopexin domain may serve as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.         During the mentored phase, I will learn how to utilize mouse models to study breast cancer stem cells as well as methods to monitor the Wnt signaling pathway to investigate the function of MMP3 in breast cancer. During my postdoc, I have established that MMP3 modulates the Wnt signaling pathway by binding and inactivating Wnt5b via the hemopexin domain and that this plays an important role in stem cell maintenance during normal homeostasis of the mammary epithelium. I will use the skills I learn during the mentored phase to determine whether this interaction of MMP3 with Wnt5b also affects breast cancer progression. In particular I will employ lentiviral transduction, transplantation of mammary epithelial cells, mouse models of breast cancer in combination with tools to monitor Wnt signaling to address whether (1) MMPs regulate breast cancer stem cells through Wnt signaling, and whether (2) non-canonical Wnt signaling mediated by Wnt5b is involved in the regulation of stem cells during normal homeostasis and in breast cancer.         These projects will provide the rationale to ask whether my results can be translated into possible therapeutic application by specifically targeting the MMP3-hemopexin domain. This will be the goal of aim 3 during the independent phase of this grant. These experiments include lentiviral overexpression of only the hemopexin domain in normal mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cell lines to test whether the hemopexin domain is sufficient for tumor initiation and progression. I will also specifically target the hemopexin domain using antibodies or small compound inhibitors. Taken together, these studies will expand our knowledge about the regulation of stem cell biology in normal homeostasis and in cancer. My results can explain why previous clinical trials using MMP compound inhibitors targeting the catalytic, but not the hemopexin domain of MMPs, performed poorly in treating cancer patients. Ultimately, this may provide the rationale for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat patients suffering from breast cancer."
"9322641","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to develop the candidate, Dr. Zachary Adams, into an independent investigator prepared to lead large-scale, rigorously designed studies evaluating the utility of mobile health (mHealth) technologies in improving treatment efficiency, efficacy, and reach among high-risk youth with substance use disorders (SUD) and comorbid mental illness. Comorbidity is common in adolescence and often complicates treatment progress. Use of mHealth approaches-such as mobile applications that tailor content to patients' specific needs, enhance patient engagement, and facilitate existing evidence-based treatments-holds great promise in reducing the public health burden of addiction and mental illness. This application proposes training and Stage IA-IB intervention development research that is directly in line with NIDA-supported initiatives and represents a logical progression from the candidate's prior research and training to address career development goals in six areas: (1) development of mobile applications for adolescent mental health, (2) etiology and treatment of comorbid SUD and trauma-related mental illness in adolescents, (3) conduct and evaluation of clinical trials, (4 multilevel and longitudinal data analysis, (5) grant management, and (6) research ethics. Goals will be accomplished through high caliber didactic training, participation in national conferences and institutes, and hands-on research experience. Activities will be completed under the mentorship of an accomplished team of expert on-site investigators in the fields of adolescent comorbidity and integrated treatments (Danielson), mHealth methodologies and evaluation (Treiber), technology-based mental health interventions (Ruggiero), [qualitative and mixed methods research (Pope)], and analysis of longitudinal, clinical trials data (Ramakrishnan). The candidate will apply these skills through completion of a three-component research project: (I) initial design and programming of a novel web-based mobile application to enhance outpatient treatment for comorbid SUD and posttraumatic stress disorder, (II) mixed method usability testing of the application by adolescents and providers to guide design and content refinements, and (III) a pilot trial to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the application to guide design of an randomized controlled efficacy trial. An iterative, patient- and provider- centered development process will be employed to ensure relevance to the target population. The central hypothesis is that developmentally tailored mobile applications that incorporate evidence-based treatment principles can facilitate increased patient engagement in and between sessions, thus improving the efficiency, efficacy, and reach of treatments for this highly vulnerable population. After completing these projects, there will be a better understanding of how mHealth approaches can be used to augment existing treatments for comorbid SUD and mental illness. The experience, and data gained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to build this line of researc and to adapt and test future mHealth tools for adolescent substance abuse and mental health problems."
"9341704","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon pruning or degeneration occurs widely during development, as part of axonal rearrangements following injury and in adult plasticity, and is a major pathological feature of most neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate and execute axon degeneration in these diverse settings remain incompletely understood. Recently, we identified a caspase-dependent pathway that regulates axon degeneration both in vitro and in vivo. These findings have provided a new entry point for determining the molecular components that regulate axon degeneration. This proposal is focused on identifying key components of the biochemical pathway of caspase-dependent axon degeneration that lead to degeneration in the developing and diseased peripheral nervous system. We will use complementary approaches to (i) rapidly screen mice mutant for various pathway components to determine which ones regulate degeneration of developing sensory and motor axons in response to trophic deprivation in vitro, (ii) identify additional components of the degeneration pathway through biochemical analysis and siRNA screening, (iii) elucidate mechanisms of caspase regulation (iv) determine the contribution of the apoptotic pathway to developmental axon pruning in vivo, and (v) test for disease relevance by crossing relevant mutants to a mouse model of sensory axon degeneration. These studies will identify novel mechanisms regulating developmental and pathological axon degeneration, including potential therapeutic targets."

"9254241","Open Resource CRISPR/CAS9 Genome-Wide sgRNA Library Screening Platform. ABSTRACT  CRISPR technology made its giant leap from bacteria to mammalian system when a few landmark discoveries that demonstrated Cas9 protein from Streptococcus Pyogenes could be reprogrammed with synthetic RNAs (sgRNAs) to generate site-specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vitro and in mammalian cells. CRISPR technology appealed to the world of genomics and gene editing as it made the task of generating large genome-editing libraries possible for functional genetic screens. Although there has been a tremendous increase in CRISPR related publications over the last two years in many areas of drug discovery and gene-function analysis, it is already being recognized by the scientific community that the application of the technology to high throughput functional genomics screening comes with its own unique challenges and a significant improvement is warranted. As research in this field focuses on improving effectiveness, increasing selectivity and reducing off- target effects, companies aim to develop simplified, flexible, robust and cost-effective CRISPR screening platforms, incorporating all of the above with experimental and bioinformatics tools for data validation and integration of this information into operational cell-based models.  CRISPR technology can be used to either achieve sgRNA directed gene knockout by Cas9 endonuclease (CRISPR-KO) or sgRNA directed regulation of gene expression by mutant dCas9 (CRISPRa for transactivation, CRISPRi for inhibition). While published studies have provided proof that both CRISPR-KO and CRISPRa/i can be successfully used in high-throughput functional genomics screens, substantial margins of improvements do exist in multiple aspects of the technology. Additionally, although the CRISPR system has opened many potential avenues for improving the drug discovery process, those remain only potential opportunities until we develop robust commercially available CRISPR screening technologies, as well as experimental and bioinformatics tools for data validation and integration of this information into operational cell-based models. Following the successful completion of Phase I studies, in the present Phase II application we propose the final development and commercialization of a high performance CRISPR screening platform with innovative features enhancing the frequency of effective gene knockout in CRISPR-KO applications, and the intensity of promoter activation/repression in CRSPRa/i. As supporting tools, we will provide protocols, reagents and software tools for screening data analysis and validation.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop, validate and commercialize a set of high efficiency, ready- to-screen, genome-wide pooled sgRNA human and mouse CRISPR lentiviral libraries, supporting bioinformatics tools for data analysis, as well as custom services for CRISPR library design, CRISPR functional genetic screening, and hit confirmation/validation assays. Upon completion of the proposed Phase II studies, Cellecta will be ready to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive, highly efficient, scalable and cost- effective genetic screening tool set that is expected to expedite systematic identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention and facilitate the development of highly specific drugs, biomarkers and novel therapeutic concepts.

"9264317","Two-stage miRNA delivering scaffolds for patient-originated cells to regenerate blood vessels There are about 1.4 million arterial bypass operations annually in the US, but many patients who require arterial bypass procedures do not have suitable vessels for use. Although synthetic materials are frequently used to treat vascular disease, their failure rate, especially in replacing small-diameter vessels, remains high. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have enormous potential for the repair of diseased or traumatized blood vessels. Indeed, we, among the first, have successfully induced iPSC differentiation to smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in culture and on biomimetic 3D scaffolds. However, it takes more than 2 months to generate patient- specific iPSCs and iPSC-derived SMCs and there is potential for oncogenesis. Provocatively, we have established a direct differentiation protocol for SMCs from patient fibroblasts using three determined factors. Also, we found that microRNA-10a (miR-10a) plays an important role in SMC differentiation and helps SMCs maintain the differentiated contractile phenotype. For SMC direct differentiation and future clinical application, an efficient non-viral vector is highly desired. Fortunately, we recently developed a novel hyperbranched polymer vector and a two-stage delivery system to highly efficiently deliver microRNAs and plasmids into cells in a temporally controlled manner. Our long-term goal is to regenerate functional human blood vessels using patient-originated fibroblasts. The key to functional blood vessel regeneration using fibroblasts is the in situ direct differentiation and maintenance of the contractile phenotype of the vascular SMCs. In this proposal, we hypothesize that sustained and highly efficient miRNA/plasmid delivery into fibroblasts and SMCs on a 3D nanofibrous scaffold will regenerate a contractile SMC-laden functional vascular graft. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Determine the mechanistic roles of miR-10a, HDAC4 and associated signaling pathways in fibroblast/SMC transdifferentiation; 2) Develop anatomically-designed nanofibrous scaffolds using a reverse 3D printing technology and immobilize sustained two-stage miRNA/plasmid delivery system on the scaffolds; 3) Evaluate engineered vascular scaffold in vitro and in vivo. By accomplishing these specific aims, we will improve mechanistic understandings of fibroblast/SMC transdifferentiation how to maintain the SMC contractile phenotype in the vascular scaffold and develop key miRNA/DNA delivery and 3D tissue engineering technologies to advance the therapeutic utility of patient-originated cells for human vascular regeneration."
"9174383","GIFT: Web Based Resourcefulness Training for Grandmother Caregivers The number of grandparent-headed homes has increased over the past two decades, primarily due to parental drug use leading to family instability, and an increase in multigenerational homes due to continuing effects of the economic downturn in 2008 and sustained unemployment and underemployment. Most grandmothers living with grandchildren report elevated stress and strain and are at risk of depression and poorer overall health than their non-caregiving peers. Stress and depressive symptoms can have a cascading effect on the family, creating an increased risk for problems in family functioning. The presence of positive coping skills, such as resourcefulness, may reduce or moderate the negative effects of caregiving and family-related stress on the well-being of the grandmother and her family. We have shown that face-to-face resourcefulness training in older adults, including grandmothers, improves both mental and physical health. The purpose of this study is to extend our previous face-to-face resourcefulness intervention to a web-based format focused on grandmothers who are either raising grandchildren or living in multigenerational homes and helping with their care, and to test its effects on health in this randomized clinical trial. The web-based online intervention, Grandmother Initiatives in Family Transformation (GIFT), tests online resourcefulness training with reinforcement of the resourcefulness skills through 4 weeks of structured journaling, against a 4 week online, unstructured journaling-only group. In this two-group randomized trial, we will randomly assign a national, convenience sample of 334 grandmothers to GIFT resourcefulness training (n=167) or the 4 week unstructured journal-only group (n=167). Specific Aims are to determine 1) whether the 4-week GIFT intervention with structured journal reinforcement versus the 4-week unstructured journal-only group improves grandmothers' mental health and physical health and family well-being over time; 2) if a) problem solving/coping (resourcefulness), b) resources (subjective and instrumental social support), and c) situational appraisals (appraised stress, appraised reward, and depressive cognitions) mediate the relationships between GIFT and individual and family outcomes at 2 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks post-intervention; and 3) if a) grandmother demographics (age, race, education, marital status, employment status, family income, age and number of grandchildren in the household), b) caregiving status to grandchildren, and c) family demands (intra- family strains) moderate the relationship between the intervention and the outcomes in Aims 1 and 2. Repeated measures and structural equation modeling will be used to analyze these data, with content analysis of the journals to evaluate enactment fidelity and to uncover additional strategies used by grandmother caregivers. Given the limited interventions available to this group of women, an intervention that transcends time and place and is available 24 hours a day is expected to bolster the personal and social resourcefulness of grandmothers living with grandchildren, leading to improvements in grandmother and family well-being."
"9404558","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is strong evidence linking lifestyle and behavioral risk factors with a range of cancers. There is also strong evidence that lifestyle change and widespread intervention can reduce the population burden of cancer. The number of individuals affected by cancer continues to grow as the U.S. population ages, and disparities in cancer incidence and mortality remain by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and geography, thus this is a critical time to place emphasis on training investigators in cancer prevention and control research that can reach multiple groups within a population. Increasingly, our health promotion goals cannot be achieved by working within a single discipline. Thus, in this new application for T32 funding, we propose the Postdoctoral Training Program in Cancer Prevention and Control Research. Our overall goal is to provide an individualized transdisciplinary postdoctoral training experience to scholars interested in establishing careers in cancer prevention and control research. Our application funding comes at a time when we have demonstrated preliminary success in recruiting, retaining, and training successful researchers, and will allow us to sustain and expand our program by leveraging institutional resources and grants such as our Transdisciplinary Research in Energetics and Cancer (TREC) Center, and our Community Networks Program Center, the Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities, both of which included training elements. The TREC External Advisory Board has been a critical asset in forming and refining our program elements, so we are well prepared for this T32. Our training program includes structured elements including individual development plans, mentored research experiences, and customizable didactic training opportunities. Our innovative training also includes a transdisciplinary journal club, career development programming, and training in communicating with media and lay audiences. Washington University School of Medicine offers a rich environment for trainees, and our transdisciplinary training in cancer prevention and control offers a unique resource to the university environment. Support through this T32 mechanism will allow us to continue to train PhD and MD scientists to conduct transdisciplinary research and lead the next generation of cancer prevention and control researchers."

"9210330","Summary: Allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation (HSCT) is an effective treatment for AML. Relapse of the malignancy remains the major cause of treatment failure and improved strategies to eradicate leukemia are required. Natural killer (NK) cells are a unique class of lymphocytes, with cytotoxic, and immunoregulatory function which can mediate potent antileukemia effects against myeloid leukemias while simultaneously preventing GVHD in preclinical models. Relatively few NK cells are present in peripheral blood or bone marrow transplant cell products and the NK cells recovering early post transplant have functional defects impairing cytotoxicity. We have developed robust clinical procedures for the ex vivo expansion and activation of cord blood (CB)-derived NK cells. The long-tem objective of this research is to develop novel cell based therapies to harness the antileukemic potential of NK cells against AML, and to further enhance their effector function by both redefining their specificity and/or enhancing their potency Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that the addition of optimally selected, ex vivo expanded and activated CB-derived NK cells will improve the outcomes of patients with AML after cord blood transplantation (CBT). We have found that patients with AML whose HLA type is homozygous for group C2 have a significantly higher risk of relapse following CBT compared to those who are homozygous or heterozygous for HLA group C1. Mechanistically, we have shown that the increased risk of disease progression in the C2/C2 risk group is related to delayed emergence of immunocompetent C2-specific KIR2DL1/S1+ NK cells post-CBT. This suggests that such patients would benefit from the post-CBT infusion of activated mature CB-NK cells that express KIR2DL1/S1. Extensive biologic correlates will examine the phenotype, function and homing of adoptively infused CB-NK cells, and their impact on immune reconstitution post-transplant. Aim 2 capitalizes on the finding that the baseline cytotoxicity of NK cells can be augmented by expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) against the target cells. CD123, the ? chain of the interleukin-3 receptor, is an attractive target for cellular immune therapy in AML, but cytotoxicity against normal hematopoietic cells would preclude safe delivery in the absence of HSCT. We will test the hypothesis that NK cells transduced with a CAR to CD123, and coexpressing CD28 and IL15 to mediate long term persistence, and inducible caspase 9 (IC9) to manage potential toxicity will provide enhanced activity against AML. Aim 3 examines if blocking the TGF-beta pathway by retrovirally transducing NK cells with a dominant negative TGF-beta type II receptor can render NK cells resistant to the immunosuppressive AML microenvironment. Optimal strategies formulated in aims 2 and 3 will be translated into human clinical trials, based on the optimal platform protocol determined in aim 1."
"9258881","PROJECT SUMMARY Spatial and temporal control of gene expression is crucial for the development of multicellular organisms. Improper gene expression leads to many abnormalities including developmental disorders and cancer. In addition to genetic information and chromatin structure, the three dimensional spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome within the nucleus significantly contributes to genome function. Critical to this organization is a developmentally essential architectural protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). CTCF exerts its insulator function by forming looping interactions between nonadjacent segments of DNA. CTCF binds to a highly conserved motif on DNA that is enriched at the borders of topologically associating domains (TADs), which are the building blocks of genome organization. Currently, we know neither how CTCF functions as a barrier between distinct chromatin domains, nor how it forms loops between distant loci. CTCF binding and function at many loci can be regulated in several ways; possibly through methylation of DNA, posttranslational modifications of CTCF, interactions with other proteins (i.e. cohesin), interactions with RNA, and multimerization of CTCF. Although CTCF constitutively binds to numerous loci across cell types, it can exert distinct functions depending on the cellular context. These variations cannot be explained by CTCF binding alone. CTCF can bind to the same regions in different cell types although it acts as a barrier in one cell type but not in the other. In our model system, a CTCF binding event within the HoxA cluster has no affect on transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), while it functions as a chromatin insulator upon differentiation into motor neurons (MNs). This suggests that CTCF binding is necessary, but not sufficient to mediate its insulation function. Rather, downstream regulatory events must be required to achieve specificity. These events could include modification to CTCF or association with secondary proteins, among other possibilities. Therefore, we hypothesize that CTCF interacts with other factors to function as an insulator. Here, we describe genetic and biochemical screens to identify factors that affect the ability of CTCF to perform its insulator function. Both approaches can independently reveal crucial factors for insulation function, which will be further analyzed to explain their mechanism of action. Ultimately, the proposed project will have an impact on gene regulation, with the results being fundamentally important for developmental and diseased processes such as developmental defects (i.e. human limb malformations), neurological disorders, and cancer."
"9189692","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Preventing youth tobacco use is a public health priority and critical to achieving our nation's cancer prevention goals. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently concluded that youth tobacco use prevention interventions in primary care settings are an important component of this effort, but highlighted a need for more research on smarter ways to integrate tobacco use prevention into our healthcare system. This study addresses this need by evaluating a novel, system-based intervention to improve youth tobacco control outcomes in pediatric primary care. We will determine if an Ask, Advise, Connect (AAC) intervention model that leverages health information technology and behaviorally-based tobacco control resources can improve population- and patient-level outcomes. The model relies on efficient tobacco use history-taking and intervention by pediatric primary care providers (e.g., medical assistants, nurses, physicians), paired with referral to freely accessible, evidence-based online tobacco prevention resources to deter and disrupt tobacco use uptake. By analyzing the pediatric outpatient workflow, we will evaluate how AAC intervention strategies can be seamlessly integrated, including electronic medical record prompts and brief behavioral counseling strategies to motivate patient adherence. We will assess the impact of the AAC intervention on population-level outcomes using system metrics to document provider assessment, patient education and guidance on tobacco use avoidance, and anti-smoking resource referral. We will also examine reach of the AAC intervention by capturing population-level metrics of resource use based on provider referral, and prospectively examine its effect on individual-level outcomes (e.g., susceptibility to tobacco use, tobacco use-related cognitions, skills to avoid tobacco use) among a subsample of patients. This AAC approach could be critical to promoting better and more sustainable youth tobacco control by strengthening the pediatric primary care system's technical expertise and workforce capacities to eradicate youth tobacco use. It is highly consistent with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in that it seeks to reduce the public health and societal burden of morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco use, and is fully aligned with National Cancer Institute tobacco control objectives in precision prevention of cancer risk."
"9245291","ABSTRACT  Allergen cross-linking of IgE bound to their cognate high affinity receptors on mast cells and basophils unleash a cascade of mediators that result in the wide array of allergic disease. Despite its central role, very little is known about the naturally occurring human IgE molecule. Most of our knowledge of the human antibody response to allergens has come from studies using polyclonal sera or inferred from murine mAbs. Until very recently, the generation of naturally occurring full-length human mAbs to a specific immunogen has been next to impossible. Here we employ a human B cell hybridoma method, immortalizing memory B cells through electrical cytofusion with a non-secreting myeloma partner, to generate for the first time ever, naturally occurring full-length human IgE mAbs. Our preliminary data shows that the frequencies of IgE producing memory B cells in the circulation of allergic patients are very low, averaging one per one hundred thousand B cells. Despite this, we are able to generate panels of human hybridomas that secrete full-length naturally occurring IgE antibodies. The patient's clinical information, serum total and specific IgE titers, is used to select samples that contain cells directed toward desired allergens - focusing on peanut and food allergens. Once a mAb is made, determination of fine allergen specificity will be carried out using Phadia in collaboration with Robert Hamilton at Johns Hopkins University. Each allergen-specific IgE mAb that is created will go through a gamut of tests in hopes of assembling panels of mAbs for ultimate use in functional studies with specific allergen proteins. Due to the paucity of available methods and reagents we developed an IgE-specific immunoaffinity chromatography protocol for purification of human IgE mAbs. Purified allergen-specific mAbs are tested in allergen competition assays to assemble them into groups reflecting antigenic sites. Stochiometry and binding kinetics of their interaction with natural allergen will be determined in detail.  The genetic and functional aspects of each allergen-specific IgE mAb will be evaluated. Antibody heavy and light chain sequences will be obtained to determine the germ-line usage, the degree of somatic hypermutation, and CDR length. This information will be used to generate isotype switch variant IgG mAbs. Finally, the kinetics of basophil degranulation will be fully evaluated for each functional IgE mAb pairing within a panel. Recombinant switch variant IgGs will be tested for their ability to antagonize allergen-specific basophil degranulation to quantify their therapeutic potential. We have created methods and began to generate and study for the first time panels of human hybridomas secreting naturally occurring allergen-specific IgE mAbs. The goal of this work is to improve upon our molecular understanding of the human IgE antibody response, which will provide insights needed for the design of better immunotherapies and allergy vaccines."

"9209328","Project Summary/Abstract There are two main objectives of this Core. First, we intend to provide training in the use of stable isotope technology within the BTRC for use by scientists and clinicians outside the BTRC. The goal is to expand the general knowledge of how to use stable isotopes for investigation of metabolic questions in intact tissues and patients. Much of the technology, once understood, is easily transferred to most university and medical school settings in the United States. Second, we intend to disseminate the results of the work described in the TR&D projects to the clinical and scientific community. The goal is to make physicians and biomedical scientists aware of the capabilities of the technologies and to encourage use of the advances from the BTRC. To achieve these goals, we propose four specific aims. Aim 1 is to continue to present a two-day Annual Symposium with a focus on magnetic resonance and metabolism. The first day will be refocused on training in technology and the second day will continue to present broader biological and clinical topics that are relevant to the technology developed in the BTRC. Aim 2 is to provide training tailored to the needs of visiting scientists, students, medical housestaff and subspeciality clinical fellows as necessary to allow investigators outside the BTRC to apply the technology to clinical problems. Aim 3 is to disseminate results and technologies via multiple strategies including a continued local Mini-Symposium for Undergraduates, continued participation in the NIH Isotope Course presented by the NIDDK, a newly proposed training course in 13C isotopomer and flux analysis at the World Molecular Imaging Congress, the web page and teaching in graduate courses. Aim 4 is to disseminate open source software designed for experiment planning, spectral analysis and metabolic fitting of 13C tracer experiments. Together, our training and dissemination activities provide a wide range of opportunities for investigators to learn to use stable isotopes for their studies in intermediary metabolism in patients and other systems."
"9226818","Chikungunya and dengue are important viral diseases that affect over 50 million people each year in the tropical and subtropical areas of the world. The chikungunya and dengue viruses evolved in non-human primates in the forests of Africa and Asia where forest mosquitoes maintained the viruses in a monkey-to-monkey (sylvatic) transmission cycle. It is only in the last few hundred years that the viruses began to infect people and their domestic and peri-domestic mosquitoes and be maintained in a human-to-human (urban) transmission cycle. A lot is known about the human mosquitoes that carry dengue and chikungunya and control programs have been developed to try and prevent and control infections. Unfortunately, there is little data on the roles wild non-human primates and their mosquitoes play in transmission cycles as they are mainly found in relatively remote areas which lack local infrastructure and facilities for research. On the small Caribbean island of St Kitts, however, there is a large population of wild African green monkeys which are ubiquitous and relatively easy to study. Also, the island is easily accessible and has very good infrastructure and research facilities for the study of dengue and chikungunya which both occur on St Kitts. To investigate the role African green monkeys on St Kitts may play in sylvatic and urban transmission cycles of chikungunya and dengue viruses we intend to trap mosquitoes from each of the five well demarcated ecosystems on the island over two years to determine the mosquitoes present and their temporal and spatial distribution patterns. Pools of the mosquitoes will be tested for the presence of dengue and chikungunya viruses to determine which species are infected and hence likely vectors, and also where on the island infections are most common. Blood meals from fed mosquitoes will be analyzed by PCR to determine the animal hosts on which the different mosquito species feed, in particular monkeys and people. African green monkeys from the five ecosystems on the island will be tested for antibodies against dengue and chikungunya viruses to determine the pattern of exposure on the island. Together, this information will indicate if the African green monkeys on St Kitts might be involved in sylvatic and urban transmission cycles of dengue and chikungunya viruses and whether non-human primates might be important in the epidemiology of dengue and chikungunya in other parts of the world, notably Africa, Asia and South America, where people live in close proximity to wild populations of non-human primates."

"9405059","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysphagia refers either to the difficulty with the initial phases of a swallow or to the sensation that foods and or liquids are somehow being obstructed in their passage from the mouth to the stomach. As many as 600,000 Americans are newly diagnosed with dysphagia each year, primarily as a result of neurological diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, muscular dystrophy, and cerebral palsy. Approximately 60-80% of patients with neurodegenerative disease are affected by dysphagia. Dysphagia is highly correlated with malnutrition and aspiration pneumonia, which result in poor quality of life and contributes significantly to increased morbidity and mortality. Current treatments for this debilitating and life-threatening condition ar limited to diet modifications (e.g., thickened liquids), behavioral adaptations (e.g., tucking the chin when swallowing), and other palliative interventions (e.g., feeding tubes) as efforts to extend survival. Despite being a major source of morbidity and mortality for a myriad of neurologic conditions, there are few treatment options for dysphagia. nUro, Inc. (nUro) - in collaboration with Dr. Teresa Lever (University of Missouri) - is developing implantable neurostimulation technology to provide a new treatment option for patients with dysphagia. The nUro technology targets the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN), which contains predominantly sensory nerve fibers that relay information about temperature, taste, and touch from the larynx and pharynx to the brain. Nerve signals traveling from the SLN to the brain contribute to the orchestration of the triggering, shaping, and timing of the sequential motor pattern of swallowing. We hypothesize that chronic SLN stimulation will selectively facilitate swallowing in patients with neurogenic dysphagia. The broad, long-term objective of this proposed research is to establish SLN stimulation as a novel and effective preventative/restorative treatment for dysphagia in ALS and other chronic neurological conditions that cause dysphagia-associated morbidity and mortality. The immediate goal of the proposed application is to optimize a protocol for chronic SLN stimulation in a mouse model of ALS. In this Phase 1 proposal, we will demonstrate the feasibility of chronic SLN stimulation therapy by investigating the efficacy of this innovative approach to maintain healthy swallowing function in a transgenic mouse model of ALS. By identifying the appropriate treatment parameters in unanesthetized, ambulatory mice (Specific Aim 1) and demonstrating that ALS-affected mice can maintain healthy swallowing function and survive significantly longer as a result of chronic SLN stimulation (Specific Aim 2), we will establish the feasibility necessary to begin investigation and development of a human therapy for dysphagia in ALS. Results will lay the groundwork for using chronic SLN stimulation for long-term management of dysphagia in patients with ALS and other chronic neurological conditions that cause dysphagia-associated morbidity and mortality."
"9376592","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing proteinuria slows the progression of chronic kidney disease. The current standard of care is to block of the renin - angiotensin system at various levels to reduce proteinuria. However, reduction of proteinuria is often incomplete, since other pathways involved in the pathogenesis or modification of proteinuria are not affected by this therapy. The long term goal of the PI's lab is to develop novel mechanism - based therapeutic agents that will reduce proteinuria and reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease due to glomerular disorders. Reducing the progression of chronic kidney disease to end stage kidney disease will have a major positive social and financial impact in the United States and worldwide. The PI's laboratory has discovered a major role of the circulating glycoprotein Angiopoietin-like-4 (Angptl4) in human and experimental nephrotic syndrome. Studies conducted by his team show that circulating Angptl4 is the first molecular link between proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypertriglyceridemia, three major components of nephrotic syndrome. In glomerular disease, increased Angptl4 secretion from skeletal muscle, heart, liver and adipose tissue occurs when proteinuria becomes moderate to severe (in the human context, when it reaches nephrotic range). Circulating Angptl4 reduces proteinuria by binding to glomerular endothelial ?v?5 integrin, while also inducing hypertriglyceridemia by inhibiting the activity of endothelium bound lipoprotein lipase. Further, it appears that this multi-organ upregulation of Angptl4 expression results from an increase in the plasma free fatty acid / albumin ratio. The PI has developed four new mutant forms of human Angptl4 protein that reduce proteinuria in rat models of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and diabetic nephropathy without significantly affecting plasma triglyceride levels. In Specific Aim 1, the relationship between elevated plasma free fatty acid / albumin ratio with increased peripheral organ Angptl4 expression in nephrotic syndrome will be investigated further using organ specific PPAR knockout mice. In Specific Aim 2, we will test whether administration of mutant human Angptl4 twice every month, or transgenic expression of rat Angptl4 from adipose tissue can reduce glomerulosclerosis and progression of chronic kidney disease in rats models of FSGS or diabetic nephropathy. In Specific Aim 3, mechanisms by which the interaction of circulating Angptl4 with glomerular endothelial ?v?5 integrin reduces proteinuria will be investigated."
"9187020","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a common disease of the optic nerve that affects over 60 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of blindness and visual disability in the United States. However, the biological pathways that lead to glaucoma are not well understood, and this has hindered efforts for early detection and treatment of this condition. Consequently, there is great need to clarify the causes of glaucoma at the molecular level. We discovered that duplication of the TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) gene is associated with glaucoma that occurs without elevation of eye pressure - termed normal tension glaucoma (NTG). TBK1 function hasn't been studied in the eye although TBK1 has been shown to have a role in autophagy in non-ocular tissue. Autophagy is a cellular process that delivers cytosolic proteins, organelles, and even intracellular pathogens to lysosomes for clearance. Remarkably, three known NTG genes (TBK1, OPTN, TLR4) all interact with each other and have important roles in activating autophagy, which suggests that autophagy may be an important common pathway in NTG pathogenesis. Moreover, autophagy has also been implicated in the retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve damage in animal models of glaucoma. Based on these data, we hypothesize that TBK1 gene duplication alters autophagy and leads to the retinal ganglion cell death and vision loss of NTG. We have created a unique set of resources to study TBK1, autophagy, and glaucoma: cultured retinal ganglion cells (using induced stem cell technology) that have an extra dose of the TBK1 gene - the same defect as our patients with TBK1-associated glaucoma. Preliminary studies of these cells have provided more evidence that duplication of TBK1 gene activates autophagy and causes glaucoma. To test our hypothesis and investigate the role of autophagy in glaucoma we propose this two-part aim: DETERMINE THE ROLE OF TBK1 GENE DUPLICATION AND AUTOPHAGY IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF NTG USING IPSC-DERIVED RGC-LIKE NEURONS ? Aim 1A: Test cells cultured from patients with NTG due to a TBK1 gene duplication (skin fibroblasts, iPSCs  and iPSC-derived RGC-like neurons) for altered autophagy molecules with microscopic, biochemical, and  autophagic flux assays. ? Aim 1B: Determine the effect of TBK1 gene duplication on the phosphorylation of its substrate OPTN at  key residues necessary for its function in autophagy with immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis  with anti-phospho-OPTN antibodies. With these experiments, we will begin to characterize the biological pathway by which defects in the TBK1 gene alter autophagy and lead to glaucoma. These studies will also provide the basis for development of novel glaucoma therapies that are targeted to autophagy and glaucoma that occurs without elevation of eye pressure."

"9231935","Project Summary/Abstract Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, uses its type III secretion system (T3SS) as a conduit through which effector proteins are shuttled from bacterial to host cell cytoplasm. Once injected, they subvert normal host functions and promote infection and defend against host immune responses. While much about T3SS function has been worked out, details of how the system assembly and activation are controlled are not well understood. Sequence homology between the Shigella protein Spa47 and known ATPases suggests that it may provide the necessary energy through ATP hydrolysis mechanisms. We hypothesized that Shigella use this ATPase to activate and control the T3SS and ultimately the ability to infect human host cells. This proposal describes recent developments that provided the first successful expression and purification of ATPase active Spa47 and biophysical characterization of the purified enzyme. These initial findings provided a strong platform for directed studies showing that Spa47 activation is controlled through the formation of an unprecedented T3SS ATPase homo-trimer that may be driven by the lack of an N-terminal sequence (shared by the Salmonella ATPase InvC) but otherwise conserved amongst T3SS ATPases. Additionally, experiments building on this knowledge identified the Shigella protein MxiN as a potent inhibitor of Spa47 activity, implicating it as a key regulatory component of the Shigella T3SS. To better understand the regulatory role of Spa47 in Shigella T3SS- associated infection and to define the traits of this potentially novel sub-class of T3SS ATPases, the specific aims of this study are to: 1) Use Shigella flexneri as a model system to unravel the relationship between Spa47 oligomerization, ATP hydrolysis activity, and T3SS-associated virulence. and 2) Characterize regulatory interactions between Spa47 and the newly identified Shigella T3SS regulatory protein MxiN. The proposed studies will employ an interdisciplinary approach to directly observe the effects of Spa47 within the context of Shigella as well as determine the influence of oligomerization and MxiN interaction on activation and regulation of the ATPase activity of Spa47. These findings will close a significant gap in the understanding of how an important class of human pathogens including Shigella and Salmonella control their virulence through appropriate timing of T3SS activation. Additionally, these studies will uncover mechanistic details of Spa47 activity that could lead to the development of compounds and methods for more efficiently treating infections by T3SS-expressing pathogens."
"9322673","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1988, the US Surgeon General concluded that tobacco products are addictive and nicotine is the main pharmacological agent in tobacco responsible for tobacco's addictive nature. Despite overwhelming evidence of the adverse health effects of smoking, it is estimated that 68.8 million Americans use tobacco products and 400,000 tobacco-related deaths occur in the United States each year. However, it is not completely understood why nicotine is addictive. One reason for this incomplete understanding of nicotine addiction may be that addiction is a complex disorder with many factors contributing to the disease. Possible factors that may contribute to nicotine addiction include long-lasting change in learning and long-lasting changes in the synaptic plasticity that underlies learning. Studies suggest that initially nicotine enhances learning but with continued use tolerance develops and deficits in learning emerge when administration ceases. The limbic area of the brain is involved in both learning and addiction and thus the effects of nicotine in this area may mediate cognitive influences on addiction. It is the hypothesis of this proposal that nicotine alters the function of the hippocampus during learning, producing a learned state that is different from learning in the absence of the drug, and that this learning may involve different patterns of cell signaling and gene activation than those activated during comparable learning without drug. The ability of nicotine to alter learning processes and the underlying neural function may facilitate addiction by contributing to withdrawal-related deficits in learning and the formation of long-lasting drug-associated memories that could precipitate craving and relapse even after long periods of abstinence. In support of this, acute nicotine has been shown to enhance a long-lasting form of contextual fear conditioning, a type of classical conditioning that involves the hippocampus but withdrawal from chronic nicotine disrupts this learning. Long-term memory storage is known to involve alteration in gene expression, and the proteins encoded by these induced genes, such as mitogen activate protein kinases (MAPK), result in long-lasting changes in neuronal function; recent evidence suggests that nicotine and learning interact to alter signaling through the MAPK pathway. Proposed experiments will identify the neural substrates that underlie the effects of nicotine on hippocampus-dependent learning, identify the specific role of hippocampal subregions in the effects of nicotine on learning, and identify the downstream targets of MAPK mediating the changes in synaptic plasticity involved in the effects of nicotine on learning. Investigating the effects of nicotine on learning from the behavioral level to changes in cell signaling will enhance understanding of addiction and aid in therapeutic development for nicotine addiction."

While the Training Program's Core Faculty is comprised primarily of clinician-scientists and basic biomedical researchers in the Department of Pathology, trainees also are encouraged to avail themselves of a wide spectrum of opportunities afforded by research mentors/laboratories in Harvard-affiliated research/medical center institutions (e.g., The Broad Institute, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Trainees are selected from a national pool of applicants, via a proactive recruitment process, and the Program's emphasis is on tailoring a research training experience to fit a given candidate's background, scientific interests and career goals. The overarching scientific principle is one of translational molecular pathology - the probing of disease mechanisms at a fundamental mechanistic level that yields new insights that can be translated into targeted treatments for diverse diseases and, ultimately, their prevention."
"9361100","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The work proposed in this application aims to continue the maintenance, expansion, validation and dissemination of the SPHARM-PDM (SPherical HARMonics Point Distributed Models) shape analysis toolbox. Shape analysis is of high interest to the biomedical sciences due to its potential to precisely locate morphological changes in pathological structures. SPHARM-PDM is a successful and popular open-source software tool that has been used by the biomedical research community to analyze the morphology of anatomical structures. Most of the existing shape analysis packages lack of integration with publicly available segmentation software tools and are very complicated to use in general. These are the main reasons why shape analysis studies have been performed mainly by larger labs or through close collaboration with computer scientists that specialize in shape analysis. With this proposal we look into maintaining the core functionalities that made of SPHARM-PDM a successful toolbox, as well as into providing a close integration with important segmentation packages and dramatically extending the toolbox into a general shape analysis toolbox (Shape AnaLysis Toolbox, SALT). New methodologies will provide support for objects of non-spherical topology, skeletal models, four-dimensional (4D) models, and study-specific optimal model correspondence. All new methodologies of SALT will be then tested using three application case scenarios to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed new functionalities and to provide an illustration of usability and best practices for the user community. In parallel with th major development and maintenance efforts, we will continue providing excellent documentation, community resources, and user support."
"9387297","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to continue our longstanding cardiopulmonary research training efforts at the University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Center Campus. This program trains individuals with doctoral degrees in either biological or medical sciences for successful academic careers in cardiopulmonary research and teaching. A multidisciplinary approach to both mentoring and research training is emphasizing the integration of studies at the molecular, cellular, tissue organ, and physiological (whole animals or human subjects) levels to permit rapid bench-to-bedside translation of the work performed. We have expanded the focus of the training program in this submission to include access to expertise in Bioengineering, Regenerative Medicine, Genomics, and Child-Maternal Health. This expanded focus will enable us to involve outstanding programs and investigators whose work is directly related to Cardiopulmonary Biology. Of the many training grants at the University of Colorado, this is the only one specifically dedicated to pulmonary vascular biology. Our continuing and long-term goal is that after 3 years of training the program's fellows will have acquired the professional skills to be competitive and obtain their own extramural funds. Our records show that we have achieved this benchmark. Therefore, our specific objectives are: 1) To provide trainee fellows with an intensive research experience in cardiovascular-pulmonary research with a focus on the pathophysiological aspects of chronic pulmonary vascular disease and right heart failure, by pairing them with mentors who are rigorously selected based on their qualifications and scientific area of expertise and placing them in a collaborative, stimulating environment, 2) To enhance the scientific knowledge and critical thinking abilities of the participating trainees by requiring a series of workshops/lecturs on hypothesis formulation, experimental design, reporting and presentation of scientific information, grant proposal preparation and hands on experience in innovative molecular and cellular physiological approaches to cardiovascular-pulmonary research, 3) To enhance multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches to research by requiring co-mentors, and strong interaction with an Internal Advisory Committee with oversight by Executive and External Advisory Committees, 4) To ensure that Fellows acquire and learn the necessary information to conduct and report research in an ethical manner, and 5) To provide the trainees with the information they need regarding a career in academic medicine and research by exposing them to available funding mechanisms for physician/basic scientists such as K-series awards and other mentored clinician scientist awards. The increasing national and international interest in pulmonary vascular biology, the expanded nature of our program, and the excellent track record of training individuals from all backgrounds, including underrepresented minorities, support our request for 6 postdoctoral trainees each year.

"9198361","ABSTRACT Over 50% of adults with HIV have some form of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) which represents a significant symptom that interferes with everyday functioning and quality of life. As adults age with HIV, they are more likely to develop comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and insulin resistance which will further contribute to poorer cognitive functioning and HAND. Based upon the Frascati criteria, HAND is diagnosed when a person performs less than 1 to 2 SD below their normative mean (education & age) on measures of two or more cognitive domains (e.g., attention, speed of processing, verbal memory, executive functioning). Yet, from the cognitive literature and our prior studies, we know we can administer certain computerized cognitive training programs to improve specific cognitive domains in older adults and those with HIV. Such cognitive training programs may be effective in older adults with HIV and therefore we may be able to change the diagnosis of HAND in such cognitively vulnerable adults. In this pre- post experimental study, 146 older adults (50+) with HAND will be randomized to be in either: 1) the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training, or 2) a no-contact control group. We will focus on those cognitive domains in which participants express an impairment and train them with the corresponding cognitive program. Such an Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training approach using standard cognitive training programs may offer hope and symptom relief to those individuals diagnosed with HAND. Furthermore, we assert that these changes will result in improved everyday functioning (e.g., IADLs) and quality of life. This approach represents a paradigm shift in possibly changing the way we look at HAND. Specific Aim 1: Compare adults who do receive Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training to those who do not in order to determine whether a change in HAND prevalence and severity occurs between groups. Exploratory Aim 1: Compare adults who do receive individualized-targeted cognitive training to those who do not in order to determine whether this improves everyday functioning (e.g., IADLs). Exploratory Aim 2: Determine whether improvements in HAND and/or everyday functioning over time mediate improvements in quality of life."

"9187880","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal fibrotic lung disorder that kills 40,000 Americans each year and over 1 million persons worldwide. In IPF, relentless expansion and alteration of the alveolar mesenchymal cell population leads to production of diseased myofibroblasts that mediate progressive scarring of the gas exchange surface resulting in death by asphyxiation. Fibroblasts derived from the lungs of IPF patients have phenotypic hallmarks that distinguish them from their normal counterparts. IPF fibroblasts have altered integrin expression, are hyperproliferative, produce increased amounts of collagen, express increased amounts of ?mooth muscle actin (?MA) and form fibrotic lesions in model organisms. We recently published that pathological lung mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a cell-of-origin for the IPF fibroblast; and that IPF extracellular matrix (ECM) reprograms fibroblast gene expression to establish a positive feedback loop that translationally activates ECM genes and their cognate cell surface receptors. In this project we summarize our paradigm-shifting data. First, we show that IPF lungs MPCs - but not control lung MPCs - generate progeny with the in vitro and in vivo hallmarks of IPF fibroblasts. Next, we show that when primary lung fibroblasts (IPF or control) interact with decellularized lung ECM (IPF or control): i) the ECM source predominantly dictates gene expression; ii) IPF lung ECM translationally activates ECM genes and genes encoding their cognate integrin receptors; and iii) IPF lung ECM, but not control ECM, decreases fibroblast expression of miR29 - a potent negative regulator of ECM and proliferation genes - creating a positive feedback loop that provides a molecular mechanism for relentless disease progression. Based on this, we hypothesize that decellularized IPF lung ECM will direct human lung MPC differentiation towards the IPF phenotype; and stabilize that phenotype by epigenetic regulation of miR29 expression to create a positive feedback loop driving genes governing IPF fibroblast hallmarks. We propose 2 specific aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. Specific Aim 1: Genesis of the IPF fibroblast - Characterize the mechanisms by which MPCs acquire IPF phenotypic hallmarks on IPF lung ECM. Specific Aim 2: Disease Progression - Dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the IPF ECM-driven positive feedback loop that increases integrin and ECM gene expression and suppresses their negative regulator, miR29. If we achieve our aims, our work will unveil mechanisms governing the genesis, maintenance and propagation of the IPF fibroblast and its pathological ECM. This information is foundational for developing therapies that target those ECM - mesenchymal cell interactions that drive IPF."
"9390534","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the most recent 10 years of our T32, 35 of our 53 trainees have completed training. Of these 35, 32 are currently active in scientific research including 8 in industry and 24 in academia, 13 of whom serve at the rank of assistant professor or higher. Even in times of low pay lines, these T32 trainees have been highly successful, garnering thus far from the NIH seven F awards, four Ks, and four Rs. They have also won one research grant from the NSF and thirteen highly competitive career development research awards from foundations (AHA, ALA, APS, PBF, LAM, Nemours). We are particularly proud that 9 of these 53 trainees are under-represented minorities (URMs). Of the 5 URMs who completed training, all 5 now hold the rank of assistant professor on the tenure track. In 39 years of continuous T32 support from the NHLBI, we have never had an unfilled slot.  Trainees with backgrounds in biology, medicine, engineering, and physics work side-by-side on problems at the intersection of pulmonary sciences and environmental exposures. These trainees benefit from working with each other, working with trainees not supported by this T32, and working with a well-funded, well-published, interdisciplinary faculty. This faculty addresses three main problems: environmental contaminants & air pollution, lung infection, and asthma. The theme of pulmonary inflammation spans these foci. A unique feature is our strong emphasis on engineering and physical sciences. Bridging the gap between the life sciences and the physical / engineering sciences has been a longstanding hallmark of our program. These themes foster exceptional levels of collaboration among a faculty with unusually diverse yet highly complementary expertise. They unify the faculty into a cohesive interdisciplinary team focusing on basic mechanisms of lung disease.  Our training approach recognizes that the breadth of interdisciplinary research teams is expanding. At the intersection of environment and health, in particular, teams increasingly need strong grounding in basic biology, genomics, bio-engineering, biophysics, and exposure and population sciences, as well as increasingly sophisticated analyses of disease models. Only then will they be prepared to study the interaction of susceptibility genes with environmental exposures. Hence, we adopt the approach that the modern trainee cannot be expected to do it all; rather, to succeed he or she will need the strongest possible disciplinary foundation together with the tools needed to work effectively with others outside their own discipline.  Our Program offers access to excellent facilities and unique nanotechnologies, and is designed so that trainees will: 1) master modern technologies of cell and molecular biology as well as integrative physiology; 2) learn the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, 3) design experiments effectively and interpret data critically, 4) adapt well to change, and 5) build successful careers as responsible members of the scientific community.

"9257053","ABSTRACT Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested that reduced brain reactivity to gain is significantly linked to diminished hedonic tone (i.e., anhedonia) and future Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This work has also suggested that increased brain reactivity to loss may be a key biomarker of increased negative emotionality in MDD and risk for depression as well. Despite compelling findings suggesting that diminished hedonic tone and increased negative emotionality are significant risk factors for MDD in preschoolers, there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of altered neural reactivity to gain and loss and increased early emotional risk for depression at this age. The purpose of proposed study is to begin filling this knowledge gap. To facilitate this goal, complimentary functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event related potential (ERP) measures of response to gain and loss will be collected in 200 4-7 year olds at two time points 1-year apart. Measures of reward learning, suggested to be a key mechanism linking reduced hedonic tone to later MDD, will also be collected and examined for potential relationships with brain reactivity to reward. An expert interdisciplinary team of investigators and consultants will support the proposed research plan. The feasibility of the proposed project is enhanced by the study team's well established history of recruiting and following large samples of preschoolers and in obtaining high quality fMRI and ERP data in children this young using developmentally sensitive methods to acclimate and train them for the demands of these environments. A systematic approach investigating brain reactivity to gain and loss will be conducted at the level of individual brain regions previously shown to be critical for reward processing and disrupted in depression. It is hypothesized that diminished brain reactivity to gain at baseline will be associated with diminished hedonic tone and reward learning measured at baseline and 1 year later. Similarly, it is hypothesized that increased brain reactivity to loss at baseline will be associated with increased negative emotionality at baseline and 1 year later. It is also hypothesized that 1) increasing brain reactivity to gain between baseline and follow-up assessments will predict increased hedonic tone and reward learning 1 year later and that 2) decreases in brain reactivity to loss during this time will predict decreased negative emotionality 1 year later. Importantly, the current study will investigate whether fMRI and ERP measures of brain reactivity to gain and loss act similarly in the hypothesized relationships. By studying how brain reactivity to gain and loss in preschoolers is associated with early alterations in emotion processing that increase risk for depression at this age, the current study may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers and neurodevelopmental trajectories of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later MDD. By further investigating whether fMRI and ERP function similarly in study predictions, information critical for the future clinical use of these methods to support earlier identification and develop novel treatments minimizing depression's public health burden will also be gained.

"9136715","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The purpose of this project is to determine the precision and accuracy of the video head impulse test (vHIT), a new clinical test of semicircular canal (SCC) function. The vestibular (inner ear balance) system is comprised of two types of sensory organs (semicircular canals and otolith organs) with unique contributions to balance. Loss of vestibular function can occur in one or both labyrinths, in one or both branches of the vestibular nerve, and in one or more vestibular sensory organs. Symptoms of vestibular loss include postural instability, visual blurring, and subjective complaints of dizziness and/or imbalance. Moreover, the incidence of falls is greater in individuals with unilateral or bilateral vestibular loss than in healthy individuals of the same  age living in the community. The incidence of dizziness and imbalance increases in populations relevant to VA healthcare: older adults, individuals with traumatic brain injury, and individuals with associated psychiatric disorders. The two most widely used clinical laboratory tests of vestibular function include the caloric test and the rotary chair test. The main advantage of the caloric test is the ability to lateralize a vestibular deficit by stimulating each ear independentl and it is generally considered the 'gold standard' test of horizontal SCC function, especially for the identification of unilateral vestibular losses (e.g., Herdman et al., 1998). The caloric test, however, has a relatively long test time (~30 minutes), is limited to the assessment of the horizontal SCCs, and generates an extremely low-velocity, low-frequency stimulus which is well below the optimal operating range of the sensory receptors of the SCCs. The rotary chair test is considered the 'gold standard' test of horizontal SCC function in patients suspected of having bilateral loss of vestibular function as the caloric test can yield false-positive results. Similarto the caloric test, the rotary chair test is limited to the assessment of horizontal SCC function. Shortcomings include the high cost of the equipment, the space requirements, and the failure to lateralize a unilateral vestibular loss since both labyrinths are stimulated simultaneously. The vHIT is a new clinical test of dynamic SCC function that uses a high-speed digital video camera to record head and eye movement during and immediately after brief, high-acceleration, passive head rotations in the horizontal and vertical planes. The vHIT detects and records abnormal eye movements (overt and covert saccades) and provides measures of either the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex or the angle of gaze deviation relative to the angle of head rotation. In contrast to the caloric and rotary chair tests, the vHIT evaluates the function of all six SCCs and  provides the capability of assessing the vestibular system using a stimulus that is more physiologically relevant and more representative of the head movements that occur during activities of daily living. Other important advantages of the vHIT relative to the caloric and rotay chair tests include lower cost, shorter test time, greater portability, and increased patient comfort. The specific aims are designed to determine the precision of the vHIT using two examiners, two different vHIT devices, and two test sessions (Specific Aim 1), determine the effect of age on the vHIT (Specific Aim 2), establish normal reference intervals (Specific Aim 3), and determine the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the vHIT in identifying patients with unilateral and bilateral vestibular losses (Specific Aim 4). To address Specific Aims 1-3, data wil be obtained from the following 5 groups of Veteran participants: (1) young normal adults (18 to 40 years of age, n = 25), (2) older normal adults (60 to 89 years of age, n = 25), (3) patients wit total unilateral vestibular losses (18 to 89 years of age, n = 15), (4) patients with partial unilateral vestibular losses (18 to 89 years of age, n = 15), and (5) patients with bilateral vestibular losses (18 to 89 years of age, n = 15). To address Specific Aim 4, the results of the index test (vHIT) will be compared with the results of the reference tests for unilateral vestibula losses (caloric test) and bilateral vestibular losses (rotary chair test) in 480 patients (18 to 89  years of age) evaluated in the Vestibular/Balance Clinic at the Mountain Home VAMC."

"9391767","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     RESEARCH SUMMARY. The importance of elucidating the biobehavioral determinants of health disparities in minority populations, and particularly among Mexican immigrants in the U.S., is well established. In this context, an important issue that warrants further investigation relates to the underlying cause(s) of epidemiologic observations that Mexican immigrants exhibit a progressive decline in health (particularly obesity) over time and across generations. The construct of acculturation (post?migration socio?cultural adjustment) is often invoked as an explanation because acculturation produces psychological and behavioral changes that affect health. But, this paradigm does not address intergenerational decline in health. First, I suggest that the intergenerational decline in health (particularly escalation in obesity rates) could be a consequence of acculturation?related biological changes in women. During pregnancy, these changes may be transmitted to the next generation (the fetus) to influence offspring phenotypes that determine susceptibility for obesity (adiposity). A necessary step towards investigating this hypothesis is determining whether, in fact, acculturation is associated with changes in aspects of gestational biology involved in the fetal programming of offspring adiposity. Second, I suggest that many of the inconsistencies of findings across studies in the acculturation?health literatur may relate to limitations of operationalization of the acculturation construct, and failure to consider the role of social context as an effect modifier (context of reception; contrast of life i origin/host countries). My proposal seeks to address both these important limitations. In Project 1 I will develop, in a population?based, representative sample of 1,000 pregnant women, an improved measure of acculturation for Mexican immigrants optimized for health research. In Project 2, in a separate sample of 100 pregnant women, I will evaluate the hypothesis that acculturation status is associated with key indicators of gestational biology implicated in offspring obesity risk. My proposed study incorporates the following Aims: 1. Develop measures of acculturation and socio?cultural context in Mexican immigrant women. 2: Administer and optimize measures of acculturation and socio?cultural context in a representative, population?based cohort of pregnant Mexican immigrant women. 3. Psychometric validation of acculturation and socio?cultural context instruments. 4. Test the hypothesis that acculturation and socio?cultural context are associated with gestational biology (stress and metabolic biomarkers related to fetal programming of obesity). Findings from this project will reveal new information about the health status of vulnerable populations (Mexican immigrants, their unborn children) and serve as a platform for future studies of maternal acculturation and fetal programming, which, in turn, could lead to new avenues for early identification of at?risk individuals, and for prevention/intervention strategies to limit the intergenerational perpetuation of disadvantage and poor health. CANDIDATE SUMMARY. I am primarily interested in the concepts of biological embedding of socio?ecological conditions, and the fetal origins of health and disease paradigm. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in human developmental biology with R01 funding, addressing key questions related to a) how an individual's social and environmental ecology influences biological systems, and b) how biological links between generations affect the development of homeostatic mechanisms associated with chronic disease risk. My short? term career goals are a) to apply the frameworks of evolutionary and developmental biology towards addressing immigrant and minority health, and b) to investigate the socio?cultural effects of migration on gestational biology. My past and current research has been guided by an interest in female reproductive function as a biological continuum between generations, and what this can reveal about health and disease. I was trained in the inter? disciplinary field of Biological Anthropology at Yale University and University of Cambridge. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN SUMMARY. My training plan is designed to allow me to acquire the professional and technical skills necessary for a successful transition to independence as a Human Developmental Biologist with a focus in life?course determinants of chronic disease. I will attain a Master of Science in Biomedical and Translational Science degree during Years 1?2 of the K01 award period. I will be mentored by a team of prominent experts in their respective fields, led by Prof. Pathik Wadhwa (a leader in the field of prenatal stress biology and DOHaD), with co-mentor Prof. Greg Duncan (a leader in the field of development science and member of the National Academy of Sciences) among others, and receive specialized short?term training from a team of distinguished faculty at other universitie, including Prof. John Berry (founder of the field of acculturation studies). ENVIRONMENT SUMMARY. Based in the UC Irvine Development, Health and Disease Research Program (DHDRP), which is currently funded by multiple major NIH grants, I will have myriad resources, including an inter? disciplinary team of 30 senior investigators to provide an intellectually productive environment, research staff, office, and laboratory facilities, and experiential education in state?of?the?art methods for studies of maternal? placental?fetal gestationa biology (including epigenetics, telomere and mitochondrial biology), fetal development, and newborn, infant and child outcomes related to body composition, metabolic function and brain development. The UCI Institute of Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS), funded by the NIH Clinical and Translational Sciences Award (CTSA) program, provides particular support to junior scientists including research design, advanced biostatistics, community engagement, bioassay platforms, and training opportunities, that will directly benefit my training and career development."
"9219231","Project Summary The long-term objective of this project is to develop a new class of broad spectrum antibiotics, focused on Gram-negative bacteria and tuberculosis. In addition, the proposed project will teach how to optimize inhibitors of the prokaryotic ribosome by defining critical interactions only possible in bacteria. Inspired by a natural product, this class targets an unexploited binding site of the bacterial ribosome. With increasing reports of resistance to frontline antibacterial therapies, there is a critical need for new agents, yet very little can be found in the development pipeline. As a result, any new therapeutic that targets Gram-negative bacteria and/or tuberculosis will address an unmet medical need. A viable approach to discover new therapeutic leads is re-evaluation of existing, but under-scrutinized classes of natural products. Through this approach a natural product scaffold was identified as a lead for a program directed toward antibiotics for tuberculosis. Initial evaluation of activity against other bacteria indicated that the antibacterial spectrum was limited to Mycobacterium spp. However, based on the chemical structure and related compounds, we expected to be able to generate analogs with more broad spectrum activity. In collaboration with Tom Steitz's lab at Yale, the structure of the initial scaffold and two analogues bound to the ribosome were recently solved. The structural studies revealed that the natural product lead and analogues bind to a highly conserved region of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in a manner that appears to convey prokaryotic selectivity and which has not been exploited in current therapeutics. Targeting this highly conserved region is expected to lead to slow rates of resistance. This structural information was used to generate two more potent analogues with favorable physiochemical properties. In a very preliminary SAR campaign of ~30 compounds, we re-engineered a portion of our lead scaffold for both synthetic simplicity and stability to provide two analogs that introduce activity beyond Mtb, to MRSA, E. coli and K. pneumoniae (including a carbapenem-resistant strain), and do not exhibit cytotoxicity to eukaryotic cells (IC50 >100 M). This project will explore and further define critical binding interactions for inhibitors to the bacterial ribosome that impart selectivity for inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and broad spectrum antibacterial activity, while maintaining the lack of mammalian cytotoxicity. Aim 1 will expound on our hypothesis for how compounds can selectively bind to prokaryotic ribosomes at an undrugged site. If our hypothesis is correct, these inhibitors will not be active against mammalian ribosomes, thereby mitigating limitations of other ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Aims 2 and 3 will explore features of related compound families that, based on our hypotheses, are expected to facilitate more potent inhibition of bacterial ribosomes while maintaining selectivity/safety and enhancing broad spectrum antibacterial activity."
"9389135","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The T32 Pathophysiology of Human Blood Cells, now in its 32nd year of funding, is seeking renewal to continue a long-standing focus on training physician-scientists in pediatric Hematology/Oncology. The object of the training program is to provide PhD and PhD-post-doctoral level research experiences and scholarly research training in Hematology/Oncology, so as to render trainees independent investigators making substantive contributions to biomedical research. The program has undergone significant changes in the past 2 cycles with the appointment of Drs. David Williams and Ellis Neufeld as Program Director and Co-Director, respectively. New areas of focus established in the past two funding cycles include stem cell biology, platelets/thrombosis, neutrophil biology/innate immunity, red cell biology/hemoglobin expression and an overall emphasis in translational research. In addition, new programs are targeting women in undergraduate science classes and MD/PhD students at Harvard Medical School/MIT to enhance the future pipeline of trainees coming to this T32. The 60 training faculty include outstanding scientists many with exemplary publication and training records. In spite of pressures on the NIH budget, research funds to the training faculty currently total $36,165,934 per year representing 158 NIH grants. The training faculty is highly collaborative, and Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard, Harvard CTSA and MIT academic environments provide stellar opportunities for formal coursework and for a myriad of scientific seminars and lectures. Of those applying for positions on this T32, 5% are accepted with a 16% acceptance rate for under-represented minorities, and over the past 15 years, 56 of 89 of our fellows were women. There are formal processes in place for regular trainee and faculty feedback. Success of trainees as judged by success in obtaining NIH training grants and independent faculty positions is outstanding and nearly 100% of entering fellows remain in hematology/oncology in scientific careers. Indeed, graduates of this training program now represent leaders in the field with significant numbers serving in academic or pharmaceutical/biotech leadership positions. This success continues in the latest funded cycle. Of the 36 MD or MD/PhD trainees who began their training at BCH/DFCI within the past 10 years and who are no longer on the grant, 24 (67%) have already obtained career awards or prestigious fellowships and of the 10 PhDs, 9 (90%) have received prestigious fellowships. We are requesting renewal with funding to support 11 training slots in the next funding period."
"9245952","Influenza remains a worldwide public health threat in the 21st Century. Its impact is magnified by a vaccine that affords incomplete protection whose composition usually changes annually, and by the episodic appearance of new pandemic strains, such as the A/California H1N1 strain that emerged in 2009. Influenza has a particularly acute impact in in the geriatric age group, with 90% of the 20,000-40,000 annual deaths in the United States attributed to influenza occurring in individuals over the age of 65. This proposal, like all of the Projects in this Human Immunology Project Consortium application, seeks to identify the host factors associated with immune response in humans. Here we focus on factors contributing to influenza vaccine response, and how these factors and pathways are affected by age and functional status. In this proposal, we will leverage our expertise in carrying out studies in human immunology, particularly our studies that have identified innate immune and gene expression signatures of vaccine response to standard-dose vaccine and how aging affects these signatures. In particular, we found an unexpected mitochondrial biogenesis signature that was strongly associated with vaccine antibody response, and this finding, together with preliminary metabolomic data, has led us to propose employing already-collected serum samples to derive biochemical signatures of vaccine response that will be integrated with the gene expression, cellular and immunologic signatures already elucidated for young and older adults in this cohort. We also propose to elucidate new insights into the biologic basis of frailty, a geriatric syndrome characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and stress resistance that is associated with increased mortality and disability. We will also gain new insights into the high-dose influenza vaccine recently approved for older adults, administering this vaccine to a cohort of young (age 21- 30), non-frail older and frail older (? 70) adults. For these studies, we will leverage large databases of older adults established by the Yale Program on Aging and the expertise and track record of experts in frailty and disability at Yale such as Dr. Thomas Gill. Samples obtained prior to and following vaccination will undergo detailed analyses by CyTOF (Core C) for innate and adaptive immune cell composition (including novel studies of the platelet lineage), activation, and cytokine production. We will also carry out unbiased studies of innate immune pattern recognition receptor function. These findings will be integrated with single-cell RNA-seq studies utilizing the nanowell platform in Core C to isolate individual cells from lineages identified to change in the context of vaccination, and with metabolic analyses of serum and cells pre- and post-vaccine. Such metabolomic analyses will identify pathways reflecting the integration of numerous genetic signaling inputs, and will provide additional insights into human influenza vaccine response. Insights into genetic, immunologic and metabolic architecture of influenza vaccination are likely to identify pathways that could be targets of therapies, drugs or other biological treatments to enhance or suppress immune responses as needed."
"9209324","Administrative Core Summary/Abstract The Administrative Core is responsible for oversight and coordination of activities in the National Center for In Vivo Metabolism. There are three aims: 1. Administer the BTRC. This component will administer and coordinate general activities of the BTRC. The financial administration, interactions with the Advanced Imaging Research Center (AIRC), communication with Collaborative Projects, communication with Service Projects, and interaction with NIBIB will all be supported through the Administrative Core. One web programmer will be supported in the Administrative Core and responsible for development, implementation, and support of the BTRC web page. 2. Manage the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC). This Committee is composed of the leaders of the TR&D projects (Drs. Malloy, Sherry, Burgess, Kovacs and Wang) plus local experts with administrative support. The IAC has multiple responsibilities. It will receive and evaluate applications for consideration as a CP or a SP, monitor instrument usage and assure appropriate chargebacks, systemically review progress in each one of the CPs on a rotating basis with a report on the assistance received from each TR&D, and oversee distribution of 13C and 15N tracers as they are developed. The IAC will advise Dr. Malloy and the leaders of each TR&D project. 3. Manage the annual meeting of the External Advisory Committee (EAC). The EAC, described in more detail in the Administration section, will be composed of experts outside UT Southwestern. Each investigator in the TR&Ds brings a common interest in metabolism and NMR spectroscopy but also contributes highly distinctive strengths. The team is well-suited to serve the metabolic research community and the BTRC. We have experience working together for many years and opinions can be shared candidly. We are confident that that a well-integrated and responsive administrative structure can be provided to the Collaborators and Service investigators."
"9404700","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for a mentored training program for pediatric subspecialty faculty interested in basic research careers. The program offers a 1- to 3-year experience dedicated to training in cell and molecular biology research that is relevant to child health for 4 Scholars per year and is designed to serve as a launch for a career as a NIH R01-funded pediatric physician scientist. The mentoring faculty includes 21 outstanding basic researchers who have a distinguished record of research contributions and mentoring. The philosophical emphasis of this mentoring experience is fundamentals of the scientific method combined with the highest standard of excellence for rigor and integrity. Each of the Scholars is expected to carry out a challenging research project in the laboratory of one of the faculty mentors leading to publications as well as an application for their own K08, K99/R00 or R01 grant. The Department of Pediatrics at Pitt has one of the fastest growing pediatric research programs in the country and is based on a new Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC campus with the new 300,000-square-foot CHP Rangos Pediatric Research Building. Follow-up from the initial term of the CHRC program at Pitt (1992-1997) shows that 4 of the 8 Scholars are now R01- funded professors and 3 of these are division chiefs. Two other graduates are full professors involved in NIH-funded research as co-investigators. Of the 6 scholars that have graduated from the second term of the program (2007-present), 5 have already competed successfully for NIH (or equivalent) funding as a PI, including one R01, 3 K awards and 1 RWJ Foundation Minority Mentored Scholar Award. Over the last 10 years the Department has used its own resources to support a similar experience for 10 additional junior faculty (CHP Scholars), all of whom have competed successfully for, or moved forward towards, independent funding (3 R01, 1 K99/R00, 4 K08/K23, 1 R21 and 1 Gates Foundation). Based on these characteristics and results, we believe that this program provides a powerful team of mentors and intellectually-rich environment that will inspire junior faculty in pediatric subspecialties and provide them with the background to become the next generation of successful child health researchers."
"9404678","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Children's Hospital Boston CHRCDA Program is to develop pediatrician physician-scientists who are performing world-class research that will improve health care for children in this country and around the world. Our Scholars will be performing laboratory-based basic and translational research under the mentorship of outstanding scientists at Children's Hospital and other Harvard Associated Hospitals and Harvard Medical School. Our program has been established to ensure the development of independent scientists. In this proposal we describe a program that included intensive mentoring, a comprehensive didactic program, and a program to ensure the scientific development of Scholars. Programmatic oversight will be provided by an External Site Visit Committee and an Internal Steering Committee. Plans are in place for programmatic self-evaluation and for review of Scholar Progress. We propose to continue the funding of four Scholar positions. Most Scholars will be funded for two years, unless they secure independent K-level or other funding during their first year of Scholarship. Historically, the Department of Medicine has funded the majority of the salary component of each Scholar, such that most of the K12 funding is used to cover the cost of supplies and research technicians. The Department has also in most years funded a position to support a fifth Scholar position. Scholars will be faculty members most often at the rank of Instructor, but Assistant Professors who are early in the development of their independent careers will also be eligible to apply. Scholars will be considered at any point from the beginning of their Instructorship to the point where they are considered to be two years away from submitting their first R-level NIH grant or equivalent. Scholars will work in a broad range of scientific investigations. Past and present Scholars are working in areas such as the mechanism of nuclear reprogramming, structural biology of malaria antigens, biochemistry of viral entry, gene discovery in short stature, cardiac malformations, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and familial epilepsy, T cell development and many other areas. These investigations will elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms and will lead to the development of new therapeutic modalities in all areas of pediatric disease, including hematology/oncology, endocrinology, nephrology, infectious disease, immunology, pulmonology and neurology."
"9405071","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ONC201 is a clinical-stage first-in-class small molecule with demonstrated anticancer activity against aggressive refractory/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. This novel compound imparts its antitumor effects through a unique mechanism of action that involves indirect dual inactivation of Akt and ERK in tumor but not normal cells. Several academic investigators at premier institutions have demonstrated the optimal preclinical profile of ONC201 in a multitude of models. These findings have prompted Oncoceutics to rapidly translate this product into the clinic to treat advanced cancer patients. The first-in-man trial is a phase I/II study that will include patients with GBM is scheduled to begin in early 2014 at MGH and has been reviewed by the FDA as part of the accepted IND. Following completion of the dose-escalation phase I portion of the trial supported by Oncoceutics, the phase II trial can begin to evaluate the monoagent efficacy of ONC201 in patients with advanced GBM. In this fast-track application, we propose to develop an automated manufacturing process to provide the clinical supply of drug product followed by evaluation of the clinical efficacy of the resulting product in patients with GBM. Phase/Aim #1: Optimize ONC201 formulation and produce GMP product for GBM trial; Phase/Aim #2: Evaluate clinical efficacy of oral ONC201 in GBM. These studies will enable a development path for ONC201 to treat GBM, which is otherwise unattainable based on investor feedback that indicates a clear need for pilot clinical data in the indication to enable private support. This proposal seeks to make a novel anticancer agent available to patients in dire need of treatment options, will push the product toward commercialization, sufficiently derisk private investments to enable subsequent development, and will advance the field forward by enabling clinical evaluation of a novel therapeutic mechanism."
"9376080","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My career goal is to become an independent investigator who empirically examines ethical issues relevant to substance abuse treatment research with a particular focus on criminal justice populations. The time and support provided by this K23 award will constitute a major step in helping me achieve these goals by providing the necessary training and mentorship in ethics research, addictions research, biostatistics and instrumentation, and criminal justice research. Current federal guidelines impose strict limitations on all above minimal risk prisoner research out of concern that prisoners may be coerced into enrolling. Such restrictions are particularly problematic for the field of opioid dependence research given the high rate of opioid addiction and related health problems (e.g., HIV/AIDs, hepatitis, other addictions, and mental illness) in prisons, and the urgent need to develop prison-initiated therapies that effectively address the high morbidity and mortality associated with post-release opioid relapse and criminal recidivism. The primary research aim of this K23 award is to develop and validate an instrument that measures the extent to which prisoners perceive their consent to above minimal risk research for opioid dependence as voluntary. Initial development of the instrument (Aim 1) will be achieved by a) critically evaluating the literature on voluntariness, b) conducting concept elicitation interviews with prisoners who have either consented or declined to enroll in a NIDA-funded clinical trial for opioid dependence, c) evaluating these data with a multi-disciplinary group to develop a construct definition and preliminary set of instrument items, and d) pilot testing the instrument for readability and comprehension. Establishing the instrument's construct validity (Aim 2) will be achieved by evaluating concept validity with factor analyses, Rasch model analyses, and by convergent and discriminant validity testing among prisoners participating in one of two clinical trials for opioid dependence treatment. This instrument should be of great interest to clinical opioid researchers, other NIDA and NIH investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and criminal justice authorities because it will allow for the identification and exclusion of subjects who migh enroll non-voluntarily. This, in turn, will support the ethical advancement of much-needed clinical research on opioid dependence and related conditions among prisoners."
"9216750","PROJECT SUMMARY Currently, very few cancer therapies result in long-term tumor stabilization or regression. This may be because most current therapies target a relatively small number of proteins and pathways. For this reason, we have developed evidence validating antizyme inhibitor (AZI) as a novel therapeutic target. AZI gene amplification and overexpression are common in a variety of tumor types, including cancers of the prostate, breast, ovary, testis, liver, lung, and skin. In addition, we have found that AZI silencing suppresses cell proliferation and experimental cancer in animal models. AZI promotes tumor growth by several pathways. These include binding and sequestering the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) antagonist antizyme (AZ), inhibiting polyamine uptake, and inactivating ODC, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis. AZ sequestration also derepresses cyclin D1, SMAD1, and aurora A kinase. Inhibition of only one of these (ODC) with DFMO has resulted in anticancer activity in clinical trials, but its success has been modest, likely because of a compensatory increase in uptake of extracellular polyamines that is blocked by AZ. Because of the increased range of oncogenic activities regulated by AZ, molecules that increase available intracellular AZ by blocking AZI are expected to be more active than DFMO. Such molecules have not yet been discovered; however, they are likely to exist because AZI retains a pocket analogous to the known substrate-binding pocket in ODC to which it is homologous. Given the overlap between this pocket and the AZ binding site, small molecule inhibitors represent an opportunity to block AZ binding and sequestration and increase available AZ in the cell. We propose to develop a drug discovery pipeline designed to identify molecules that inhibit the AZ-AZI interaction. The first stage of this pipeline will be high throughput FRET assays to identify inhibitors of AZ-AZI interaction, using AZ-ODC and AZ-AZIN2 FRET interaction assays as counterscreens. These assays will be developed in the Rogers Lab, which has developed two different protein-protein FRET assays, has screened >250,000 compounds with each, and has successfully identified compounds with antiangiogenic activity in vivo. Secondary assays to assess the ability of hit compounds to disrupt AZ-AZI complexes in vivo will be developed in the lab of Dr. Bruce Zetter, who has substantial experience in cancer research and is an expert on the role of the AZ-AZI pathway in cancer. Assays to be developed include BLI (BioLayer Interferometry) and in vivo FRET assays to assess AZ-AZI interaction in cultured cells. AZI antagonism will be confirmed with a polyamine production assay and BLI assays for SMAD1, cyclin D1, and Aurora A kinase. Finally, the labs will collaborate to test the whole pipeline on a library of 10,000 compounds at the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology (ICCB) facility at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Small molecule AZI antagonists identified in the proposed screening pipeline will be used as lead compounds for the design of anticancer therapeutics and as probes of the molecular recognition and cellular effects of AZ release."
"9104096","Core Description  The Center will have 4 projects  ? Project 1: Clinician Based Appropriateness  ? Project 2: Outcomes Based Appropriateness  ? Project 3: Patient Preferences Appropriateness  ? Project 4 : Economic Based Appropriateness        All the four Projects in the Center will utilize data collected in various ways from patients seen by a sample of practicing chiropractic providers in four national sites. The national sites will be selected during the first year of the project and will represent major regions of the country to enhance the generalizability of the findings to the United States overall. Within each ofthe four sites, we will identify and recruit a sample of 20 practicing chiropractors (i.e., 80 in total). If a chiropractor is interested in participating, we then will check to see if they meet the following eligibility requirements: (a) they typically see at least 5 patients a day who are being treated for chronic cervical pain; (b) they are willing to allow our team to recruit interview and shadow 10 patients through their visit over a  2-day period; (c) they will allow us to review and abstract 10 random patient charts and the 10 whom we interview; and (d) they will provide basic information about themselves and their practices.      Each project has slightly different, but highly overlapping, data collection requirements, including: (a) the abstraction of patient files (Project 1); (b) face-to-face patient interviews (Project 1,2 4); (c) observations of treatment encounters (Project 3); (d); provider interviews (Projects 1,2,3,4); (e) questionnaires about each practice (Project 1, 3); and (f) patient follow-up telephone interviews (Projects 1, 2,3 4).  Rather than have each project collect its own national data we have created one Data Collection and Management Core (DCMC) or the whole Center. This not only results in costs efficiencies but also ensures a much great level of integration of the projects and the data."
"9208427","The mission of the Neuro-Oncology Program is to improve the standard of care for brain cancers. The Program features a broad portfolio of research initiatives in the general clinical disciplines (medical, radiation and surgical oncology) and in therapeutically relevant scientific areas (e.g. oncolytic viruses, signal transduction, angiogenesis, tumor immunology). For this CCSG renewal, we will focus on astrocytomas ? the most lethal brain tumor of adults and the most common brain tumor of childhood. We have four specific aims: Aim one is to determine why adult gliomas are unresponsive to signal transduction antagonists that are 1) genetically indicated, 2) brain-penetrant, and 3) effective in other cancers. Aim two is to adapt emerging tools of immunotherapy to the treatment of adult gliomas. Our study plan addresses an important unmet need in this area - namely a broader portfolio of antigenic targets for glioma. We will explore a whole exome sequencing approach (NeoVax) that generates synthetic peptide vaccines corresponding to novel open reading frames encoding cell surface proteins on tumor cells. Aim three addresses IDH mutant gliomas in young adults. Our preclinical work, together with early clinical data, suggests that effects of the oncometabolite R-2HG in glioma will, unlike leukemia, not be reversible on a clinically relevant time-scale. Our study plan draws upon new imaging techniques for visualizing R-2HG in IDH mutant glioma patients and a synthetic lethal approach to drug development based upon actionable metabolic changes that arise as a consequence of IDH1 mutation. Aim four is to develop targeted therapeutics for pediatric gliomas. Activating mutations of the serine/threonine protein kinase BRAF are found in 70-75% of pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Our study plan addresses the unmet need for effective brain-penetrant RAF inhibitors for PLGA.  The Program is led by Tracy Batchelor MDMGH and Charles Stiles, PhDDFCI. At the time of the last CCSG renewal in 2011 it received a merit score of ?outstanding to excellent?. There are 94 members in the Program drawn from all seven DF/HCC member institutions. Collectively, the members receive over $31 million per year in cancer-relevant funding. Of this total research support package, $11.6 million is NCI funding and another $8.4M is from other peer-reviewed sources including NINDS (which, in a unique relationship, shares the burden of brain cancer research with NCI). The remaining $12M is from non peer-reviewed sources. One prominent component of the support package is a SPORE/P50 grant on glioma, newly awarded since the last CCSG renewal in 2011. Another important grant is a P01 on pediatric astrocytoma - one of just two P01s, nation-wide focused exclusively on pediatric brain cancer. During the project period, Neuro- Oncology Program members generated over 1,000 publications. Of these, 25% were inter-institutional, 26% were intra-programmatic, and 31% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members. Overall, when counted once, 27% of DF/HCC publications were inter-programmatic collaborations."
"9404695","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research benefitting the health of children requires training new generations of pediatric physician-scientists who are prepared for independent careers in basic biomedical research. A new collaborative research enterprise between Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta is poised to meet this need. The Emory-Children's Pediatric Research Center has already generated tremendous community enthusiasm, resources, facilities, and new discoveries. We propose a Child Health Research Career Development Program entitled the Atlanta Pediatric Scholars Program. Strengths and resources from partner institutions, combined with a critical mass of investigators working in a number of child health-related disciplines within the Emory Department of Pediatrics, create an ideal training environment for basic research career training. The infrastructure to support this program has been put in place over the past several years, and a robust research strategic plan is in place to continue recruitment and expansion of our research enterprise. A formal curriculum has been designed featuring didactic training and careful attention to mentoring, with the overarching goal of producing outstanding, independent physician-scientists attacking fundamental problems in pediatrics/child health. Training of physician-scientists from minority and underprivileged backgrounds is a particular focus of this program, and will be facilitated by existing strengths and partnerships in Atlanta. The program will include a rigorous system for tracking and assessing progress. The Atlanta Pediatric Scholars Program is an important component of a growing academic enterprise in Atlanta focusing on child health, and is poised to provide outstanding career development of new leaders in child health-related research."
"9012756","The goals of this project are to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which cowpox virus (CPXV) and monkeypox virus (MPXV) inhibit T cell stimulation and the impact of these immune evasion mechanisms on viral virulence and the development of anti-viral immune responses. We previously demonstrated that CPXV inhibits MHC-l-mediated antigen presentation thus escaping poxvirus-specific CD8+ T cells. Preliminary data suggest that, in addition, CPXV escapes CD4+ T cell stimulation and inactivates T cells in trans, i.e. without infecting T cells and independent of antigen presentation. The latter mode of T cell inhibition is very similar to our previously reported mechanism by which MPXV inhibits MHC-independent T cell stimulation. We therefore hypothesize that the responsible gene products are conserved between CPXV and MPXV. By analyzing deletion mutants we identified a gene region in the CPXV genome encoding the genes responsible for both CD4+ T cell escape and inhibiting T cell stimulation by anti-CD3. Since both antigen-dependent-and antigen-independent stimulation of T cells requires signal-transduction by the T cell receptor (TCR), it is conceivable that a single gene is responsible for both T cell evasion phenotypes. In three specific aims, we will (I) identify the genes in CPXV and MPXV responsible for inhibiting MHC-l-independent T cell stimulation by CPXV and MPXV, (II) characterize the corresponding gene products of CPXV and MPXV and determine how they inhibit TCR-mediated T cell activation, and (111) examine the role of T cell evasion for CPXV virulence and the impact of these inhibitory mechanisms on the development of antiviral immune responses in vivo: Since T cell inactivation by CPXV and MPXV is unlike any other viral T cell inhibitor mechanism described to date, our studies are expected to uncover novel molecular strategies for viral immune evasion. We further expect that this work will lead to a re-evaluation of the role of T cell evasion in the pathogenesis of zoonotic orthopoxviruses (and potentially smallpox, if the T cell inhibitors are conserved in Variola major) because these evasion mechanisms are absent from the widely studied Vaccinia Virus (W) and the mousepox virus ectromelia (ECTV)."
"9393030","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of our training program in Cardiovascular Biomechanics and Imaging is to attract, train, and graduate highly qualified, multi-disciplinary scientists in the area of cardiovascular bioengineering at pre- and post-doctoral levels. The program was created 10 years ago in response to: 1) the dearth of training opportunities available at the intersection between cardiovascular medicine and bioengineering at the University of Colorado and indeed within the Greater Rocky Mountain region; and 2) the strong institutional commitment to build bioengineering research and training within the University of Colorado. We believe the first 10 years have produced outstanding outcomes, with all pre-doctoral and post-doctoral graduates of the program in research positions within academia or industry, and many successfully receiving research grants and trainees of their own. Further, NHLBI T32 funding has been extraordinarily important in leveraging a large amount of additional funding from the University of Colorado, which bodes well for our next cycle of trainees. We believe the combination of outstanding outcomes, significant and continuing institutional support and growing reputation make a compelling argument to continue this program for the next 5 years, and thereby establish the University of Colorado as a premiere training destination for cardiovascular bioengineering.

"9233564","ABSTRACT Most solid tumors share two hallmarks that could be targets for cancer therapy: Chromosomal instability (CIN) and aneuploidy, with tumor cells generally carrying far more chromosomes than their euploid counterparts. CIN is defined by elevated frequencies of whole-chromosome missegregation, which in turn can lead to aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes. The conserved kinase Mps1, which is one of the most commonly over-expressed proteins in tumors with aneuploidy/CIN, is a promising target for cancer therapy. This kinase functions mainly to ensure successful chromosome segregation by promoting the correct attachment of chromosomes to microtubules. Interestingly, abnormally high levels of Mps1 are found in tumors with elevated chromosome numbers, and Mps1 is protective for these cells, making these tumor cells much more vulnerable to reductions in Mps1 activity than diploid cells. The recent development of selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitors of Mps1 has reinforced its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer. The major limitation of the current anti-Mps1 compounds, which induce its full inactivation, is the fact that those treatments can also have toxic impact on the physiology of normal cells. Mps1 phosphorylates many target proteins that are involved in several essential cellular processes. Critically, it is not known which of these targets and processes are the ones that are protective for aneuploid tumor cells. In this proposal, we will aim to identify the Mps1-dependent process and specific proteins that protect aneuploid tumor cells, using yeast cells with elevated chromosome number as a model system. As has been seen in human cells, yeast polyploid cells are exquisitely sensitive to reductions in Mps1 activity. We will interrogate the yeast gene set to identify genes whose levels are critical for the Mps1-target interaction that is critical for polyploid cells. The analysis of this interactome will identify direct Mps1 target proteins that are necessary for the protective function. In parallel, we will dissect the domains of Mps1 critical for its protective function. Combined with knowledge of putative targets, this information will provide critical tools for the analysis of the Mps1-target interaction. Successful completion of these experiments would provide fundamental information about how Mps1 interacts with its target proteins and will have important implications for the design of therapeutics that specifically target Mps1-target interactions that are protective for tumors."
"9204733","Project Summary/Abstract (Description): Developmental Funds  NCCC uses discretionary funds in general, and CCSG Developmental Funds in particular, to pursue new  opportunities, promote novel transdisciplinary collaborations, and advance meritorious cancer research. In  response to the 2008 review, we have retained a priority for investment in new faculty recruitment, where  return on investment historically has been highest. Refinement in use of Developmental Funds has been  linked to insights arising from planning and evaluation activities. In response to External Advisor  recommendations, we have emphasized collaborative initiatives, and Members subsequently have secured an  NCI U54 award in Cancer Nanotechnology and NIGMS P20 IDeA multi-project awards in quantitative  biomedical sciences and in molecular epidemiology. NCCC utilizes its five-year Strategic Plan to prioritize  announcements and financing of projects requesting use of developmental funds. The full portfolio of NCCC  developmental approaches includes pilot projects, new faculty funding, interim support, and investment in  advanced technology and new Shared Resource services. Recipients of pilot awards totaling $687,853 in  CCSG funds secured $16.3M in subsequent funding (see Table 2). We have directed pilot project awards to  strategic areas, such as multi-investigator proposals, translational studies, and early phase clinical trials. We  have examples of faculty refocusing on cancer-relevant questions (e.g., Stan [CM]), teams subsequently  securing multi-investigator awards (e.g., Roberts, Paulsen, and Pogue [CIR]), and junior faculty securing peer-  reviewed support (e.g., Danilov [MT]). During the current award period, we received renewal with a 25%  increase in the ACS-IRG pilot award program NCCC conducts. Our most recent call for pilot projects secured  proposals from over 25% of our Members, indicating the value perceived in this opportunity, and we selected 8  of 24 proposals, including at least one from each Program. We have invested $315,000 in CCSG funds in new  faculty recruitments who have secured $10.8M in subsequent peer-reviewed funding (see Table 3). NCCC  has in place policies addressing bridging (resubmission of approved but unfunded proposals) and retention  (preparation of new proposals) support, both of which rely on NCCC discretionary funds rather than CCSG  support. We have utilized NCCC developmental funds to promote Member utilization of new technologies,  including deep-sequencing and preclinical imaging. We have augmented services available to Members  through existing NCCC Shared Resources by developing new capabilities, such as geospatial mapping and  speed congenics. Renewal of CCSG Developmental Funds will support pilot project awards in priority areas  such as translational research, new faculty recruitment in strategic initiatives in early phase clinical  development and cancer immunotherapy, the 2015 opening of the NCCC-directed floor in the adjacent  Williamson Translational Research Building, and collaborative groups around emerging themes such as  precision medicine, surgical innovation, and behavioral interventions aimed at cancer risk reduction."

"9392326","Summary The long term goal of this project is to gain insight into the nature and role of antibodies in health and disease. B1 cell-derived natural antibodies play a critical homeostatic role in eliminating apoptotic debris and noxious molecules, beyond their role in microbial defense. In mice, B1 cell-derived IgM against atherogenic oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) protects against heart disease, whereas B2 cell- derived IgG anti-oxLDL exacerbates heart disease. In humans, IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies correlate with atheroprotection, but these antibodies could not be connected to B1 cells, because the definition of human B1 cells was unclear. Moreover, pathological oxLDL represents a heterogeneous collection of molecules. These issues have been addressed with new findings that establish the foundation for the current proposal. 1. We redefined human B1-like cells as CD20+CD27+CD43+ and showed by multiple criteria they are a unique and distinct population. 2. Bengtsson and colleagues focused attention on a specific peptide of apolipoprotein B100 (peptide 220) and showed that the serum level of IgM antibodies against the oxidatively modified peptide is inversely and independently correlated with subsequent cardiovascular events. 3. We showed in collaboration with Bengtsson that beneficial IgM anti-MGO-p220 antibodies are generated by human B1-like cells. 4. Bengtsson and colleagues showed that the serum level of IgG anti-MGO-p220 does not correlate in any way with subsequent cardiovascular events. These results highlight an unresolved issue concerning interaction between the serological arm of the immune system and atherosclerotic heart disease: why do IgM antibodies against oxLDL oppose atherosclerosis but IgG antibodies against oxLDL exacerbate atherosclerosis or do nothing. We propose to address this issue by examining the nature of IgM vs IgG anti-MGO-p220 antibodies. To elucidate the reason why antigen-specific IgM antibodies are beneficial and antigen-specific IgG antibodies are inconsequential, we will: SA1. Obtain IgM and IgG anti-MGO-p220 antibodies for structural comparison, by sorting single cells and PCR amplifying expressed immunoglobulin for sequence analysis. SA2. Express native and mix-and-match IgM vs IgG antibodies, by cloning each antibody as both IgM and IgG, and expressing IgM with and without J chain. SA3. Test the function of IgM vs IgG antibodies, by examining the ability of cloned/expressed antibodies to inhibit macrophage uptake of MGO-modified apoB100. Results of these studies will greatly increase knowledge regarding the mechanism by which IgM natural antibodies fulfill a beneficial role in atherosclerosis and IgG antibodies fail to do the same. The information generated by this work is likely to suggest new therapeutic options that involve administration of, or immunization for, specific antibodies as identified herein."
"9376988","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a public health epidemic wordwide and affects nearly a third of adult Americans. Several devastating co-morbidities are associated with obesity, including insulin resistance/type II diabetes and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Paradoxically, in obese states, lipid storage is not suppressed, in spite of resistance to insulin action. This ?nding that has important consequences for the management of obesity and its complications. An emerging molecular mechanism linking obesity to excessive lipid storage is the mTORC1/SREBP1c pathway, which our group and others have identi?ed as both activated with obesity, and as a key regulator of lipogenesis and new adipocyte formation. This study will test the hypothesis that mTORC1 activation in the obese state elevates lipid levels, due to activation of both adipogenesis and lipogenesis. To accomplish this, we have developed several new innovative models to test speci?c aspects of this hypothesis. First, we have generated adipose-speci?cTsc1 knockout mice as a model of chronic adipose mTORC1 activation. The chronic elevations in mTORC1 signaling in these mice are associated with elevated fat mass and increased hepatic steatosis, likely due to enhanced de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue. We will determine the molecular changes resulting from chronic mTORC1 elevation, and identify the molecular mechanisms underlying these mTORC1-dependent increases in lipid storage. Elevated adiposity may is caused by increased adipogenesis, so we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 positively regulates adipogenesis. We will speci?cally evaluate the hypothesis that mTORC1 regulates PPAR? mRNA stability via a miRNA-dependent mechanism. To test the role of mTORC1 in the liver, we will study both activation and inhibition this kinase via ablation of the essential mTORC1 component Rptor, and Tsc1 respectively in adult mouse livers. This approach will allow us to evaluate whether mTORC1 is necessary and suf?cient for the development and maintenance of hepatic steatosis in adult liver tissues for the ?rst time. This is an important gp in our knowledge, since in obesity-associated liver disease, mTORC1 is not activated during development, but co-incident with elevations in adiposity. We will explore the physiological signi?cance of a positive feedback loop in SREBP1c using genome-edited rats. This key mTORC1 target plays an important role in de novo lipogenesis and the ampli?cation of SREBP1c action by a transcriptional feed-forward circuit has been proposed to be an important component of both diet-induced hepatic steatosis and obesity. By deleting only the relevant SRE at the endogenous Srebf1 locus, we can test the importance of this circuit in a controlled and direct manner. Importantly, these rats will also allow us to separate the direct activation of SREBP1c by mTORC1 and other signals, from the confounding effects of positive feedback. Together these studies will answer fundamental mechanistic questions regarding how mTORC1 and SREBP1c regulate adipogenesis and lipogenesis, providing insights into potential routes of therapeutic intervention for obesity and liver disease."
"9243746","Project Summary/Abstract Recent advances in genomic technology have led to quantitatively measuring the transcript abundance in a single cell, creating an unprecedented opportunity to investigate important biological questions that can only be answered at the single-cell level such as early cell development, cell identity and changes in cell state. This technology has already led to new biological discoveries by associating changes in the transcript profiles of individual cells with phenotypes including immune response, treatment and disease.  However, this technology also presents new statistical and computational challenges that need to be addressed to accurately interpret this data. While some methods developed for measuring transcript levels in bulk populations of cells can be used for single-cell data, such as aligning raw sequencing reads to the genome, other steps in the processing, such as normalization and quality control, require new methods to account for the additional sources of variability visible only at the single-cell level. Failure to account for the additional cell-to-cell variability leads to systematic errors and biased results in downstream analyses including differential expression detection, classification of cell types and quantification of transcriptional heterogeneity. The overall goals of the proposed research are to develop novel statistical methods that will 1) remove these systematic errors induced from this high-resolution technology by accounting for variability visible only at the single-cell level and 2) quantify biological variability such as transcriptional heterogeneity within and between populations of cells.  My long-term goal is to obtain the skills necessary for me to become a highly capable, independent scientist poised to bring significant statistical and methodological advances to the rapidly evolving field of genomics and transcriptomics at the single-cell level. Specifically, this award will provide the training, mentoring and career development to accomplish my research goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty at a research university with independent funding. At the completion of this award, I will become part of a new generation of researchers, proficient in statistics, computational biology and functional genomics, enabling me to work closely with biomedical researchers profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells."

"9204747","Project Summary/Abstract: Cancer Control (CC)  The over-arching goal of the Cancer Control (CC) Program is to reduce cancer risk and mortality and to  improve the quality of care and quality of life for individuals and populations. Program members conduct  cancer behavioral research, addressing the adoption of cancer-causing behaviors by adolescents and young  adults, and health services research, addressing the impact of emerging technologies and health care policies  on cancer care and outcomes across the continuum from prevention to screening and treatment. Working  together through inter-disciplinary teams that include physician-scientists, behavioral and communications  scientists, functional brain scientists, psychologists, decision scientists, economists, statisticians, geospatial  and health services researchers; 35 program members from 11 departments actively are pursuing six  scientific themes: (1) Media and marketing influences on adoption of tobacco, alcohol and eating behaviors  during adolescence; (2) Tobacco regulatory research, (3) Geospatial research addressing how local geography  affects cancer behaviors and outcomes; (4) Comparative effectiveness of emerging cancer screening and  treatment technologies; (5) Studies that characterize how practice variation and health care reform affect  cancer care and outcomes; and (6) Effective communication of the benefits and harms of cancer screening  and treatments, to foster informed choice and enhanced survivorship through decision support. Translational  goals include establishing the scientific basis for regulatory policies, aimed at tobacco and other cancer  causing behaviors, and for policies that guide cancer screening and the delivery of cancer care. Major  program accomplishments include establishing a scientific basis for policies to limit movie smoking cues and  translating those findings into policies that reduced exposure, publishing paradigm-shifting studies on  overdiagnosis as it relates to cancer screening and diagnosis, conducting practice-changing clinical trials that  affected recommendations for lung cancer screening and early palliative care, and delivering cancer care to  the rural underserved. Program Co-Directors actively recruit scientists and foster a stimulating inter-  disciplinary research environment through monthly research group meetings (behavior and health services),  working group meetings (lung screening, decision support/survivorship), quarterly full program meetings, and  active mentorship of Program members. NCCC further supports CC Program research through pilot funding  and strategic recruitments of new investigators, including early-stage investigators who have strengthened CC  ties with The Dartmouth Institute.

"9197279","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are chronic myeloid malignancies characterized by overproduction of myeloid lineage cells. An acquired JAK2V617F mutation, which results in constitutive activation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase, has been found in a majority of patients with MPNs. This has led to the development of JAK2 inhibitors. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, has been approved for treatment of hydroxyurea-resistant PV and advanced MF. Although Ruxolitinib therapy can reduce splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms, it failed to produce complete remission in patients with PV/MF. It has become clear that current chemotherapies including JAK2 inhibitors are not sufficient to cure MPNs. So, there is a critical need to develop novel targeted therapies for MPNs. We have found that SHP2 is constitutively phosphorylated/activated in mouse and human MPN cells expressing JAK2V617F. SHP2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a positive role in cell signaling. In preliminary studies, we have observed that knockdown of SHP2 significantly inhibits proliferation of cells expressing JAK2V617F. Moreover, deletion of SHP2 inhibits the development of PV and MF in JAK2V617F knock-in mice. Furthermore, treatment with a novel SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 significantly inhibits the growth of JAK2V617F-positive MPN cells. So, we hypothesize that SHP2 may play important roles in hematopoietic transformation/MPNs induced by JAK2V617F, and pharmacologic inhibition of SHP2 might be efficacious against MPNs. To test our hypothesis, we have proposed two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will further define the role of SHP2 in the development and maintenance of PV and MF using floxed SHP2 and conditional JAK2V617F knock-in mice. In Aim 2, we will determine the safety and efficacy of a novel SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 against cultured and primary MPN cells and animal models of PV and MF. We will also determine the effects of SHP2 deletion or inhibition on JAK2V617F-evoked signaling and define the mechanism by which SHP2 regulates JAK2V617F-induced transformation/MPNs. Our proposed studies will provide the first demonstration that SHP2 plays an important role in the development of MPNs (PV and MF) and targeting of SHP2 using small molecule inhibitor 11a-1 is a novel strategy in treating MPNs. Moreover, results from these pre-clinical studies will generate the supportive data for Phase I/II clinical trials of SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 in the treatment of MPNs."
"9239664","The humoral response to malaria is critical in the control of blood stage parasitemia and the breadth of the antibody response is protective against the development of clinical malaria. It is not understood why some children fail to develop adequate humoral immune responses to Plasmodium infection early in life. Both Plasmodium falciparum malaria and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) are childhood infections in sub- Saharan Africa. The majority of children become seropositive for EBV within the first years of life, an event that is normally asymptomatic but accompanied by potent immunosuppression. The long term goal of this proposal is to provide mechanistic evidence that overlapping acute gammaherpesvirus coin- fections are responsible for suppressing the development of humoral immunity during Plasmodium in- fection in children. Using well-established mouse models of EBV (MHV68) and malaria the objective of this proposal is to identify how acute MHV68 co-infections suppress the development of anti-malaria humoral immunity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the induction of IL-10 by M2 in MHV68-infected B cells impairs the ability of T follicular helper cells to provide B cell help for effective antibody production to incoming Plasmodium infection. This hypothesis has been formulated from our published and preliminary data showing that M2 induces substantial amount of IL-10 in MHV68-infected B cells and that MHV68 can only suppress humoral immune responses to both primary and challenge Plasmodium infection when it can synthesize the M2 protein. The rationale for the proposed work is that the development of new therapeutic strategies to ensure protective humoral immunity develops in chil- dren depends on an understanding of the contributing factors that prevent the development of the hu- moral response in the first place. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be test- ed by pursuing 3 specific aims:  Aim 1: Dissect how Tfh cells respond to an incoming Plasmodium infection in the context  of IL-10 secretion from MHV68-infected B cells  Aim 2: Determine whether M2 is sufficient to globally suppress anti-Plasmodium humoral  immune responses  Aim 3: Demonstrate that humoral immunity to P. falciparum in children is reduced during  acute immunosuppressive EBV infection The approach is innovative because to our knowledge we are the first to propose that impaired anti- malarial humoral responses could be a result of a gammaherpesvirus mediated suppression. The p- roposed research is significant because it is expected to advance understanding of how the develop- ment of immunity to malaria can be adversely impacted by viral co-infections"

"9203064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal links a series of innovative AAV gene therapy experiments in two well-established animal models of alpha-mannosidosis with preclinical toxicology studies to develop a path forward to a first-in-human clinical trial of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-delivered gene therapy for this illness. The Kaler lab has treated a mouse model of Menkes disease using CSF-directed AAV5 gene therapy via efficient transduction of choroid plexus epithelia. The choroid plexuses (CP) are highly vascularized structures that project into the ventricles of the brain. The polarized epithelia of the CP produce CSF and secrete a large number of proteins. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) could potentially benefit from a CP-targeted approach because AAV transduction results in sustained episomal transgene expression and CP epithelia have a slow rate of turnover. The Wolfe lab has shown that AAV gene transfer into the brains of animal models of LSDs can mediate substantial but incomplete cellular correction and clinical improvement. The advantage of targeting CSF flow is that it extends throughout the ventricular system to the subarachnoid space, from which molecules ultimately reach the entire brain. Intrathecal delivery of purified recombinant lysosomal enzyme (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT) has been successful in ameliorating some brain pathology in animal models and recently in a human clinical trial. However, a major drawback to this approach is the need for repeated intrathecal injections due to short half- lives of recombinant enzymes. An alternative long-term strategy is to remodel CP epithelial cells with an AAV vector to secrete enzyme of interest. CP epithelia have an extremely slow turnover rate, thus this approach could generate a permanent source of enzyme production for secretion into the CSF and penetration to brain structures. Furthermore, intraventricular injection AAV vectors can deliver the normal gene to some of the parenchymal cells, which can then also secrete normal enzyme into extracellular spaces for delivery to other cells. A two-year NIH Bench-to-Bedside Award (R21 equivalent) supported the initial evaluation of this hypothesis in animal models of alpha-mannosidosis (AMD), a prototypical LSD. This U01 proposal expands that effort with the goal of completing the pre-clinical studies needed to submit a phase I clinical trial IND in 3-4 years. We propose to: 1) Evaluate the relative abilities of different AAV-vector serotypes to support CSF- directed AAV transduction in a mouse model of AMD and test the most promising serotypes in the much larger brain of the AMD cat, with the goal of identifying the vector that is most likely to produce the greatest benefit in human clinica trials; 2) Establish clinical and biochemical features in AMD patients for outcome measures in a future clinical trial; and 3) Perform preclinical toxicology studies in non-human primates and develop regulatory approval for a first-in-human gene therapy trial for AMD. The potential impact on clinical practice in the field of LSD is high since, if the proposed aims are successfully achieved, the largest current barriers to health for patients with AMD and other LSDs with brain disease would be circumvented."

"9242168","Project Summary Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subset of T lymphocytes that sit at the boarder of adaptive and innate immunity. They have highly restricted T cell receptors (TCRs) that detect glycolipid antigen presented by the non-classical MHC molecule CD1d and they respond rapidly to antigen or cytokine stimulation. NKT cells play an important role in anti-microbial immune responses and because of their rapid production of multiple cytokines they are being considered as therapeutic agents in cancer and other diseases. NKT cells acquire their effector phenotype as a consequence of their unique mechanism of selection and differentiation in the thymus. The range of effector fates that NKT cells can acquire is only beginning to be appreciated but the mechanisms controlling NKT cell effector fate choice are completely unknown. Our research is directed at understanding the molecular mechanisms that control iNKT cell development with a focus on the E protein transcription factors, their inhibitors the ID proteins, and their downstream targets. These proteins are critical regulators of iNKT cell numbers and effector cell fate choice. In this grant application we propose experiments to determine the requirements for E2A in iNKT cell development an the consequences of over- and under-expression of two putative E2A target genes, Lef1 and Bcl6. Our studies will have a major impact on our understanding of how NKT cell number and function is regulated. In addition, our studies will provide insight into mechanisms to manipulate NKT cell effector fate and thereby alter immune responses at their inception."

Studying these supposedly uncultivable bacteria presents a major challenge to the field. Members of the applicant division TM7 phylum are the most prevalent yet elusive of these bacteria. TM7 has been found in various human body sites and environmental samples, and also been linked to human mucosal diseases, particularly severe and ulcerative periodontitis, vaginosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, the impact of this study is twofold: it will increase our knowledge of uncultivable bacteria and will illuminate the pathogenic potential of TM7 members.  Using novel cultivation methods, our lab recently cultured the first TM7 member (TM7x) attached to the surface of a previously uncultivated Actinomyces odontolyticus strain (XH001) from the oral cavity. TM7x was not able to grow on its own, suggesting that the presence of XH001 is crucial to TM7x's survival. In contrast, XH001 had accelerated cell death and sporulation in presence of TM7x. This type of epibiotic parasite interaction is completely novel and has never been observed in oral microbiota. Furthermore, TM7x, when associated with XH001, can prevent the induction of TNFa gene expression by macrophages, suggesting its possible role in modulating the immune response. Yet many questions remain unanswered: Why does TM7x need XH001? Does TM7x adhere to the surfaces of other oral bacteria? What are their individual and combined pathogenic potentials? Based on our initial findings, I hypothesize that physical and/or metabolic interactions between TM7x and XH001 are crucial for the growth of TM7x and have a great impact on their pathogenicity. Uncovering this interaction at the molecular level will elucidate th impact of TM7x on human health and disease.  To explore these hypotheses, I will carry out four interconnected but independent aims: (1) I will first thoroughly characterize the morphological and physiological changes of TM7x and XH001 during different stages of co-culture growth. (2) I will next analyze the global gene expression of each growth stage to uncover the underlying genetics of the observed morphological changes. (3) I will manipulate gene expression of TM7x or XH001 to further evaluate the interaction between TM7x and XH001. (4) Once I understand the interaction between TM7x and XH001, I will apply this knowledge to study the pathogenic potential of TM7x in association with XH001."

"9188007","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Myocardial infarction and its consequences are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Earlier studies by us have uncovered key roles for RAGE in myocardial infarction, as global deletion RAGE resulted in decreased myocardial necrosis, increased functional recovery and preservation of ATP compared to wildtype littermates 48 hours after ischemia/reperfusion (l/R). Our studies have uncovered that RAGE contributes to oxidative stress consequent to l/R and influences mitochondrial dysfunction that accompanies injury to the heart. A thorough approach to understanding the basic mechanisms underlying the effects of global RAGE deletion requires cell-specific dissection of the precipitating pathways of injury. Novel findings from our group during the past year enhance the direction of the proposed studies in this application: the RAGE cytoplasmic domain interacts with diaphanous-1 (mDia-1), a member of the formin homology domain protein family and an effector of Rho GTPases. mDial is essential for RAGE ligand-mediated cellular migration and activation of cdc42/rac-1. In this project, we will probe the signaling mechanisms in cardiomyocyte stresses evoked by l/R in the heart using murine models, both in the absence and presence of diabetes. We hypothesize that cardiomyocyte RAGE and mDial, highly upregulated in the murine heart after l/R, signals devastating metabolic consequences in the myocardium, which trigger mitochondrial dysfunction, in part through GSK-3n, ROCK and apoptotic events. These concepts will be explored in depth using novel RAGE and mDial floxed mice in murine models of l/R in the heart. Project 3 is integrally linked within the Program and will study cell-specific RAGE and mDia-1 signaling in myocardial infarction. Project 3 shares findings from Affymetrix gene array studies with Projects 1&2 to create integrated pathways by which RAGE signaling regulates cardiovascular stress. Project 3 uses all three Cores of the Program during all five years."
"9204749","Project Summary/Abstract: Cancer Mechanisms (CM)  The goal of the Cancer Mechanisms (CM) Program is to elucidate and characterize cellular/molecular  pathways that present opportunities to prevent cancer and to improve cancer classification and treatment. The  research interests of the program faculty range from fundamental pathway discovery in model organisms,  biochemical and cell biological approaches to understanding cell cycle and self-renewal, to elucidation of  genetic pathways that present opportunities for improved cancer diagnosis, classification, prevention, and  treatment. Furthermore, new members focusing on bioinformatic and proteomic approaches to cancer have  enhanced our intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborative opportunities. The CM program  currently has 22 members from 9 different departments whose research is organized into several overlapping  themes: 1) cell division and cancer, 2) gene expression and cancer, 3) cancer cell biology including,  metastasis and vascular biology, and 4) bioinformatic approaches to cancer. Diversity in the research  approaches and backgrounds of investigators in the CM program also is accompanied by significant overlap  between research themes, with clinical experience and observations informing basic science approaches, and  discoveries in biochemical and genetic model systems being translated to clinical trials. The Co-Directors  represent both ends of the basic and clinical research spectrum and leverage their diverse experience to  enhance collaborations through activities that include recruitment of new members, organizing specialized  regional symposia, attracting outside high-profile seminar speakers, and organizing regular programmatic  meetings, retreats and ad-hoc technical workshops; with the goal of enhancing members' cancer-oriented  research and facilitating collaborative projects. These activities have resulted in a strong collaborative group;  as evidenced by the intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic joint grants, cancer clinical trials translating  CM science themes, and publications. The program is a generator of discoveries of novel targets, pathways  and mechanisms to be studied in the clinic. The success of CM investigators was enabled by the NCCC  through the successful strategic recruitment of outstanding new faculty in the Bioinformatics theme (Cheng,  Greene), Pathology (Stan), Proteomics (Kettenbach), and in clinical/translational investigations (Dragnev [CE]),  the support of shared resources, and the provision of pilot funding. More than 271 cancer-related manuscripts  have been published over the reporting period (86 [32%] appearing in high-impact journals), many of them  representing intra-program (26=10%) or inter-program (76=28%) collaborations. Intra-programmatic involve all  22 CM program members, with 17 co-authors with other NCCC members, including several other programs,  particularly ICI, MT, and CE. Total funding for the program is currently $5.6M, of which $5.4M is peer-reviewed,  and $1.8 is from NCI."

"9195291","Project Summary/Abstract: Human skin and mucosa are composed predominantly of keratinocytes, which play a critical role in maintaining organ and organismal barriers against environmental insults. Included in such insults are endogenous and exogenous DNA toxins that cause genome instability and DNA damage. DNA repair mechanisms are a critical secondary defense once DNA damage has occurred. While all cells in the body have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to repair DNA damage, the consequences of defective repair are distinct for different organs and are likely rooted in developmental processes that remain poorly understood. Nowhere is the importance of organ-specific DNA repair more apparent than in the inherited human genome instability disorder Fanconi Anemia (FA), wherein every cell in the body is incapable of repairing certain types of DNA damage properly. A universal molecular feature of the disease is the absence of the FA DNA repair pathway. Clinical features of the disease include congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure and, curiously, a unique susceptibility to keratinocyte transformation. FA patients exhibit an extreme susceptibility to squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the skin and mucosa early in life, and we have recently uncovered novel adhesion defects in normal-appearing patient skin using electron microscopic studies. The role of the FA pathway in normal keratinocytes and developmental origins for defective tissue homeostasis and SCC predisposition will be examined here. I hypothesize, based on preliminary data, that FA pathway loss impairs signaling and barrier functions of somatic epidermal stem and progenitor cells (ESPCs) and that these abnormalities, in turn, promote tissue defects in 3D engineered models of skin as well as ultimately SCC susceptibility and progression. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel developmental system wherein induced pluripotent stem cells generated from FA patients are inducibly complemented to reconstitute FA pathway function and differentiated into keratinocytes and 3D epidermis. All experimental elements of the projects are in place and I anticipate a learning experience which will allow me to gain a comprehensive understanding of developmental processes leading to defective somatic ESPCs and resulting inherited disease susceptibilities as a solid academic career foundation."
"9187929","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The homozygous RAGE null mouse formed the centerpiece of discoveries during the last cycle of this Program. We demonstrated that RAGE plays critical roles in atheroscierosis in apoE null mice, mediates upregulation of pro-inflammatory and tissue-destructive genes in hypoxia, and mediates loss of cardiac function in the heart upon ischemia/reperfusion (l/R). Multiple novel findings shape the direction of our Program: first, we discovered that the RAGE cytoplasmic domain interacts with diaphanous-1 (mDia-1), a member of the formin homology domain protein family and an effector of RhoGTPases. mDia-1 is essential for RAGE ligand-mediated cellular migration and activation of cdc42/rac-1. New discoveries link mDial to key properties of smooth muscle cells, macrophages and cardiomyocyte signaling. Second, Project 2 has discovered the unanticipated finding that RAGE plays opposing roles in acute vs. chronic hypoxia/ischemia on regulation of Egr-1 in endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages. Third, Project 1 has discovered that RAGE downregulates ABCG1 and cholesterol efflux to HDL. Fourth, Project 3 has discovered that deletion of mDial is highly protective in the heart in l/R. As a Program, we have shared not merely tools and strategies by virtue of our Core units but, more importantly, we have sought to understand the big picture of RAGE signaling. As our data unfold, we recognize that RAGE signaling is not one size fits all, as new discoveries have uncovered distinct pathways of regulation by the receptor depending on cell type, duration of stress, and specific form of cellular stress. The challenge is to put it together. Toward this end, we have generated novel RAGE- and mDial floxed to probe cell-specific signaling of this axis in atherosclerosis (Project 1), angiogenesis (Project 2) and myocardial infarction (Project 3). Taken together, these discoveries form the basis of a highly innovative and significant set of questions testing RAGE and mDial signaling in vascular dysfunction in diabetic- and non-diabetic cardiovascular pathology. Using novel and state-of-the-art techniques, floxed mice and molecular approaches to gene regulation, we are well-positioned to lead the study of RAGE in the next cycle of this Program."
"9223096","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) persists as a major public health problem, and TB infections are increasingly resistant to the drugs typically used to treat them. Data exist ? including results from in vitro and animal experiments, pharmacological evaluations of existing and novel tuberculosis drugs, past successful and unsuccessful clinical trials of tuberculosis treatment regimens, epidemiologic data, and clinical experience ? that might be useful in optimizing tuberculosis treatment. But TB care lacks frameworks to integrate that wealth of data and apply it in clinical decision-making. This mentored clinical scientist research career development award will allow the recipient to develop a research career pursuing more effective tuberculosis treatment regimens, through the development and testing of mechanistic models based on data from a variety of sources. The recipient of this award is a translational and computational investigator and an infectious diseases physician at Johns Hopkins University, with a background in laboratory and clinical research and a growing proficiency in the mathematical modeling of drug-resistant tuberculosis epidemics. During this award period, she will be mentored by a team whose expertise spans preclinical TB drug development, clinical trials of TB treatment, computational pharmacology, and population-level TB modeling. As a long-term career goal, the recipient aims to guide successful tailoring of tuberculosis therapy to individual patients, based on their personal characteristics, on the TB strains with which they are infected, and on their particular epidemiologic setting. In the short term, the proposed research focuses on first identifying TB patients in whom drug resistance is likely to emerge during treatment and then developing strategies to mitigate that risk. In this project, a model of TB treatment will be developed which incorporates detailed dynamics of drug resistance and the impact of resistance on overall regimen efficacy. Simulated treatment courses will be used to identify risk factors for treatment failure or new drug resistance and potential strategies for preventing those unfavorable outcomes. Then, data and specimens from ongoing TB clinical trials of novel regimens will be analyzed to understand how drug-resistant subpopulations within patient's TB infections impact those patients' responses to treatment. Finally, a population-level model will be developed that evaluates the interplay between TB treatment regimens' efficacy, their barriers to resistance, accompanying drug susceptibility tests, and treatment algorithms. This model will be used to improve implementation of novel TB treatment regimens in a way that maximizes benefit to patients while preventing spread of resistance to TB drugs. This mentored research will be accompanied by relevant skills training in TB pharmacology, advanced statistical methods, and pharmacometric, within-host, and population-level modeling. Collectively, this research and career development training provide a pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator focused on optimizing and individualizing the treatment of tuberculosis."
"9221779","Project Summary/Abstract Imaging plays a critical role in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of neuroblastoma (NB). Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is extensively used for imaging NB and is recommended for staging and follow-up of NB. In this early-phase study, we are evaluating a novel radiotracer, meta-fluorobenzylguanidine, or 18F-MFBG. We hypothesize that imaging with this positron-labeled analog of MIBG will provide a more convenient single-day imaging alternative using superior scanning technology (PET/CT or PET/MR) and enhanced quantitative assessment of disease in these NB patients. Imaging with 123I-MIBG is limited in several respects, including: a) inferior image quality related to the physical properties of the isotope that limit the dose of tracer that can be administered and the technology of the gamma camera and single photon imaging (SPECT), which has lower resolution than PET imaging; b) need for an imaging agent that not only targets lesions but also provides a superior high-contrast image to assess organs such as lung and liver; c) less optimal modality (SPECT imaging) due to limited ability to quantify uptake or measure metabolic activity of disease; and d) inconvenient two-day imaging process that requires injection on Day 1, followed by imaging on Day 2 to allow for optimal uptake of the tracer by the tumor and clearance of background activity [best target-to-background (T/BG) ratio]. An imaging modality that is more convenient and allows for superior quantification of disease is critically needed. PET imaging is superior to SPECT (higher resolution and ability to quantify lesion uptake and metabolic activity), and 18F-MFBG is a fluoride-labeled analog of MIBG with targeting properties similar to MIBG. The positron emitter 18F allows for imaging with a PET scanner and can provide high-contrast images with high T/BG ratios within one to three hours post-injection, a significantly more convenient option for patients than waiting 24 hours and returning to the clinic. The lesion uptake and distribution can be quantified with 18F-MFBG PET imaging. Additionally, imaging with 18F-MFBG will allow for combined PET/MR imaging, thereby reducing the radiation dose through the elimination of the CT component of PET/CT and its associated ionizing radiation. We hypothesize that PET imaging with 18F-MFBG will be safe and feasible and will target NB lesions comparable to or better than 123I-MIBG. Due to a convenient one-day imaging schema and PET imaging with PET/CT or PET/MR, this novel radiotracer is expected to play a critical role and replace 123I-MIBG for imaging of NB in the future. This is a Phase I/IIa study for early assessment of this novel imaging agent. Results of this study will be used to plan larger Phase II studies and, if successful, Phase III studies for validation of results and with the ultimate goal of achieving FDA approval."

"9228756","Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of many cancers. First observed by Warburg, tumor cells switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (MOP) to aerobic glycolysis (AG). AG is less energy efficient than MOP, but it appears to confer advantages to rapidly proliferating cells through formation of metabolic by- products that can be incorporated into membrane lipids, signaling molecules, amino acids and nucleotides. Enzymes that contribute to de novo lipogenesis, the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, have been shown to be overexpressed in a number of human cancers. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) catalyzes the synthesis of palmitic acid from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA and in recent years has been shown ex v ivo to be overexpressed in cancers, including breast, prostate, colorectal and glioma, and to contribute to drug resistance. Overexpression of FASN is associated with a poor prognosis. As e xpression of FASN in normal tissue is very low, and FASN appears to play an i mportant role in tumor proliferation and malignancy, it has been proposed as a therapeutic target in various cancers. Inhibition of FASN has been shown to induce apoptosis, reduce tumor growth and impart chemosensitivity in multiple cancers including breast and prostate. Clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer involves prostate-specific antigen blood screening and biopsy. Patients are typically stratified according to clinical T-score, PSA count and Gleason score. At present, it remains difficult to distinguish between patients with aggressive and indolent forms of the disease, and new biomarkers for prostate cancer are necessary to better predict outcome and response to therapy. FASN has been proposed as a promising candidate biomarker, but its relevance has not been assessed in vivo by non-invasive means. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a r apidly growing diagnostic field that enables the non- invasive study of disease. This project proposes to develop a small series of FASN inhibitors labeled with carbon-11 or fluorine-18 for imaging FASN expression in prostate cancer cell lines and mouse xenograft models. To assess FASN expression, a series of novel tracers labeled with 11C or 18F will be synthesized based on the most potent FASN inhibitors reported to date. To our knowledge this project represents the first attempt to study FASN expression via molecular imaging using inhibitors of the enzyme. If successful, this program will provide new radiolabeled probes to identify and quantify FASN expression in vivo using non-invasive PET imaging. This capability will provide a tool to study FASN biology, identify FASN positive tumors and identify patients who may benefit from anti-FASN therapy. Significant prognostic value may be attained by noninvasive monitoring of FASN expression during disease progression and over the course of therapeutic interventions. This is particularly intriguing in light of the recent reports of FASN therapies in tumor bearing animals and promising antitumor effects in early clinical trials."

"9182886","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although frailty is generally considered to be a geriatric syndrome, individuals with chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk for premature frailty. Many patients on hemodialysis are frail, including a sizeable proportion of those under age 65. Frailty is a syndrome resulting from cumulative declines in multiple physiologic systems, leading to impaired homeostatic reserve and decreased capacity to withstand stress. Operational definitions of frailty vary, but two general approaches have emerged: a deficit accumulation approach, in which an individual's impairments and conditions are summed to create a frailty index and a physical frailty phenotype characterized by a set of components that include weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, and poor physical performance or self-reported physical function or various proxies thereof. Frailty is associated with higher risk of adverse outcomes, such as hospitalization and death among community-dwelling elders and among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, in whom the prevalence of frailty is much higher than even the general elderly population.  Studies exploring correlates of frailty in the dialysis population have focused on the frailty phenotype approach and have emphasized demographics and comorbidities rather than potentially modifiable risk factors or pathophysiology. Specifically, the potential contributions of inflammation, hormone abnormalities, fluid overload, myokines, and polypharmacy have been under-investigated despite their potential for remediation. In addition, frailty has generally been treated as a stati condition, with studies determining outcomes after a single baseline assessment of frailty. A better understanding of the development, and in some cases, resolution of frailty could lead to better insight into its prevention and treatment. Finally, there has been little comparison of the prognostic information afforded by different definitions of frailty or by the individual components of frailty constructs among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The objective of this application is to thoroughly characterize frailty among patients on hemodialysis - its origins and clinical correlates, its trajectory, and factors related to its development and resolution. The rationale for undertaking these analyses is to gather information that can be used to prevent or mitigate frailty and its sequelae. We propose to leverage the data collected in a USRDS special study cohort, additional analyses of stored serum samples, and linkage to outcome information available in the USRDS to accomplish the following specific aims: Aim 1: Elucidate the underpinnings of physical frailty among patients on hemodialysis and identify potentially remediable correlates. Aim 2: Determine trajectories of frailty, focusing on risk factors for development and resolution of frailty. Aim 3: Determine the extent to which frailty predicts adverse outcomes, including death, hospitalization, development of disability, transition to a higher level of care, falls, and fractures."

"9405179","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opiates remain among the most useful and important class of drugs in medicine, but not without problems. The recognition of the importance of treating pain has led to an increase in their overall use and, with it, an increase in diversion an abuse. Drugs capable of producing analgesia lacking these unwanted actions would be a major advance in treating pain and minimizing drug abuse. Our laboratory has synthesized a series of analogs targeting a new opioid site that have a superior pharmacological profile. They are potent analgesics, as much as 100-fold that of morphine, and yet they display no respiratory depression, physical dependence, reinforcing behavior or cross tolerance to morphine. Our goal in this proposal is to further expand the structure-activity of these compounds by using two scaffolds that have not been examined previously on this target. We also propose to design and synthesize additional chemical probes suitable for further exploring the pharmacology of opioids and the biochemical mechanisms of their actions. This work will focus upon the generation of novel radiolabeling techniques to permit the identification of potential new targets and affinity labels."
"9218472","Project Summary The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the most effective means of detecting and treating arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). However, the main limitation of the current ICD technology is that it aims to terminate an arrhythmia only after the arrhythmia has started. Given that failure, delay or false decision in detecting VT/VF are life-threatening concerns, the next generation of ICD technology should be able to prevent arrhythmias from starting, rather than terminating them after their initiation. Repolarization alternans (RA), a pattern of variation in the shape of electrocardiographic waveform that appears on an every other beat basis, has been associated with increased vulnerability to VT/VF and sudden cardiac death (SCD). In this paradigm shift grant application we propose to investigate the hypothesis that therapy application by an ICD before the abnormal heart rhythm develops will provide a significant improvement not only in preventing SCD, but also in patient acceptance of ICD therapy and quality of life. We have developed a prototype system that can both estimate RA in real-time from intracardiac electrograms and deliver electrical pulses that are timely coupled to cardiac electrical activity. In this proposal we will investigate the applicability of RA-triggered delivery of clinically appropriate electrical therapy to suppress/terminate RA and prevent the development of VT/VF in an animal model of ischemic cardiomyopathy in ambulatory animals. To achieve the aims of this proposal we will (i) determine the efficacy of timely delivered pacing pulses in reducing/suppressing repolarization alternans and preventing the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias; (ii) determine whether altered heart rate variability reduces/suppresses repolarization alternans and prevents the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias; (iii) determine whether RA-triggered therapy can reduce/suppress repolarization alternans and prevent the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in ambulatory animals."

We propose to integrate genomics data to uncover causal variants in complex traits and diseases, and to highlight their specific influence on relevant cell types, transcription factors and regulated genes. The contribution of this proposal is a systems-level analysis of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that integrate genetic, epigenetic and gene expression data, to uncover disease-causal non-coding variants by quantifying their effect on transcription factor binding sites for different chromatin states. The innovation of the proposed research consists in the use of novel computational strategies based on statistical and information theoretic approaches, and a web platform that will make the results and tools derived from the proposed research, broadly available and accessible to the scientific community. The experimental strategy will offer an important and general framework for scrutinizing epigenetic and genetic variations, and for generating insights and testable hypotheses to reveal causal genetic variants that underlie complex traits and diseases. We expect that our findings will promote future development of personalized therapeutic approaches. Candidate Career Goals: Dr. Pinello's career goal is to become an independent investigator to systematically study the sources of variation that affect gene regulation in complex traits and diseases by linking genetic and epigenetic variation. The K99/R00 award will give him the protected time needed to obtain the additional knowledge and expertise necessary to achieve this goal. The proposed research is complemented by a structured plan that spells out specific training activities and career development components. Dr. Pinello will supplement his hands-on training with formal coursework and specific mentored research exploration focused in three main areas: Medical Genetics, Functional Genomics and Experimental Techniques. To oversee his training and proposed research, Dr. Pinello has assembled a mentoring team with complementary skills. By combining expertise in epigenetic and gene regulation with population and medical genetics, at the end of the award period Dr. Pinello will have developed a broad set of skills and a research focus that is distinct from his current lab. He will thus be a fully qualified independent investigator. Environment: The Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard School of Public Health has a distinguished record of training successful scientists, and is an excellent environment for conducting research. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and the hospitals and institutions of the Partners Consortium provide a rich and vibrant academic environment in Boston and Cambridge."
"9250304","Project Summary We are requesting support for graduate student and postdoctoral fellow registration fees for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) in Quantitative Genetics and Genomics. Since its inception, this series of conferences has focused on the development and application of statistical methods in genetics and genomics, with special emphasis on complex trait, population and evolutionary genetics/genomics. One of the unique features of the meeting is that it brings together leaders in the fields of human, animal, plant and model organism genetics, which always leads to very productive and stimulating exchanges. Another exciting aspect of the meeting is the affiliated Gordon Research Seminar, organized and run by and for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. The GRC provides many opportunities for early-career scientists to get involved at the frontiers of science, the most notable of which is the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) program. Gordon Research Seminars are a series of highly successful and unique meetings that enable young researchers to share in the GRC experience. Each seminar is held in conjunction with a related GRC and begins the weekend immediately prior to the GRC. Graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education come together in a highly-stimulating and non-intimidating environment to discuss their current research and build informal networks with their peers that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. These seminars are organized by young investigators with the support of leading scientists from the associated GRC. The specific goals of the 2017 Gordon Research Seminar on Quantitative Genetics & Genomics are to a) create an informal and friendly atmosphere that encourages graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to engage in discussions with leaders in the field, b) provide a forum for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to discuss their latest unpublished research and network with their peers, c) introduce students and postdoctoral fellows to broader scientific ideas and disciplines, with the goal of stimulating future cross- discipline research, and d) provide a primer on fundamental concepts of quantitative genetics and genomics to facilitate enhanced understanding of topics in the GRC. In this proposal, we request funds to support the attendance of US-based graduate student and post-doctoral trainees. We propose to support attendance at both the Gordon Research Seminar and Gordon Research Conference."
"9238168","Drugs targeting the estrogen receptor (ER) in breast cancer have been extremely successful in controlling the disease for many patients, however acquired resistance is frequently encountered. We have identified recurrent mutations in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER among a high percentage of patients with such acquired resistance. We have found that the two most frequent mutations promote an agonist conformation despite the absence of ligand, cause resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AI), associate with poor clinical outcomes, and may be targeted by certain ER antagonists. However, we have more recently found that a spectrum of clinical ESR1 mutations exists. Our data reveal that there is diversity in the mechanisms whereby different mutants alter ER function as well as diversity in the impact of different mutations on ER conformation and activity. The overall hypothesis of this project is that different ER LBD mutations share an ability to promote some level of estrogen-independent receptor activity but have distinctive potencies in driving tumor phenotypes and promoting drug resistance. In this proposal, we will establish the mechanisms whereby different ESR1 mutations promote ER activity, characterize the gene expression programs driven by different mutations, understand the implications of different mutations for sensitivity to ER inhibition, identify likely routes of resistance to ER antagonists in ER mutant disease, and develop rational combinations to durably treat ER mutant cancer. To accomplish these goals, we will generate cell line models into which ER mutants have been knocked-in and patient derived organoid and xenograft models. We will evaluate existing ER antagonists and develop novel inhibitors to identify compounds that potently inhibit various ER mutants. Finally, we will use in vitro screens and tumor biopsies to characterize likely mechanisms of resistance to newer ER antagonists and nominate pharmacologic strategies to overcome these."
"9227421","PROJECT SUMMARY Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and have been one of the greatest threats to human health. Despite their ubiquity and impact, less than 0.01% of viruses are identified and well-characterized. Recent study showed that there are about 108 different viral species while only a few hundred of them have been studied. One major roadblock to isolating and studying viruses is the inability to grow them in culture. In fact, most of the known viruses cannot be grown in the laboratory. Another limiting factor in the study of viruses is the relatively low abundance of virus particles present in complex specimens such as human tissue or bodily fluids. This application seeks support to build new platforms enabling genome sequencing of single virions and isolation of extremely rare virions. Single virion sequencing will eliminate the need for establishing cultivable virus-host system and enable genome sequencing of uncultivable viruses directly from environmental samples. The new platform will integrate metagenomics, drop-based microfluidics, and up-to-date molecular biology techniques. Drop-based microfluidics is a technique that utilizes micron size channels to precisely control and manipulate small volumes of fluids separated by immiscible phase at a very high throughput. Within an hour, a microflulidic drop maker generates millions of picoliter-size test tubes that function as reaction vessels. In addition, individual droplets can be merged to add reagents, split to subtract droplet contents, or passed through a fluorescence detection system to detect droplets that are positive to the assays at the rate of ~ 1000/s. Droplet microfluidic techniques will be used to encapsulate single virions into micron-sized drops, perform single virus assays, and select target virions at an extremely high throughput. Metagenomics is the study of genetic materials recovered directly from environmental samples and enables researchers to sample all DNA fragments in a given sample. Metagenomic analysis will be used to identify the partial sequence of a target virus, and these sequences will be used to detect and isolate the target virus from a complex biological mixture. The first platform we propose will enable isolation and genome sequencing of a single selected virion. Using the platform, we will identify the genome sequence of novel viruses that are potentially human pathogens, African swine fever-like virus (ASFLV) and human rhino-like virus (HRLV). The second platform we propose will enable parallelized sequence analysis of single intact virions. We will use this platform to perform high throughput sequencing of single virions that are randomly sampled from untreated wastewater. Recent studies indicate that the vast majority of virions in wastewater are novel viruses; therefore, high-throughput genome sequencing of single virions in wastewater will reveal the genome sequence of diverse novel viruses. The successful merging of microfluidics and metagenomics towards the characterization of viral genomes will not only help identifying novel viruses that can be possible threats to humans but also open new avenues for the investigation of virus diversity, evolution, and adaptation."
"9403298","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a competing continuation of T32-NR-007104 that began in 1999. The request is for 5 pre- doctoral and 4 post-doctoral trainees. Our proposal is responsive to the Institute of Medicine's recommendation to double the number of nurses with doctoral degrees by 2020. We place high priority on the recruitment of BSN to PhD students, targeting the recruitment of nurses to doctoral study who had not previously decided upon a research career in order to increase the pipeline into PhD education. We have made curriculum changes and organizational adjustments to our mentoring program to enable successful completion of the PhD  within 3 years by trainees with and without master's degrees. Our goal is to recruit promising young nurses into  research careers and make it feasible for them to complete their training by age 30 thus enabling them to make  sustained contributions to nursing science, improved clinical care, and education of the next generation of  nurses. Ours is a formal interdisciplinary program comprising the conceptual and empirical foundations and cutting edge methodologic approaches and statistical tools of advanced outcomes research and we specialize in identifying and employing large secondary data sources. Our research priorities, reflected in the funded research of our faculty, are improved outcomes for the chronically ill, reducing health disparities, comparative effectiveness of nursing delivery systems, improved care for critically ill patients and end of life care, and outcomes across settings from hospitals to nursing homes to home care. Our curriculum for BSN to PhD research training includes a year-long course in clinical nursing in recognition that many of our high priority applicants do not have the benefit of extended clinical experience and need increased clinical exposure and mentoring in order to ask clinically-relevant research questions. Our students take coursework with our interdisciplinary affiliated faculty and our program interfaces with related training programs throughout Penn providing a network of educational opportunities for trainees that augment their experience. The program is guided conceptually by the Quality Health Outcomes Model postulating that outcomes of nursing interventions are mediated by the organizational context in which care takes place and the health status and characteristics of patients. Trainees receive state of the science education in the measurement of the organizational context of  care, patient risk adjustment methods, nurse sensitive outcome measures, spatial geography and geocoding,  comparative effectiveness methods, cost of care measurement, panel studies, and international outcomes  research. The program's first 14 years have been highly successful in terms of recruitment and program completion including by minorities, high visibility scientific publications by trainees, success of our alumni in competing for grant funds, and the placement of those who have completed their training in mainstream research positions where their research careers can flourish."
"9232858","Abstract  Chagas disease is a zoonotic tropical pathology, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Endemic in Latin America, it is one of the leading causes of congestive heart failure in the world. Historically associated with poverty in rural areas, immigration and relocation of the vectors are changing the epidemiology of the disease, as evidenced by a substantial increase in the number of cases in the US. Treatment is restricted to nifurtimox and benznidazole, both of which are relatively toxic, have limited efficacy and are not approved by the FDA. Our laboratory has been working on the rational search for chemotherapeutic treatments for Chagas disease that can selectively target the parasite without compromising human cells.  The study of the mechanisms of sensing, adaptation and survival of the parasite is important for the identification of selective drug targets that can lead to the elimination of the parasite without affecting the host. During the transformation into different life stages, T. cruzi finds extreme fluctuations in environmental conditions to which it must adapt in order to survive. Mechanosensitive channels are cation channels able to detect changes in the tension of the membranes and usually are activated by stretch of the lipid bilayer. They are considered the primary sensors of osmotic changes in a multiplicity of cells and organisms, triggering signaling pathways that drive osmoregulation. Although T. cruzi has a robust compensatory response under hyposmotic and hyperosmotic conditions, the identity of the molecules detecting changes and eliciting adaptive responses in the parasites is still unknown. Previous in silico studies suggest the presence of several putative mechanosensitive channels in T. cruzi. We have identified the presence and expression of a channel with structural features shared by small conductance mechanosensitive channels (TcMcS). TcMcS blockage by genetic and pharmacological methods affects the osmoregulatory capacity of the cells. We propose that mechanosensitive channels with homology to bacterial channels play an important role in sensing and adaptation to environmental conditions in T. cruzi, determining the success of the host cell invasion and survival of the parasite. Analysis of T. cruzi mechanosensitive channels expression profiles and localization, complemented with electrophysiological studies will shed light about the mechanism of activation and modulation of these proteins. Genetic manipulation of the level of expression and phenotypic analysis in vivo will demonstrate the physiological role of TcMcS channels in the parasite and will help establish their potential as therapeutic targets."
"9104090","Project Description    This project will conduct a systematic literature with the support of the Systematic Review Core to locate prior work on associations between variation in chiropractic care for chronic cervical pain care and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We will also conduct focus groups to evaluate the applicability of standardized PROs that assess patient experiences of care (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems or CAHPS) and health-related quality of life (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement and Information System or PROMIS) to chiropractic patients who have experienced M/M for cervical pain. This information will be used to determine if modifications to existing measures are needed and if there are gaps that require new items. Revisions to existing items and new items will then be drafted and subjected to cognitive interviews with chiropractic patients who have experienced M/M for cervical pain. The revised and new items will be finalized based on the cognitive interviews and then included along with the CAHPS Clinician and Group Adult Visit Survey and the PROMIS-57 Survey in the national sample of chiropractic patients shared by each of the four projects in this Center of Excellence.    The national sample data will be collected from a random selection of practitioners and their patients in four national sites geographically distributed across the US. Project 1 will assess the treatment given chronic cervical pain and the number of times M/M is done. Project 1 with help from the Research Methods Assessment and Evaluation Core will estimate the appropriateness of chiropractic M/M care.    We will conduct a thorough evaluation of the psychometric properties of these PRO measures in the national sample of chiropractic patients with chronic cervical pain, including an evaluation of measurement equivalence by comparing the national sample responses to data collected in large samples of other patients: the CAHPS comparative database and PROMIS wave 1 sample. In addition, we will estimate the associations between appropriateness of care (defined by Project 1) and PROs in the national sample. The health-related quality of life outcomes we use will also be useful to Project 4 (Economic Based Appropriateness), especially the EQ-5D preference-based single summary score we will estimate based on the PROMIS-57 domain scores.    This work provides an essential assessment of the applicability of the leading state-of-the-science patient centered outcome measures to CAM in terms of acceptability to chiropractic patients and psychometric quality. In addition, it provides unique information about the extent to which the current approach tor evaluating appropriateness of care relates to patient-centered outcomes of care. The findings of this study will provide a basis for future evaluations of the comparative effectiveness of CAM versus other health care interventions in the United States."
"9234668","Project Summary/Abstract Tumor-draining lymph nodes (LN) are the first site of metastasis in most types of cancer. The extent of metastasis in the LN is often used in staging cancer progression. Notably, in recent work the applicants described novel nanoscale TRAIL-coated liposomes that when conjugated to human natural killer (NK) cells enhance their endogenous therapeutic potential in killing cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In this proof-of-concept study, the applicants will target these liposomes to the LN by conjugating them to NK cells, and will investigate their ability to prevent the lymphatic spread of colon cancer tumors in mice. It will be shown that targeting NK cells with TRAIL liposomes can enhance liposome retention time within regional lymph nodes to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. If successful, the proposed approach could be used to kill cancer cells within the tumor draining LN to prevent the lymphatic spread of cancer. The proposed work is organized into three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: To examine the mechanism of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposome therapy and test their efficacy against drug- resistant colon carcinoma in a subcutaneous LN metastasis model. Sub-aim 1.1: Examine the roles of different natural killer cell receptors on super NK cytotoxicity. Sub-aim 1.2: To test the efficacy of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes to treat oxaliplatin-resistant colon cancer. Oxaliplatin is a clinically important platinum-based drug however long-term treatments with oxaliplatin have been shown to lead to the acquisition of drug resistance in colorectal cancer cells. Specific Aim 2: To characterize the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes introduced intraperitoneally. Intraperitoneal route of liposome injection will be examined to enable efficacy studies in the orthotopic colon cancer model of Aim 3. Sub-aim 2.1: To examine the whole body biodistribution and LN pharmacokinetics of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes, with special focus on the mesenteric lymph nodes. Sub-aim 2.2: To assess for toxicity in response to repeated intraperitoneal injections of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes. Specific Aim 3: To evaluate TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposome efficacy in an orthotopic model of colon cancer metastasis to the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen-to-liver metastasis. Sub- aim 3.1: Characterize the efficacy of TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes to treat orthotopic colon cancer metastasis to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Sub-aim 3.2:Treatment of secondary metastasis from the spleen to the liver with intravenous TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposomes. Colon carcinoma cells will be injected into the spleen, a lymphatic organ, to examine whether intravenous TRAIL/Anti-NK1.1 liposome treatment can also prevent or reduce secondary metastasis from the spleen to the liver. IMPACT: This innovative TRAIL-liposome based intervention will demonstrate that NK cells can be used to eliminate tumorigenic cells in the tumor-draining LN, and thus prevent the formation of LN metastases, a currently unmet need. The success of this project will establish a new platform technology for the cellular-based delivery of receptor-ligand therapeutics for the treatment of various cancers and other diseases."
"9231706","Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a novel analytic software module for tumor growth rate assessment during therapy in advanced lung cancer patients. Tumor growth rate is a novel concept for evaluation of clinical benefit of cancer therapy and is proposed as objective guides for treatment decisions, however is not included in the current standards of tumor response evaluation. The concept of tumor growth rate is especially important in patients with specific mutations in their tumors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in lung cancer, treated with personalized therapy specifically targeting their mutations. EGFR-mutant patients show initial dramatic response to targeted therapy using EGFR inhibitors; however, their tumors grow back and eventually progress. Current clinical practice lacks objective guidelines about when EGFR inhibitor therapy can be safely continued while tumors are growing back, and the decision is left to treating physicians? discretions. Similar clinical scenarios are observed during therapy using other targeting agents for various cancers, indicating an increasing clinical demand to fulfil this unmet need for objective guides for treatment decisions in the era of precision cancer therapy. Investigators of this academic-industrial partnership team have developed a method to objectively characterize of tumor growth rate over time using the serial clinical CT imaging data obtained in patients receiving cancer therapy. The method was applied to EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients as a well-studied paradigm, and provided a reproducible reference value that indicates fast versus slow growth. Given the demonstrated feasibility as a clinical investigation, the team proposes to deliver this novel analytic functionality to the clinical setting, by developing an automated analytic tool for tumor growth rate assessment and interpretation, which is essential to make the approach more widely adaptable within the clinical workflow. The academic-industrial team consists of accomplished investigators from Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women?s Cancer Center and industrial scientists from Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, with expertise in oncology, radiology, biostatistics, and engineering, who have a track record of productive collaboration. The team has started to work together to address the following aims: Aim 1) Develop an analytic software module for tumor growth rate in lung cancer during therapy, which operates on an existing workstation; Aim 2) Optimize the module based on the reproducibility assessment and user feedback in a pilot cohort of 30 EGFR-mutant patients; and Aim 3) Apply the analytic software module for tumor growth rate in lung cancer patients treated in prospective trials. Delivery of the novel analytic module for tumor growth rate to the clinical setting will provide objective guides for treatment decision making during cancer therapy, and help to maximize the benefit of precision therapy for cancer. The demonstrated productivity of academic-industrial partnership with bidirectional research relationship further ensures successful completion of the project goal."
"9238046","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The primary goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of a newly discovered mutational process called chromothripsis. Chromothripsis generates rapid karyotype evolution in cancer, congenital disease, and other contexts. Chromothripsis is characterized by extensive genomic rearrangements and an oscillating pattern of DNA copy number levels, all surprisingly restricted to one or a few chromosomes. We have made significant recent progress in defining a mechanism for chromothripsis. We showed that intact chromosomes missegregated into aberrant cancer-associated nuclear structures called micronuclei (MN) develop extensive DNA damage. This led us to propose that the physical isolation of chromosomes into MN could cause chromothripsis. Recently, we developed a method (Look-Seq) to combine live cell imaging and single cell genome sequencing, enabling us to recreate chromothripsis in the laboratory and directly demonstrate that it can originate from disrupted MN. We established that chromothripsis could arise by fragmentation and reassembly of MN chromosomes. These fragments can also circularize, potentially providing a mechanism for forming double minute chromosomes, major vehicles for oncogene amplification in cancer. The Look-Seq approach now positions the laboratory to attack the key mechanistic questions in the field: the timing and order of chromosome fragmentation and reassembly, the mechanism of MN chromosome fragmentation; and how it is reassembled. We also propose a series of experiments to define the contribution of DNA replication errors in generating localized chromosome rearrangements. Finally, we propose experiments to elucidate the mechanistic basis for two major sources of oncogene amplification in cancer."
"9196544","This application develops a Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (TCC) for Health Disparities Research  on Chronic Disease Prevention within the DHHS-defined Region 5 titled The Flint Center for Health Equity  Solutions (FCHES). Core Academic Faculty and their community partners bring significant research and practical  expertise in health equity efforts, behavioral health interventions and epidemiology, geography and the effects  of built environment on health, and physical fitness and healthy eating in economically distressed, minority-  majority communities. The TCC targets its initial activities within Flint, Michigan, with plans to extend the scope  and reach of Center activities more generally across the state and nation. The proposed TCC focuses on 3  primary populations, including: (1) underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities, (2) geographic areas with high  concentrated poverty, and (3) medically underserved communities. Within Flint, Michigan, and across the region,  these three populations reflect the most disparate populations and have the highest need for multi-level  interventions, including policy-based approaches to prevent and reduce chronic diseases. The proposed  research and activities of the TCC evaluates ways to act on the need for systemic- and policy-level interventions  to ameliorate the ?downstream? disparities in morbidity and mortality among our most marginalized populations.  Building on this body of work, the TCC will promote the most promising policy interventions to influence the  systemic and structural ?upstream? factors that promote health inequalities. Our Center relies upon a systems  approach and is transdisciplinary, collaborative, and translational. TCC activities will also include two community-  based multilevel collaborative intervention research projects, one focused on prevention of chronic physical  health disease/condition (specifically obesity and cardiovascular disease) and the other focused on prevention  of chronic behavioral health disease/condition (specifically substance abuse and mental illness). Our behavioral  health intervention program also has the potential to improve overall physical well-being for families. Our long-  range goal is to eliminate disparities in physical and behavioral health developing, implementing and  disseminating community-based multilevel interventions and creating sustainable health equity solutions in  partnership with a broad cross-section of multi-sectorial stakeholders.   The TCC?s Administrative Core will provide leadership for the Center?s overall strategic planning,  including scientific leadership and oversight using a community-based approach and the core principles of  CBPR. This Core will maintain external communications with the National Center for Minority Health and Health  Disparities, and provide administrative support for all of the Center?s components, as well as facilitate the  expansion of consortium partnerships under the umbrella of the Center. The Administrative Core will also  coordinate, administer, guide, support, review, and manage TCC activities, and facilitate collaborations within  and outside of the TCC."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the formation and maintenance of the stereociliary bundle of cochlear hair cells, and the defects in this process that cause deafness. We propose here to investigate the normal functions and the pathophysiological changes associated with Fam65b mutation that cause deafness. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that Fam65b is critical for the structural organization of stereociliary bundle of cochlear hair cells. To test our hypothesis, we will: i) continue our characterization of Fam65b(-/-) hair cells; ii) characterize Fam65b functiona domains; iii) look for interaction partners for Fam65b that functionally cooperate in hair bundle morphogenesis. Our preliminary data show the feasibility of our approach. We anticipate that our studies will shed new insights into the molecular machinery that shapes stereocilia and determines its properties. Quite possibly, our findings may link several deafness-related genes into a common molecular pathway and provide new leads for the development of therapeutic approaches for the treatment of some forms of the disease."

"9370484","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant application seeks to uncover the molecular and neural networks underlying social attachment behaviors in prairie voles. Humans form attachments at many levels of social interactions, including with spouses, family members, friends, and other members of the community. The neurobiological mechanisms that control the formation and maintenance of social attachment remain poorly understood. This is in part because traditional genetic model systems such as mice, fish, flies, and worms do not exhibit social attachment behavior as adults, precluding the use of powerful molecular genetic approaches to dissect mechanisms underlying social attachment behavior. Prairie voles are small rodents that form an enduring social bond between adults, and they also display other related afflictive behaviors. Pharmacologic studies in prairie voles have implicated vasopressin and oxytocin signaling in the control of social attachment behaviors. However, there are significant limitations of these pharmacological manipulations such that the genetic requirement of specific neuropeptide signaling pathways remains unclear. Progress in uncovering the molecular and neural circuit basis of social attachments in prairie voles has been slowed by the absence of gene targeting techniques as well as by the absence of identification of behaviorally-salient neurons. In this grant application, we propose to develop gene targeting technology in prairie voles, focusing on vasopressin and oxytocin signaling pathways (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we propose to analyze behavioral deficits in social attachment in prairie voles genetically mutant for these signaling pathways. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose developing molecular tools to uncover genetic and neural pathways underlying social attachment in prairie voles. Taken together, our studies will enable gene targeting in prairie voles and elucidate neural mechanisms that control social attachment behavior. Health relatedness: Social attachments are thought to be critical for our mental health and for success in personal and professional interactions. Failure to form or maintain social attachments is often an early indicator of a serious mental illness such as autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia. Strikingly, vasopressin and oxytocin are also thought to play a critical role in human social attachments, and dysregulated signaling via these neuropeptide pathways has been implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Our proposal seeks to establish the prairie vole as a new mammalian genetic model system and to uncover mechanisms underlying social attachment behavior. These advances may therefore provide a useful model system to study social behaviors relevant to human health and mental illnesses."
"9213850","PROJECT SUMMARY Organismal diet has a profound impact on tissue regeneration, aging, and disease in mammals. However, the mechanisms through which diet perturbs stem and progenitor cell biology and leads to diseases such as cancer are poorly understood. With the rise of obesity in the US population?more than 1 in 3 adults are obese ?understanding the relationship between diet, stem cell biology, and cancer incidence takes on great importance.  Focused on the mammalian intestine, we find that a pro-obesity high fat diet (HFD) augments the number and niche-independent function of Lgr5+ stem cells. Mechanistically, our studies indicate that a HFD induces a robust peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-d) signature in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and progenitors (non-stem cells), and pharmacologic activation of PPAR-d recapitulates the effects that a HFD has on these cells. Furthermore, like a HFD, ex vivo treatment of intestinal organoid cultures with fatty acid constituents of the HFD enhances the self-renewal potential of these organoids in a PPAR-d dependent manner. Interestingly, both HFD- and agonist-activated PPAR-d signaling endow progenitors with the organoid-initiating capacity normally restricted to stem cells. In fact, agonist-enforced PPAR-d signaling permits these progenitors to form in vivo tumors upon loss of the tumor suppressor Apc. These observations provide a possible pathway for diet through modulating PPAR-d activation to alter not only the function of intestinal stem and progenitor cells but also their capacity to initiate tumors. Many questions remain regarding the impact of a HFD on the intestine, such as the in vivo, cell type-specific roles of PPAR-d in this process, and the identity of progenitor subsets that emerge in this diet to drive tumor development. Also, although PPAR-d is a master transcriptional regulator of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), it is unclear whether intestinal stem and progenitor cells or tumors that arise in a HFD rely on this PPAR-d-activated FAO metabolic program for their maintenance.  Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that PPAR-d mediates the in vivo effects of a HFD in ISCs and progenitors in intestinal homeostasis and tumor initiation (Aim 1); that a subset of non-stem cell progenitors acquire stemness and tumorigenic potential in a HFD and with enforced PPAR-d signaling (Aim 2); that a HFD or enforced PPAR-d signaling render ISCs, progenitors, or established tumors metabolically reliant on fatty acid oxidation for their maintenance (Aim 3).

The research program has proven to be an effective training basis for both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. The predoctoral program involves four semesters of academic work followed by a preliminary examination. Upon successful completion of these requirements, full time research occupies the remainder of the training program. The postdoctoral training program is focused on full time research in the participating laboratories. Both the predoctoral and the postdoctoral program are enhanced by departmental and program seminar series of various types as well as a virology journal club, monthly works in progress meetings for participating laboratories and two annual minisymposia, one in the fall on Viral Oncology and AIDS Malignancy and one in the spring on Pathogenic Human Viruses. These activities foster communication between members of the program, and with other students and faculty at Duke, to the ultimate benefit of not only the trainees but the institution in general."
"9405704","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the first competitive renewal of a currently funded T32 grant that provides post-doctoral training in multi-disciplinary multi-modality molecular and translational cardiovascular imaging for highly qualified fellows holding either a MD or/and PhD, in preparation for academic careers as independent investigators in the highly clinically relevant field of cardiovascular imaging. As imaging technology and molecular medicine advances, increasingly complex questions often arise requiring the convergence of perspectives from multiple disciplines. The future of cardiovascular imaging will most likely be practiced by integrated multidisciplinary teams with diverse areas of expertise. The goal of this research training program is to provide the necessary skills needed to work in this new multi-disciplinary investigative environment. Applicants will be recruited from both clinical and basic science departments, with particular attention paid to minority, disabled, and disadvantaged candidates. We will continue to select and enroll applicants in order to maintain support for 4 post-doctoral fellows each year, with an equal balance of physicians and scientists. Post-doctoral fellowship training will be 2-3 years in duration. There will be three primary research focuses in the post-doctoral training, 1) cardiovascular molecular imaging, 2) cardiovascular imaging technologies and analyses, and 3) translational cardiovascular imaging. The primary faculty for this program are from the Yale School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and from multiple departments within the Yale School of Medicine, including: Internal Medicine (Section of Cardiovascular Medicine), Diagnostic Radiology, Surgery, Anesthesiology, and Therapeutic Radiology. The faculty sponsors have been selected based on extramural support, research productivity, and commitment to multi-disciplinary training. Each trainee will be assigned both a basic science/engineering and clinical mentor. Trainee progress will be monitored by individual mentors, the trainee's advisory committee, and the Program Directors. Drs. Sinusas and Duncan will co-manage the program to assure a balanced and integrated experience in the relevant clinical and engineering sciences."
"9404534","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application seeks continuing support for the Microenvironmental Influences in Cancer Training Program (MICTP) at Vanderbilt University. Over the past 24 years and continuing with the 5-year period preceding this competitive renewal, we have been remarkably successful in recruiting and training excellent students and postdoctoral fellows, particularly those from groups underrepresented in science. Overall, the MIC training program encompasses a group of 26 faculty members from both the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and the Meharry Medical College. The training program is conducted within a vibrant academic environment and is supported by close interactions with the Vanderbilt-lngram Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Vanderbilt Department of Cancer Biology, and the Vanderbilt-Meharry Alliance Program. In addition to departmental and preceptor-specific laboratory instruction, each trainee receives cancer-related training in the form of two courses focused on cancer biology, a grant workshop, an annual Tumor-Host Interaction Program retreat, and a Clinical Experience. Trainees within the program are actively mentored by both faculty members and through paired peer mentoring by former student and postdoctoral trainees. Furthermore, predoctoral students are supported by an Interdisciplinary Graduate Program and an independent graduate program in Cancer Biology. Postdoctoral trainees are supported by an institutional Office of Postdoctoral Affairs, which provides both financial and academic support as well as career development advice and opportunities. Significant institutional investment in training programs, core facilities, state-of the-art laboratories and equipment further enhances trainee development. Training in this critical area of cancer research is necessary to build the workforce required to understand the complexities of the microenvironmental influence on cancer development and progression, and to translate this information into more effective and less toxic approaches to the treatment and prevention of cancer. Furthermore, training in tumor microenvironment will prepare our students and postdoctoral fellows to solve the major unsolved or neglected problems, the provocative questions, in oncology."
"9404079","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The breadth of interdisciplinary research teams is expanding dramatically. At the intersection of environment and health, in particular, teams increasingly need strong grounding in basic biology and genetics while at the same time need increasingly sophisticated analyses of disease models. Only then will they be prepared to study the interaction of susceptibility genes with environmental exposures. For that reason we have adopted the approach that the modern trainee cannot be expected to do it all; rather, to succeed he or she will need to be prepared with the strongest possible disciplinary foundation together with the tools needed to work effectively with others outside their own discipline. From a large and talented pool of applicants, we select outstanding BS and DVM trainees who seek the PhD or ScD degree, and outstanding PhD, MD, and DVM trainees who make a 3-year commitment to postdoctoral training in interdisciplinary pulmonary sciences. Trainees with backgrounds in biology, medicine, engineering, and physics work side-by-side on problems at the intersection of pulmonary sciences and environmental exposures. These trainees benefit from working with each other, working with trainees not supported by this T32, and working with a well-funded interdisciplinary faculty. This faculty addresses three main problems: air pollution, lung infection, and asthma. The theme of pulmonary inflammation spans these foci. Another theme is a strong emphasis on engineering and physical sciences. Bridging the gap between the life sciences and the physical / engineering sciences has been a longstanding goal of our program. These themes foster exceptional levels of collaboration among a faculty with unusually diverse expertise and interests. They form the faculty into a cohesive interdisciplinary team elucidating basic mechanisms of lung disease. Our Program offers access to excellent facilities and unique nanotechnologies, and is designed so that trainees will: 1) master modern technologies of cell and molecular biology as well as integrative physiology; 2) learn the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, 3) design experiments effectively and interpret data critically, 4) adapt well to change, and 5) build successful careers as responsible members of the scientific community. In the past 34 years of our T32 we have never had an unfilled slot. In the past 10 years of our T32, 6 of our trainees were underrepresented minorities and 27 have completed training. 25 are currently working in science, including 7 in industry and 18 in academia at the rank of assistant professor or higher."
"9012755","Project 2: Structure and function of poxvirus immune evasion domains. In this project we will explore the functional and mechanistic attributes of a large family of sequence diverse proteins encoded by the zoonotic orthopoxvirus cowpox. We hypothesize that ten proteins In cowpox share a similar structural scaffolding that we have termed the poxvirus immune evasion (PIE) domain. Certain PIE proteins are known to sabotage host Immune surveillance and effector functions, and our goal Is to systematically determine the ligands and receptors for all ten PIE proteins encoded by the Brighton Red strain of cowpox. These efforts will be complemented by crystallographic investigations and quantitative binding assays to determine PIE protein structure and specificity, and structure-based engineering to develop variants with altered ligand/receptor Interactions. We will also undertake extensive In vitro functional studies of the PlEs, evaluating their mechanisms of action In the context of well-established Immunological assays. Our investigations will also be considered In the broader context of the battlefield of viral infection and host defense. In close collaboration with the Yokoyama and Fruh labs we will evaluate the pathogenesis of cowpox with either selective PIE proteins knocked out or their ligand/receptor binding determinants altered. The proposed experiments will result In a significantly improved functional annotation of cowpox and yield important clues about host-pathogen Interactions that are likely to benefit both the scientific and clinical communities."
"9204741","Project Summary/Abstract: Irradiation, Preclinical Imaging, & Microscopy (IPIM) Shared Resource  The Irradiation Shared Resource has been a component of the NCCC CCSG for more than 30 years. For  the current submission, IPIM has been expanded to include preclinical imaging, optical cellular (confocal)  and electron microscopy. This expansion has been facilitated by an NCI CCSG supplemental grant  (3P30CA023108-32S4) that supported renovation of a new small animal imaging facility. Construction was  completed in 2012. The new Shared Resource is used by investigators from four of the six NCCC research  programs, including Cancer Mechanisms, Molecular Therapeutics, Cancer Imaging & Radiobiology, and  Immunology & Cancer Immunotherapy. IPIM combines animal and cell-based ionizing irradiation services,  sophisticated cell and electron microscopic imaging, and large and small animal imaging capabilities,  including 9.4T small-bore magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI), small bore/rodent  positron emission tomography (mPET), small bore / rodent computed tomography (mCT), high resolution x-  vivo small bore CT, whole animal (rodent) bioluminescent (IVUS) and fluorescence (Infrared) imaging.  Additionally, IPIM oversees large-animal imaging instrumentation, including MRI, CT,  fluoroscopy/angiography, and ultrasound; all necessary for many types of preclinical translational research.  IPIM is involved intimately in the development and use of the recently completed Center for Surgical  Innovation (CSI), a unique novel intraoperative clinical and preclinical surgery-imaging facility that includes  state-of-the-art MRI and CT scanners that enable scanning a patient during surgical procedures. Finally the  IPIM (Strawbridge, Hoopes) oversees and facilitates several alternating magnetic field (AMF) generators  and coils currently used to activate magnetic nanoparticles in the ongoing NCCC nanotechnology cancer  research program. IPIM activities are overseen by P. Jack Hoopes (DVM, PhD) and a senior internal  advisory board with very significant knowledge and experience in all scientific aspects of these services.  Activities are scheduled and managed by a centralized staff of seven highly experienced and trained  scientists and resource managers. Each service receives oversight from the director as well as a co-  director highly trained in that specific area. David J. Gladstone (DSc, DABMP), chief of radiation physics,  Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, directs the irradiation service. A research veterinarian, Dr. Karen  Moodie (DVM, MS), directs the preclinical and animal imaging resource. Radu Stan (MD, PhD) directs the  optical cellular (including confocal) services. The Electron Microscopy facility and program is directed by Dr.  Charles Daghlian (PhD). Due to the need for daily expertise and support, the irradiation resource and  optical cellular (confocal) and electron microscopy resources each have operational support from  managers Rendall Strawbridge, Christopher Ogomo, and Kenneth Orndorff, along with image processing  consultant Alex Hartov, all who are on site to assist and access information."
"9393837","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients, yet we fail to understand the fundamental mechanisms of this process to develop effective therapies to interfere with its progression. One mechanism that tumors use frequently is their ability to hijack embryonic programs to increase their plasticity to leave the primary tumor, migrate long distances and grow at distant sites. To achieve this, cancerous cells induce embryonic genes to turn on signaling pathways that play roles in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. One such pathway that plays essential roles both during embryogenesis and in the adult is the evolutionarily conserved JAK/STAT pathway. JAK/STAT signaling is involved in various biological processes including proliferation, immunity, apoptosis and cell migration and is also often implicated cancer metastasis. However, its precise role during cell migration and metastasis is still not well understood. In order to understand the precise role of this pathway during cell migration, I will use zebrafish neural crest migration as an in vivo model. Given the remarkable similarities between these embryonic cells and invasive tumor cells, this also holds the promise of providing a powerful in vivo model to study cancer metastasis. First, I will identif the relevant JAK/STAT pathway components during neural crest migration. Then I will isolate downstream JAK/STAT target genes and other interactors during neural crest migration. Lastly, I will test the effects of the JAK/STAT pathway specifically on melanoma. The results of this proposal will significantly enhance our understanding of the role of this pathway during cell migration both during normal development and cancer metastasis. In addition, the findings from this study will determine the effects of the JAK/STAT signaling specifically on melanoma development."
"9104092",". Project Description  Appropriateness of care is about ensuring that individuals receive care that is (a) clinically effective, (b) cost-effective, and is consistent with (c) ethical principles and (d) preferences relevant to individuals, communities and society. Given the prevalence of patient self-referral in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and the health system-wide focus on patient-centered care, it seems reasonable to consider individual preferences when assessing the appropriateness of CAM procedures. Unfortunately, we know very little about CAM users' preferences and decision-making since most CAM studies are conducted at the individual level rather than for specific illness episodes. Using chiropractic manipulation and mobilization (M/M) for chronic cervical pain as an example, this study will explore the role that patients' preferences, expectations and experiences may play in assessing the appropriateness of treatments and procedures.     The study will occur in three stages. In the first stage, we will recruit patients suffering from chronic neck pain from chiropractic practices and conduct in-depth, semi-structured interviews about their past and current experiences in treating their neck pain. We will use these interviews, as well as a comprehensive review of the literature; to develop a series of interview protocols for assessing patient decision making, expectations, experiences and satisfaction with their chiropractic care. Next we will pilot test the protocols on 50 chronic cervical pain patients who are currently seeing a chiropractor and make appropriate changes as required. The finalized protocols will then be the basis for collecting data from a national sample of 800 patients with chronic cervical pain from 80 chiropractic practices located in four national sites.      These data will provide unprecedented insights into patient preferences, expectations, healthcare experiences and satisfaction with those experiences, reported short- and long-term results and satisfaction with those results and treatment appropriateness. We will also describe how these vary across sociodemographic characteristics, time, initial pain severity and previous experiences with chiropractic, other CAM and other non-CAM treatments. The resulting patient-centered findings will be incorporated into the discussion concerning the appropriateness of utilizing M/M for chronic cervical pain."
"9385155","Summary  There is substantial variation in recovery after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). If we could understand the underpinnings behind this variation, then treatments could be optimized to reduce the profound negative societal and economic impact associated with pediatric TBI. Predictors of recovery following TBI, particularly the roles of genes and environment, are incompletely understood. Elucidation of genetic and environmental influences on recovery after pediatric TBI is critically needed to advance development of precision medicine strategies. Novel systems biology analyses conducted by our group indicate genetic factors within two main biologic processes, response to injury (cell proliferation, cell death, inflammatory response, cellular metabolism) and neurocognitive and behavioral reserve (neurodevelopment, cognition, and behavior), are likely associated with recovery after TBI. An approach that seeks to identify genes and variants over- represented (gene-enrichment) across these biologic processes would improve upon prior candidate gene approaches. Genetic variants implicated in recovery after TBI interact with home and family environmental factors to influence cognitive and behavioral outcomes in other pediatric populations; however, the effects of the interaction between genes and environment on recovery after pediatric TBI have not been explored. The objective of this proposal is to understand the interplay between genetically influenced biologic processes and environment with respect to recovery after pediatric TBI. We hypothesize that genetic variants overrepresented in biologic processes important to TBI recovery will be associated with global, neurocognitive, and neurobehavioral functioning and that environmental factors will interact with genetic factors to influence recovery after severe pediatric TBI. We will collect salivary DNA samples from approximately 338 children participating in the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI Trial (ADAPT, U01 NS081041). The primary outcome will be global functioning assessed by the pediatric Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) at 3, 6, and 12 months post injury and secondary outcomes will include a comprehensive assessment of cognitive and behavioral functioning at 12 months post injury. We will use an analytic approach that seeks to identify genes and variants associated with recovery that are over-represented (gene-enrichment) across response to injury and neurocognitive and behavioral reserve biologic processes. Mixed model analyses will be used to evaluate the association of genotypes with recovery after severe pediatric TBI and to elucidate the association of environmental factors (family functioning, parenting practices, home environment, and socioeconomic status) with recovery. How genetic and environmental factors and genetic and early clinical factors interact to influence recovery after severe pediatric TBI will also be evaluated. This project will provide critically needed information to inform individualization of prognosis and development of novel, precision medicine approaches for pediatric TBI, which are considerably lacking for this population."
"9388016","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a T32 training grant at the University of Colorado to support the training of post-doctoral fellows (MD and PhD) who wish to prepare for careers in cardiovascular research. The broad objective of this training program is to create a training environment that will provide the next generation of cardiovascular researchers with training in cardiovascular research that is linked to the research goals of the NIH/NHLBI strategic plan: 1. to understand the molecular and physiologic basis of cardiovascular health and disease; 2. to develop personalized preventive and therapeutic regimens for organ specific diseases and 3. to generate an improved understanding of the processes involved in translating research into practice. To meet this objective, we have developed a comprehensive training plan and we have assembled a group of mentors from the rich cardiovascular research community at the University of Colorado campuses in Denver and Boulder.

"9189857","ABSTRACT  Over 15% of couples in the United States suffer from infertility. Half of these cases are due to male factors such as low sperm count, abnormal sperm morphology and motility, or unexplained poor embryogenesis. Mammalian sperm exhibit a highly compacted nuclear and chromatin structure with only 5- 15% of the normal cellular histone complement. This transition occurs when nucleosome-associated histones within post-meiotic male germ cells are acetylated by histone acetyltransferases to open the structure to, in turn, allow subsequent eviction and replacement with protamines - leading to the profound compaction in mature sperm. Abnormal histone retention in sperm can lead to infertility and poor embryogenesis, thus implicating epigenetic regulation of the male gamete as a critical factor in reproduction. My preliminary data depict dynamic changes in histone post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, during spermatogenesis. My findings further demonstrate that pre-meiotic conditional deletion of the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 results in abnormal sperm with increased histone retention. The goal of the proposed study is to investigate the functional and mechanistic role of histone acetylation in nucleosome eviction in post- meiotic male germ cells, and to determine whether contribution of excess retained paternal histones affects embryonic transcription, developmental programming and embryogenesis. To conduct these experiments I will use the conditional mouse model to functionally perturb histone acetylation through ablation of the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 in pre-meiotic male germ cells (Gcn5cKO). In specific aim 1, I will use the Gcn5cKO mice to determine the mechanisms through which loss of histone acetylation leads to altered chromatin remodeling and excess histone retention in mature sperm, and how the consequences of reduced histone acetylation affects gene transcription during spermatogenesis. In specific aim 2, I will examine fertility of, and early embryonic development and transcription, resulting from the Gcn5cKO male mice to investigate the effect of excess paternal histones and associated altered paternal chromatin accessibility. To our knowledge, this will be the first investigation to conditionally ablate a histone acetyltransferase in pre-meiotic germ cells in the testes and investigate the functional consequences. As a result of these experiments we expect to further our understanding of the link between acetylation of histone residues and histone eviction and determine if transmission of excess paternal histones affects offspring development. Furthermore, as mouse and human spermatogenesis and sperm function are highly conserved, the findings of these experiments will be an invaluable source of information for understanding, diagnosing, and treating male infertility."
"9404684","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Hematology Clinical Research Training Program at the University of Pennsylvania was established in 1978 and has provided training for 132 men and women. The program's primary goal is to help a diverse group of individuals prepare for careers as investigators in the broadly-defined discipline of hematology and blood disorders. The faculty includes 37 trainers of all academic ranks and a plan is in place for adding or withdrawing trainers when appropriate. Up to 12 new trainees are accepted each year (8 postdocs and 4 predocs). Candidates were originally were drawn primarily from physicians enrolled in the clinical hematology training programs in the Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics. Since 1998 we have also supported postdoctoral trainees who are not physicians and, since 2004, predoctoral trainees, most of whom are in Penn's MD-PhD program. The connection to the MD-PhD program takes advantage of the PI's role as the director of that program. The inclusion of predoctoral students reflects our belief in the long term value of involving talented students to hematology-related research at an earlier point in their training as scientists and physician-scientists. Essential features of the program include formal and informal advising, skills workshops, attendance at local seminars and national conferences, coursework, training in the responsible conduct of research, and an annual symposium. MD postdoctoral fellows have the option of enrolling in a Biomedical Graduate Studies (BGS) PhD program. Outcomes. 117 postdoctoral trainees (68 MD, 17 MD-PhD and 32 PhD) and 15 pre-doctoral trainees (10 MD-PhD and 5 PhD) have been supported. Of the 109 who have completed all stages of training, 56 (50%) hold full-time appointments at an academic institution, 13 (12%) are employed in industry, 1 (1%) works at the FDA, and 3 (3%) run transfusion services at the NIH or Red Cross (total 67%), all of which we consider appropriate outcomes. Of those who currently hold fulltime academic appointments, at least 68% currently hold or have had NIH research funding. A detailed plan for attracting and training a diverse group of men and women, monitoring their progress benchmarked with an individualized development plan, and receiving feedback from trainees, alumni and faculty is included in the application."
"9181318","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in southern Africa. This syndemic has resulted in an overwhelming burden for healthcare workers and the healthcare system. Drug- resistant TB remains a growing threat to public health despite advances in treatment and diagnosis over the past decade. South Africa has the world highest rate of TB/HIV co-infection and ranks fourth worldwide for multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB incidence and HIV prevalence. Treatment of MDR-TB, defined as resistance to isoniazid and rifampin, remains challenging and complex and success of second line treatment regimens is considerably less likely. Prospective cohort studies from South Africa report less than 50% treatment success (i.e. cure/completion) and marked differences between patients with and without HIV. International and South Africa specific MDR-TB guidelines recommend integration with HIV treatment programs and movement toward community-based programs within the primary care system. Although heralded as a major success by the HIV and TB treatment communities, implementation of TB/HIV integration in a community-based platform is much more challenging, requiring clinicians to navigate both HIV and MDR-TB treatment guidelines, overlapping drug toxicities and parallel care systems potentially leading to greater fragmentation of care. Nurse case management (NCM) models in which a registered nurse coordinates treatment plans to ensure that appropriate and timely care is given have been shown to improve treatment outcomes. There is little evidence to describe NCM of MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients by registered nurses globally, and specifically MDR- TB/HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed 5-year interdisciplinary cluster randomized study will determine the impact and cost-effectiveness of a NCM intervention on MDR-TB treatment outcomes in South Africa, the epicenter of the MDR-TB/HIV epidemics. We hypothesize that the NCM intervention sites will report increased cure/completion rates of MDR-TB among patients with and without HIV compared to control sites. Sampling 10 clusters with 300 subjects each (1500 per group), achieves 88% power to detect a difference between the groups of 0.18; a clinically meaningful difference in MDR-TB treatment outcomes. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) identifies essential elements of a health care system that encourage high-quality chronic disease care in a bundled approach. These elements provided the conceptual framework for the proposed NCM intervention, a multi-faceted systems level intervention bundle to improve MDR-TB/HIV treatment outcomes. The proposed study is innovative and significant as it will translate a NCM intervention within the proven CCM framework in a low resource setting with a robust cost-effectiveness analysis. The study is globally relevant as it addresses the essential question of how can the implementation of TB/HIV integration occur in an evidence- based and sustainable manner."

While many commercial and academic histology services are available, no other facility is available that offers comparable quality with rapid turnaround and highly experienced professional supervision and investigator education. The Core provides the initial interpretation and understanding of an animal model and interprets this phenotype in the context of the genetic manipulation. Murine models of cancer have provided investigators with a unique opportunity to understand tumor cell biology in the setting of intricate and dynamic physiological systems. This includes the ability to not only investigate the role of specific oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and signaling pathways in tumorigenesis, but, in contrast to in vitro systems, the interactions between the tumor and its environment can be studied as well."
"9245948","Abstract We propose to use a systems approach that combines well-defined cohorts with unbiased large-scale profiling to elucidate signatures defining immune responsiveness in the context of divergent disease outcomes. Standardization, both at the assay and analytical levels, will allow comparisons and integration of data across projects. To maximize the immune profiles of samples generated in our Projects?and the shared analysis and interpretation of data? we propose a Single Cell Phenotyping Core to conduct and analyze multiparameter immune markers using shared platforms. The platforms of the Core include mass cytometry (CyTOF) for multiparameter single cell analysis of samples from the Research Projects (Aim 1). This new technology, which overcomes many of the limitations of fluorescence-based flow cytometry, provides unprecedented cellular analysis of multiple cell populations simultaneously and is a powerful technique for translational investigations. Our core will support seamless web interface and in depth computational analysis needs of the projects (Aim 2). In addition, we will use nanowell-based single-cell analysis for multispectral imaging cytometry (MuSIC) to measure, analyze and report the surface expression of up to 16 markers on immunocytes in sorted populations of interest or in sparse samples, including synovial fluid and EM biopsies (Aim 3). Finally, we will extend the capabilities of the nanowell platform for performing single-cell RNA-sequencing, which provides a unique and unbiased approach for resolving heterogeneous subsets of immune cells (Aim 4). Array-wide RNA- sequencing of targeted cell types or sparse samples is an innovative platform to probe the intrinsic differences between cells of interest and to refine the molecular signatures of cells implicated in disease."
"9213428","PROJECT ABSTRACT Emergency contraception (EC) provides a woman with an additional line of defense against unintended pregnancy following an act of unprotected intercourse. Orally-dosed EC works by delaying ovulation and reduces the risk of pregnancy for a single act of unprotected intercourse by 50-70%. Unfortunately, obese women are significantly more likely than their normal BMI counterparts to experience failure of orally-dosed EC and in some instances EC is equivalent to placebo.  Our preliminary data provides evidence for testing a dose escalation strategy in an effort to provide improved efficacy from orally-dosed EC in obese women. We hypothesize that increasing the dose of orally-dosed EC agents will normalize the pharmacokinetics resulting in the expected treatment effect (delay in follicle rupture) in obese women. In this proposal, we plan to perform detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of ulipristal acetate- based EC in obese women and expand upon our preliminary findings of levonorgestrel-based EC."
"9210125","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke and other neurodegenerative disorders are a leading cause of death, disability and loss of quality of life. The importance of glutamate neurotoxicity in cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases is well documented. Both in vitro and in vivo administration of glutamate and its analogs effectively kill neurons via excitotoxic mechanisms. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is pivotal in glutamate neurotoxicity and cerebral infarction. Prior studies indicate that NO, or peroxynitrite plays a prominent role in glutamate excitotoxicity and cerebral infarction. Amongst other responses NO, or peroxynitrite, can activate PARP-1, which leads to cell death through the formation of complex and branched poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer. Recently, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) has been identified as key mediator of neurotoxicity triggered by glutamate, reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and PAR polymer. AIF resides in the mitochondria in normal healthy cells, but moves to the nucleus following a lethal stimulus in a PARP-1 dependent manner. Blocking AIF from entering the nucleus can spare cells from death. This form of cell death has recently been designated parthanatos to distinguish it from other types of cell death such as apoptosis, necrosis or autophagic death. Interference with each step of the parthanatic cascade has been shown to be neuroprotective in a variety of models. Once AIF enters the nucleus, large scale DNA fragmentation (chromatinolysis) occurs through poorly characterized mechanisms, which is likely to be the execution step in parthanatic cell death. Accordingly, experiments are proposed to identify and characterize the parthanatos AIF associated endonuclease-1 (PAAN-1) and to investigate the role of PAAN-1 in excitotoxic and stroke induced neuronal injury. The identification of AIF interactors and understanding the mechanisms of PAAN-1 in neuronal injury will lead to new methods to terminate the toxic actions of NO, PAR and AIF and offer innovative therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases and stroke."
"9277863","Abstract: Reversible synaptodendritic injury and glial activation have emerged as important phenotypes and correlates of HAND. Furthermore, persistent inflammation that has been implicated as a major underlying factor in the progression and pathology of HAND, is likely attributable to the fact that following virus infection and formation of the proviral DNA, antiretroviral therapy (ART) has no effect on the expression of viral gene products such as Tat or gp120 that are lurking in tissues such as the CNS. Intriguingly, similar to HIV+ subjects on ART, SIV- infected rhesus macaques on ART also demonstrate loss of synaptophysin, increased glial activation and dysregulation of various signature microRNAs (miRs). MiR-mediated regulation of disease pathogenesis represents an evolving area of research that has ramifications for the identification of potential therapeutic targets for various neurodegenerative disorders, for which, currently there exists no cure. Parallel to the advances made in miRNA research, there has also been the advent of the field of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs represent an important mode of intercellular communication, by serving as conduits for the transfer of membrane and cytosolic proteins, lipids and RNA (including miRs), between cells. Based on miRNA array data obtained from the brains (basal ganglia) of SIV+ macaques, we hypothesize that HIV proteins modulate HAND neuropathology via two complementary miR-associated mechanisms: a) HIV Tat-exposed astrocytes upregulate the expression and release of miRs regulating synaptic plasticity in the EVs, which, following uptake by the neurons, cause synaptodendritic injury and, b) HIV Tat-exposed astrocytes also upregulate the expression and release of inflammation related miRs in the EVs, which, following uptake by the microglia (Mg), leads to their activation via the TLR7-dependent pathway. The innovative aspect of this proposal is based on our unique observation that HIV-protein exposed astrocytes release EVs containing a signature cargo of miRs, which are taken up by neighboring neurons and Mg to induce synaptodendritic injury and activation, respectively. These experiments will be brought full circle with an examination of functional studies aimed at uncovering the underlying mechanisms of EV/miR-mediated synaptodendritic injury and glial activation in a Tat inducible transgenic model."
"9355477","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Lower extremity amputation can cause impairments in gait and balance due to the loss of proprioception and motor control. The asymmetries present during amputee gait are thought to be one of the major contributors to secondary musculoskeletal problems such as osteoarthritis. After lower extremity amputation, physical rehabilitation is necessary to achieve functional ambulation; however, no an evidence-based standard of care exists for individuals who undergo transtibial (TT) amputations. The objective of this application is to determine the effectiveness o gait training in an immersive virtual environment with variable terrain in people with transtibial amputation. Our custom designed Virtual Gait Retraining System (VGRS) is a virtual reality (VR) system which provides visual and motor challenges while treadmill walking. The VGRS immerses the user in a virtual world, provides additional feedback with an avatar and presents the user with challenging tasks such as inclines and stair climbing which are complemented by the movement of the treadmill. Our central hypothesis is that people with amputations will achieve greater improvements in balance, mobility and gait function using our custom designed VGRS as compared to current conventional treadmill gait training. The proposed research is needed because the VGRS, a new and innovative rehabilitative system, has not been tested on TT amputees. Furthermore, the benefits of standardized treadmill training for TT amputees have not been fully examined. This objective will be accomplished by addressing the following specific aims: 1). Compare the efficacy of VGRS to conventional treadmill training. 2) Evaluate the rate of improvement over the course of each training program (VGRS and conventional treadmill). We will conduct a randomized clinical trial with twenty TT amputee subjects comparing 6 weeks of training with the VGRS to 6 weeks of training using a conventional treadmill protocol used in prior research (Darter et al. 2013). We will use gait analysis, postural sway and standard balance and mobility instruments including the 6-Minute Walk Test, Four Square Step Test, the Berg Balance Scale and the Dynamic Gait Index to assess improvements in gait and mobility. We will evaluate subject pre- and post-training and at an interim point 3 weeks into the training sessions. Interim assessments will include temporal-spatial gait parameters, the 6-Minute Walk Test and the Dynamic Gait Index. We anticipate that the VGRS will deliver more effective training by creating a realistic and challenging environment with accurate visual perception of a motor task which is being simultaneously performed by the user. We will also gain an understanding of the rate of improvement for TT amputees during treadmill training. The research design will demonstrate the need for immersive virtual reality that includes a rich visual display and affords the opportunity to train on a variety of terrain conditions and mobility tasks to capture the natural range of adaptive variation in the real world to improve gait in transtibial amputees."
"9378348","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuromodulation is a promising novel methodology deployed to improve the conditions of thousands of patients whose consciousness is impaired after brain injury. Attempts at neuromodulation using deep brain stimulation (DBS) have targeted a number of loci in the brain arousal pathways such as the thalamus, mesencephalon and cervical cord. However, recovery following single location stimulation remains modest, especially in comatose patients. Although some of these pathways can trigger awakening from sleep or light planes of anesthesia upon activation are insufficient to promote arousal from a deeper arousal state like coma. Furthermore, selective damage to one of these regions, even bilateral, rarely results in permanent unconsciousness. Interpretation of these results suggests that arousal pathways are redundant however, they are not functionally interchangeable. While this implies that the full complement of arousal from a deep arousal state requires coordination of multiple pathways, the mechanism through which this coordination is achieved by the brain is poorly understood. We aim to overcome this challenge uncovering novel neuronal circuits that promote wakefulness through basic research. Considering that medullary reticular neurons project to arousal- modulating areas throughout the brain, integrate a broad range of sensory and autonomic inputs, and fire in response to salient stimuli in close association with the initiation of behaviors, we modulated their activity during a pharmacologic induced coma (PIC). Our results showed that activation of an area located at the anterior border of the nucleus gigantocellularis (aNGC)- elicited robust cortical, autonomic and motor arousal during a state of PIC. To understand how this small subpopulation of neurons exerts such widespread activational effects on arousal, we analyzed immunolabeling of c-Fos-a well-established marker of neuronal activation-following pharmacologic activation of aNGC neurons. C-Fos labeling was sparse and largely limited to structures known to participate in arousal including rhombenchephalon (locus coeruleus and parabrachial nucleus); mesencephalon (periaqueductal gray and ventral tegmental area); diencephalon (intralaminar thalamic nuclei as well as posterior and anterior hypothalamus); and basal forebrain. These findings suggest that aNGC is able to recruit these pathways to trigger arousal from a dense PIC. This proposal characterizes aNGC as a new site to promote arousal from a coma-like state and proposes recruitment of multiple arousal pathways through aNGC as new mechanism to produce widespread activational state resulting in wakefulness. Using extracellular in vivo recordings and innovative technology like optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) we will dissect the circuitry involved in aNGC- stimulated arousal and we will visualize the dynamics of multi-area activation. Results of this study will uncover novel mechanisms leading to new approaches for emerging treatments for patients under coma state."
"9204306","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bystander training programs have recently proliferated on college campuses as a means to reduce sexual assault. While bystander training programs show promise in reducing sexual assault and have the potential to engage men as allies in this task (Coker et al., 2014), evaluations of these programs have relied largely on self  report methods to measure primary outcomes (i.e., bystander efforts to intervene). Additional research is needed to understand situational factors that influence the likelihood of a bystander taking action. The present project addresses these needs by investigating the unique and interactive effects of an online bystander training program and alcohol intoxication on men's actual bystander behaviors observed in a laboratory setting. Based on prior theoretical and empirical evidence it is expected that participation in an online bystander training program will result in increased bystander behaviors to reduce sexual aggression during a laboratory analogue. Further, theories of alcohol's myopic effects on cognitive and attentional processes suggest that drinking may play a critical role in bystander behaviors (Steele & Josephs, 1990). It is expected that bystander alcohol intoxication will result in fewer and poorer quality bystander behaviors and that alcohol intoxication will moderate associations between the online bystander intervention and bystander behaviors such that the effects of the intervention will be weakened by alcohol intoxication. Knowledge gained from this study will enhance the development of programs aimed at engaging men as active bystanders to reduce sexual assault by shedding light on the interactive effects of participation in a bystander training program and acute alcohol  intoxication on actual bystander behaviors."
"9389799","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for competitive renewal of our T32 entitled Training in Behavioral and Preventive Medicine that is based at the Brown University Centers of Behavioral and Preventive Medicine (CBPM) and The Miriam Hospital. The program goal is to train a total of 13 postdoctoral fellows for two year periods to conduct research to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by changing the most prominent lifestyle risk factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking. Over the first 10 years of this training program, we have successfully trained 21 fellows and have 4 additional fellows currently in training. Our success is highlighted by that fact that 10 of the 11 trainees funded in our first  cycle have faculty appointments and all 10 have research grant support. Of the 10 who were funded more recently, 7 have faculty appointments (five of whom already have grant support, including 3 from NIH), and 3 are continuing further research training at other institutions.  This T32 develops researchers who advance the basic science understanding of the etiology of behaviors associated with CVD and who develop and disseminate effective interventions targeting these behaviors to prevent or treat CVD. These approaches require multidisciplinary teams which are facilitated by the ongoing collaborations between the CBPM (including the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center) and the Brown Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, the Department of Medicine and the School of Public Health. There are large numbers of federally funded trials that provide outstanding research training opportunities for our fellows including projects on the effects of behavior change on CVD risk factors, studies of genetic and environmental contributions to health and CVD, projects focusing on underrepresented populations, including Latinas, Southeast Asians and persons with HIV, and projects using innovative channels (e.g, Internet and text-messaging) and sites of delivery (e.g., YMCAs). We have retained and augmented our successful training model for this cycle. Program Director Rena Wing, PhD, continues in her leadership capacity. Jeanne McCaffery, PhD, is the new Associate Director, and Drs. Beth Bock, Ana Abrantes, Elizabeth McQuaid, Charles Eaton, and Akilah Dulin-Keita serve on the Training Committee. Training is highly individualized with all fellows developing core competencies in areas such as CVD-related behavioral research and specialized competencies in their specific areas of research. Formal didactics and mentored research experiences are combined to develop competencies. Mentoring teams are headed by a senior behavioral scientist and complemented with a physician, public health scientist or a junior faculty mentor. Trainee progress in achieving training objectives is formally evaluated, as is the success of the Training Program. Given our ability to recruit highly competitive candidates, provide extensive research and training opportunities, provide outstanding mentors with established track records, and produce funded researchers and junior faculty members, we feel uniquely qualified to continue our T32 research training in behavior change and CVD.

"9196548","Healthy living is critical to prevention of chronic diseases. Previous research has shown multilevel public health  intervention programs to be the most effective strategy for promoting health, as these programs offer individual,  community, and structural opportunities for healthy behaviors. Existing evidence based physical activity and  healthy eating interventions have shown improvements in physical activity and consumption of fruits and  vegetables, but only with community and structural interventions have the increases in activity and healthy eating  been sustained well-after the intervention was complete. Economically deprived communities suffer from an  absence of both environmental and person-level resources, including food shortages and limited safe  recreational space, to support healthy living behaviors, including physical activity and healthy eating. The Church  Challenge is a physical activity and diet intervention that was developed by Flint-area churchgoers and the  Genesee County Health Department in response to concerns about parishioners? fitness and weight. It is a two-  level (church and individual) level intervention to help kick-start congregant physical activity and dietary changes.  At the church level, churches facilitate: (1) three history lessons on why African-Americans have the dietary  patterns that they do and information on how these patterns can be adjusted to be healthier; (2) healthy cooking  classes; (3) church social and peer support in the form of regular announcements and groups within each church  who compete in a church-based weight loss challenge; and (4) access to a local church-based food pantry. In  addition, the program incorporates scripture and other spiritual principles (it was developed primarily by pastors).  At the individual level, individuals commit to (1) attending the healthy cooking classes and historical lessons, and  (2) select, publicly commit to, and attend 3 specific aerobics classes weekly at a local church-affiliated fitness  center. The proposed project will add and assess the effects of a third, community level, intervention: engaging  participating churches in policy advocacy and private sector communications to improve healthy land use in Flint  (e.g., by reintroducing a large scale grocery market to the city of Flint, providing sidewalks, bike lanes, and other  safe places for physical activity that do not require cars for residents to access). We will examine how the third  level intervention increases churches? capacity for and participation in community advocacy around policy issues.  We are not aware of another faith-involved intervention RCT that has involved a community-policy level,  or that has used churches to drive change at that policy level. This project will (1) examine the effectiveness  of a community-designed, community-based, multilevel physical activity and diet intervention (the Church  Challenge) relative to enhanced treatment as usual among 770 people in 30 primarily African-American Flint-  area churches using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, randomized by church; (2) conduct longitudinal  and process evaluations of promoting church engagement in policy advocacy to improve health land use in Flint;  and (3) evaluate church-level and individual-level sustainment of behavior change."
"9136711","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      One of the most common and debilitating features of aphasia is an impairment in ability to retrieve words, whether it involves naming seen objects, or producing nouns, verbs and other words conveying meaning in spontaneous propositional speech. The long-term goal of this line of research is to establish an effective, viable, evidence-based treatment program for word retrieval deficits in persons with acquired aphasia from stroke. The short-term goal, and focus of this project, is to conduct a final phase II trial that tests the efficacy of an experimental treatent (called phonomotor) against customary and usual treatment (i.e. semantic-based therapy) for anomia in aphasia. In the context of a 2-armed control trial, we propose to deliver 60 total hours of therapy to 80 individuals who have suffered a left hemisphere stroke and exhibit aphasia with significant anomia. Effects of treatment acquisition and generalization will be measured at 3 time points (immediately, 3-months and 1-year post treatment termination). The primary aim will address between group differences of confrontation naming performance of untrained nouns at 3 months. Secondary questions will address generalization of treatment to measures of ecologic validity and discourse production. Through a series of phase I and phase II trials, we have shown that intensively delivered phonomotor treatment not only improves confrontation naming performance on trained words but, as predicted by the theory motivating it, importantly achieves generalization to naming of untrained words, some aspects of discourse production, and indicators of quality of life. The treatment program is motivated by a connectionist model of phonology (Nadeau, 2001; Nadeau, 2006, Nadeau, 2012) and by a two level interactive model of language (Dell, 1987). The theoretical foundation for the phonomotor treatment is as follows: through the systematic training of phonemes (sounds) and phoneme sequences, the neural connectivity supporting phoneme sequence knowledge will be enhanced. Because these sound sequences provide the basis for the words that represent concepts, through bidirectional spread of activation among and between linguistic levels, generalization from treating phonemes can be expected to improve naming of untrained words and discourse production, both immediately after treatment and continued beyond treatment termination."
"9389287","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community."
"9215545","Genetic counseling or Cancer Genetic Risk Assessment (CGRA) for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is an evidence-based precision medicine strategy that facilitates informed decision making about effective health management options. Identification of individuals at increased risk of HBOC is crucial for cancer survivors and their families to benefit from biomedical advances in cancer prevention, early detection, treatment and survivorship. Although national guidelines for CGRA and genetic testing have been available for two decades, only one-third or less of high-risk women have accessed these services. The optimal risk assessment strategy starts with an individual with an HBOC-related cancer. Widespread dissemination and adoption of national guidelines for informed decision-making and promoting CGRA is needed to achieve a population-level reduction in cancer morbidity, mortality and disparities. Thus, it is important to promote access to CGRA, particularly in medically underserved populations. The proposed Genetic Risk Assessment for Cancer Education and Empowerment (GRACE) Project seeks to address this important translational gap by developing and implementing strategies to promote guideline-based care in the Rocky Mountain region where there are distinguishable disparities in CGRA utilization by ethnicity and geography. Remarkably, few intervention studies have been conducted to address the regional and national translational gap in CGRA utilization for these diverse populations, underscoring our study's high impact and innovative public health intervention delivery approach. The GRACE Project is guided by evidenced-based behavior change counseling strategies to promote risk-based care delivery and reduce disparities that consider individual, cultural, social and system-level factors. The study's primary aim is to test the comparative effectiveness of mailed targeted print (TP) vs. TP plus a telephone-based tailored counseling and navigation intervention (TCN) vs. usual care (UC) to increase guideline-based CGRA for HBOC. We will oversample Hispanics and rural dwellers and enroll 1206 high-risk female cancer survivors. Women will be recruited through the Colorado and New Mexico cancer registries and meet the criteria for a CGRA referral. Enrollees will be randomized to one of 3 study arms and complete baseline, 1-month, 6-month and 12-month surveys. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a targeted intervention (TP) vs. a tailored (TPC) intervention vs. usual care (UC) on CGRA utilization 6 months (primary outcome) after the intervention and at 12 months, after removal of key access barriers; 2) compare the effectiveness of the interventions on genetic testing utilization; 3) examine potential underlying theoretical mediating and moderating mechanisms that will further specify and elucidate significant intervention effects; and 4) compare the cost effectiveness of the interventions vs. usual care, for utilization of CGRA services. If effective, either or both interventions have the potential to reach a large number of high-risk families and reduce disparities through broad dissemination."
"9380266","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this small business innovation research grant is to develop and commercialize a cost-effective, contrast-assisted intraoperative ureter detection system, which integrates into existing surgical tools to identify ureters in real-time and prevent iatrogenic injuries. 70% of iatrogenic ureteral injuries are detected postoperatively, up to 30 days after hospital discharge. These injuries can cause ureteral obstruction, fistula(e) and eventually renal failure when not repaired immediately, and cost hospitals an average of $30,000 per patient with an added hospitalization time of 4 days. Currently, the only available technologies that assist in ureter detection, including cystoscopy and lighted stents, are costly and have led to additional complications such as reflux anuria and urinary tract infections. The RUD system would be the first unobtrusive and cost-effective alternative with the potential to decrease the incidence of ureteral complications during surgery. In this SBIR project, Briteseed will continue the development of a ureter detection system, and validate its capabilities in both ex vivo and in vivo porcine studies. This rapid ureter detection (RUD) system will use optical technology to non-invasively detect the ureters in real-time and prevent iatrogenic injury during surgery. This system will enable users to detect the ureters using methylene blue (MB), an FDA-approved and clinically utilized dye, as a contrast agent during surgery. No additional tools such as catheters, stents and cystoscopy will be used, therefore avoiding any complications caused by these tools. By preventing ureteral injury through real- time detection, this technology will lead to safer surgical outcomes for patients and lessen the financial burden on hospitals. In Phase I of the SBIR, the RUD system will be optimized and validated to provide: (a) real-time, automated ureter detection and (b) ability to differentiate between the ureter and surrounding tissues. In Phase II, the RUD system will be modified to integrate into surgical tools most commonly used near the ureters during gynecological procedures (i.e. thermal ligature devices, grasper/dissectors). This technology will profoundly affect gynecological procedures, where the ureter is at high risk with no highly adopted detection method currently available to prevent injury."
"9390630","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes our research training program in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical  Care Medicine. In this program, we offer a multidisciplinary approach to Pulmonary research  and medicine that integrates state of the art basic science, clinical trials and patient outcomes.  Four post-doctoral fellows (two MD Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine Fellows, two PhDs) and  two graduate students will be offered two years of research funding. In addition, we will also be  offering short term summer research experiences for diversity candidates. Research will be  supplemented by trainee participation in program wide research seminars, journal clubs, and  didactic coursework. It is our belief that such program wide meetings and interactions are vital to  providing young scientists with a broad perspective on research outside their own projects,  avoiding early over-specialization and an inappropriately narrow research focus.   Course work includes a program specific course on pulmonary disease and research. It also  includes a mandatory course in Responsible Conduct in Research and biostatistics. We will also  offer a wide range of courses appropriate to trainees embarking on a research career. These  include experimental design, grant writing, manuscript writing, human investigations,  epidemiological methods and career development. These are offered in our graduate programs,  our CTSA based Human Investigators Program and other university departments.   Research mentorship is provided by a faculty of seasoned scientists with extensive experience  in training young scientists. This program is also structured to develop faculty mentors by  pairing junior mentors with more senior mentors. About half the faculty conducts research  primarily involving the lung. The remainder have specific areas of expertise in cell and molecular  biology that are frequently applied to the study of lung diseases. Interactions and synergy  among the laboratories in this program add to the rich and broad training environment. Our  trainees have been very successful given the relative youth of our training program including  achieving independent research funding, faculty or industry positions in biomedical research  and postdoctoral positions at other prestigious institutions."

The Surgical Oncology Basic Science and Translational Research Training Program is a critical component of this overall training goal. The current T32 application will provide surgical trainees from general surgery and other surgical subspecialties the opportunity to develop essential skill sets in basic science, translational, and public health research. The Surgical Oncology Research Training Program has evolved in parallel with a dynamic training environment at WUSM, and currently takes advantage of unique resources in the Department of Surgery, the Siteman Cancer Center, the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, the Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences, and the Department of Surgery's Division of Public Health Sciences to develop customized and highly structured formal didactic and mentored research experiences for individual surgical trainees. The success of the program is evidenced by the important research accomplishments made by trainees working with program faculty, and the long-term success of trainees in academic medicine. Of note, 5/8 trainees (63%) who have completed the research training program and their clinical training in the last ten years, and 35/60 trainees (58%) who have competed the program since its inception, remain in academic medicine, many with independent funding. Important changes to the Surgical Oncology Research Training Program in this competitive review include additions to the program leadership, development of two distinct research tracks (basic science track, and translational research/public health/clinical effectiveness track), and reduction in the number of training slots to allow for an increase in the tuition budget. These changes will ensure that the Surgical Oncology Research Training Program maintains excellence at the forefront of two different surgical oncology research paradigms, basic science research, and translational/public health/clinical effectiveness research. NCI support will allow WUSM to continue this highly successful research training program, providing the next generation of surgeon- scientists with the research training required to succeed in an increasingly competitive research environment."

"9208424","Developmental Therapeutics Program Project Summary / Abstract The Developmental Therapeutics Program comprises a highly collaborative effort in early phase drug development that serves as a magnet for bringing promising new anti-cancer drugs from the NCI, DF/HCC investigators and industry through the earliest phase of clinical evaluation. The Program is thus tightly integrated with Disease Programs and actively transitions drugs from early to later phase development. In addition, the Program is closely aligned with other Programs and Centers that focus on drug discovery and biomarker development, as well as aspects of cancer biology that include signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and immuno-oncology. Three Specific Aims are planned over the next 5 years: (1) To conduct Phase I and I-II clinical trials of new anti-cancer agents and combinations with safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and preliminary efficacy endpoints; (2) To validate biomarkers for drug response, resistance, and toxicity; and (3) To provide mentoring and career development support for fellows and junior faculty in early drug development. The program has 58 members, representing six DF/HCC institutions and 11 academic departments. In 2014 peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $3.7 million in total costs from the NCI and $0.3 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, Developmental Therapeutics Program members published 1,364 cancer-relevant papers. Of these 28% were inter-institutional, 13% were intra-programmatic, and 59% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members. Overall, when counted once, 27% of DF/HCC publications were inter- programmatic collaborations."
"9405698","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this revised renewal application for post-doctoral research training support is to produce cutting edge independent scientists and future research leaders in genetic epidemiology. We are proposing to do this in a multidisciplinary setting with emphasis on substantive applied orientation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors and other complex traits related to heart, lung, and blood disorders. We have made partnership arrangements with cardiology fellowship programs at our institution so that we can actively recruit MDs (and MD/PhDs) in addition to PhDs. We believe that the research environment at Washington University is outstanding for carrying out research in cardiovascular genetic epidemiology. The cornerstone of this young program is its emphasis on intense and sustained individualized training of each trainee under the supervision of an experienced preceptor. Indeed, emphasis on individualized training is one of its hallmarks. Its centerpiece is an Individualized Training Pathway (ITP) developed for each trainee by the Program Director, the trainee's preceptor(s), and the trainee. An individual trainee's ITP will reflect his/her educational background, the previous research experience if any, the particular research interests of the trainee, and will address the curriculum needs as well as the type of research experience he/she needs. The focus of the research and training philosophy advocated by the Program Director and the participating preceptors is a clear understanding of the concepts, principles, and methods of genetic epidemiology necessary for investigating the physiological and pathophysiological processes that underlie CVD and related complex traits. We are requesting funds for continuing to support 4 slots each year (with half the slots devoted to MDs and MD/PhDs). Our proposal rises to the challenge by blending and integrating carefully chosen didactic training with greater emphasis on a direct hands-on research and grant writing experience. One of the great strengths of this training program is that the vast established resources and rich interdisciplinary training environment of the entire DBBS, as well as those of our GEMS and MSIBS masters degree training programs are available to all post-doctoral trainees in this program. The proposed post-doctoral research training program aspires to produce future genetic epidemiologists in much demand in the current market place for pursuing cardiovascular and other biomedical research. The research training environment at Washington University is outstanding, which also has a separate Office of Post Graduate Affairs to look after postdoctoral trainees and their special needs and serve as their advocate."

"9386900","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for renewal of a research training grant in cardiothoracic surgery that has been continuously funded since 1994. It is anticipated that in the next ten years there will be a shortage of cardiothoracic surgeons. To meet the future needs it is essential that we train an increased number of academic surgeons. An essential element is training these individuals to be independent investigators. Therefore, the overall aims of the program are to provide a stimulating environment and research training for academic cardiothoracic surgeons. The specific goals are to:1)attract the most innovative, inquisitive, diverse, and motivated candidates; 2) provide them with the highest possible level of training in the basic and clinical research in cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology and pathology; and 3)foster critical thought to prepare the trainees for an independent academic career and leadership role. The strength of the program is its interdisciplinary approach to scientific proble solving in which clinically recognized problems are studied in animal models of human disease at the integrative, cellular, and molecular levels, which can then be translated to clinical solutions. A key component of this training program is the faculty, which includes 22 faculty members with over $25 million of NIH support and extensive experience with research mentoring. They represent 4 separate departments with a history of collaborative research. Over the last 30 years, the laboratory has trained 94 US postdoctoral research fellows. Of these 63 (68%) are in academic medicine. Six are division chiefs or department chairpersons, and one is a principal investigator at the NIH. The NIH T32 training grant has provided key support for this training. We have also trained 103 foreign research fellows and 56 (54%) of them are in academic medicine. Prior to the start of the present NIH training grant only 7% of our trainees were female and 3% were from underrepresented minorities. In the last 10 years, 31% of trainees have been female and 19% have been minorities. This T32 is essential element of our research training and we request support for four postdoctoral trainees.

"9234684","Project Summary/Abstract: We have identified a number of genes via genetic analysis and RNA interference gene inactivations that act as protein coding cofactors for the function of miRNAs and siRNAs in C. elegans. Some of these proteins were identified in genetic screens for decrease in miRNA function, some in genetic screens for decrease in siRNA function, and some in genetic screens for increase in siRNA function. We have also identified the target small RNAs that mediate these functions by deep RNA sequencing of selected mutant strains. We propose to dissect in detail how these proteins orchestrate the production, trafficking, and function of small RNAs in both mRNA degradation, mRNA translational control, and control of gene expression. We also propose to discern how the miRNA and siRNA and other small RNA pathways may compete with each other for common cofactors, thus leading to an increase in function in one pathway, when the other pathway is debilitated."
"9390570","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the competitive renewal of this joint Ohio State University (OSU)-Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) institutional T32 postdoctoral program is to provide interdisciplinary, translational, and state- of-the-art research training in congenital and acquired heart disease. This plan provides a unique opportunity to focus on a continuum of congenital and acquired heart disease from fetal life to senescence and to compare disease mechanisms and outcomes between these diverse populations. The rationale is that advances in heart disease therapy and prevention are most likely to originate from a translational research program that fosters collaboration between physician-scientists and basic scientists. We will expand ongoing efforts to provide an academic environment to cultivate true `bidirectional' research, so that significant clinical problems identified by our physician scientits can be addressed in the laboratory, and key findings at the bench can be rapidly translated to larger animal studies and back to the bedside.  This renewal application seeks 6 trainees per year for 5 years with a 2-3 year commitment. Fellows will be selected from MD, DVM, Pharm.D. or PhD trainees who have strong interests in cardiovascular research and are committed to careers in disease-oriented investigations. The Program Directors have a strong-track record in translational cardiovascular research and mentoring and will serve as the primary directors at their respective institutions. The training plan design consists of formal academic courses, seminars and journal clubs to provide trainees with an overview of heart disease and an in-depth cardiac research orientation. Trainees will participate in a tailor-made survival skills course comprised of various modules and workshops related to professional development. Each trainee will perform independent research projects in a mentor's laboratory.

"9245945","The overall goal of the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) program is to capitalize on recent advances in immune profiling methods in order to create a novel public resource that characterizes diverse states of the human immune system. We propose to contribute to this program through deep interrogation and a broad systems approach that will identify molecular signatures of divergent human immune responses to infections. The three projects that comprise our U19 each leverage a common experimental infrastructure to focus on a different infectious diseases: the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, emerging arthropod-borne West Nile virus, and effects of aging on vaccination against influenza. Our goal is to delineate human immune signatures that are associated with the divergent manifestations in the population, using well-defined patient cohorts and a multidimensional analytical approach to quantitatively assess primary human immune cell function. Our program employs cutting-edge immune profiling such as multidimensional profiling by CyTOF, metabolomics, nanoscale technologies such as MuSIC (MultiSpectral Imaging Cytometry), and RNA-seq on single cells that will inform a systems approach to elucidate the biologic signatures defining immune responsiveness. Commonalities between the responses in different tissues, and to the different infection types, will be determined by quantifying signature enrichments, and by identifying conserved active sub-networks in this immune-specific functional network. This collaborative U19 takes advantage of enormous strengths across our institutions to tackle a challenging issue in human immunology. The investigators in this proposal have established collaborations, regular interactions, and a track record of shared success. Our three research projects are supported by shared cores for Administration, Data Management and Analysis, Single Cell Immunophenotyping, and Clinical Recruitment. The united goal of these varied approaches is to define elements of the immune response that contribute to divergent infection outcomes. This multifactorial, wide-angle view of the immune response will be compiled employing the expertise of each individual approach for Systems Modeling from deep interrogation of three sets of stratified patient cohorts. The output of this functional systems immunology approach will be definitions of human immune signatures following multiple forms of infectious challenges with the ultimate goal of defining future targets for intervention and predicting susceptibility or resistance."

"9377041","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is the second leading cause of blindness due to death of retinal ganglion cells (RGC). Our long term goals are to identify disease genes and investigate their function in the pathogenesis of POAG. Many risk factors for POAG have been identified, including advanced age, thin cornea and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated IOP is caused by increased resistance to outflow of aqueous humor (AH) through the trabecular meshwork. The mechanisms linking thin cornea to glaucoma are not fully known, but it may cause susceptibility to RGC death independent of IOP. Currently, the only modifiable risk factor is IOP, which can be lowered by drugs, laser or surgery. However, the relationship between IOP and RGC death is unclear since some patients with IOP in the normal range develop glaucomatous optic nerve damage while others with elevated IOP do not. Nonetheless, lowering IOP slows progression of the disease, even for patients with so-called normal tension glaucoma. During our previous funding period, we identified ADAMTS10 as the disease gene in a colony of dogs with inherited POAG. ADAMTS10 protein is involved in formation of microfibrils which are extracellular matrix structures primarily composed of fibrillin-1 polymers. In addition to providing stretchable support in tissues such as blood vessels and skin, microfibrils are the primary reservoir of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta). TGFbeta is elevated in plasma and TGFbeta signaling is hyper-activated in affected organs in diseases associated with microfibril defects, such as Marfan syndrome. Defective microfibrils could for the first time provide a mechanistic explanation for the well-established elevation of TGFbeta in the AH of human POAG patients, which is thought to contribute to glaucoma pathogenesis. Discovery of ADAMTS10 as a POAG gene led us to form the hypothesis to be tested in this proposal that microfibril defects cause glaucoma. Using two independent mouse lines with well-established microfibril deficiencies, we will: 1. Test the hypothesis that microfibril deficiencies affect AH dynamics, 2. Test the hypothesis that microfibri deficient mice are susceptible to RGC death at normal and elevated IOP and 3. Test efficacy in preventing or reversing glaucoma phenotypes of a drug that inhibits constitutive TGFbeta signaling and is effective in treating Marfan syndrome, a known microfibril deficiency. The anticipated significant accomplishments of this project are: 1. Test a fundamental hypothesis that microfibril deficiencies cause glaucoma. 2. Establish a new model of glaucoma independent of elevated IOP. 3. Investigate glaucomatous RGC pathology independent of elevated IOP. 4. Test therapeutic approach to treat glaucoma based on the microfibril hypothesis."

"9208414","Early Phase Clinical Research Support Project Summary / Abstract Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center has a proven track record of success in designing, conducting and completing high-impact early phase clinical trials (Pilot, Phase I, Phase I/II). The development and conduct of such trials, which have the potential to transform the care of cancer patients, are challenged by the availability of funds rather than the lack of patients or novel concepts, particularly concepts arising from DF/HCC laboratories. Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS) funds are used to support research nursing and clinical research coordinator time for approved early phase trials as well as costs associated with the generation of preliminary data through other early phase clinically related activities. Preliminary data may come from pharmacodynamic studies (e.g. measurements of immune perturbation, repeat tumor biopsies, target protein levels, circulating tumor cells or DNA) for important unfunded or under-funded Early Phase trials, with a focus on facilitating the translation of new treatment or biomarker concepts from the laboratory to clinic. By supporting collaborations between laboratory and clinical investigators, EPCRS decreases time from discovery to clinical testing of new agents and approaches thus enabling the conduct of trials that might otherwise either not be conducted or else delayed."
"9067824","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infertility affects about 6.1 million people in the U.S., equivalent to 10% of the reproductive age population. As a result, the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), including in vitro fertilization (IVF) has risen dramatically, so that nearly 1% of babies born in the US are conceived using IVF. These pregnancies are at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including low birth weight, preeclampsia, placental abruption, placenta previa, preterm delivery, and perinatal mortality, many of which may be attributed to abnormalities of placentation and trophoblast differentiation in the first trimester, and also have increased risks for major structural birth defects, imprinting disorders and possibly additional long term health consequences. The goal of this study is to determine the molecular mechanisms which may contribute to these increased risks, and whether these result from the use of ART, or from the underlying infertility. Through our Prenatal Biorepository, we have unique access to discarded tissue remaining from chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Significantly, these samples are coupled to a database of pregnancy-related data and pregnancy outcomes, and term placental samples are available from the same pregnancies, as up to 45% of CVS patients deliver at Cedars-Sinai. This enables us to examine first trimester trophoblasts obtained during the period in which placentation occurs, in ongoing pregnancies which can be followed to term and beyond. Our preliminary data show significant differences between gene expression profiles of CVS trophoblast cells in a) pregnancies conceived via IVF, b) infertility-associated pregnancies conceived in vivo, and c) pregnancies conceived spontaneously. In this application, we will use genome-wide genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression profiling to differentiate the impact of infertility genetics and IVF-induced epigenetic changes on placental function and ultimately fetal development. Specifically, we propose to quantify and compare gene expression and CpG DNA methylation, as well as genome-wide SNP and copy number variation (CNV) profiles and exome-wide non-synonymous SNP profiles, in CVS samples from pregnancies conceived with infertility and in vitro versus in vivo fertilization, as compared to spontaneous pregnancies. To distinguish the effects of intrauterine environment, we will also quantify and compare gene expression and CpG DNA methylation in term placental samples from a subset of the same pregnancies. Lastly, we will identify the functional activity of genes whose expression is found to be altered, using primary trophoblast cultures and trophoblast cell lines, and evaluate their roles in trophoblast cell migration, invasin and apoptosis, which may lead to aberrant placentation. This truly integrated and innovative approach will allow us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that contribute to pregnancy-related complications and adverse outcomes, and to determine whether these are altered in pregnancies conceived using ART or related to the underlying infertility."

"9259221","The hippocampal formation is essential for the formation and maintenance of new long-term memories. The process of memory consolidation, where new potential memories that are still labile enter long term storage, is thought to involve bidirectional flows of information between the hippocampus and neocortex. Understanding how our different emotions and motivations might guide memory consolidation so as to bias the learning of salient information is a major objective of systems neuroscience research. The locus coeruleus (LC) is involved in both emotion and memory. LC cells release norepinephrine (NE) in various brain regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex, during states of high emotional arousal. Disruption of the activity of the LC cells themselves or inhibiting the receptors for NE in the hippocampus can suppress memory formation. Conversely, enhancing NE signaling in the hippocampus can improve memory. These results have pointed to a clear role for NE in sending emotional signals to the hippocampus, where it can boost access of highly salient information to long term memory storage. However, LC NE signaling is more elaborate during cognitive tasks. The cells shift rapidly between tonic and phasic firing modes, transitions that have been shown to predict accurate performance on signal detection tasks. While critically defining the LC systems' importance in hippocampal coding and memory formation, previous causal studies did not have the temporal resolution to capture the function of the LC's tonic and phasic firing shifts. Moreover, it is not known even how gross alterations in NE signaling alters hippocampal neuronal ensemble coding of information. In this proposal, therefore, LC neurons' precise firing patterns will be measured during a cued spatial memory task that is known to engage hippocampal-cortical interactions. Then, based on the timing of the phasic events, the release of NE triggered by phasic bursts of firing of the LC cells will be inhibited using optogenetics, while leaving the baseline firing intact, and the impact on the coding of the experience in the hippocampus will be measured. The changes in hippocampal coding will be measured by obtaining simultaneous recordings from hundreds of neurons simultaneously in the hippocampus during memory performance. Understanding how the LC can influence memory processes in the hippocampus has far-reaching implications for memory related pathologies, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). Profound loss of LC NE neurons and NE levels occurs in the early stages of AD. The function of the LC inputs to the hippocampus in memory and hippocampal coding can now be elucidated by controlling neural activity at temporal resolution of neural activity variation. NE is an especially promising novel target for treating AD since pharmacological agents targeting the NE receptors are in wide use for mood disorders and cardiovascular disease so repurposing these drugs to help AD patients would be an imminent possibility."

"9244437","PROJECT SUMMARY Immunoregulation, including suppression of autoimmunity, is a fundamental function of a healthy immune system. FOXP3 is a key transcription factor for a subset of CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs), which can be of thymic or peripheral origin. Mutations in FOXP3 cause the Immune-dysregulation Polyendocrinopathy- Enteropathy- X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, an early onset deadly X-linked immunodeficiency with severe multiple autoimmune manifestations, most notably in the skin, GI tract, and endocrine organs. Loss-of- function FOXP3 mutations result in a primary dysfunction of Tregs leading to chronic inflammation, lymphoproliferation and autoantibody production. Currently, the only cure for IPEX syndrome is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from a matched donor. The therapeutic benefit of allo-HSCT demonstrates that replacing the immune system with wild-type FOXP3 cells can cure the disease. However, the limited matched donor availability and toxicities of allo-HSCT make this approach challenging. The goal of this proposal is to develop a CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approach for site- specific restoration of wild-type FOXP3 gene expression. We will apply this method to both T cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSPCs) carrying FOXP3 mutations to correct Treg functional defects and to reverse the IPEX phenotype in preclinical disease models. The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system is an efficient gene editing tool in various cell types. We can achieve very high efficiency of gene editing in both CD34+ HSPC and stimulated or unstimulated T cells using chemically modified CRISPR guide RNAs (sgRNAs). In the present study, we will apply this to edit the FOXP3 gene locus i n IPEX patient cells. As mutations that cause IPEX are distributed throughout the FOXP3 gene, our gene editing strategy involves insertion of a wild-type FOXP3 cDNA copy at the initiation codon so that c D N A expression is regulated by endogenous elements. We have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of a FOXP3 cDNA in rescuing loss of FOXP3 via lentiviral vector delivery to patient-derived T cells in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 1 we will optimize the CRISPR/Cas9 system to d i s r u p t a n d restore FOXP3 gene expression in T cells, first in healthy donor, then in IPEX patient T cells to show reconstitution of Treg function. In Aim 2, we will restore FOXP3 gene expression in I P E X p a t i e n t CD34+ HSPCs. For both we will perform key determinations of target specificity by sequencing on and off-target sites in modified T-cells and CD34+ cells after transplantation into NSG/NSGDR1 mice. These studies will optimize CRISPR/Cas9 technology for efficient gene editing in primary cells. Our ultimate goal is to deliver autologous FOXP3 edited cells as a cure for IPEX syndrome, an otherwise deadly genetic autoimmune disease. In addition, we anticipate that these studies will be of broad relevance to other monogenic immunodeficiencies, especially those involving immune dysregulation."
"9104094","Core Description This Core, the Systematic Review Core (SRC) will conduct all the systematic reviews (SRs) and literature reviews for the 4 Projects. These will range from a full systematic review and possible meta-analysis for Project 1 Clinician Based Appropriateness to less extensive reviews for Projects 2,3 and 4 where we are not anticipating being able to conduct meta-analysis. The reviews will be conducted by an expert team at the Samueli Institute with cooperation ofthe Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center (SCEPC) located at the RAND Corporation. The Samueli Institute has developed a robust, efficient and rigorous process for conducting systematic reviews and has conducted reviews in almost all the major categories of CAM [1-15] using a process referred to as the Rapid Evidence Assessment ofthe Literature or REAL? process. Briefly, Samueli Institute has automated the review process on a web-based platform known as Mobius Analytics, Systematic Review System SRS (Copyright 2003-2009 Mobius Analytics Inc., Ottawa, Ontario) to increase the efficiency of the process. A key advantage of the REAL process is that Samueli Institute has developed a system to not only assess internal validity when looking at quality but also external validity and model validity criteria. This process has been developed as a streamlined systematic review system that is more objective and criteria-based, increasing inter-rater reliability in the review process and creating a model that is able to produce evidence reports in a more rapid fashion at a reduced cost than most systematic reviews.      The SCEPC is one ofthe premier centers for conducting SRs in the US. It has conducting numerous previous reviews in CAM. The SCEPC was previously awarded a three year grant from NCCAM, administered through AHRQ, to provide technical expertise and conduct systematic reviews for CAM. The SCEPC has collaborated  with Samueli Institute on several systematic reviews in the past."
"9257990","Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cancer cells proliferate within particularly fibrotic and poorly vascularized tumors. Although PDAC cells exist within a tumor environment with limited nutrients and oxygen, these cells nevertheless aggressively proliferate and grow. Limited electron transport chain (ETC) activity caused by oxygen limitation in this environment creates a redox balance problem such that NADH cannot be recycled by the ETC to NAD+. Under these conditions, NAD+ can become limiting for growth, a condition we term electron acceptor insufficiency. Cells proliferating under hypoxic conditions must overcome this electron acceptor insufficiency in order to proliferate. We hypothesize that oxygen limitation leads to reliance on alternative metabolic pathways to maintain redox balance, biomass synthesis and proliferation. While many studies have focused on aberrant PDAC metabolism triggered by genetic alterations common to this malignancy, there is little understanding of the environment- dependent alterations in tumor cell metabolism that are required for PDAC proliferation in harsh oxygen and nutrient limiting conditions. The proposed work will identify the metabolic requirements of PDAC cells brought on by hypoxia. First I will test whether otherwise unexplained PDAC metabolic phenotypes might drive reactions that allow these cells to proliferate in limited oxygen. Specifically, I will test the hypotheses that proline and fatty acid metabolism allow hypoxic PDAC cells to overcome electron acceptor insufficiency and are functionally important for hypoxic PDAC proliferation. Lastly, I will perform a metabolic gene targeted CRISPR/Cas9 screen, to identify the set of metabolic enzymes that are required for PDAC redox homeostasis and proliferation under environmental hypoxia. The results of these studies will be the first to identify metabolic pathways that PDAC cells require for redox balance under hypoxia. This will provide a metabolic basis for understanding how PDAC cells continue to proliferate under conditions that otherwise severely limit perturb cellular redox balance and synthesis of metabolites required for growth. This is important as targeted inhibition of the set of reactions that PDAC cells use to maintain redox balance and prevent electron acceptor insufficiency may selectively prevent PDAC cell proliferation and have therapeutic value. Thus, this work may reveal ways to target PDAC based on the environmental context of these cancers."
"9198781","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Countless anecdotes report sleep-assisted insight, or sudden solving of previously vexing problems. Prior research indicates that both sudden insight solutions (Wagner et al., 2004) and restructured memory (Ellenbogen et al., 2007) benefit from periods of sleep, possibly dependent on the same sleep- dependent processes (Stickgold & Walker, 2013). The proposed project adapts a recently developed memory paradigm that selectively enhances sleep-related memory consolidation to manipulate the incubation of problems during slow wave sleep. Thus, we can make more direct causal inferences about the sleep stages and processes that support incubation and subsequent solving of insight-like problems. If successful, the targeted incubation paradigm will provide a method for facilitating problem solving and for further investigating mechanisms and interactions of problem incubation and memory. The primary aim of the project is to test whether sleep facilitates problem solving through reactivation and restructuring of the problem representation during sleep. We test this by adapting the targeted memory reactivation paradigm developed by co-investigator Paller (e.g., Rudoy et al., 2009). Each participant engages in an evening and morning session for 5 days. Each evening session, participants attempt to solve a set of difficult insight-like problems, until 4 problems remain unsolved. The problems presented on any given day are distinctive by content, type, and modality (spatial versus verbal, etc.). During these evening sessions, each problem attempt is paired with a distinctive sound. Overnight, participants' sleep will be monitored with a portable EEG system capable of detecting sleep stages (particularly slow wave sleep). The sound cues for half the unsolved problems will be presented during slow wave sleep phases, triggering reactivation (Antony ... Paller, et al., 2012). The following morning, participants will re-attempt all the unsolved problems; we predict they solve more problems that were targeted with sound cues during sleep, because memory reactivation permits restructuring necessary to solve such problems. Follow-up experiments will examine other sleep stages, problem types, and the pre-sleep processing necessary for successful incubation. This study is novel and transformative, generating a novel paradigm for research and for facilitating problem solving in the real world. If successful, it will lead to a new program of research that promises t illuminate the important role of sleep in problem solving and in cognition generally, as well as mechanisms of interactions between memory and problem solving."
"9213723","Tumor relapse and acquired chemotherapy resistance are two major factors leading to the high mortality of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. It has become increasingly evident that ovarian cancers contain subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) with enhanced tumorigenicity and chemoresistance. These CSCs are believed to be responsible for treatment failure and tumor relapse. However, it is still unclear how CSCs survive DNA-damaging agent treatment, and how the tumor regenerated by the surviving CSCs develops chemoresistance. Error-prone translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), a DNA damage tolerance mechanism that bypasses DNA damage during replication, has been suggested to mediate acquired chemoresistance. Our recent studies have revealed that ovarian CSCs show elevated expression of TLS polymerase ? (Pol?); we also demonstrated that Pol? is critical to the survival of ovarian CSCs following cisplatin treatment. Based on this scientific premise, we generate a hypothesis that enhanced Pol?-mediated TLS in CSCs contributes to tumor relapse and the development of acquired cisplatin-resistance after initial cisplatin treatment, by facilitating CSC survival and increasing CSC mutagenesis. The main objective of this proposal is to determine a novel mechanism that contributes to EOC relapse and chemotherapeutic resistance following initial cisplatin treatment. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis and achieve our goal. In specific aim 1, we will determine the contribution of Pol?-mediated TLS to EOC relapse after cisplatin treatment. In specific aim 2, we will delineate the contribution of Pol?-mediated TLS to the development of acquired cisplatin resistance in the EOC and cisplatin-induced mutations in ovarian CSCs. The rationale under this proposal is that understanding the mechanism underlying tumor relapse and chemotherapy resistance would facilitate the development of new therapy strategies to improve the outcome of patients with EOC. It is our expectation that at the conclusion of this project, we will have provided solid evidence showing that enhanced expression of Pol? in ovarian CSCs contributes to the tumor regrowth, mutagenesis in CSCs, and the development of cisplatin resistance after initial cisplatin treatment. Downregulation of Pol? would significantly inhibit tumor relapse and prevent the development of cisplatin resistance, and thus, can be exploited for a new therapy strategy for EOCs."
"9276536","Individuals with HIV infection on suppressive antiretroviral therapy continue to have elevated rates of cognitive impairment. Finding an objective, inexpensive biomarker for cognitive impairment in fluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or neuroimaging would be useful to diagnose worsening impairment and follow with treatment. While there have been many markers suggested for increasing peripheral inflammation, this activation does not always correlate with impairment. Exosomes are spherical vesicles that encapsulate cellular proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs from the cytoplasm of the parent cell. Exosomes are shed into the extracellular space by cells under normal and pathological conditions. They are a form of cell-to-cell communication and their content often mimics the parent cell. We demonstrate that we can isolate plasma exosomes and capture by immunoadsorption, neuron-derived exosomes (NDE). We show that the total number of NDE from HIV-infected subjects is decreased compared to uninfected controls. We also show an increase in high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, an alarmin that signals cellular stress and damage, in all subjects with mild cognitive impairment, including several impaired subjects without HIV infection. We further demonstrate that the number of NDE have a significant positive correlation with increasing age in HIV+ subjects, unlike uninfected controls. We hypothesize that plasma NDE will have cargo that correlates with increasing cognitive impairment in HIV infection. We also posit that normal aging will influence the exosome cargo. We propose to characterize the exosome protein cargo using mass spectrometry and identify targets that parallel neuronal cell health in normal aging and increasing cognitive impairment in HIV-infection. This allows for a noninvasive, inexpensive technique to monitor brain health and response to therapy. !"

Our goal is to recruit promising young nurses into  research careers and make it feasible for them to complete their training by age 30 thus enabling them to make  sustained contributions to nursing science, improved clinical care, and education of the next generation of  nurses. Ours is a formal interdisciplinary program comprising the conceptual and empirical foundations and cutting edge methodologic approaches and statistical tools of advanced outcomes research and we specialize in identifying and employing large secondary data sources. Our research priorities, reflected in the funded research of our faculty, are improved outcomes for the chronically ill, reducing health disparities, comparative effectiveness of nursing delivery systems, improved care for critically ill patients and end of life care, and outcomes across settings from hospitals to nursing homes to home care. Our curriculum for BSN to PhD research training includes a year-long course in clinical nursing in recognition that many of our high priority applicants do not have the benefit of extended clinical experience and need increased clinical exposure and mentoring in order to ask clinically-relevant research questions. Our students take coursework with our interdisciplinary affiliated faculty and our program interfaces with related training programs throughout Penn providing a network of educational opportunities for trainees that augment their experience. The program is guided conceptually by the Quality Health Outcomes Model postulating that outcomes of nursing interventions are mediated by the organizational context in which care takes place and the health status and characteristics of patients. Trainees receive state of the science education in the measurement of the organizational context of  care, patient risk adjustment methods, nurse sensitive outcome measures, spatial geography and geocoding,  comparative effectiveness methods, cost of care measurement, panel studies, and international outcomes  research. The program's first 14 years have been highly successful in terms of recruitment and program completion including by minorities, high visibility scientific publications by trainees, success of our alumni in competing for grant funds, and the placement of those who have completed their training in mainstream research positions where their research careers can flourish."
"9181442","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes causes deficits in vision and global retinal activity that happen prior to the end-stage vascular growth and edema of diabetic retinopathy. Several studies have shown that decreases in retinal function predict vascular changes, suggesting that diabetic retinopathy may be a neurovascular disease, where direct damage to retinal neurons contributes to the progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, it is unknown what causes this retinal dysfunction. Decreases measured in human and animal models with electroretinograms are population measurements and thus could be due to deficits in retinal neuronal signaling or loss of retinal neurons. To address this major knowledge gap, we are proposing to investigate the progression of direct neuronal damage in diabetes and differentiate between retinal neuronal dysfunction and retinal cell death as the causes. Previous in vivo studies have identified potential decreases in the activity or survival of retinal photoreceptors that sense light, bipolar cells that receive inputs from photoreceptors, amacrine cells that feedback input onto bipolar cells and ganglion cells that are the output of the retina. As bipolar cells receive inputs from photoreceptors and amacrine cells, changes in the activity or cell loss of bipolar cells or ganglion cells may be an important mechanism of retinal dysfunction in early diabetes. We will use an innovative approach with mouse lines that express fluorescent proteins in specific retinal bipolar cells and the STZ model of diabetes, which kills pancreatic beta cells, to investigate the mechanisms of diabetic retinal damage in vitro over multiple time points. In Aim 1 we will determine which specific retinal neurons have a dysfunctional physiological response in diabetes and test a potential treatment to prevent this dysfunction, using single cell electrophysiology recordings of the responses of targeted bipolar cells and ganglion cells to light. In Aim 2 we will determine what changes in the mechanisms of neuronal signaling explain the physiological changes measured in Aim 1 in the targeted bipolar cells. In Aim 3 we will determine if the diabetes induced changes in neuronal signaling are accompanied or preceded by changes in morphology, survival and/or receptor expression, using the fluorescent protein expression of our targeted bipolar cells and immunohistochemistry techniques. These studies will be the first to make physiological measurements from individual retinal cell types in the intact retina from a diabetic mouse model, where it is possible to determine what neuronal mechanisms have changed due to diabetes. The illustration of the mechanisms of diabetic retinal neuronal damage will test one therapeutic target (dopamine deficiency) and suggest others, such as therapies that reverse changes in neuronal activity or promote neuronal survival that can be used in a time window where retinal damage from diabetes may not be irreversible. This will provide a foundation for future studies to determine if these direct neuronal changes correlate with vascular changes and how preventing neuronal changes would affect the end-stage of diabetic retinopathy."
"9204743","Project Summary/Abstract: Transgenic & Genetic Constructs (TGC)  The Transgenic & Genetic Constructs (TGC) Shared Resource, directed by Dr. Steven Fiering, provides services  for generating, maintaining, and genetically and experimentally manipulating genetically modified mice (GMM).  TGC provides mouse, cell, and genetic construct manipulation and speed congenics to NCCC researchers.  These technical services are provided by 3 technical specialists, one for the mouse work, one in Embryonic  Stem cell culture and general molecular biology research, and the third performing automated SNP genotyping  assays using Illumina(R) technology. Newer services of TGC involve using techniques to generate mice with  either humanized immune systems or humanized livers. A colony of immunodeficient Nod/SCID/IL2gamma  receptor knockout mice (NSG) is in high demand by NCCC researchers, because they are the optimal strain for  establishing xenografts of human tumor cell lines. For many GMM-based experiments, knowing the genetic  background carrying the genetic modifications is crucial. Traditionally, a 3-year process of random backcrossing  has been required to change the genetic background of a GMM. Dr. James Gorham, with assistance from  Fiering, established a speed congenic facility that uses automated SNP genotyping to perform speed congenic  and related services on GMM. Merging TGC with the Speed Congenics Resource expanded TGC services to  provide rapid identification of male breeders with the highest proportion of the desired background; this has cut  the required number of backcross generations from 10 to 5. On a daily basis, Fiering focuses primarily on the  transgenic mouse generation and utilization services, and Gorham focuses on the speed congenics, but they  work together to direct TGC as one unit. Combining these services into TGC has enabled us to expand and  improve services and efficiency to better serve our clients. The generation and utilization of GMM is a  technically complex field, with new techniques rapidly evolving. TGC constantly is developing new technical  capabilities and new services to broaden our ability to support GMM usage in cancer research. The vast  majority of services provided by TGC utilize equipment (e.g., tissue culture hoods, molecular biology equipment,  microscopes, and injection devices and surgical tools) that have been in the lab for most of the 16 years of its  existence. Biological systems in use at a given time, technological approaches and the faculty and their interests  constantly evolve. Our ability to provide the broad range of services is dependent primarily on the accumulated  skill of the personnel performing the service tasks, such as culturing ES cells, manipulating embryos, using  recombineering to generate constructs, and speed congenic analysis. TGC services are an important component  of the research conducted by 4 of 6 NCCC Research Programs (Cancer Mechanisms, Molecular Therapeutics,  Cancer Imaging & Radiobiology, and Immunology & Cancer Immunotherapy). TGC also has entered into shared  service agreements with the University of Vermont Transgenic Shared Resource and Jackson Labs to avoid  overlapping services and to refer clients for services not available at their institution."
"9017984","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     In recent war-related conflicts, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a signature injury affecting a large percentage of the Veteran population. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, also referred to as concussion) accounts for approximately 70-80% of all TBI among returning Veterans as well as the civilian population. Although most overt symptoms of mTBI resolve spontaneously within days or weeks of the injury, in 10-20% of mTBI victims some functional deficits persist, with recent estimates suggesting that as many as 44-50% of mTBI patients experience three or more symptoms at one-year post-injury. Repetitive mTBI is of particular interest because military personnel often have several mTBI exposures over the course of their lives and possibly within single deployments. Recurrent brain injuries, even when mild, may interfere with neuropsychological recovery. Repeated concussion has also been associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive impairments of memory and cognition, as well as depression, anxiety, and motor abnormalities.  Among the proposed environmental risk factors of neurodegenerative disease, TBI, including mild TBI, is probably one of the most consistent candidates for initiating the molecular cascades and provoking neurodegeneration leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Consequently TBI has been shown to accelerate pathology and behavioral deficits in genetic models of AD or to enhance vulnerability to Parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxins. Recent evidence also identified TBI as an environmental risk factor of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), an early onset dementia associated in its behavioral variant with behavioral abnormalities, loss of sociability, or impulsive and irrational behavior.  Our preliminary studies show that mild repetitive impacts to the head of mice using a controlled impactor (closed head injury) result in gliosis, white matter changes, and cognitive deficits 3 months after injury. Separately, we showed that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), a key growth factor in the hematopoietic system, has prominent neuroprotective effects in acute brain injury when administered systemically after injury. These effects are mediated via CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) expressed at least in part by injured neurons. A newly discovered second ligand for this receptor, IL-34, seems to be equally or more potent than CSF1 in our model. Most importantly, for this proposal, preliminary studies show a remarkable recovery of memory impairment and reduced gliosis with a single bolus treatment of CSF1 after injury in our model of mTBI.  Based on these preliminary data we hypothesize that mild traumatic insults to the central nervous system lead to long-term neurobehavioral deficits in mice which model in part the deficits observed in human mTBI patients, and that systemic treatment with CSF1 and IL-34 will attenuate brain injury and related behavioral deficits even if given days or weeks after injury. In this application we propose to refine our model of mTBI and assess long-term pathological and cognitive changes in wildtype mice. We will expose mice to multiple repetitive cortical impacts that are days or weeks apart and study the longterm consequences of these injuries. Most importantly, we will treat such impaired mice with neuroregenerative protein therapies days, weeks or months after the initial traumatic impact occurred. After completion of the proposed studies we expect to have preclinical proof for efficacy of CSF1 and/or IL-34 in reducing pathology and alleviating symptoms in mouse models of mTBI. Since CSF1 is used clinically in humans our findings may find rapid translation to the clinic."
"9252162","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol and other drug use are common in adolescence. Our prior studies found that adolescents with alcohol use disorders (AUD), and even binge drinking in the absence of a diagnosis, show abnormalities on indices of brain functioning, including neuropsychological test performance; hippocampal, prefrontal, and cerebellar volumes; white matter microstructural integrity; and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) response to cognitive and alcohol cue tasks. However, some of these indices are related to risk factors for adolescent alcohol involvement, such as family history of AUD. Thus, it is unclear if abnormalities observed in adolescent heavy drinkers are caused by alcohol exposure, or predated the onset of heavy drinking. Description: This renewal project will follow 296 youth previously characterized in R01 AA13419 prior to the onset of substance use. At baseline, these youth were 12-14 year-olds free from any psychiatric disorder with, on average, one alcohol use experience, and nearly half at risk for AUD based on family history. Baseline assessments, now complete, included neuropsychological testing and brain imaging with high resolution MRI, FMRI acquisition during working memory and alcohol cue presentation tasks, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this competing renewal, we will continue to follow these adolescents with quarterly interviews on substance use and general functioning. Each subject who initiates heavy drinking (defined as at least monthly binge drinking episodes), as well as a non-user matched for age, gender, and family history, will be invited back to repeat the protocol 3 times during this 5-year period (independent of whether they remain heavy drinkers or transition out during the duration of the project). As of Year 09, 29% (n=86) have initiated heavy drinking (most typically at age 17), and 61% (n=181) have remained non-drinkers/users (28 fall into neither group). Aims: The goal of this project now is to ascertain if indices of brain functioning (i.e., neuropsychological testing; hippocampal, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellar volumes; white matter microstructural integrity in frontoparietal and fronto-cerebellar tracks, and FMRI response to working memory in frontal and parietal regions and to alcohol cues in reward networks changes after the onset of heavy drinking to a different degree than observed in typically developing adolescents of the same age who do not use substances. We hypothesize that initiation of heavy drinking during adolescence will be associated with alternations in brain structure and function, and that gender will moderate this relationship. Other substance use (marijuana and nicotine) and other risk factors for AUD (externalizing behaviors, level of response to alcohol, and alcohol expectancies) will be evaluated as potential contributors to change in brain functioning. Based on our previous studies, we further hypothesize that baseline brain response patterns will significantly predict substance use involvement and outcomes. Pilot analyses will begin to look at normalization of these neural abnormalities, as some young adults transition out of heavy drinking."
"9391932","PROJECT SUMMARY  The neural crest is a multipotent stem cell-like population, unique to vertebrates, that is essential for normal craniofacial morphogenesis. These cells contribute to a wide variety of derivatives, including the craniofacial skeleton and cartilage, sensory and autonomic ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, and pigmentation of the skin. Neural crest progenitors arise at the neural plate border, between neural and non- neural ectoderm, and, after neurulation, reside within the dorsal aspect of the future central nervous system, the neural tube. Neural crest cells then undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to exit the neural tube, and migrate extensively at times to distant locations. Once they reach their destination, neural crest cells cease their migratory program and differentiate into a wide range of derivatives. The neural crest is indispensable for the development of the face? genetic defects affecting neural crest generation, migration, proliferation, or differentiation, result in numerous diseases and malformations affecting the face, e.g. Treacher Collins syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, and cleft palate to name a few. Thus, there is a need for basic scientific knowledge regarding the precise mechanisms underlying neural crest development.  To this end, the Specific Aims of this Proposal seek to use loss-of-function experiments to:  1) Characterize the role of a gene, draxin, in cranial neural crest fate specification and EMT/migration by  RNA sequencing and time-lapse confocal microscopy; and  2) Identify the signaling pathway(s) with which draxin interacts to regulate cranial neural crest development,  by fluorescent reporter expression and in situ protein-protein interaction assays.  The goal of this Proposal is to identify the mechanism by which draxin regulates cranial neural crest EMT and migration during development. Thus, the results of this Proposal will significantly enhance our understanding of the regulation of cranial neural crest EMT and migration, providing new scientific avenues for translational research applications in the treatment of craniofacial defects."
"9245197","Project Summary/Abstract  Right ventricle?to?pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduits are frequently used as a surgical palliative treatment for a variety of congenital heart diseases in infants and children. Due to the growth of the infant or child, or complications like kinking or thrombosis of the device, these conduits require replacement which may involve several major open heart surgery before adulthood. We propose to utilize 3D printing to design and develop a novel RV-PA conduit that increases its size via tailored self-unfolding triggered by flow and time so that fewer complications as well as surgeries are required to maintain and develop normal pulmonary blood flow from infancy to adulthood. It is envisioned that 3D printing will also allow for improved precision in patient customization and on-demand design changes to enable better functionality. We anticipate that self- unfolding mechanisms and associated shape changes will result in operation of the conduits over longer periods of infant and child growth into adulthood.  In the R21 phase, we will design, fabrication, surface modification, and in-vitro testing of self-unfolding RV- PA conduits. We will first conduct printing parameter studies for 3D printing of FDA-approved materials for fabrication of RV-PA conduits with variable dimensions. Simultaneously, we will utilize numerical simulations to determine design parameters that allow size changes and validate these using in-vitro tests for functionality and biocompatibility.  In the R33 phase, we will upgrade our 3D printer and refine the RV-PA conduits to enable printing with better resolution and with fluoropolymer inks to eliminate the need for surface modification. Finally, we will validate in- vivo operation using comprehensive hemodynamic evaluations and post-mortem gross-histological evaluation in a sheep model. We will analyze extracellular matrix formation, characterize endothelial cell function and white blood cell activation, and quantify immunohistochemistry for inflammation analysis.  We anticipate that these studies will enable a new class of RV-PA conduits as well as serve as a model for designing patient-specific shape changing biomedical implants for infants that are capable of growing at the same rate to reduce the number of follow up operations."
"9216603","The most well-established mechanism for the expression of the activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) is the trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) into or out of the postsynaptic membrane. This trafficking is believed to be shaped in important ways by the identity of the particular receptor subunits present in the dendritic spine. The dominant model of AMPAR trafficking has held that the unique C-terminal tails of these subunits play an important role in sorting these receptors to their intended destination, whether it be in the surface membrane, specifically in the postsynaptic membrane, or at an intracellular site. Recently that model has been partly challenged by findings that suggest that AMPARs are not sorted by subunit composition, but rather that the primary driver of LTP induction is a change in the properties of the postsynaptic density and/or in dendritic spine volume that captures additional AMPARs in a subunit indiscriminate manner. Yet at the same time, previous data, including our own, strongly support the idea that specific AMPAR subunits in the postsynaptic membrane are crucial for the induction of LTP and the specification of defined synaptic plasticity states. This grant seeks to leverage the existing knowledge about the trafficking of AMPA receptors in a new series of experiments that combines our established techniques of paired-neuron electrophysiological recordings with our more recently acquired ability to use array tomography to track the location of glutamate receptor subunits on dendritic spines of synapses specifically known to have undergone plasticity. We will test competing hypotheses concerning the nature of AMPA receptor trafficking into postsynaptic membranes during the induction of synaptic plasticity."

"9245951","Abstract  Individual variations in immune status and function shape responses to infection and contribute to disease severity and outcome. Infections with West Nile virus can be asymptomatic or severe, even leading to death, and no effective therapies or vaccines are available. Thus, identifying molecular signatures of immunity and phenotypes of susceptibility is essential to guide development of improved diagnostics, therapeutic interventions and future vaccines. We propose studies with a coordinated Systems approach for investigation of stratified subjects with West Nile viral infections to define how components of the immune response contribute to divergent outcomes. We will employ recent advances in high-throughput and high-resolution technology to profile individual immune responses in order to identify the molecular signatures defining divergent responses to West Nile virus infections. We will use shared platforms such as CyTOF, metabolomics, and innovative nanowell cytometry linked to single cell RNA-seq to provide insight into the immune responses to WNV. Our coordinated in-depth systems analysis includes for the first time the phenotype and functionality of neutrophils, platelets, and metabolomics in divergent clinical outcomes. Through integrating multiple immune components, we will define response profiles that correlate with successful outcome of infection. Strengths of our proposal are the well characterized clinical populations, the coordinated in-depth interrogation of multiple cell types and responses, the experienced and coordinated research team, the interrogation and integration of multiple variables that influence immune responses, and established HIPC consortium networks."

The postdoctoral training program employs specific, quantifiable training milestones emphasizing mentored research; publications; the development of career development awards; and required and elective didactic coursework including responsible conduct of research. Medical student training likewise emphasizes scientific reasoning and focused, mentored research. Ongoing evaluation is an integral component of the program, and includes UAB and EAB input. Program-specific and institutional efforts are aimed at the recruitment of underrepresented minority trainees and individuals with disabilities."
"9403451","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In its most recent research plan, the NHLBI's National Center for Sleep Disorders Research identified the need to train investigators as its highest priority. The Harvard Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine Program for Training in Sleep, Circadian and Respiratory Neurobiology, based at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has been addressing this need since 1998 and has been modified to address the new challenges in our field. This program provides structured, comprehensive research training to prepare outstanding individuals for academic positions in the broad field of sleep science and sleep medicine. For each trainee, the training program consists of core required courses and activities, elective courses and activities, and an intensive research experience. Cross-disciplinary and translational research is a highlight of this program, and formal mentoring and tracking components are integral features. Intensive research training experiences are available across the breadth of sleep, circadian and respiratory neurobiology areas, including basic as well as clinical and translational research opportunities, with several program projects that span multiple laboratories and institutions. There are 15 Full Preceptors with extensive experience and demonstrated success at training pre- doctoral and post-doctoral fellows, well-funded research programs (training faculty have current research support totaling over $25 million of direct costs per year), and outstanding resources that trainees will utilize for research. In addition, we have 11 Associate Preceptors who also oversee our trainees, and are actively being trained to be our next generation of mentors. Our training record over the past decade reveals the success of our efforts to train leaders in academic sleep science. Of our pre- and post-doctoral trainees funded by this training grant over the last 10 years, >80% have remained in academic medicine (still in academic training or now in faculty positions). More than 40% of those still in academic medicine have already received external grant support as PI or Co-I with the remainder well on their way to independence. Funds are requested to support four pre-doctoral graduate students, three pre-doctoral short-term summer minority medical students and eight post-doctoral trainees. Based on our highly completive application process, we are confident these slots will be filled by outstanding future leaders. This formal program has grown and been refined over the decade since inception, and meets a nationally recognized need to increase the number of highly qualified investigators in sleep science and sleep medicine.

"9104281","The long term goal of our research is to understand and manipulate immune surveillance pathways. The antigen processing mechanisms yields thousands of peptide/MHC complexes (pMHC I and pMHC II) on the cell surface as potential ligands for CD8+ and CD4+ T cells respectively. With prior funding support we showed that antigenic peptides are trimmed not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the endoplasmic reticulum by ERAAP, the ER aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing. This key concept is now part of current text book descriptions of antigen processing pathways. In ERAAP-deficient mice, lack of peptide trimming in the ER has been found to disrupt the normal peptide repertoire by both classic MHC Ia as well as non-classical MHC Ib molecules: many pMHC I are missing and numerous novel pMHC I emerge on the surface of ERAAP-deficient cells. The loss and gain of unique peptides results in vigorous reciprocal immune responses in wild-type versus ERAAP-deficient mice. We have also discovered that ERAAP and MHC I interact physically and functionally and truncated ERAAPdomains serve as dominant negative regulators of MHC I peptide presentation. Unexpectedly, we also discovered that ERAAP can also regulate peptide presentation by MHC class II molecules and hence CD4 T cell responses as well. These properties of ERAAP may explain the recent genome wide association studies that have shown that polymorphic variants of ERAP1 (human ortholog of mouse ERAAP) are associated with autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. Here we will test the molecular mechanisms and consequences of ERAAP's role in regulating the peptide repertoires presented by MHC I and MHC II molecules. We will also test the hypothesis that ERAAP polymorphisms influence the peptide presentation by particular MHC molecules that could cause normally tolerated self-peptides to become immunogenic and thus cause autoimmunity. We anticipate the results to provide new insights into the antigen processing pathways and how these pathways could be manipulated to regulate immunogenicity and presently incurable autoimmune disorders."

"9226519","Project Summary/Abstract  We propose to determine a how tick peritrophic membrane (PM) protein, named as putative chitin binding protein (CBP), influences PM formation as well as Borrelia burgdorferi infectivity in ticks. Lyme disease, a prevalent arthropod-borne disease in North America, is caused by spirochetal bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by Ixodes scapularis (I. scapularis) ticks. In nature, nave ticks acquire the spirochete via feeding on infected animals. Humans and many domesticated animals are accidental hosts of ticks. Once transmitted from infected ticks to hosts, B. burgdorferi can colonize a variety of target tissues causing a number of serious clinical complications. Despite there are more than 300,000 new estimated cases of Lyme disease in the United States every year and recent emergence of new and more virulent strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the United States < http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0208-lyme-disease.html >, a vaccine to prevent human infection unavailable. The tick gut represents the microbial entry point and also serves as the major organ for pathogen colonization and survival within the vector. The PM, which is an acellular strip-like structure, is formed during early stages of blood meal engorgement in ticks, is primarily composed of chitin microfibrils embedded in a matrix of proteins, such as chitin-binding proteins and glycoproteins. It covers the whole surface of the gut, physically separating the gut lumen from the epithelium [10]. Acting as an effective mechanical barrier, the PM prevents damage to gut cells from by ingested products and toxins and keeps the stability of the gut environment. In many arthropods, such as mosquitoes, a permanent PM structure exists before the intake of a blood meal. Notably, in ticks, the PM is transiently formed during the early course of feeding, which provides an opportunity to interfere with PM structure using inhibitors or specific antibodies directed against PM components critical for its formation or function. Here, we characterized a potential tick PM protein, termed as CBP for its roles in PM formation as well as B. burgdorferi survival within the vector. The goal of the current proposal is to further characterize biological functions of CBP and its use as a novel tick vaccine against Lyme disease."
"9205527","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common, complex diseases constitute a major human heath burden. Rare genetic variants are an important component of disease risk and a full understanding of genetic architecture will require studies of hundreds of thousands - perhaps millions - of individuals. Study design, including ethnic diversity and pedigrees, and leveraging phenotypes proximal to the gene level will be critical for early success. Across three Discovery Projects, we will generate 50,000 whole genome sequences in well-phenotyped individuals to study disorders of the cardiovascular system, bone and metabolism. These projects will utilize Illumina HiSeq X instruments and the world-class analysis and informatics pipelines at Baylor College of Medicine's Human Genome Sequencing Center. Methods for investigating noncoding variation, including long-read haplotypes and structural variation, will be given particular attention throughout. The discovery projects will be followed by replication studies in even larger numbers, and a case-cohort strategy will aggregate these data as a prelude to a comprehensive experiment based on recruitment of patients via large health care networks. These prospective collections are a first step toward realizing precision medicine."
"9196549","This multi-level intervention research project aims to accelerate successful translation of evidence-based family  interventions into widespread community practice to reduce behavioral health disparities in underserved and  minority communities by improving family resilience and access to services.

Participatory action research and empowerment evaluation methods  will guide this multi-pronged, multi-level research. One goal of this dissemination research is to reduce health  disparities in disenfranchised ethnic and underserved families by improving the existing community/researcher  partnership and feedback loops to develop a better understanding of ways to improve the research, training,  program, and dissemination of an evidence-based, family intervention the Strengthening Families Program. SFP  is 14-session family-focused intervention composed of three major components: parent training, children's skills  training, and family interaction. SFP 10 to 14 Years has been found to reduce by 2 to 3 times children?s lifetime  diagnosis of depression, social anxiety, phobias, and personality disorder in six randomized control efficacy  studies by different research teams with longitudinal studies up to 10 years at 22 years of age. With SFP going  to scale in behavioral and mental health centers nationwide and worldwide, questions remain, however,  concerning variables contributing to effectiveness under conditions of such broad dissemination and how these  finding can be used to avail the program to poor families through third party reimbursement (such as Medicaid).  This application represents a unique opportunity to study community participation in research on a citywide basis  and to work with Michigan?s newly formed Health Disparities Collaborative.

"9270473","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Identifying host determinants governing HIV transcription and latency is critical to developing an HIV cure. Cell-surface glycosylation and lectin-glycan signaling play critical roles in the establishment of several immune responses and modulation of cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions. The relevance of host glycosylation machinery to HIV latency is yet to be determined. We performed a pilot experiment involving the application of cutting-edge technologies to characterize the glycan structure profiles on the cell membranes of HIV latently- infected, productively-infected, and uninfected primary CD4+ T cells (obtained by infecting primary CD4+ T cells with a dual-fluorescence HIV reporter construct which enables the identification, quantification, and FACS-based purification of these cellular populations). Our pilot experiment strongly supports the hypothesis that latently-infected primary CD4+ T cells harbor a distinct glycomic profile, as compared to productively- infected or uninfected cells. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that the human carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-9 (Gal-9) regulates HIV transcription and potently reactivates latent HIV in vitro and ex vivo. Gal-9 signals through cell-surface N-linked glycans in vitro, modulating key transcription initiation and chromatin remodeling factors that regulate HIV latency. Our data reveal that host glycan structures on the surface of infected cells may mediate signals that define the transcriptional state of HIV, and suggest that Gal- 9 and the host glycosylation machinery should be explored as foundations for novel strategies to cure HIV. Aim 1 of our proposal will utilize a primary cell-based model to rigorously determine if HIV latently-infected CD4+ cells exhibit a distinct glycomic fingerprint that can be exploited to identify and target HIV latency. We will infect primary CD4+ T cells isolated from 40 HIV-uninfected donors with a dual fluorescent reporter HIV construct allowing the differentiation and purification of latently-infected, productively-infected, and uninfected cells. We will identify glycan patterns associated with HIV latency by profiling the cell-surface glycan structures of each population using an advanced, high-density lectin microarray platform. In Aim 2, we will decipher the nature of glycan-mediated recognition in Gal-9-mediated reversal of HIV latency. First, cell-surface glycan patterns of purified HIV latently-infected primary CD4+ T cells will be correlated with the ability of Gal-9 to reverse HIV latency in vitro. Then, we will use enzymatic deglycosylation to examine the requirement of cell- surface N-linked and O-linked glycans in Gal-9-mediated viral reactivation ex vivo in primary CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV-infected ART-suppressed individuals. This study will allow us to define the opportunities by which glycan-based interventions can be harnessed to identify and eradicate HIV infection."
"9224096","Cryptosporidium (Crypto), an intestinal parasite, causes diarrheal disease in humans worldwide. In the resource-constrained world, it is a leading cause of diarrhea and death in young children and a major opportunistic infection in untreated HIV/AIDS patients, in whom it can lead to severe, and ultimately fatal diarrhea and wasting. In the USA and other developed countries, it is a frequent cause of waterborne outbreaks of disease. Despite the global impact of Crypto, treatment options for cryptosporidiosis are severely limited. Nitazoxanide is the only FDA-approved drug for cryptosporidiosis. Thus, development of new interventions for cryptosporidiosis is imperative. There are several constraints to drug development for cryptosporidiosis. The pathogenesis of the disease and host-parasite interactions amenable to targeting for drug development are poorly understood. A major limitation to understanding pathogenesis is the lack of a primary human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) model for infection and propagation of the parasite. Although cancer-derived or primary IEC lines grown in 2D culture support temporary Crypto infection the parasite cannot be propagated in these cells for more than 5 days. Genetic modification of Crypto has recently been pioneered but is impeded by the lack of an in vitro system to propagate transgenic parasites. Thus, a primary human intestinal model that supports infection and propagation of wild type and transgenic Crypto and recapitulates human gut structure and function is essential. We previously reported the construction and characterization of a bioengineered 3D human intestinal model in vitro. Our preliminary data indicate that this model can support Crypto infection for at least 17 days and that Crypto from infected scaffolds can re-infect new scaffolds for up to three cycles. However, IEC lines used in this model are cancer-derived and may not recapitulate normal human IEC structure and function. Enteroids are functional 3-D intestinal epithelial units derived from adult intestinal crypt stem cells and can be infected with Crypto. The overall goal of this project is to establish the bioengineered 3D model using human enteroids or primary human IEC lines for Crypto infection. Our central hypothesis is that this model will support infection and propagation of Crypto, expedite genetic manipulation of the parasite and testing of interventions for cryptosporidiosis. The Specific Aims are to 1) Establish a bioengineered 3D primary human intestinal tissue model and 2) Develop and optimize this model for infection and propagation of Crypto. Success in establishing this model and achieving propagation of infection in the model will be transformative for Crypto research. The model can be used to study the pathophysiology and host-parasite-microbe interactions in human cryptosporidiosis, expedite genetic manipulation of the parasite and test targeted, effective interventions for cryptosporidiosis."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the competitive renewal of this joint Ohio State University (OSU)-Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) institutional T32 postdoctoral program is to provide interdisciplinary, translational, and state- of-the-art research training in congenital and acquired heart disease. This plan provides a unique opportunity to focus on a continuum of congenital and acquired heart disease from fetal life to senescence and to compare disease mechanisms and outcomes between these diverse populations. The rationale is that advances in heart disease therapy and prevention are most likely to originate from a translational research program that fosters collaboration between physician-scientists and basic scientists. We will expand ongoing efforts to provide an academic environment to cultivate true `bidirectional' research, so that significant clinical problems identified by our physician scientits can be addressed in the laboratory, and key findings at the bench can be rapidly translated to larger animal studies and back to the bedside.  This renewal application seeks 6 trainees per year for 5 years with a 2-3 year commitment. Fellows will be selected from MD, DVM, Pharm.D. or PhD trainees who have strong interests in cardiovascular research and are committed to careers in disease-oriented investigations. The Program Directors have a strong-track record in translational cardiovascular research and mentoring and will serve as the primary directors at their respective institutions. The training plan design consists of formal academic courses, seminars and journal clubs to provide trainees with an overview of heart disease and an in-depth cardiac research orientation. Trainees will participate in a tailor-made survival skills course comprised of various modules and workshops related to professional development. Each trainee will perform independent research projects in a mentor's laboratory. The research areas encompassed by the 34 extramurally-funded basic- and clinical- science mentors and 3 participating faculty are represented by their individual affiliations with The Heart Center at NCH and The Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute at Ohio State. A new clinical investigator pathway is added to the training program to enhance clinical research opportunities for MD fellows. The pathway will be directed by J. Phil Saul, MD, an internationally recognized physician-scientist and Chair of Pediatrics. An aggressive underrepresented minority recruitment and retention plan is described to increase trainee diversity. A cross-institutional system will be used to perform trainee and mentor evaluations. Overall metrics to determine success include programatic review by internal and external advisory committees and the successful execution of each trainee's individual development program. Trainee-specific metrics include completion of required coursework, annual evaluation by the mentoring team, and research productivity as assessed by the number of peer-reviewed manuscripts and abstracts, presentations at national meetings and grant submissions (NIH K, R21 and/or foundation grants)."

"9403698","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes the synthesis and further study of the monanchocidin family of marine natural products. The monanchocidins have novel chemical structures and potent biological activities making them ideal targets for chemical synthesis. Further, the monanchocidins are active against relevant human cancer cell lines, and related natural products active against a number of diseases, and thereby serve as lead compounds for the development of chemical probes and/or therapeutics. Synthetic access to the monanchocidins has not yet been reported and little is understood regarding their biological targets.  The objective of the proposed research is to develop a scalable and expedient approach to the pentacyclic guanidine alkaloids and apply this synthetic scheme to the monanchocidins and related natural products. We plan to achieve this goal by combining a concise and asymmetric synthesis of a linear precursor with a biomimetic guanidine-forming cascade. A stereoselective synthesis of a heavily oxidized morpholine heterocycle that constitutes the eastern half of the natural products is also targeted.  In parallel to our syntheti efforts we are investigating the biological activity of the natural product fragments as they become available and have already revealed interesting properties. We plan to advance these scaffolds to potent and selective chemical probes for polyamine signaling pathways and for in-vivo protein modification. We expect that our efforts will lead to significant advances in both synthetic chemistry and chemical biology and reveal rational paths forward for the development of chemical probes."
"9392514","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of adult Medicaid recipients and other low-income people with multiple chronic health conditions is rapidly rising (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2012). Health systems struggle to meet their needs, and effective approaches to support and treatment are lacking even as the ACA makes care accessible to larger numbers of low-income people. Many of these people are part of the growing demand for integrative medicine, but struggle to access these services because of their typically high out-of-pocket cost (Fritts, Calvo, Jonas, & Bezold, 2009). Group visits are an increasingly widely used innovation, bringing multiple patients together for medical care, education and support with one or more clinicians. Several studies have examined the use of integrative medicine in group medical visits (Chao, 2012; Geller, Orkaby, & Cleghorn, 2011) including culturally specific approaches (Mehl-Madrona, 2010). However, it is not clear how widely integrative medicine and group visit approaches are being combined and implemented, and whether patients and clinicians view group medical visits as an acceptable approach to integrative treatment. The purpose of this research training proposal is to acquire the necessary training for research that will examine the use of group visits as an approach to disseminating integrative medicine and increasing patient engagement in care. This exploratory, mixed-methods study seeks to understand the implementation and use of integrative medicine group visits across multiple health conditions, focusing on settings that serve Medicaid recipients and uninsured people. Methods will include a web-based survey of clinicians as well as interviews and participant observation with patients and clinicians, with the following specific aims: 1) Describe how integrative medicine and group visit approaches are being combined through a web-based survey of clinicians using this approach in safety-net settings, evaluating which complementary health approaches are being implemented for what health conditions; 2) Identify how clinicians assess the effectiveness, benefits and limitations of combining integrative medicine and group visit approaches in safety-net settings through interviews and observations; 3) Assess patient satisfaction levels and engagement in care in safety-net settings that combine integrative medicine and group visit approaches through interviews and observations. The long-term goal of this research is to assess the potential contributions of innovative integrative medicine delivery methods to address disparities in access to complementary health approaches as well as health disparities more broadly."
"9236368","The p53 tumor suppressor is a DNA damage/stress response protein that functions as a transcription factor to regulate a large number of genes that prevent proliferation of damaged cells via initiation of cell cycle arrest and senescent programs or via apoptosis and other mechanisms of cell death which are potent tumor suppressive mechanisms. Disruption of the pathway occurs most often through mutation or deletion of the p53 gene itself, but elevated levels of two important p53 inhibitors, MDM2 and MDM4, also contribute to tumor development in specific cancers. MDM2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation and both MDM2 and MDM4 inhibit p53 activity by masking its transcriptional activation domain. In mice, overexpression of Mdm2 or Mdm4 is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis, while deletion of either Mdm2 or Mdm4 results in p53-dependent lethal phenotypes. These and other studies provide compelling data for the relationship between Mdm proteins and p53 and have led to the development of MDM2 inhibitors (MDM2i) for the treatment of human cancers. Recently published Phase I clinical trials using one such MDM2i show promise as several patients achieved complete or partial responses or had stable disease following treatment and tumors exhibited activation of downstream p53 target genes. Unfortunately, these studies also highlighted serious adverse effects including hematological, gastrointestinal and kidney toxicities, phenotypes that were predicted from studies in mouse models. In addition, activation of known p53 targets did not always correlate with p53-mediated cellular events and implies tissue specificity of response. We have developed in vivo mouse models that allow us to probe the specificity of the p53 response at the molecular and organismal levels. Global loss of Mdm2 results in tissue-specific activation of p53 targets and apoptosis/senescence phenotypes which also vary by tissue type. In another model, deletion of the p53 target Puma but not p21 rescued some of the defects due to reduced MDM2 levels. These tissue specific differences need to be better defined to understand the toxicities of Mdm2i in humans and to develop potential biomarkers for toxicity. Thus the first aim will be to determine and functionally examine the p53 transcriptional program and the downstream pathways (senescence/apoptosis) that are activated in vivo upon depletion of Mdm2 in bone marrow, intestine and kidney. High MDM2 levels as occur in some human cancers are not tolerated by normal cells. We have completed a CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify factors that allow normal cells to survive despite elevated levels of MDM2 to identify and characterize synthetic lethal relationships with high MDM2 in tumors (aim 2). Lastly, we plan to determine the mechanisms and factors that cause increased MDM2 levels in tumors that lack amplification of the Mdm2 locus since small differences in MDM2 levels (and therefore p53) impact tumorigenesis (aim 3). Our studies will deepen our understanding of the p53-Mdm2 pathway, yield possible markers for toxicities to MDM2i, and uncover the molecular mechanisms that induce and support MDM2 overexpression in cancers."
"9198265","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in the X-linked gene that encodes MeCP2 (MECP2) are the cause of Rett Syndrome in girls. MECP2 duplication syndrome is an X-linked genomic disorder that accounts for 1-2% of all cases of X-linked intellectual disability (ID), primarily in boys. It is characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, infantile hypotonia, ID progressive neurological declines, and poor to absent speech. Data suggest that there are two distinct clinical paths in this syndrome. One path affects an estimated 50% of the population and is characterized by a dramatic loss of motor skills (regression) that eventually leads to death before the age of 25 resulting from complications of recurrent lower respiratory infections, suggesting possible immune deficits. In contrast, the other path is milder and includes individuals who maintain their milestones and have fewer infections. No study has examined the basis for these two alternative disease paths, or the contributing factors that lead toward a path of decline. The age of regression onset varies between 3-16 years. In addition to specific clinical markers, we have recently discovered that there are immune markers associated with regression that may account for the high frequency of respiratory infections, including impaired functioning of Th1 cells that make the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-?), and lower vaccine titers. We have also found that decreased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (a marker of stress) is associated with regression. This application therefore proposes a longitudinal study consisting of three annual evaluations of the clinical, immune, and stress markers of regression in males between the ages of 3-12 years with MECP2 duplication syndrome. The specific aims are: 1) To determine whether increased respiratory infections, lower cognition, seizures, and increased social withdrawal predict regression status in MECP2 duplication syndrome, 2) To determine whether suppression of IFN-? from Th1 cells and lower influenza vaccine titers predicts regression status, and 3) To determine whether HPA axis hypoactivity predicts regression status. Completion of this study will immediately affect clinical practice through implementation of better guidelines for yearly vaccines, and guidelines for possible immune therapy. It will also lay the foundation for a future treatment study testing whether drugs known to improve functioning of TH1 cells normalize or improve clinical course, enhance HPA axis activity, and therefore improve quality of life. Finally, completion of our aims will also have broader public health significance for autoimmune disorders consistently associated with MeCP2 overexpression, including: lupus, Sjgren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis."
"9187823","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to study the role of facial affect recognition deficits and social threat sensitivity in a sample of adolescent (ages 14-17) first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia (HR-SZ) in order to better understand social dysfunction and sub-threshold symptoms of psychosis. 40-75% of HR-SZ adolescents qualify for a major mental health diagnosis and 4-22% will eventually develop a psychotic disorder. Social dysfunction is a key marker for predicting which HR-SZ people will develop schizophrenia; however, little is known about specific pathways to dysfunction during late adolescence. Facial affect recognition deficits, difficulty decoding facial emotions in others, are present in HR-SZ people and predict psychosis and social dysfunction. Sensitivity to social threat may also be an important marker of psychosis risk and predictor of social dysfunction, as preliminary evidence suggests that HR-SZ adolescents report greater sensitivity to threat in daily life and have a hypersensitive pattern of cardiac autonomic responding characterized by slower return to baseline heart rate variability pattern after exposure to threats. The proposed study will examine whether excessive sensitivity to social threat (assessed through cardiac psychophysiology) and facial affect recognition deficits predispose HR-SZ adolescents to a pattern of increasing symptoms and social dysfunction compared to controls over three time points: baseline, 6 months later, and 1 year later. Sensitivity to social threat and facial affect recognition deficits are characteristic of those with schizophrenia and their relatives but not specific to them; these domains have been identified as NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDocs), and thus the proposed research should have relevance to the study of psychopathology across diagnostic boundaries. The proposed study would also provide the first-known use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine social dysfunction and sub-threshold symptoms of psychosis in daily life for HR-SZ adolescents. Starting the second year of the proposed funding period, EMA methods will be combined with ambulatory heart rate variability to examine how daily life measures of autonomic functioning relate to baseline laboratory-assessed sensitivity to social threat and behavioral EMA responses. To appropriately evaluate her research questions, the candidate will receive training in social and neurobiological aspects of typical and prodromal adolescent development, longitudinal study design and data analysis, and assessing psychophysiological response to threat with laboratory and ambulatory cardiovascular responding.

"9187986","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stroke has the largest racial disparity of any chronic disease, Geographic disparities also exist, and the magnitude of both disparities is increasing. Alarmingly, REGARDS has documented racial and geographic disparities in cognitive decline that are of the same magnitude as for stroke. A lack of understanding of the causes of these disparities has contributed directly to the failure to reduce or eliminate them.  REGARDS is a national cohort of 30,239 black and white community-dwelling participants aged 45+ when enrolled in 2003-2007. We propose to utilize the cohort to build on findings to date and extend our findings to evaluate new hypotheses. REGARDS is positioned to document disparities in incidence of stroke and cognitive impairment and also to understand why these disparities exist.  We propose to conduct a second in-person evaluation to define incidence and progression of stroke risk factors. We will continue stroke ascertainment to double the number of stroke events and improve our ability to define factors contributing to the as yet unexplained stroke disparities. By continuing cognitive assessments, and adding more sensitive in-person measures of cognitive function, and instrumental activities of daily living, we will advance the understanding of causes and clinical relevance of disparities in cognitive decline. We propose the following specific aims:  ? Specific Aim #1: to quantify incidence of, and change in severity of stroke risk factors over  9 years of follow-up, and to establish causes for racial and geographic disparities in these  risk factors.  ? Specific Aim #2: to evaluate three pathways that may account for unexplained disparities:  a) differential impact of risk factors where the same change in risk factor increases risk  more for one race than the other, b) residual confounding from incomplete characterization  of risk factors, and c) novel stroke risk factors including psychosocial and behavioral  factors.  ? Specific Aim #3: Measure the functional impact of cognitive impairment, estimate the  prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment over 10 years of follow-up, and account  for racial disparities in cognition attributable to literacy by gathering new information on  functional performance and word reading ability."
"9177693","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The piRNA pathway has a conserved role in transposon silencing and genome maintenance during germline development. Adaptation to new genome pathogens by the Drosophila piRNA genome defense system appears to be driven by transposition into heterochromatic clusters, which produce the primary piRNAs that to initiate silencing. The HP1 homolog Rhino binds to clusters and is evolving rapidly under positive selection, suggesting that it may co-evolve with invading mobile elements. piRNA clusters and Rhino thus function at the adaptive interface between the piRNA pathway and transposons. Aims1 and 2 combine evolutionary divergence and conservation with genetic, genomic, computational and cytological tools to define this critical interface. The ability to differentiate cluster transcripts from mRNAs is critical to the specificity of the piRNA dense system, and our recent data suggest that stalled spicing may mark cluster transcripts for processing into silencing RNAs. Aim 3 focuses on the role of splicing in piRNA precursor sorting into the silencing pathway. These studies address mechanisms that maintain the inherited genome and are likely to directly impact reproductive health."
"9404542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this first renewal of the Integrated Biological Systems Training in Oncology (IBSTO) program is to continue to prepare predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows for careers in cancer research with comprehensive training in basic and translational research. IBSTO training focuses on basic cellular processes and mechanisms that are shared between cell biology and developmental biology that are critical to understanding how cells become tumorigenic and on how to translate this basic research knowledge to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cancer. The IBSTO program takes place in an active and growing Medical Center environment with state-of-the-art facilities, a vibrant NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, top-ranked basic science departments, an Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences, and an active Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. The Program Director has a strong record of basic cancer research and administrative experience. In our first four years we have already recruited 22 outstanding predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees that have been very productive. Trainees have been placed with experienced, well-funded, productive preceptors in an interactive research environment with extensive resources. The three broad areas of experience of our preceptors are in cell biology, developmental biology/genetics and medicine. Each trainee has mentors from each group to provide unique and valuable perspectives to enhance their cancer-related research training. The goals of our training program are to provide proactive mentoring and oversight, provide cross-discipline education and research, provide training in cutting edge methodology, develop useful academic skills, foster interactions with faculty and other trainees, provide exposure to current cancer research discoveries, and provide exposure to clinical cancer treatment and translational research. In this renewal we have strengthened our clinical/translational component with the addition of an Associate Director and new preceptors who focus on translational research and new required clinical training experience in oncology. We strongly believe that integrating basic science research training in cell biology, developmental biology and genetics with translational and clinical experience allows a better understanding of the multiple lesions in cellular processes that define cancer, which is critical t diagnosing, treating and eventually preventing of this disease."
"9353970","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is among the most severe and burdensome medical conditions worldwide, yet the brain alterations that lead to the symptoms of schizophrenia remain unknown. This K01 application presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator focused on understanding the neurobiology of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. The activities in this application build on the candidate's prior training and are set i a resource-rich environment that will foster his development of expertise in 1) principles of clinica imaging in schizophrenia, 2) neuroanatomy of subcortical circuitry relevant to schizophrenic illness, 3) methods for collection and analysis of high-resolution functional connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging data in psychosis, and 4) responsible conduct of research. The overarching goal of the research to be carried out in this application is to take findings from animal models o schizophrenia, which were motivated by original research in patients with the disorder, back to the clinical setting in order to determine whether the brain alterations observed in the animal models are observable in human patients. Specifically, findings in the dopamine D2 receptor over expressing mouse model, which was developed to model the excess of D2 receptor activity in the associative striatum of patients with schizophrenia, suggest an alteration in anatomical projections from the associative striatum to the external segment of the globus pallidus. In addition, findings in the 22q11 deletion syndrome mouse model, which was developed to model a known genetic risk factor for schizophrenia in humans with 22q11 deletion, suggest an alteration in the functional strength of connections from the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus to the auditory cortex. This project will directly test the existence of these alterationsin brain connectivity in medication-nave patients with schizophrenia using functional connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging. If such evidence is found, it would have important implications for our understanding of the brain bases of schizophrenia, and would generate new molecular and anatomical targets for treatment of this devastating illness."
"9188006","Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major complication of diabetes and is a leading cause of amputations  of digits or limbs. My laboratory has focused for the past 15 years on the molecular regulation of genes in  hypoxic stress. In the previous cycle, three major discoveries linked RAGE to regulation of acute responses  to hypoxia: First, in cultured endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages, acute exposure to hypoxia  resulted in rapid release of AGE-reactive epitopes within minutes of hypoxic stress. Second, in the intact  heart and in primary murine aortic and human aoilic endothelial cells, RAGE regulated rapid upregulation of  Egr-1 in a manner suppressed by deletion or knockdown of RAGE and by aminoguanidine, an AGE inhibitor.  Third, in collaboration with Project 1, we showed that monocytes/macrophages devoid of RAGE orthe  RAGE cytoplasmic domain binding partner, diaphanous-1 or mDia-1, did not upregulate Egr-1 in acute  hypoxia. To address the diabetes-relevant implications of these findings, we employed an in vivo model of  hind limb ischemia induced by unilateral femoral artery ligation. Diabetes significantly impairs vascular repair  mechanisms in this model. Our preliminary data reveal a fascinating and unexpected switch in RAGE  signaling in acute vs. chronic oxygen deprivation ... whereas RAGE signaling upregulates Egr-1 in acute  hypoxia, in hind limb ischemia, particularly in diabetes, RAGE suppresses adaptive induction of Egr-1 and, in  parallel, reduces angiogenesis and blood flow recovery. In this application, we will probe the effects of  specific deletion of RAGE in either monocytes/macrophages or endothelial cells to dissect the mechanisms  by which RAGE action suppresses angiogenesis and blood flow recovery. Together with Projects 1&3, we  will discern the fine-tuning mechanisms by which RAGE acts in common cardiovascular stresses, as all three  Projects will use Affymetrix arrays to develop an integrated picture of RAGE signaling in distinct cell types  and situations. We will use all three Cores in all five years ofthe Program."

"9401839","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Hematology Clinical Research Training Program at the University of Pennsylvania was established in 1978 and has provided training for 132 men and women. The program's primary goal is to help a diverse group of individuals prepare for careers as investigators in the broadly-defined discipline of hematology and blood disorders. The faculty includes 37 trainers of all academic ranks and a plan is in place for adding or withdrawing trainers when appropriate. Up to 12 new trainees are accepted each year (8 postdocs and 4 predocs). Candidates were originally were drawn primarily from physicians enrolled in the clinical hematology training programs in the Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics. Since 1998 we have also supported postdoctoral trainees who are not physicians and, since 2004, predoctoral trainees, most of whom are in Penn's MD-PhD program. The connection to the MD-PhD program takes advantage of the PI's role as the director of that program. The inclusion of predoctoral students reflects our belief in the long term value of involving talented students to hematology-related research at an earlier point in their training as scientists and physician-scientists. Essential features of the program include formal and informal advising, skills workshops, attendance at local seminars and national conferences, coursework, training in the responsible conduct of research, and an annual symposium. MD postdoctoral fellows have the option of enrolling in a Biomedical Graduate Studies (BGS) PhD program. Outcomes. 117 postdoctoral trainees (68 MD, 17 MD-PhD and 32 PhD) and 15 pre-doctoral trainees (10 MD-PhD and 5 PhD) have been supported.

"9224641","Project Summary Thyroid cancer is the most-common endocrine malignancy. Its incidence has tripled in the last thirty years. Diagnosis of thyroid cancer is difficult because 50% of people older than 65 have at least 1 thyroid nodule, but only 10% of the nodules are cancerous. Approximately 1.6 billion dollars are spent annually in the US to detect thyroid cancer. Conventional ultrasound is used to identify nodules that warrant a needle biopsy. However, 65% of needle biopsies are negative for cancer and 30% are ?indeterminate.? The indeterminate nodules are surgically removed for definitive diagnosis and 75% of them prove to be benign. Therefore, well more than 80% of initially presenting nodules undergo unnecessary biopsies and more than 20% of them also undergo subsequent unnecessary surgery procedures. Accordingly, the broad objective of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of using quantitative-ultrasound (QUS) methods to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules reliably and thereby to reduce the enormous cost and risks associated with unnecessary biopsies and surgical excisions. The first aim of the project is to develop and asses the ability of QUS to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules and to compare the ability of QUS to the ability of conventional methods to select nodules that warrant biopsies; the second aim is to expand QUS methods by combining existing QUS measures developed by Riverside Research with measures derived from so-called B-flow- imaging (BFI) and shear-wave-elasticity (SWE) techniques developed by GE; the third aim is to formulate an objective basis for planning future, prospective studies to translate the findings of the present study to a commercial instrument that can bring QUS-based nodule evaluation into the clinic. To achieve these three aims, QUS performance in classifying cancerous and benign nodules will be compared to the performance of conventional ultrasound and the results of fine needle cytology, molecular marker analyses, and, in the cases of that undergo surgical excision, histology, will used as gold standards. Classification will be performed using standard, well understood, linear, and non-linear methods, such as linear-discriminant analysis and support- vector machines respectively. If feasibility is successfully demonstrated in the proposed project, and if the demonstration of feasibility ultimately leads to future incorporation into an instrument capable of real-time QUS analysis for reliable nodule evaluation, then a highly significant technological advance will be realized that can provide valuable, risk-reducing, cost-effective health-care benefits for patients presenting with thyroid nodules.

"9215116","Regulation of the LIN28/let-7 pathway in cancer The RNA-binding proteins LIN28A/B control the biogenesis of let-7 tumor suppressor miRNAs. Reactivation of this embryonic pathway is sufficient to promote cellular transformation and drive tumorigenesis in mouse models. Notably, LIN28B functions as an oncogene in neuroblastoma, Wilms tumors (nephroblastoma), hepatoblastoma, and others. At the molecular level, LIN28A recruits the Terminal Uridyl Transferases (TUTases), ZCCHC6/11, to let-7 precursor RNAs targeting them for destruction by the DIS3L2 exonuclease. Germline DIS3L2 mutations cause Perlman syndrome - a rare developmental and cancer predisposition disorder with ~6,000-fold elevated risk of Wilms tumorigenesis. Somatic mutations in DIS3L2 have also been found in ~30% sporadic Wilms tumors. Despite this genetic evidence that DIS3L2 functions as a tumor suppressor its molecular and cellular function remains unaddressed. Similarly, the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) of fetal overgrowth is associated with ~600-fold elevated risk of developing Wilms tumors, yet the molecular and cellular function of the H19 long-non-coding RNA, a likely tumor suppressor gene in BWS, remains unknown. Considering the strong links between miRNA, LIN28, DIS3L2, and Wilms as well as preliminary data linking H19 to the LIN28/let-7 pathway, leads us to hypothesize that dysregulation of let-7 biogenesis is a unifying mechanism in Wilms tumorigenesis. Loss-of-function studies will be performed to address the possible redundant role of ZCCHC6/11 in LIN28B regulation of let-7, and biochemical approaches will be employed to elucidate the mechanism by which LIN28B suppresses let-7 in human cancer cells. Relative levels of let-7, H19, LIN28A/B, and DIS3L2 will be measured in a panel of cell lines and primary human Wilms tumors and RNA sequencing analysis will be performed on a subset. H19- and DIS3L2 loss- and gain-of-function experiments will be performed in human cancer cells and the effects on gene expression, cell growth, and tumorigenicity will be measured. Novel approaches will be applied to identify new DIS3L2 target RNAs. This will provide important mechanistic insight into the LIN28/let-7 pathway in human cancer cells, uncover the tumor suppressive role of H19 in pediatric cancer, and highlight the relevance of RNA decay mechanisms in cancer by elucidating DIS3L2 tumor suppressive function."

"9343352","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent and/or dysregulated macrophage activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Imaging activated macrophages using a non-invasive approach would allow frequent monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy. In the first phase of this RFA, we focused on developing optical and nuclear imaging strategies based on expression of folate receptor ? (FR?) by activated macrophages. In the setting of lung inflammation, we showed markedly increased FR? expression in macrophages and monocytes that co- expressed high levels of inflammatory cytokines. In preliminary data, we showed that chronic airway inflammation in COPD results in a dramatic increase in FR?-expressing macrophages. In lung macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from COPD patients, approximately 50% express FR?, whereas only <10% of macrophages from healthy controls express FR?. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that folate-based molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) to detect activated macrophages can identify COPD patients and determine those most likely to have rapid disease progression due to higher levels of chronic lung inflammation. Specific aims are designed to: 1) validate folate-based PET probes in mouse models of COPD, 2) perform dosing, toxicology, and safety studies with folate-based PET probes in rodents and humans, and 3) test whether folate-based PET imaging can be used to identify COPD patients and determine whether the PET signal correlates with measurements of inflammation, disease severity, and rate of disease progression. Initial studies will optimize our current folate-PET probes and determine whether PET imaging of activated macrophages can be used to identify progression of disease in mouse models of COPD. Subsequently, dosing and toxicology studies will be performed in rodents and humans, followed by a Phase I study in humans comparing individuals with COPD to control subjects without lung disease. For this investigation, we will partner with an ongoing EDRN-sponsored study designed for longitudinal evaluation of a cohort at risk for lung cancer. PET imaging will be performed prior to scheduled bronchoscopy, which is completed as part of the follow-up evaluation in this cohort. Imaging data will be correlated with parameters of inflammation in BAL and physiologic measurements of disease severity and progression. Together, these studies will determine whether folate-based imaging is useful for quantifying inflammation in lung diseases like COPD, and whether identifying macrophage activation could delineate a subgroup of patients who would benefit from anti-inflammatory or macrophage-targeted therapies.

"9245950","PROJECT SUMMARY Lyme disease, due to infection with the Ixodes tick-transmitted spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, with over 300,000 new cases annually. Infection can result in asymptomatic IgG seroconversion or cause clinical disease manifesting as an isolated skin lesion erythema migrans (EM) or with systemic illness involving the skin, heart, nervous system and/or joints. The infection is most responsive to antibiotics when identified early, but those people with disseminated infection or in whom treatment is delayed can experience debilitating disease that can become unresponsive to antibiotics. The immune responses to Bb associated with asymptomatic IgG seroconversion and that give rise to specific organ system involvement are poorly understood. This proposal will profile the innate and adaptive immune responses that arise after Bb infection in well-characterized patients with a) asymptomatic IgG seroconversion; b) isolated EM; c) acute disseminated infection with multiple EM and/or neurologic disease; and d) the late manifestation of arthritis. We will use novel state-of-the-art technologies to deeply characterize the immune response to Bb over time, both phenotypically and functionally, and correlate these responses with clinical presentations and outcomes. State-of-the-art high-resolution technologies such as CyTOF will be conducted on whole blood and synovial fluid, and T cell library populations exhibiting different chemokine receptors defining cytokine secretion and tissue migration will be generated to evaluate antigen-specific responses. The transcriptomes of responding T cell subsets in blood and other cell populations of interest identified by CyTOF will be analyzed by single cell RNAseq. Novel nanowell technologies will be used when cell samples are limiting, as in the case of skin biopsies or CSF samples, to characterize responding cells at the single cell level phenotypically using MuSIC (MultiSpectral Imaging Cytometry). These same tissues will be interrogated for immune signatures found in blood vs those unique to these sites and will be further assessed by single cell RNAseq. Along with the immune responses, we will also profile the host metabolome to define metabolite signatures associated with divergent clinical outcomes. Enabling this understanding of the immune response will be a systems biology approach to data integration, including clinical status, host metabolites and in vitro cell responses, to support an in-depth analysis and modeling of the host metabolic and immune responses as they evolve in subjects with Lyme disease. The output of this functional systems immunology approach will be definitions of human metabolite and immune signatures following infection with an extracellular bacterial pathogen Bb that will be compared to other infectious pathogens, with the ultimate goal of defining future targets for intervention and predicting susceptibility or resistance to systemic disease."

Our  long-range goal is to eliminate disparities in physical and behavioral health developing, implementing and  disseminating community-based multilevel interventions and creating sustainable health equity solutions in  partnership with a broad cross-section of multi-sectorial stakeholders.   The Dissemination and Implementation Science Core will conduct both research dissemination  (defined as use of active approaches to spreading research findings about evidence-based interventions to the  target audience via determined channels using planned strategies) and dissemination and implementation (D/I)  research (defined as the study of methods to disseminate and promote the integration of research findings and  evidence into healthcare policy and practice). In other words, the Core will identify, develop effective methods,  systems, infrastructures, and strategies to widely disseminate research findings and also contribute to scientific  knowledge about how to overcome barriers to the adoption, integration, and sustainment of evidence-based  multilevel interventions, particularly those examined in Center research projects. Aim 1 is to convert each  Center research project into a Hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation study by conducting a mixed-  method, multi-stakeholder process evaluation of multilevel intervention training and delivery. This includes  examining facilitators and barriers of implementation in these studies to help design future scale-up strategies.

"9404159","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Washington University Program in Principles of Pulmonary Research provides multidisciplinary training for predoctoral and postdoctoral scholars committed to a career in respiratory research. The postdoctoral portion of the Program enables MD and MD/PhD physicians who are training in pulmonary and critical care medicine to learn state-of-the-art scientific research in concert with PhD trainees from a basic science background. The predoctoral portion of the Program engages students in the MD/PhD and PhD graduate division to work in close connection with the same respiratory research curriculum. The proposal remains at seven postdoctoral and five predoctoral trainees with 2-3 years of support before transitioning to additional career development awards. The aim of the Program is to promote the career development of trainees so they will enter academic pulmonary medicine with the skills needed to study problems relevant to respiratory diseases. The Program is closely monitored through a Director and four Committees (Internal Advisory, External Advisory, Review, and Diversity Recruitment) and relies on 25 senior mentors, 11 junior mentors, and 15 support faculty distributed into a coordinated set of three interdisciplinary research tracks, including two basic-translational tracks (Immunology-Host Defense and Epithelial Cell-Matrix Biology) and one clinical-translational track (for further application to human disease). The basic tracks are designed to correspond to the major themes of the pulmonary research program and to coincide with the graduate training program, and the clinical track is aimed at extending these fields to human subject research and the CTSA curriculum. This program structure allows for a broad-based faculty from 13 departments to coordinate and focus research activities and trainee supervision in a collaborative and synergistic process. For all trainee activities within this structure, there is also a carefully constructed mentoring process that includes benchmarks for individual trainee presentation, publication, and grant application. To achieve these goals, all predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees engage in the same research review process that is home-based around a joint Research and Development Conference. This conference is the hub for input from an overall Program Review Committee (that includes the Program Director and his advisors) and a project-specific Advisory Committee (that includes the trainee's mentors, co- mentors, and collaborators). Trainees also receive input via individual lab and group meetings as well as additional research conferences that are set up to coordinate with the research themes of the Program. The research-intense experience is supplemented through graduate coursework to build general skills and specific knowledge of a research field. Together, these mechanisms serve to ensure high-level trainee experiences and performance in previous and present cycles of this longstanding and highly successful Program."
"9385920","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States healthcare system spends far more than any other developed county and we consistently have worse outcomes. Comparative and cost-effectiveness research (CER2) are fields of scientific inquiry that employ innovative methods to generate knowledge aimed at improving quality and efficiency by informing the everyday decisions confronting clinicians, patients, purchasers and policy makers. This is in contrast to efficacy research, such as a randomized controlled trial, where the question is typically whether the treatment can work under a controlled environment. Because CER2 is designed to inform actual patient situations, it is much more patient-centered. Many have recognized that CER2 will be important tools to inform decisions about health promotion and disease prevention in underserved high-risk populations such as racial and ethnic minorities, persons with multiple chronic conditions, the elderly and children. The United States research community has an unprecedented opportunity to improve the nation's health system and the health of the population as well as improve efficiency through CER2; and, nurse scientists, whose research provides the evidence base for nursing practice, which is the largest clinical workforce in the United States, need to be trained in CER2 methods. This training grant, CER2 Training for Nurse Scientists, provides an opportunity to train nurse scientists in this important field. The Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), including the Columbia University School of Nursing (CUSON), is an excellent environment to train nurse scientists in CER2 methods. This application builds upon the complementary strengths of CUSON's faculty with expertise in mentoring pre-doctoral and post-doctoral students in CER2 methods; their research foci on high-risk, underserved populations as well as the robust infrastructure of CUMC in CER2 methods. The specific aims are: 1. To recruit and retain a qualified diverse cadre of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral nurse fellows to conduct CER2 comparing the everyday effectiveness of approaches to health promotion and/or disease prevention across the continuum of care in high-risk, underserved populations; 2. To implement a training curriculum for CER2 methods that includes the integration of theories and methods used in the conduct of rigorous CER2 training for nurse scientists trainees; 3. To enhance the knowledge and skills of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral nurse scientist trainees in CER2 methods to inform patient and/or policy decisions about health promotion and/or disease prevention across the continuum of care in high-risk, underserved populations; and, 4. To evaluate the CER2 Training for Nurse Scientists program structures, processes, and outcomes on an ongoing and annual basis. These aims are well-matched to the mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research, which is to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, communities, and populations; as well as help nurse scientists to be leaders in identifying high-quality, high-value, patient-centered approaches to health promotion and disease prevention across the continuum of care."
"9404497","President Barack Obama was delivering on a promise made in his State of the Union Address when he  officially launched the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), igniting intensive work by Dr. Francis Collins and the PMI Working Group this year. The promise is bold: nothing less than truly revolutionizing the way we develop therapies and treatments for patients across America. With the PMI, we can credibly claim that we will improve health outcomes for all.  Achieving this vision will require the efforts of numerous healthcare stakeholders. Because the PMI has the promise to solve our most intractable health problems by harnessing the power of data, success requires recruiting individuals willing to share their personal information. These volunteers ? the 1 million Americans who will comprise the PMI Cohort Program (PMI-CP) ? are the pillars upon which the PMI will stand. The volunteers will need to understand the goals of the PMI, the logistics of what volunteering means and the specifics of why sharing their personal health data and biospecimens will benefit the health of future generations. With the right communications strategy, cohort volunteers will not only understand their individual importance to this cause, they will also be actively enthusiastic, and assist in the recruitment of additional volunteers from their communities.  This is a proposal to help accomplish this feat through a multi- faceted campaign with a suite of outreach strategies designed to find, educate, and activate a cohort that is representative of the diversity of our country. It will require communications strategies that reach many thousands at a time, as well as multiple targeted, personalized micro-strategies. Messaging is at the core of achieving buy-in and making participation a matter of personal, community, and civic pride. As bold and large as the PMI is, recruiting the cohort comes down to the individual.  Garnering this level of buy-in will require a team with expertise in not only communications and patient advocacy, but also with a record of achieving the level of trust needed to connect with individuals in a meaningful way and the ability to motivate them to take action. The team must have the ability to speak across cultures, ethnicities, and socio-economic statuses. We have assembled that team. And we would be honored to make the PMI vision a reality."
"9233104","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue reconstruction and closure of incisions and wounds is pertinent to almost all surgical interventions and traumatic injuries. This project aims to develop a medical sealant that reduces cost, inflammatory response and disease transmission risk, while improving procedural outcomes. Current clinical options suffer from a combination of high cost, poor material properties, and biocompatibility issues. Utilizing a technique called solution blow spinning, polymer fibers can be deposited directly onto any surface. Solution blow spinning has the potential to be a powerful tool in surgery and in biomaterials fabrication. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the use of solution blow spun polymer blends of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) for use as a surgical sealant in an intestinal anastomosis model. The hypothesis for this research is: solution blow spun PLGA/PEG blends will have advantages over existing sealant strategies, leading to better surgical procedure outcomes. This proposal has been designed to utilize the complementary expertise and facilities at the University of Maryland's Functional Macromolecular Laboratory (UMD) and the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation at Children's National. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are: 1. Adhesive optimization, characterization, and in vitro assessment 2. Polymer functionalization for improved adhesion and in vitro characterization 3. In vivo pre- clinical efficacy and biocompatibility of blow spun polymer sealants in acute and chronic pre-clinical models. This work aims to correlate material properties and deposition conditions to in vitro and in vivo efficacy, and will lead to greater insight into the development of effective surgical materials. Ultimately, successful development of the direct deposition of polymer fiber constructs using solution blow spinning onto any surface could lead to clinically translatable approaches in a diverse variety of surgical applications and in biomaterials fabrication."

"9404198","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests continued funding, at a level of eight training positions, for a postdoctoral training program in arteriosclerosis that began in 1978 and was last renewed on July 1, 2008. The goal of this program is to train basic and clinical investigators with broadly based knowledge in the major fields related to arteriosclerosis research. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has a major impact on the health of the American population, making this training program very relevant. This training program functions within a broad framework of research dealing with various aspects of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a strength of the program is the many collaborative interactions that exist between faculty and collaborative research programs for trainees has always been stressed. A group of senior scientists will act as mentors both to postdoctoral trainees working in their laboratories as well as to other trainees in the laboratories of more junior faculty members. The program also includes training in clinical/translational aspects of cardiovascular research. Many of the senior faculty have worked together at Columbia for more than 20 years. They interact through research efforts, joint weekly research conferences, and educational programs such as the Institute of Human Nutrition. Dr. Ira Goldberg, PI and Director of the training program, has been actively engaged as a mentor of young basic and clinical scientists for many years. The former director, Dr. Ginsberg, three associate directors, and leaders of the four training themes form an executive committee that oversees research, admissions, career development and administration. Regardless of the research focus, all trainees will enroll in didactic programs to strengthen their knowledge in biostatistics and clinical trials and to obtain some background in basic laboratory investigation. Mentoring is also a focus of the program. New faculty were added to bring new strengths to the program in vascular biology and translational research. This latter focus includes integration with a newly awarded NIH CTSA. The program will continue to recruit a mix of Ph.D. and M.D. trainees and trainees will work with a mix of M.D. and Ph.D. faculty. A program to enhance recruitment of scientists from underrepresented ethnic groups is in place and has been successful. (End of Abstract)"
"9229742","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aside from age, elevated blood pressure is the most predominant cardiovascular disease risk factor worldwide. In the United States it is estimated that ~60% of the adult population have elevated blood pressure in either the prehypertensive (120-139/80-89 mmHg) or hypertensive (>140/90 mmHg) range. Both prehypertension (particularly systolic BP >130 mmHg) and hypertension are associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and vascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction is a major factor underlying the increased risk of vascular events with elevated blood pressure. In addition, insufficient nightly sleep (<7 hr/night) and poor sleep quality have been linked not only to the etiology of elevated blood pressure but are also a prevalent, often ignored, comorbidity. Indeed, short sleep duration and/or poor sleep quality is now considered to be a plausible risk factor for elevated blood pressure and a harbinger of increased cardiovascular risk. A high prevalence of insufficient nightly sleep has been reported in hypertensive adults. Importantly, habitual sleep duration of less than 7 hr/night is independently associated with an increased risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. The influence of insufficient sleep on vascular endothelial function in adults with elevated blood pressure is unknown. Moreover, given the emerging relation between sleep duration and quality and blood pressure, sleep represents an important, and currently neglected, therapeutic target for improving vascular health and, in turn, reducing cardiovascular risk in adults with elevated blood pressure. The present proposal will test the following hypotheses: 1) that chronic insufficient sleep is associated with diminished endothelium- dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and endothelial tissue-type plasminogen activator release in adults with elevated blood pressure. Furthermore, the postulated diminishment in endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function with insufficient sleep will be due, at least in part, to increased oxidative stress; and 2) increasing sleep duration and improving sleep quality (utilizing individualized targeted sleep interventions) will increase both endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and endothelial tissue-type plasminogen activator release in adults with elevated blood pressure. Increases in endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function will be due, at least in part, to reduced oxidative stress. To test these hypotheses, 124 middle-aged adults with elevated blood pressure (>130/80 mmHg) will be studied. Endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function will be assessed, in vivo, using an isolated forearm model. The proposed study will provide new and clinically important information regarding the influence of insufficient sleep on vascular endothelial function in adults with elevated blood pressure. Moreover, determining the possible cardioprotective effects of improving sleep and circadian physiology on vascular endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function in adults with elevated blood pressure is clinically innovative, novel and critical to the development of optimal strategies (both primary and adjunctive) to mitigate blood pressure-related cardiovascular risk."
"9354295","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using neuroimaging techniques to find biomarkers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related social difficulties will allow for earlier detection of risk: a critical component of identifying which infants need preventive treatment. Neuroimaging may also offer a more sensitive method of predicting and assessing treatment response than focusing only on observable behavior. However, we first need to improve our understanding of typical brain development to identify neural markers that predict individual differences in social behaviors. These neural markers can then become targets for the study of biomarkers of ASD. Better understanding the neural differences associated with ASD and related social difficulties will help to guide the development of treatments that are closely matched to biological areas of deficit and provide promising regions of interest for studies utilizing neuroimaging to predict and assess treatment response. The current proposal is a multi-level (brain function and behavior), longitudinal neuroimaging study of 60 typically developing infants during a critical period in social development. The study will utilize functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain functioning in response to both novel (live social interaction) and well-validated (biological motion) social stimuli at 6 months of age. Identified neural correlates of social stimui will then be applied to predict individual differences in key areas of social functioning in these same infants at 12 months. The applicant's overarching career goal is to conduct research that helps to prevent deficits in social- emotional functioning before they reach clinically impairing levels. The proposed fellowship training is an integral step in this career path. The applicant wil receive intensive training in developmental neuroimaging techniques under the mentorship of a leading researcher in the neurobiology of social cognition and ASD. This project, which combines clinical and developmental research using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, will provide an ideal vehicle for the trainee to develop as an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, so that her research program can help bridge the gaps between social development, neural systems, and clinical research."

"9181368","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is requested from NIAAA for the development of an independent program of research to examine relationship-specific alcohol use motivations and event- level relationship-motivated alcohol use processes in romantic relationships. Individuals in romantic relationships consume alcohol in relationship-specific domains (e.g., self-disclosure, expressing intimacy, coping with relationship problems) that are distinct from general motivated-drinking domains and that have relationship-specific consequences. This is a public health concern because some couples continue to drink excessively despite experiencing alcohol-related and relationship problems, whereas others do not. Understanding the relationship-specific motivations for alcohol use, as well as the risk and protective factors associated with relationship drinking processes as they occur in real-time in couples' natural environments, is crucial to addressing problematic alcohol use in relationships. This understanding can ultimately inform prevention and intervention efforts to improve the health and well being of romantic couples. A long-term career goal of the candidate is to use this research to develop a comprehensive model of relationship- motivated alcohol use to guide future research and theory development on couples' alcohol use. The proposed study and training experiences of the MRSDA are an initial step in developing an independent program of research toward achieving this long-term goal. The candidate will use the five-year award period to receive extensive training and mentoring in five key areas: 1) the adaptation, development, and validation of a measure of relationship-specific drinking motives; 2) ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of the determinants and consequences of relationship drinking events and related analysis of multilevel dyadic data; 3) naturalistic observation of relationship drinking events using the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) and related coding of behavioral data; 4) psychosocial and contextual risk and protective factors associated with relationship-motivated alcohol use; and 5) the ethical and responsible conduct of research involving human subjects. The candidate proposes a two-part study in which a measure of relationship-specific drinking motives is adapted from existing measures, refined, and validated using an online survey methodology (Study 1), and momentary relationship-motivated drinking events and processes are assessed in real-time using an innovative multi-method approach combining EMA, EAR, and daily reports. It is hypothesized that relationship- specific drinking motives will predict relationship alcohol use and consequences above and beyond general drinking motives, and that these motives will be differentially associated with intra-individual (e.g., mood) and inter-individual (e.g., partner influence) risk and protective factors in couples' natural drinking environments as well as negative vs. benign alcohol-related consequences (e.g., relationship-specific drinking problems; conflict with partner; intimacy). The research environment at the Research Institute on Addictions, combined with the carefully selected expert mentoring team, will provide the candidate with excellent support and guidance during the award period. The combined training and research experiences of the MRSDA will provide necessary skills and ideally position the candidate to pursue a program of independent research addressing problematic relationship-motivated alcohol use as an important public health concern."
"9404077","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Nutrition, Obesity and Atherosclerosis Training Program at the University of Washington is a successful Training Program, now in its 35th year of funding. The overall goal of the program continues to be to provide a highly qualified group of postdoctoral MD clinicians and PhD scientists with the research skills they need to become fully independent biomedical investigators in the areas of nutrition, obesity and atherosclerosis. The training program utilizes 26 investigators at the University of Washington who are performing both basic and clinical research in these areas as preceptors. Use is also made of a number of basic and clinical scientists with whom the core faculty collaborates to broaden research opportunities and resources available to trainees in the program.  Trainees entering the program previously have obtained either an MD or PhD degree and MD candidates usually have completed residency training. Some have had some prior research experience. PhD candidates have demonstrated ability in a basic science discipline and have demonstrated capability for research related to the focus of this program. Selection of the 4 candidates supported by this training grant is made by an Executive Committee from a large pool of qualified applicants who continue to apply for research training in metabolism, endocrinology and nutrition at the University of Washington.  This program provides trainees with research experience in both basic and clinical science necessary in preparation for independent research careers. Appointments to the Training Program are for at least 2 years, with an optional 3rd year available. The program also includes opportunities for trainees to interact through program-specific meetings, and to present their research to peers, preceptors, and invited scientists from other academic institutions. A series of didactic lectures and seminars related to the topics of lipids, obesity, nutrition and atherosclerosis, as well as in scientific methods and biomedical ethics, complement the research training. Rigorous evaluation of trainees and preceptors is performed bi-annually and is overseen by the Executive Committee and an External Advisory Committee.  The Nutrition, Obesity and Atherosclerosis Training Program has been highly successful in training productive scientists, including minority scientists, in these areas during the current funding period, and will provide an even stronger training environment due to several changes in overview, coherence, and training opportunities during the next funding period."
"9184567","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most membrane and secreted proteins are decorated with mucin-type O-glycans which serve diverse biological roles. The mechanisms behind their biological roles and more specifically what governs O-glycan site selection and subsequent O-glycan elongation are largely unknown. The objective of this project is to elucidate the processes governing O-glycan site selection and O-glycan elongation at the enzyme and peptide substrate level in order to address the molecular mechanisms and biology of O-glycosylation. Mucin type O- glycosylation is vital to animal reproduction and development and increasingly linked to a wide range of rare to common disease states (such as hormonal/metabolic dysfunction, impaired host defense, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases and even cancers) where it serves to modulate diverse biological functions including cell-cell interactions. Many disorders are linked to changes in expression or mutation of individual members of the large family (20 in man) of polypeptide-GalNAc transferases (ppGalNAc Ts) that initiate O-glycosylation by adding GalNAc to polypeptide Ser or Thr residues. O-glycosylation is absolutely required for embryonic development of the mouse and fly, relying on the Core 1 elongating transferase (T-synthase) in the mouse and several individual ppGalNAc T isoforms in the fly. How individual ppGalNAc T isoforms in this large family (or even T-synthase) can play such critical biological roles is unknown as the substrate specificity of these transferases have not been sufficiently characterized. That ppGalNAc T site selection is also modulated (positively or negatively) by prior glycosylation underscores its complexity and how much more needs to be learned of its specificity. The detailed characterization of ppGalNAc T isoform and elongating transferase specificity proposed in this project will lead to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological roles of O-glycosylation and will eventually lead to novel strategies to treat diseases of aberrant O- glycosylation. The AIMS of this project are to (1) expand the innovative use of a library of novel random peptide and glycopeptide substrates to fully characterize the specificity and basic enzymology of the transferases that initiate and elongate mucin type O-glycosylation, (2) to use these data to further develop sophisticated web based O-glycan predictive tools that include ppGalNAc T isoform and elongating transferase peptide and glycopeptide specificity, and (3) to develop a novel method for identifying in vivo isoform specific glycosylation targets using tissues from transferase knock-out animal models. These basic studies together with those of colleagues at other institutions will advance our understanding of the properties of these transferases, their targets (and resultant glycan structures) and ultimately the mechanisms of their biological role and function. These studies will significantly advance the field and will allw the development of novel specific inhibitors for potential use as targeted therapeutics."
"9385177","Emergency Medical Services (EMS) commonly schedules providers to work shifts of 24-hours or longer, con- tributing to severe fatigue, occupational injury, and potentially putting patients at risk. Our long-term goal is to identify shift schedules that are safe for providers and the patients they treat and transport. These schedules must consider the frequency of emergency responses on an average shift, feasibility and utilization of on-shift rest, and also conform to workforce availability and cost constraints. The overall objective of this application is to determine the extent to which scheduling, health behaviors, and workplace factors increase risk of negative safety outcomes. The central theme is that individual and agency- specific factors compound the risk of negative safety outcomes posed by extended shifts. We hypothesize that untreated sleep disorders, adverse health behaviors, and frequent calls for emergency response that reduce sleep opportunity increase the risk for motor vehicle crashes and occupational injuries. Completion of this work will identify modifiable factors amenable to intervention and assist in design of agency-level scheduling strate- gies and interventions to improve safety. The application proposes three specific aims. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that a greater number of emergency responses per shift will be associated with less on-shift sleep. Our preliminary data suggest on-shift sleep var- ies and may be related to the opportunity for rest. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that individual factors, such as sleep disorders and simultaneous employment at multiple jobs, increase the risk of injury, motor vehicle crash- es (MVCs), and near-miss MVCs. Our preliminary data suggest that EMS providers with sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, shift work disorder, insomnia) and those who work multiple jobs will have an in- creased risk of negative safety outcomes. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that EMS agency-level factors, such as policies that restrict daytime sleep and policies that allow more than 24 hours of consecutive work, increase the risk of injury, MVCs, and near-miss MVCs. Preliminary data suggest that these policies are common and may increase the risk of negative safety outcomes through fatigue-related performance decrements. The outcomes of this proposal will characterize the relative importance of individual-level and agency-level fac- tors with respect to occupational safety. The proposed analysis will determine the extent to which sleep is ob- tained across settings with varying environmental conditions and demands. These findings are critical for de- termining appropriate policies for shift-length regulation among EMS clinicians who must provide emergency services 24-hours per day. We will identify the rate of crashes on the commute home from work, an unexplored area of risk in this workforce."

Previous evidence from our lab suggests that estrogen through estrogen receptor alpha (ER?) protects the TMJ from degeneration by promoting Col2 and proteoglycan production. Further, we have preliminary evidence indicating that estrogen-ER? inhibits Wnt pathway signaling. These findings suggest that estrogen signaling promotes chondrogenesis via ER? by mediating the canonical Wnt pathway. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of ER? signaling on mandibular condylar cartilage matrix production and TMJ homeostasis. The proposed work comprises two aims:  AIM 1: Evaluate the role of estrogen via ER? on collagen type II (Col2) production. We hypothesize that estrogen promotes Col2 transcription via ER? by inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. To confirm the effects of estrogen-ER? on chondrogenesis, reporter mice will be utilized to examine upregulation of Col2 and downregulation of Wnt signaling with estrogen and an ER? agonist. Then, the ability of estrogen-ER? to promote chondrogenesis by inhibiting Wnt signaling will be determined by activating the Wnt pathway in WT and ER?KO mice in an ovariectomy-estrogen replacement model.  AIM 2: Determine the effects of ER? deficiency on TMJ degeneration and correlate to resulting compressive properties and masticatory function. We hypothesize that ER?KO mice will exhibit accelerated age-related TMJ degeneration which will correspond to a decrease in compressive modulus, fixed charge density, and bite force compared to WT controls. Changes in matrix composition will be correlated to alterations in compressive properties and masticatory function. The results from this proposed research will provide evidence of the sex predilection of TMJ degeneration and provide therapeutic targets (e.g. ER? agonist) to delay degeneration. Through this work, we aim to enhance the understanding of estrogen?s role in TMJ condylar cartilage chondrogenesis and homeostasis. Also, the development of TMJ condylar cartilage structure/function relationships will be beneficial for the development of regenerative therapies to combat TMJ degeneration."
"9199100","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) has a lifetime prevalence rate of approximately 20% in the United States and is the leading cause of non-fatal disease burden worldwide. MDD can be debilitating for all, but beginning in early adolescence, women are twice as likely to experience MDD relative to men. Moreover, as they age, they are at disproportionately high risk for developing several serious medical conditions that frequently co-occur with MDD and presage early mortality, such as hypertension, heart disease, certain cancers, neurodegeneration, and stroke. Understanding mechanisms that may underlie the initial development of depression, especially among women, is therefore of paramount public importance. To address this issue, I will elucidate neural, inflammatory, and genomic processes associated with risk for MDD in adolescence. Recent studies have shown that social stress engages a network of brain regions involved in processing physical and social threat. Social stress also up regulates components of the immune system involved in inflammation, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. To examine for the first time social stress-induced alterations in neural activity and connectivity, pro-inflammatory cytokine activity, and genome-wide transcriptional activity that are associated with risk for MDD, I will conduct a study in which 25 adolescent girls at high risk for MDD (i.e., no personal history of any affective Axis I disorder, but a positive maternal history of MDD) and 25 adolescent girls at low risk for MDD (i.e., no personal or maternal history of any Axis I disorder) will be exposed to a brief episode of social rejection while undergoing an fMRI scan. In addition, blood samples will be obtained at four time-points during the study to test for social stress-induced changes in (a) levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-?, IL-1?, and IL-6, and (b) inflammatory gene expression, using microarray-based genome-wide transcriptional profiling. As such, this study will be the first to examine neural, inflammatory, and genomic responses to social stress that are associated with differential risk for depression (Aims 1 & 2). The study will also be the firstto examine relations between these different stress-related mechanisms in adolescent girls at high and low risk for MDD (Aim 3). Finally, the study will allow me to obtain mentored training in several areas that are critical for pursuing this line of research independently, including: neuroscience and neuroimaging methods, fMRI data analysis, and functional genomics. My goal as a clinical psychologist is to identify mechanisms that underlie the initial emergence of risk fo depression and related disorders in adolescence, which can in turn be modified to reduce the enormous disease burden that is associated with these conditions. This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award will enable me to pursue this goal by providing me with protected time to obtain state-of-the-art training at UCLA. This award will also allow me to conduct the firs multi-method, experimental fMRI study on neural, inflammatory, and genomic mechanisms underlying risk for depression in adolescence, which will in turn inform the development of novel strategies for reducing the mounting disease burden associated with depression and depression-related diseases."
"9208431","Kidney Cancer Program Project Summary / Abstract The Kidney Cancer Program performs innovative basic research into the molecular basis of kidney tumors. Scientific efforts within the current funding period have focused on identifying meaningful biomarkers for early detection and prognosis, underlying mechanisms of disease biology and novel therapeutic targets for the various kidney cancer populations, and improved preclinical models for preliminary validation of these findings. The specific aims of the program are to 1) Identify and validate novel targets in kidney cancer, and establish pre-clinical models for testing new agents; 2) Identify molecular and biologic predictors of response and toxicity to therapy; 3) Leverage Program and SPORE infrastructure to facilitate drug and device development; and 4) Identify factors that increase the risk, predict the development and recurrence of kidney cancer. The program has 38 members, representing seven DF/HCC institutions and 8 academic departments. In 2014 peer- reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $1.3 million in total costs from the NCI and $1.2 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, Kidney Cancer Program members published 742 cancer-relevant papers. Of these 36% were inter-institutional, 14% were intra-programmatic, and 51% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members.

"9104089","This project will adapt a method developed by the RAND Corporation for studying the prevalence of inappropriate health care and which has been previously applied by RAND to chiropractic manipulation and mobilization (M/M) for low back pain. In this Project the method will be applied to study the use of M/M in chiropractic practices for chronic cervical pain (CCP).     An extensive review of the literature will be done and a systematic review written (a meta-analysis if this is possible but a synthesis if it is not) with the support of the Systematic Review Core (SRC). From this review a set of indications based on the literature for performing M/M for CCP will be developed. These indications will categorize patients in terms of their symptoms, past medical history, and the results of previous diagnostic tests. The review will also look at the evidence for patient preferred outcomes (from Project 2: Outcomes- Based Appropriateness), patient preferences (from Project 3: Patient Preferences Appropriateness) and costs (from Project 4: Economic-Based Appropriateness). Once the indications have been created (and reviewed by experts in the field) the process to be used is a modified Delphi. A multidisciplinary panel of nine clinical experts will initially receive the literature synthesis and the set of indications individually and based on the literature and their own clinical experience where applicable, will be asked to rate the appropriateness of M/M for chronic cervical pain. The panel will then be brought together in a face-to-face meeting and the results of these ratings are then circulated to the panel members. Following group discussions, and revising of the indications, the panels re-rate the indications. In further round of ratings the panel will be given data on patient preferences preferences (from Project 3: Patient Preferences Appropriateness), outcomes (from Project 2: Outcomes-Based Appropriateness), and costs (from Project 4: Economic-Based Appropriateness. Once the work of the expert panel is completed, RAND will generate a set of indications for doing M/M for CCP based on the evidence and clinical experience of the panelists which can then be used to compare actual practice."
"9209327","Project Summary/Abstract Biochemical imaging using hyperpolarized (HP) nuclei now offers the possibility of extending the inherent power of 13C NMR to rapidly image intermediary metabolism in human patients. The recent installation of a clinical polarizer in this BTRC provides the opportunity to test and validate this technology as it moves towards clinical research applications. The overall intent is to develop a good understanding of how to interpret 13C NMR spectra and images from the liver after injection of HP-[1-13C]pyruvate and other substrates. A general theme in this TR&D project is to perform conventional 2H and 13C isotopomer analysis and hyperpolarization exams in the same tissue. With this approach, standard tracer methods are used to efficiently validate and interpret the HP data. Aim 1 will focus on the utility of HP [1-13C]pyruvate for monitoring TCA cycle flux and pathways related to gluconeogenesis in a rat model. Pharmacological and nutritional interventions will be used to selectively manipulate specific aspects of liver metabolism. The sensitivity of HP data to these interventions will be tested, and critically compared to results from simultaneous 2H and 13C NMR isotopomer analysis. In Aim 2 we will investigate novel probes such as HP-[2-13C]dihydroxyacetone for imaging phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP). 13C labeled mono-esters of TCA cycle intermediates, developed in TR&D 1, will also be evaluated in vivo. With our collaborators, we have already determined that detection of HP-[1-13C]lactate, HP-[1- 13C]alanine and HP-[13C]bicarbonate from the liver is feasible in the pig. Consequently Aim 3 will test the effects of nutritional state on gluconeogenic pathways and TCA cycle flux, using conventional methods, and at the same time perform HP spectroscopy and imaging after injection of HP-[1-13C]pyruvate. Parallel experiments in the same animals with an identical protocol will be performed with [U-13C]pyruvate, not hyperpolarized, to measure the fraction of exogenous pyruvate entering the malate, lactate, alanine and acetyl- CoA pools. These methods will be extended to human subjects in Aim 4 where we will monitor metabolism of HP-[1-13C]pyruvate in the liver and evaluate the impact of simple alterations in nutritional state. The primary goal is to implement hyperpolarization exams in the human liver and to critically evaluate the metabolic information resulting from these exams."
"9188475","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Tinnitus, the perception of ringing or buzzing in the absence of an acoustic stimulus, is a significant problem in the United States and is of specific concern for the military personnel. For the second consecutive year tinnitus is again the number one compensated disability with more than $1.2 billion paid in disability benefits in 2010. From training to deployment and combat activity, the military population is constantly exposed to acoustic trauma from weapons fire, tracked and non-tracked vehicles, airplanes and helicopters as well as bombs and grenades. Since tinnitus often results from exposure to loud noise, military personnel are at high risk of developing tinnitus. There is currently no cure for tinnitus. In order to develop appropriate pharmacological interventions, metrics that can be used as indicators of tinnitus attenuation are critically needed. Several studies report increased neuronal activity in the inferior colliculus (I) as a result of tinnitus. This suggests that monitoring neuronal activity in IC neurons may provide a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of tinnitus. A novel non-invasive method for assessment of neuronal activity is manganese enhanced MRI (MEMRI). Our group and others have used MEMRI to evaluate neuronal activity in auditory neurons (Yu et al., 2007; Brozoski et al. 2007; Holt et al., 2010). Although tinnitus sufferers often report loud, sustained or impulse noise exposure as a trigger for their tinnitus, many people with tinnitus do not sustain a permanent hearing loss. Thus, the biomarker for tinnitus needs to be apparent regardless of hearing status or method of tinnitus generation. Our proposed studies use several models of tinnitus (PTS-permanent threshold shift tone; TTS-temporary threshold shift tone; and SAFTS-small arms fire threshold shift noise) and build on our previous report suggesting that increased neuronal activity in the IC identified by MEMRI may be a reliable diagnostic marker for tinnitus. Having the capability of definitively associating a specific biomarker with the perception of tinnitus allows for testing the efficacy of pharmacological intervention. We have recently shown that tinnitus results in differential expression of voltage gated calcium channel (CaV) genes. Furthermore, our preliminary studies have shown that pharmacological administration of CaV blockers prior to the generation of tinnitus greatly reduced the perception of tinnitus. Therefore we will use two metrics, tinnitus perception and increased spontaneous neuronal activity in the IC, as indicators of tinnitus and assessment of these two metrics will be used as a method for evaluation of drugs proposed for pharmacological interventions. The research proposed in this application offers a path both to objective diagnosis of tinnitus and therapeutic interventions."
"9370162","ABSTRACT Among the co-morbidities associated with long-term HIV infection, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a life-threatening disease characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart failure. Evidence suggests a prominent role for inflammation and autoimmunity in idiopathic PAH, though this concept has been under studied in the context of HIV-PAH. Lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-PAH, along with deficiencies of available animal models, greatly impede identification and testing of new therapies. We have developed a simian model that closely mimics HIV-PAH. Our preliminary data indicate that inflammation, immunosenescence and autoimmune phenotypes are associated with worse pulmonary hypertension in this model. We therefore hypothesize that the development of HIV-PAH is driven by chronic immune activation and dysregulated immune responses. Additionally, we hypothesize that this dysregulated immune response is driven in part by persistent gut microbial translocation, and contributes to hyper-proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, vascular tissue damage and fibrosis. Overall goals of this proposal are to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-PAH and to use this information to inform the development of adjunctive therapies that will prevent or reverse HIV-PAH. We will test these hypotheses and address these goals by 1) determining the role of chronic immune activation and inflammation on the development of PAH in a non-human primate model of HIV-PAH and 2) examining the effectiveness of anti-retroviral therapy, conventional PAH therapy and anti- inflammatory/anti-microbial therapy in this model. We have found that SIV infection is a natural cause of PAH that closely mimics HIV-PAH and we have established multiple modalities of evaluating disease progression, thus we are uniquely positioned to address these goals. The proposed studies will advance our knowledge of disease progression by allowing us to evaluate host immune responses at each stage of the disease process and test efficacy of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory therapies. These studies will not only address the mechanisms associated with the development of HIV-PAH, but they will provide critical information regarding the timing and targets that may be amenable to therapies aimed at both prevention and resolution of vascular damage, hemodynamic alterations and right heart dysfunction."
"9316207","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spores are major mechanism by which the important nosocomial pathogen Clostridium difficile transmits disease, yet little is known about how this obligate anaerobe forms the resistant spore form. While preventing spore assembly would break the destructive cycle of infection and re-infection that characterizes C. difficile infections, no therapies currently target this developmental process. A major obstacle to developing such therapies is the absence of a basic understanding of how C. difficile forms a spore. Our long-term goal is to understand how C. difficile assembles the protective proteinaceous spore coat, which is necessary for functional spore formation. We recently identified the first spore morphogenetic proteins in the Clostridia as SpoIVA and SipL and showed that they directly interact. In this application, we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which SpoIVA and SipL coordinately regulate spore formation. We will use complementary genetic, biochemical, and cytological methods to determine the functional significance of SpoIVA-SipL complex formation during spore assembly, identify new SpoIVA and/or SipL interacting partners that regulate spore assembly, and localize SpoIVA and SipL during spore formation. By interrogating the mechanism by which SpoIVA and SipL interact and recruit coat proteins to the forespore during sporulation, the proposed studies will elucidate the functions of key regulators of spore formation, identify new morphogenetic proteins in the Clostridia, and develop new imaging methods for localizing proteins in live cells under anaerobic conditions. Since SipL is found exclusively in the Clostridia, these studies will expand our limited understanding of how spore assembly is regulated in the Clostridia. Completion of the proposed work will provide the mechanistic insight necessary for rationally designing screens that can identify C. difficile sporulation inhibitors and may also identify new potential therapeutic targets. As a result, these studies may lead to novel therapeutics that can prevent disease transmission by C. difficile and other clostridial spore-forming pathogens."

In support of this goal, we propose to apply our established, state-of-the-art DNA sequencing and analysis platform to comprehensively identify rare variation influencing susceptibility to common complex diseases corresponding to three disease themes: 1) cardiovascular disease and metabolic risk, 2) autoimmune disease including Type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and 3) developmental and degenerative diseases including cleft lip/palate, idiopathic scoliosis and macular degeneration. Where possible, we will leverage emerging methods and technology to advance the state of the field and achieve our program goals. Our approach extends the discovery power of low-cost whole genome sequencing (WGS) with innovative laboratory and computational techniques to comprehensively interrogate the full spectrum of human genome variation. We developed these studies with substantial input from expert collaborators whose continued involvement and disease-specific expertise will be critical for success. Ultimately, the diversity of our proposed projects - in ters of disease phenotypes, sample ancestries, and study designs - will provide a better understanding of the genetic architecture of common disease and the extent to which it is shared across world populations."
"9338070","Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this research program is to understand how parallel retinofugal pathways are established during development. This proposal focuses on the question of how retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons select their correct targets and target layers in the brain during development. RGC axon-target and axon-layer matching are both critical aspects of visual circuit organization and yet, very little is known about how they develop in mammals. We propose to study the development of these connections in transgenic mice where specific RGC subtypes express fluorescent proteins and in which specific genes are absent or misexpressed in the retinofugal pathway. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) characterize the cellular events that enable RGCs carrying different qualities of visual information to recognize their appropriate targets in the brain, 2) test the hypothesis that the adhesion molecule cadherin-6 controls RGC axon-target matching 3) test the hypothesis that lamina specific targeting of axons from direction selective RGCs to the superior colliculus is mediated by the adhesion molecule cadherin-7. Results from these experiments should lead to new understanding of how mammalian visual circuits are established and inform strategies for maintaining and replenishing visual circuits in response to injury or disease."
"9404498","Drawing upon our successful track record of designing and implementing innovations in human/patient-centered tools, systems, and experiences for some of the nation?s leading healthcare organizations, we will design a   strategic communications plan that speaks directly to patients and people in different healthcare and caregiver roles, using a compelling visual identity and language they can connect with and relate to. This will allow more people to meaningfully engage with PMI as a whole, thus increasing enrollment and retention in the initiative.  What makes Wondros unique is our adherence to the principles of human-centered storytelling. In our experience, thoughtful, well-designed, and effective communications are based on the authentic needs of stakeholders. Our approach to this campaign would be based on an understanding of the authentic needs, goals, and desires of the people who will make up the PMI Cohort. We develop this understanding through an initial process of discovery   we call Ecology Modeling (more details on this are presented under ?Our Approach?). This will lay the foundation for establishing a national PMI community that will grow and gain momentum based on grassroots advocacy.  As your communications design partner and in close collaboration with NIH Communications, we will develop a comprehensive communications plan to drive enrollment on a national scale, to reach the goal of achieving a research cohort of one million Americans and beyond. The plan would include outreach and dissemination to key organizations and groups, including underserved and underrepresented populations, website promotion, earned/social media inclusive of multimedia assets, and a paid advertising campaign in English and Spanish. The plan would be anchored by strategic and targeted messaging and a unique and compelling visual identity.  To reach the broadest and most diverse audiences, the campaign will have a robust web and mobile presence. The campaign will also leverage the latest innovations in targeted online marketing to reach specific, traditionally  Hard-to-reach communities. We will measure success and impact consistently through digital analytics and metrics.  The campaign would include advocate-celebrities and influencers to communicate the higher purpose of PMI: democratizing and supporting science and research for the benefit of all and for future generations, making healthcare more transparent and human-centered, and emphasizing the engagement of the public as active partners in the advancement of precision medicine. The campaign will convey the importance of PMI as part of the bigger picture for advancing medical science and, more specifically, how it can benefit and empower individuals as active participants in improved healthcare outcomes and processes.  We also understand the challenges of running all the different dimensions of a successful campaign and have the expertise needed to design and implement all the moving parts in a way that is flexible and responsive to changing conditions. We also understand the importance of working as a collaborative partner and ensuring that the plan has continuity throughout its lifespan."

"9104093","Project Description  To ensure patients receive appropriate care is an overarching goal of all medical research. The most well-known method used to determine appropriateness is based on clinical acumen and evidence as to whether the treatment is safe, efficacious and effective. This Project (Project 4) examines the impact of expanding this method through the inclusion of economic considerations. The addition of economics to the definition of appropriate care brings important information to both the determination of whether the choice of a particular treatment is appropriate, and whether the course of treatment, once chosen, is appropriate. This expansion is not only important for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) where patient self-referral and out-of pocket payment is common, but also for healthcare in general where ethical strategies for reducing costs are needed.     For the appropriate choice of treatment, economics adds the consideration of cost-effectiveness to safety and effectiveness. We will provide information on the cost-effectiveness of manipulation and mobilization (M/M) by chiropractors for chronic neck pain to the Appropriateness Panel (Project 1) to see if this information changes their ratings of M/M appropriateness for the various clinical indications considered. The information on the cost effectiveness of M/M will be generated by a decision analytic model built upon all available relevant evidence? evidence gathered by the Systematic Review Core. From these new cost-inclusive appropriateness ratings we will estimate how the prevalence of appropriate and inappropriate care (estimated by Project 1) change. As a side benefit, the decision analytic model will also be used to calculate the value of knowing more about (i.e., reducing the uncertainty through further research around) each of the model parameters.     For the appropriate course of treatment, economics provides information for the definition of length- or end-of treatment rules. Many therapies continue to provide incremental, although diminishing, benefits overtime. Therefore, if only clinical effectiveness is considered, these therapies would be continued indefinitely. However, as long as the health benefit (in this Project measured as reductions in pain and disability) per additional treatment goes down, the cost per additional unit of benefit will go up. At some point, and likely well before the treatment benefits end, the cost to obtain these last benefits can become untenable. Therefore, costs are a key determinant (in addition to safety and continued effectiveness) of the appropriate course of care. We will utilize the data collected by the Data Collection and Management Core, and with the support of the Research Methods Assessment and Management Core will perform a series of analyses to develop preliminary end- or length of treatment algorithms to help guide an appropriate course of M/M for chronic neck pain.     The determination of a cost-appropriate course of treatment is especially important for CAM providers for several reasons: many patients pay for care out of pocket; the patient-practitioner relationship can confound the source of treatment effects; the prevalence of chronic conditions seen can require long courses of care and may also require maintenance care; the focus on moving patients toward self-care; and the treatment challenges involved with patients who arrive at CAM only after exhausting all other sources. Note that the length- or end-of-treatment rules developed may result in more or fewer treatments than the usual number allowed by various health plans.      Finally, the total cost of inappropriate care will be estimated to help determine the magnitude of the problem and need for further research. Although the focus of these Projects and the Center will be chiropractic manipulation/mobilization (M/M) of chronic cervical pain, the objective is to develop these methods for all CAM (and non-CAM) practices."
"9402762","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for a new postdoctoral training program to train MD and PhD researchers to assume leadership roles in developing innovative, high impact research on adherence to medical treatment and chronic illness management that will enhance the health outcomes of children with pediatric chronic conditions. Modern medical treatments have improved the health outcomes of large numbers of children and adolescents with chronic conditions. However, one of the most critical remaining barriers to improving children's health outcomes over the course of their lifetime management of chronic illness is nonadherence to prescribed medical treatment. Nonadherence is defined as the discrepancy between prescribed treatment (medication or other treatments) and what is actually taken by patients. As noted by the World Health Organization (WHO), treatment nonadherence is not only highly prevalent (rates of 50% or greater in pediatric chronic illness populations) but has an extraordinary negative impact on children's health and health care costs. Innovative and clinically relevant research will be needed to close the gap between the health outcomes that are potentially achievable with more optimal treatment adherence and those achieved in current practice. NIH program priorities and requests for applications, scientific consensus conferences, and scholarly reviews have all identified the critical importance of research on pediatric adherence to treatment. A critical barrier to scientific advances in pediatric adherence and chronic illness management research is the shortage of talented, well-trained researchers who are devoting their careers to developing innovative, high impact treatment adherence and chronic illness management research with pediatric populations. One of the most promising ways to address this need and improve child health is to develop innovative interdisciplinary research training programs to train leaders in the field of treatment adherence and chronic illness management research. This is the goal of the proposed program. Specific training innovations will involve the integration of biomedical, behavioral, biostatistics, and health services/outcomes research and are reflected in a comprehensive training curriculum and research opportunities. Research innovations include novel methods of adherence promotion interventions involving technology (telehealth, internet, cell phone) designed to enhance the power and duration of intervention effects and reach diverse populations who cannot easily access traditional clinic-based approaches. Program innovation will also be enhanced by novel research training opportunities to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of adherence promotion interventions in pediatric chronic illness management, to integrate objective methods of adherence measurement (e.g., behavioral and pharmacological) and conduct advanced statistical analyses to evaluate the impact of adherence promotion interventions on children's health outcomes."
"9243803","Abstract  This work will involve the development of an invasive gene drive system in the Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue mosquito, Ae. aegypti, a major vector of human insect-borne disease known to annually infect up to 500 million people worldwide, hospitalizing over  a million, and killing approximately 25,000. The current approaches used for mosquito disease prevention, including vector suppression by environmental modification, insecticides, and anti-inflammatory drugs, are simply insufficient. The replacement of wild mosquito populations with genetically modified individuals that are engineered to be ?disease resistant? should provide a sustainable, long-term, method for disease prevention. However, the transgenes that mediate disease refractoriness are unlikely to confer an overall fitness benefit to insects that carry them. Additionally, wild populations are large, partially reproductively isolated, and dispersed over wide areas. Therefore, population replacement requires a gene drive mechanism in order to spread linked cargo genes, mediating disease refractoriness, through wild pathogen transmitting populations. Here I propose to ?resurrect? the historical concept of using reciprocal chromosomal translocations to spread disease refractory genes into wild pathogen transmitting mosquito populations. While this approach was rigorously attempted in the past, it was ultimately completely abandoned, due to elevated fitness costs resulting from the technologies used to generate the translocation strains, in addition to the inabilities to link genes for disease resistance to the chromosomal break-points. Importantly, recent advancements in genetic engineering and synthetic biology allow for these historical problems to be entirely overcome. Furthermore, translocation-mediated gene drive systems are threshold-dependent and thus have several attractive features important for social and scientific acceptance for wild transgenic releases: the systems are species specific; zero horizontal spread between species; minimal ecological impact in contrast to insecticides; robust and unbreakable with a inexorable linkage of the selfish genetic element with its cargo; complete transgene removal from wild population can be carried out if desired. Therefore, this project will utilize cutting-edge applied synthetic biology principals to engineer reciprocal chromosomal translocations at precise locations in Ae. aegypti (Aim-1). Once translocation-bearing strains are established, these will be introgressed with wild genetic backgrounds, fitness dynamics will be measured, and small laboratory-scale drive experiments will be executed (Aim-2). Overall, a successful translocation-based population replacement system linked with disease refractory genes will have a significant impact on both human health and the technical capability in which mosquitoes and other insects will be managed in the future. As these systems can be designed in most insects, this innovative approach could also later be engineered in wide range of insect disease vectors, revolutionizing and modernizing the field of insect population control."

Effective representation in parent institution forums is accomplished by participation at  gatherings such as the monthly Geisel COO Administrative Council. Geisel has delegated lead responsibility  for its School-wide shared resources to NCCC Administration, which has developed an order entry and charge  entry software application (CCOPs) now used campus-wide. NCCC Administration has had lead responsibility  for budget projections, recruitment proposals, and administrative search support for the majority of all Geisel  faculty recruitments since 2008. The NCCC new and annual renewal membership processes are managed by  the Administration. Pilot project solicitations, reviews, and awards are NCCC Administration-managed.  NCCC Administration has responsibility for management of the 7-story Rubin Building. Meetings facilitated by  Administration include the monthly Program meetings, monthly Grand Rounds, annual retreat, and the annual  meeting of the External Scientific Advisory Board (EAC). Administrative funds management includes operating  accounts, philanthropic funds, and inter-departmental cancer-related external awards, including the CCSG  award and its supplements. Dedicated NCCC Senior Leadership roles include a Director, Deputy Director, and  Associate Directors for key Clinical Research, Basic Research, Population Sciences, Shared Resources,  Education, Community Affairs, and DH Cancer Service components. As a team, Senior Leadership meets  semi-monthly, addressing jointly cross-cutting considerations such as setting of priorities, identifying  translational research opportunities, recruiting new investigators, and the distribution of space and other Center  resources. Senior Leadership fosters scientific discovery through establishment of developmental funding  mechanisms, convening of scientific retreats, and formulation of an NCCC strategic plan. Focus on catchment  area needs has been advanced through Senior Leadership participation in state-wide planning, issuance of  regional emerging issue briefs, and NCCC leadership of several state-wide requested services. Senior  Leadership contributions to training initiatives have included leadership of the New Hampshire INBRE project  to develop research capabilities at currently non-research academic institutions, applying its faculty strength to  the training of additional quantitative biomedical sciences, introducing talented Dartmouth undergraduates to  cancer research, and providing graduate trainees involvement in emerging areas of interest, such as global  health."
"9070505","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical decision confronting health care providers is how to predict in the acute setting which children will suffer persistent postconcussive symptoms (PCS) and functional impairments after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Mild TBI occur in >450,000 youth under 15 years of age annually and can result in persistent symptoms associated with significant functional impairments. Various methods are recommended for the diagnostic evaluation of children with mild TBI: assessment of presenting signs/symptoms, acute mental status examination and balance testing, neuropsychological testing, and neuroimaging. However, no previous study has systematically compared the prognostic significance of these methods. The overall goal of the proposed project is to examine the utility of diagnostic methods commonly used in clinical settings in the prediction of persistent PCS and functional impairments. Participants will include 8- to 15-year-old children with mild TBI (n = 200) or mild orthopedic injuries (n = 100), recruited in the Emergency Departments (ED) at two large children's hospitals. Acute signs and symptoms of concussion, as well as mental status and balance, will be assessed using standardized methods at the time of recruitment. All children will complete computerized neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 7 days of injury. PCS will be assessed remotely on a weekly basis using electronic devices during the first 6 months post injury. Functional impairments will be assessed in person acutely and 3 and 6 months post injury. Other potential confounds (e.g., children's premorbid functioning; effort; pain; symptom exaggeration) also will be assessed. The proposed research is innovative because no previous study has compared the predictive utility of these commonly-used methods for assessing pediatric mild TBI. Additional innovations include collecting ratings of PCS at home on electronic devices to obtain real-time data from participants; assessing balance using a simple measure commonly employed in sports concussion research but not yet studied in a broad sample of children with mild TBI; using a newly-developed, computerized neuropsychological test battery to assess cognitive abilities; and employing newer MRI sequences capable of detecting subtle abnormalities (i.e., SWI, DTI). Our specific aims are (1) to examine the prediction of PCS and functional impairments following mild TBI and (2) to determine the incremental predictive utility of each of four assessment methods. Statistical analyses will assess the independent and combined contributions of four sets of variables to the prediction of PCS and functional impairments: (a) presenting signs/symptoms; (b) acute mental status and balance testing; (c) neuropsychological testing; and (d) neuroimaging. Prediction will be evaluated using mixed models, as well as traditional indices of clinical utility. A comprehensive study of these diagnostic methods and their incremental utility in predicting outcomes will have a major impact on clinical practice, particularly in acute care settings, by helping improve prognostic determinations, develop decision tools, and focus treatment efforts."
"9255595","PROJECT SUMMARY Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disease most often caused by loss of function mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Loss of both LDLR alleles in homozygous FH (HoFH) results in excessively high levels of plasma cholesterol, xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, and death in the first decades of life if untreated. Current treatments are largely ineffective for HoFH and more permanent solutions are desperately needed. Liver-directed gene therapy using Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) vectors is an area of intense research that is very near to achieving meaningful correction of several inherited diseases. While ongoing clinical trials with AAV are showing promising results, conventional (additive) gene therapy has limitations including: transgene silencing, imprecise control of expression levels, immune responses to transgene and capsid protein, and the loss of episomal AAV genomes to cell division. We believe many of these may be solved by a gene editing approach using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. Our long-term goal is to refine and optimize our AAV-based gene therapy platform for repair of disease-causing alleles underlying the most severe lipid disorders. The objective of the current application is to perform preclinical gene therapy to correct the metabolic defect in Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) in a mouse model via AAV-based genome editing. Our central hypothesis is that AAV-mediated homologous recombination, in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 directed DNA cleavage, can effectively repair a mutant version of the Ldlr gene with high efficiency. In Aim 1 we will determine the optimal Cas9 ortholog and guide RNA sequence for AAV-mediated site specific disruption of the Ldlr gene in mouse liver. In Aim 2, we will use these vectors, along with a recombinant AAV genome harboring a ?repair template? to deliver the functional ?wild type? exon for Ldlr. The extent of editing and correction will be assessed at the genetic as well as phenotypic levels- include changes in plasma lipids and susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Completion of the aims will produce a powerful AAV-based system for somatic gene knockdown and repair in the liver, which can be broadly applied for both basic science and gene therapy applications."
"9185984","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many organ systems, cells projecting hundreds of beating cilia, called multiciliate cells, produce a vigorous fluid flow that transports biological materials along luminal surfaces. Multiciliate cells populate the respiratory airways, the reproductive tract, and the ventricles of the brain, where the flow they produce has significant implications for human health. A key process in achieving directed flow is to align beating cilia along a common planar axis, requiring mechanisms that orient the rotational axis of the basal body at the base of each cilium. This process is known to be initiated by the planar cell polarity pathway, and to involve flow-based cues and elements of the cytoskeleton, but the mechanisms that align cilia direction are largely unknown. To address this issue, one approach is define the genetic pathways that drive the differentiation of multiciliate cells, and to use these pathways to identify novel factors that underlie cilia orientation. Specifically, this approach addresses the fct that the basal bodies in a multiciliate cell are highly specialized compared to those found in other ciliated cells, but the molecular bases of these specialization remain undefined. Using this approach, basal body factors involved in cilia orientation will be identified, and their role in producing directed fluid flow will be characterized. The factors studied include a new basal body associated protein required for maturating cilia orientation, proteins that comprise a basal body appendage called the ciliary rootlet, and candidate proteins that have been identified based on their structural features, and the fact that their expression is associated with multiciliate cell differentiation. The proposed studies will generate new insights into the cell specific components that allow basal bodies in multiciliate cells to mediate directed fluid flow, and lay the foundatio for understanding how flow can fail in human diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia."

"9187422","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Back pain is among the top contributors to disability among Americans and is associated with considerable cost to the US economy. Despite established practice guidelines that recommend conservative approaches, clinical management of nonspecific back pain (i.e., back pain that is not caused by pathologic etiology) varies, with evidence of overuse of opioid analgesics, early diagnostic imaging, and specialty care. Older adults in particular receive poorer care for nonspecific back pain than their younger counterparts. While nonspecific back pain is one of the top reasons adults visit physicians, it also happens to be one of the most common conditions treated by complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers who rely on conservative management. In the US, the chiropractic profession is the largest and most organized CAM group, and chiropractic care is the only CAM service covered by Medicare. However, current information available to health policymakers lacks a fundamental understanding of the potential indirect effects of chiropractic care in Medicare. The overall objective of this project is to rigorously examine the relationship between availability of chiropractic care and utilization, expenditures, and care for nonspecific back pain. Our central hypothesis is that chiropractic care is being used as a substitute for ambulatory medical services and affects both expenditures and nonspecific back pain care. This research project has the following two aims: (1) Among older adults, determine the extent to which availability of chiropractic care influences use of and expenditures on ambulatory medical services (e.g., primary care, specialty care, and emergency room visits) for nonspecific back pain and (2) Among older adults, determine the extent to which availability of chiropractic care influences clinical management of nonspecific back pain. Our approach is innovative because it departs from the current status quo by performing a real-world, natural experiment using Medicare patients who relocated. As each patient serves as his or her own control, this rigorous study design is better suited to identify causal relationships and will allow us the unique opportunity to observe the effect of a change in chiropractic care availability. In order to measure availability of chiropractic care and other health services, we will apply novel geographic information system (GIS) tools. This proposed project is significant because it will provide timely information for health policymakers to anticipate effects of healthcare system redesign; specifically, how inclusion of a CAM service in a national health insurance system impacts care of older adults with nonspecific back pain."

"9185343","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of atherosclerosis and type 2diabetes continues to increase world-wide, and the development of new therapeutics for metabolic disease is crucial. Notably, both diseases are associated with low grade systemic inflammation characterized by increased expression of cytokines, particularly interleukin-1b. Although chronic stimulation of the innate immune system by endogenous ligands is believed to underlie these metabolic diseases, the molecular mechanisms of activation remain unclear. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family of innate immune sensors, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome, recognize certain danger signals leading to caspase-1 activation and processing and secretion of IL-1 family cytokines. This pathway is highly regulated and requires a two-hit model of inflammasome priming and activation, but how endogenous ligands trigger these two steps is not clear. The scavenger receptor CD36 been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and diabetes, and binds a variety of modified endogenous ligands that accumulate in these diseases, including oxidized LDL (oxLDL), saturated fatty acids, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Notably, several of these ligands have recently been shown to be trigger the inflammasome and we hypothesize that engagement of CD36 may be a common mechanism by which this cytosolic complex senses metabolic-associated danger signals and leads to immune dysfunction. In this grant, we propose to (a) determine the role of cooperative signaling via CD36 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in priming the inflammasome (step 1) in response to endogenous ligands, (b) determine how engagement of CD36 contributes directly to activation of the inflammasome (step 2) through endolysosomal dysfunction and production of reactive oxygen species, and (c) test whether inhibition of CD36 in vivo blocks inflammasome activation and IL-1b production in mouse models of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance/diabetes. These studies will provide insight into the mechanisms by which the inflammasome is triggered during atherosclerosis and diabetes, and assess the potential of CD36 as a therapeutic target in the treatment of the chronic inflammation that characterizes these metabolic diseases. !"
"9404071","ABSTRACT Trauma or congenital defects of bone, including the craniofacial skeleton, are particularly damaging to physical and psychological well-being. There is an unmet clinical need to improve existing technologies designed to enhance bone formation: to treat traumatic bone injury, reverse age-induced bone loss, and relieve symptoms of heritable disorders of bone metabolism. Notch is a developmental cell-cell signaling pathway with myriad functions that is highly conserved through evolution. Coordinated changes in Notch ligand/receptor presentation alter bone metabolism in a manner dependent on cellular origin and differentiation state. We hypothesize that contextual interactions between the 5 different Notch ligands and the 4 different Notch receptors regulate cell fate decisions driving bone healing, and that Notch ligand gain-of-function may be used to promote therapeutic intramembranous bone formation. This study aims to answer significant yet unexplored questions concerning the role of Notch signaling in adult stem cell biology: 1) What are the specific Notch ligand/receptor interactions driving osteoblastogenesis? 2) How are Notch ligand deficiencies compensated, and what is the resulting bone phenotype? 3) Can modulation of Notch signaling drive therapeutic bone formation? To answer these questions, we will utilize two mouse models of adult bone regeneration: calvarial defect as a translational model of craniofacial bone regeneration following acute trauma and femoral marrow ablation to model rapid intramembranous bone formation in compartmentalized long bone. In Aim I we propose to characterize the Notch ligand/receptor interactions governing mesenchymal progenitor cell differentiation toward bone. In Aim II we propose to elucidate modifications and compensatory mechanisms implicated in Notch ligand deficiencies altering bone regeneration. In Aim III we propose to assess therapeutic modification of the Notch pathway to improve healing of critical-size craniofacial defects. Bone formation in wild-type and conditional Notch ligand single/double knockout mice will be evaluated following these procedures, and outcome variables will include gene expression analysis, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, histomorphometry, super-resolution confocal microscopy and micro-computed tomography. Elucidation of Notch ligand/receptor interactions driving osteoblastogenesis holds significant promise for informing safe and efficacious pharmacological intervention improving bone healing. Using modern molecular biological techniques, biophysical chemistry and advanced imaging, this comprehensive cross- sectional small animal study will provide essential pre-clinical data on therapeutic ligand delivery for craniofacial bone healing. Successful completion of the proposed project will improve outcomes of reconstructive surgeries involving the skull and reduce morbidity associated with conventional bone grafting."

"9243114","Bacterial pathogens cause devastating diseases, and it is imperative to improve our ability to treat bacterial infections. Among the most potent drugs in current use are the fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which trap the normally transient covalent intermediate formed by DNA gyrase with DNA, to create local DNA damage that is cytotoxic. In addition to gyrase, which is a type 2A topoisomerase, most bacteria also contain a structurally distinct type 1A topoisomerase, Topoisomerase 1 (Topo I). Like DNA gyrase, Topo I forms a transient covalent DNA adduct and should in principle be an excellent drug target, but no drugs currently target Topo I. Discovery and optimization of drugs that target Topo I and other topoisomerases has been limited by the lack of a mechanism-based assay for induction of topoisomerase-DNA adducts. We recently developed an assay, the RADAR assay (Rapid Assay of the DNA Adduct Response), that quantifies the covalent topoisomerase-DNA adducts formed as signature DNA damage in cells treated with topoisomerase poisons. We hypothesize that the RADAR assay will be useful for identifying new drugs that function by this mechanism, and for quantifying the potency of topoisomerase poisons in current use. The goal of this application is to validate the RADAR assay for screening compound libraries for drugs that poison bacterial topoisomerases. To achieve this, we will address current challenges in three aims. We will (1) show that DNA adducts formed by M. tuberculosis Topo I are toxic in mycobacteria and can be detected by the RADAR assay; (2) adapt and optimize the RADAR assay for high throughput screening; and (3) validate the RADAR assay for drug discovery by screening the TB Alliance TB Active Collection library. Impact: Validation of the RADAR assay will enable its application to discovery of new mechanism- based drugs to treat TB and a wide range of other infectious diseases."
"9248128","PROJECT SUMMARY-ABSTRACT The purpose of the proposed study is conduct a controlled investigation of HIV host and viral dynamics on brain integrity in vertically infected children on stable combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in Myanmar. Outcomes from the PREDICT trial in Southeast Asia revealed residual cognitive impairment among pediatric HIV+ individuals with vertical infection. Socioeconomic variables predicted cognitive test performance among infected children and children exposed to HIV but uninfected with the virus. Efforts to define the neuropathogenesis of HIV require adequate control of these environmental variables known to influence cognitive test performance and engagement in ADLs. The majority of HIV+ children in Myanmar reside in privately funded orphanages with standardized caregiver status, nutrition, and education. Our preliminary work reveals cognitive impairment in these children on cART with high CD4 count when compared to demographically matched healthy controls (HIV-). Further, 40% of the HIV+ children express preferential use of the CXCR4 co-receptor and the degree of cognitive impairment is greater among these children compared to those expressing the CCR5 co-receptor despite similar CD4 counts. Previous studies have associated CXCR4 utilization with worse cognition in HIV+ adults with advanced disease, but it is unclear from these studies if co-receptor subtype is liked to cognitive impairment or more simply a correlated variable between disease severity and cognitive impairment. Our preliminary data suggests a mechanistic role for CXCR4 on reduced brain integrity independent of advanced disease, emphasizing the need to identify the relevant immunological factors. Work from our team previously demonstrated that circulating monocyte HIV content, monocyte subpopulations, and myeloid-derived immunological mediators are key mechanisms of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment. The present study will examine these immunological mechanisms and co-receptor tropism in the cascade of events related to cognitive impairment in vertically infected youth. This information is critical to facilitate the development of targeted treatments to improve cognitive function among children with vertically infected HIV. We will enroll 120 HIV+ vertically infected children and adolescents between the ages of 8 and 15 and 60 HIV- controls matched for demographics, and all residing in privately funded orphanages. Neuropsychological, virological, and immunological assays will be completed to determine pediatric HIV neuropathogenesis in the context of stable cART."

This T32 builds upon established clinical and scientific strengths in various oncologic disciplines of the Departments of Surgery and Obstetrics/Gynecology. The partnership of both Departments with UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center provides an integrated infrastructure of collaborative bench science that spans fundamental molecular discovery to move scientific inquiry from bench-to-bedside for applied clinical and translational research. This training environment enhances the intra-collaborative, seamless trans-departmental initiatives available in Tumor Biology and Immunology, Human Genetics, Autoimmunity and Inflammation, Translational Clinical and Outcomes Research.  The strategic goals of the research plan have special emphasis on the training of nascent, promising young Surgical-Scientists in their early post-doctoral years and who are in ACGME-approved training programs in Surgery or Gynecologic Oncology. Thus, this T-32 program coordinates the mentorship of promising post- doctoral ACGME resident-candidates who will aspire to academic faculty positions and will strengthen UAB's exceptional mentoring environment. This T-32 grant represents a mechanism for faculty collaboration and synergistic scientific interests among its four SPORE programs at UAB. Programmatically, an effective interdisciplinary research experience is implemented by the obligatory incorporation of the required teaching via mentors and the required course work for individual research plans. Course work in statistics and ethical conduct of research is augmented in this competitive renewal with formal instruction provided by the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) and the Office of Post-Doctoral Education in grantsmanship, manuscript writing, and translational research. Over the past five years, 22 ACGME resident-trainees in Surgery and Gynecologic Oncology were supported by this T-32 mechanism. Because post-graduate surgical training approaches 7-10 years, and T-32 Trainees conduct research in the early stages of their career, a significant number of trainees still have >5 years of surgical training remaining prior to academic appointment. Therefore, we are just beginning to see the academic success of our program after 10 years of continuous funding. In the past 10 years, there have been 36 trainees that have completed their T-32 training with 70 % of these residents continuing in academic biomedical research and practice / training. Moreover, in the past five years, this T-32 has been gender-balanced and has included 17% under-represented minorities. This T32 has, over the past ten years, provided continual strong commitment to trainees with oversight and encouragement of reciprocal commitment to careers in investigation and academia. This is reflected by those who have completed training with academic faculty positions in other Schools of Medicine within Departments of Surgery, its oncology disciplines, and Obstetrics/Gynecology. Continued funding is therefore requested annually for 6 post-doctoral resident-trainees."
"9224634","Several New World arenavirus (NWA) cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) diseases in humans that are characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Moreover, because of their stability, high morbidity and potential for aerosol transmission, HF-causing NWA represent credible biodefense threats.Concerns posed by human pathogenic NWA are aggravated by the lack of FDA-licensed vaccines and current anti-arenaviral therapy being limited to the off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective. The significance of HF-causing NWA in human health and biodefense readiness, together with the limited existing armamentarium to combat them, underscore the importance of developing effective countermeasures to combat NWA infections of humans. For several viruses broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAb) have been isolated from individuals who recovered from infection and shown to bind to highly conserve epitopes within viral surface glycoproteins (GP) and capable of protecting against viruses with high degree of antigenic variability. Therefore, BNAb provide a powerful tool for antiviral immunotherapy. Moreover, information regarding the interaction of BNAb with their highly conserved epitopes and their mechanisms of neutralization can facilitate the design of novel universal vaccines and the discovery of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this exploratory R21 application we propose first to generate cross-reactive variable (V) region humanized monoclonal antibodies (hVMAbs) against NWA surface GPs using sequential plasmid DNA immunization of VelocImmune mice with GPs from the genetically distantly related NWA (Aim 1). We will characterize these hVMAbs regarding their breadth of reactivity against GPs of representative members from all three NWA clades (Aim 2), including all known HF-causing NWA. We will select hVMAbs exhibiting broad NWA cross-reactivity to identify those with broadly neutralizing activity (BNhVMAbs) against NWA in cell-based assays (Aim 3) and to initially assess their in vivo therapeutic activity using infection of the mouse with recombinant LCM viruses expressing NWA HF-causing GPs of interest (Aim 4). The identification and characterization of NWA GP-specific BNhVMAbs will represent a first and necessary step for the development of an antibody (Ab)-based therapy against HF-causing NWA. Furthermore, characterization of the epitopes recognized by identified NWA GP-specific BNhVMAbs will facilitate the generation of immunogens able to induce similar broadly neutralizing (BN) responses to generate a polyvalent NWA vaccine, as well as the rationale design of broad-spectrum anti-NWA antiviral drugs."

"9322659","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elderly suffer the majority of influenza hospitalizations and deaths and are a priority for determining influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). The Univ. of Pittsburgh and UPMC Health System (UPMC) are located in Allegheny County (AC), in which influenza is reportable & which has one of the 5 oldest populations in the U.S. We propose a test-negative case-control study of influenza VE in 2 UPMC hospitals to determine VE against hospitalizations of adults. UPMC has been on the US News honor roll for over a decade, including most wired and has a strong research tradition. The influenza season will be determined from syndromic surveillance from multiple hospital EDs, the Health Dept. (ACHD), & from lab data from >14,000 respiratory viral panels (RVP) done annually at UPMC. Theradoc informatics will identify adult inpatients who have had an RVP conducted. Enrollees' survey data will be directly entered into NIH's REDCap. Frailty can be assessed by survey and/or electronic medical record (EMR) data (e.g., Charleson Co-morbidity Index) to assess confounders and effect modifiers. Our Data Center manages REDCap data, EMR data from hospitalizations, & immunization data for uploading to CDC. Population-based incidence of influenza hospitalizations will be determined from ACHD and UPMC St. Margaret hospitalization data and by agent-based modeling at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Our team is a strong candidate for this project because: 1) UPMC is the dominant regional health system with a strong bond rating; 2) infection control personnel recommend RVPs to establish diagnoses, and our team's leadership responsibilities at the hospitals can further influence the use of RVPs; 3) we have published data showing excellent concordance between UPMC's GenMark RVP and the CDC's PCR for detecting influenza; 4) research shows better protection in the elderly from high-dose influenza (HD) vaccine; UPMC has recommended and promoted HD vaccine in large quantities, although regular vaccine is available, allowing for vaccine type comparisons; 5) UPMC's EMR links inpatient and outpatient vaccination records, and interfaces with the state immunization registry; 6) it includes diverse, well-published investigators who have worked together previously."

"9204745","Project Summary/Abstract (Description): Protocol Review & Monitoring System  Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) has established a process by which Cancer Center Members undergo  internal peer review of the scientific merit and prioritization of proposed clinical trials and population science  protocols prior to Institutional Review Board review (i.e., Dartmouth's Committee for the Protection of Human  Subjects [CPHS]). These NCCC reviews are to confirm the scientific validity of the proposed study, to assess  the feasibility of the study in light of the availability of human subjects and current protocols relying on  enrollments from that same population, to assure the safety monitoring plan is appropriate and in accordance  with regulations, and to offer comments that could enhance either scientific merit or implementation logistics of  the planned study.  NCCC's Clinical Cancer Research Committee (CCRC) is a chartered multidisciplinary committee charged with  reviewing all non-NCI Cooperative group research protocols and amendments proposed to be opened by  Dartmouth Principal Investigators (PIs) for treatment of, and intervention for, cancer. Cancer prevention  studies, screening trials, behavioral studies, quality of life / survivorship studies, and interventional trials that  rely on collection of patient-reported outcomes that have not already undergone external peer review by NIH  and its funding agencies are reviewed by the CCRC Population Science Subcommittee (PSS). The CCRC has  the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research activities that fall within its  jurisdiction.  CCRC members are selected to represent the broad spectrum of oncology research. Cadre membership  includes representatives from medical oncology, hematology, surgical oncology, pediatric oncology, clinical  pharmacology, biostatistics, basic science research, population science, clinical research administration, and  patient advocacy.

"9204748","Project Summary/Abstract: Cancer Epidemiology (CE)  The goal of the Cancer Epidemiology (CE) Program is to provide a platform to synergize research efforts of  epidemiologic and clinical researchers in order to elucidate pathways to cancer occurrence and progression  that can impact clinical treatment and prevention strategies. The program brings together experienced, NCI-  funded epidemiologists, molecular biologists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticists and NCCC clinicians around 3  central interactive program themes: (1) population genomics, (2) emerging risk factors, and (3) life course  epidemiology. Program investigators design, execute, and analyze population-based research aimed at  understanding cancer etiology, second malignancies, progression, and survival, as well as develop novel  methods for these lines of research. This work is based on outstanding efforts to use population-based studies  of the catchment area population and also to engage in research with national and international epidemiologic  resources, including clinical trials, cohort and case-control studies. Currently there are 22 members, including  3 clinical members and 1 joint member, spanning 11 departments with expertise and experience in all facets of  modern molecular epidemiology. The NCCC has been instrumental in supporting the efforts of the CE  program, most notably with its support of strategic, targeted recruitment efforts, including the recruitment of  Chris Amos, Olga Gorlova, Jennifer Doherty, Diane Gilbert-Diamond, Scott Williams, Amarendra Das, Zhigang  Li, Brock Christensen and Carmen Marsit, the latter who serves now as Co-Director of the program with  Margaret Karagas. Spurred by these recruitments and their synergies with existing member interests, the  present program has developed and evolved, from a broader program in Cancer Epidemiology and  Chemoprevention, to focus its efforts on cancer epidemiology research and translation. The program aims to  expand collaborative research efforts within its membership and across NCCC Programs, utilizing monthly  program meetings to encourage these activities, which are subsequently catalyzed by pilot grants funded by  NCCC. The support of the NCCC was paramount in the successful creation and funding of the new COBRE  Center for Molecular Epidemiology, the development of an interdisciplinary training program in the Quantitative  Population Sciences in Cancer, and a second COBRE in Integrative Biology. These initiatives have been  instrumental in the recruitment of talented faculty and trainees that continue to energize and grow cancer  epidemiology research. More than 580 cancer-related articles have been published over the reporting period  (85 [15%] in high impact journals), with all 22 members on intra-program (158=27%) and 19 members on inter-  program (74=13%) collaborations. Total funding for the program is currently $11.5M, of which $10.8M is peer-  reviewed and $2.9M is from NCI. These efforts will allow the CE program to continue to perform cutting-edge  molecular epidemiologic research, on the etiology and outcomes of cancer, to reduce the burden of human  malignancies and impact prevention and treatment strategies."
"9389110","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Calprotectin (CP) is an abundant protein in neutrophils that is known to sequester Zn and Mn from pathogens using two distinct metal sites in a process known as nutritional immunity. CP has potent anti-microbial activity against many pathogens, including the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. However, the mechanism by which CP exerts its anti-candida activity is unknown. Recent studies from the Culotta lab have shown that, in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis, C. albicans lesions in the kidneys are associated with profound clearing of Zn, suggestive of Zn withholding from the pathogen, possibly by CP. Surprisingly, Cu may also be withheld from C. albicans during kidney infection as the yeast present in these lesions exhibit mRNA markers of Cu starvation. There is no known role for CP in withholding Cu, but biochemically CP has the capacity to bind Cu. Thus, I began to investigate if CP could be responsible for Cu and/or Zn sequestration from C. albicans. Using laboratory yeast cultures, I have shown that CP can sequester Zn and Cu away from C. albicans and Cu sequestration requires metal binding residues in CP that are distinct from the Zn binding site. I have also shown that C. albicans upregulates Cu or Zn uptake genes in response to the metal limiting environment imposed by CP. Given these results, I hypothesize that CP aids in the fight against C. albicans during kidney infection by sequestering multiple metal ions, including Cu, away from the pathogen. To investigate this, I will carry out the following aims. Aim 1: To understand the impact of CP on metal accumulation and metal stress responses in cultures of C. albicans. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which CP can sequester Cu versus Zn, I will test the ability of various site specific metal binding mutants of CP to inhibit C. albicans growth in culture and to withhold Cu and Zn from this pathogen. Yeast gene expression will also be analyzed to define any Cu and Zn starvation stress responses as well as any oxidative stress that occurs in C. albicans when CP attacks this pathogen. Aim 2: To understand the connection between CP and metal homeostasis in C. albicans during kidney infection. After establishing a role of CP in sequestering both Zn and Cu away from C. albicans in vitro, I will investigate if CP is responsible for the decrease in kidney Cu and Zn observed in the aforementioned murine model of disseminated candidiasis. First, kidneys from infected mice will be examined histologically to tract neutrophil and CP recruitment to sites of fungal lesions. Laser capture microdissection will be used to isolate fungal lesions in  the kidney for the analysis of metals and fungal mRNA. By this approach, we can define local changes in Cu and Zn (and other metals) and will identify any fungal stress responses by examining markers of Cu and Zn uptake as well as oxidative stress. These analyses will be carried out in both WT and in CP-deficient mice to determine if CP is responsible for metal withholding from C. albicans during fungal invasion of the kidney. Together, these studies will provide insight into how CP combats C. albicans during the innate immune response, including an unprecedented role for Cu sequestration by CP in nutritional immunity."
"9404541","Project Summary/Abstract: Our overall goal is to train the next generation of behavioral oncology scientists to conduct interdisciplinary cancer prevention and control research spanning the continuum of prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivorship. Research training in behavioral oncology is particularly well suited to benefit from interdisciplinary scientists capable of pursuing multi- and inter-disciplinary approaches that focus on the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors. Unlike training in bench science, Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) trainees must be embedded in a rich diversity of senior researchers like the one created at Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis and the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center (IUSCC). During the last 10 years, we have trained interdisciplinary behavioral scientists in medicine, psychology, nursing, informatics, epidemiology, neuroscience, and music therapy who are making significant contributions to cancer research both nationally and internationally. The purpose of this training program is to: 1) Train interdisciplinary pre and post-doctoral fellows with the requisite knowledge and skills to become successful independent investigators in the field of behavioral oncology, 2) Develop a cadre of senior interdisciplinary researchers who serve as mentors for our trainees through an interdisciplinary research network at IUSCC, and 3) Strengthen and implement a structured training program based on science in behavioral oncology, with new and innovative training experiences that will increase the outcome competencies of our graduates.  Mentees meet weekly with their primary mentor and monthly with their secondary mentors in addition to developing a mentoring team. Individual mentoring is supplemented by a strong curriculum built specifically for training in behavioral oncology. Structured training experiences are developed in Modules that are scheduled for three-hours each week lead by the Program Director. Additional research experiences include weekly review and writing sessions, and lectures from outstanding faculty. A key component of training for all fellows is writing and critiquing grant applications and publications. Predoctoral fellows are allowed a maximum of 3 years of support and post-doctoral fellows 2 years of support. We plan for 4 predoctoral fellows and 6 postdoctoral fellows.  New and innovative additions to the program include: 1) the intersection of aging and cancer, 2) embedded experiences in a basic and clinical laboratory, 3) formal proposal development as an outcome of the traineeships, 4) a proposal ready for submission as an outcome of the traineeship, 5) experience in abstract submission and presentation, and 6) focused content on career planning."
"9121437","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sepsis-induced lung injury is a common, highly-morbid critical illness. While advances in supportive care strategies have improved patient outcomes, mortality remains unacceptably high. As the mechanisms of sepsis-induced lung injury and subsequent repair are uncertain, few targeted pharmaceutical treatments have been developed that improve patient survival. This proposal aims to understand an endogenous lung epithelial repair response that is initiated by the processes which incite lung injury during sepsi.  Our laboratory has recently discovered a novel mechanism of sepsis-induced lung injury that may initiate endogenous repair responses. Sepsis is associated with cleavage of the pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx, a heparan sulfate (HS)-rich layer of glycosaminoglycans lining the luminal endothelial surface. Degradation of the glycocalyx facilitates alveolar endothelial and epithelial injury and releases HS octasaccharides into the pulmonary vasculature. We propose that the HS octasaccharides released during septic glycocalyx degradation extravasate from the pulmonary microvasculature and access the alveolar epithelium, where they may affect alveolar epithelial growth factor signaling, specifically ERK signaling, and repair. However, whether the cleaved HS octasaccharides enhance or inhibit alveolar epithelial ERK signaling and repair is context dependent and may be dependent on both the sulfation pattern of the HS octasaccharides and the presence of competing HS on the alveolar epithelial cell surface.  We will utilize state-of-the-art techniques to determine 1) if HS extravasates from the pulmonary microvasculature and accesses the alveolar epithelium during sepsis, 2) the sulfation pattern necessary for HS octasaccharides to enhance ATII cell ERK signaling and repair in vitro, and 3) if HS octasaccharides enhance ATII cell ERK signaling and lung repair during sepsis in vivo. Information gained from the proposed work will not only provide knowledge about endogenous alveolar epithelial repair mechanisms, but could also lead to the development of pharmacologic treatments to augment the pro-reparative effects of HS."

"9228009","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this project we will seek a better understanding of why and how mouse strains lacking the NF?B RelB protein, known as the primary effector of the non-canonical NF?B pathway, develop severe inflammatory and auto-immune disease. Whereas previous studies focused on NF?B response genes, our unbiased transcriptomic measurements (preliminary results) revealed that RelB-deficient macrophages and dendritic cells show dramatic hyper-expression of interferon stimulatory genes (ISGs) due to hyper-expression of interferon-?. Hyper-activity of the type I IFN regulatory system in antigen-presenting cells may indeed explain the T-cell mediated auto-immune phenotype in RelB knockout mice. The proposed project addresses the overarching hypothesis that RelB functions as a critical signaling node that fine-tunes inflammatory and interferon-mediated responses during the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. In the first Specific Aim, we will first characterize the control of interferon gene expression by RelB in macrophages and dendritic cells, not only in RelB knockouts but also naturally occurring splenic DCs that show either low or high expression of RelB (using a novel RelB-Venus reporter). We will examine whether reducing the hyper-activity of the interferon system genetically will suppress the auto-immune phenotype of RelB-/- mice. In the second Specific Aim, we will characterize the mechanism of how RelB regulates type I interferon responses. Using a novel RelB-DNA binding mutant (RelBdb/db), we will distinguish between chromatin-bound vs. cytoplasmic mechanisms. Preliminary results suggest that (i) hyper-activation of IRF3 may be mediated by cytoplasmic inhibition by RelB of RelA, either by direct binding or via stabilizing the RelA-trapping I?Bsome, and that (ii) RelB:p50 may directly inhibit IFN? expression by competing with IRF3 for binding to the G-IRE (Cheng et al 2011). These mechanisms will be delineated in the proposed studies."

"9260217","PROJECT SUMMARY The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine offers the unprecedented opportunity to prevent nearly all cervical and anal cancers and a high proportion of vaginal, oropharyngeal, vulvar and penile cancers, where HPV is the etiologic agent. HPV vaccination is recommended for all children ages 11-12, with catch up for females to age 26 and males to age 21. However, despite clear and indisputable value in cancer prevention, uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine series has lagged far behind the goal of 80%. Provider recommendation is the strongest determinant of HPV vaccination, but slow translation of guidelines for preventive services, such as immunizations, into practice is a known challenge. Practice Facilitation (PF) is a multicomponent quality improvement intervention approach that has well-established efficacy, in which external support and resources are provided to build the internal capacity of practices to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Our central goal is to identify the optimal approach to implementing an evidence-based intervention for the uptake and completion of HPV vaccine among adolescents receiving care in the community, guided by implementation science theory. AIM 1: Determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two modalities for delivering a multi-component PF intervention to increase HPV vaccination initiation and completion in community-based pediatric practices. We will compare the traditional in-person Coach PF modality to a lower-resource Web-Based PF modality. The primary patient outcome is HPV vaccination. We will also examine and compare the sustainability of practice changes on vaccination rates and the effects over time for each intervention modality. H1: Both interventions will result in significant increases in HPV vaccination from baseline over time. H2: Increases in the rate of HPV vaccination will be higher and sustained for a longer period of time in the Coach PF Arm as compared with the Web-Based PF Arm. H3: The Web-Based PF Arm will be more cost-effective than the Coach PF Arm. AIM 2. Understand mechanisms of why the PF intervention may work better for some pediatric practices than others for HPV vaccination. We will examine theory-based determinants at the organizational, provider, and patient levels that may mediate (explain) or moderate (change) the effects of the PF intervention on vaccination outcomes. H4: Adoption of changes (process variables) and patient factors will mediate effects of the intervention on HPV vaccination outcomes. H5: Organizational factors, provider attitudes, and intervention characteristics will moderate intervention effects on HPV vaccination outcomes. The findings will inform organizations about which PF modality to use among their constituent practices to improve HPV vaccination rates, with potential for future national dissemination."
"9188004","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Accelerated atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in subjects with diabetes. Extensive evidence using pharmacological antagonists and genetically modified mice points to key roles for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts in diabetic and non-diabetic atherosclerosis. We have discovered that homozygous RAGE null mice display significant reduction In atherosclerosis in the apoE null background, both in the non-diabetic and diabetic state. In parallel, significantly reduced vascular inflammation accompanies the benefits of RAGE deletion. The interaction of the RAGE cytoplasmic domain with mDial, a formin family molecule, highlights novel insights Into the mechanisms by which RAGE signals.  Major discoveries that form the basis of this Project include that in macrophages, RAGE markedly suppresses transcription and translation of the cholesterol transporter ABCGI, and, thereby, greatly reduces cholesterol efflux to HDL. In SMCs, RAGE ligands stimulate proliferation and migration In a manner dependent on mDia-1 and signaling through glycogen synthase kinase-n (GSK-3n) In this application, we will employ newly-developed two sets of novel floxed mice in which we may delete RAGE specifically in SMCs or monocytes/macrophages to probe in-depth the mechanisms by RAGE and mDial contribute to  accelerated atherosclerosis. Project 1 is integrally linked within the Program. Together the three projects will probe the intricacies of RAGE signaling, recognizing that some processes appear dependent vs. independent of mDial Project 1 collaborates with Project 2 on RAGE & glyoxalase!; and Project 1 collaborates with Project 3 on opposing roles of RAGE on regulation of Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK-SD and cell fate. Project 1 shares findings from Affymetrix gene array studies with Projects 2&3 to create integrated pathways by which RAGE signaling regulates cardiovascular stress.

"9262700","Heart failure with impaired systolic function (HF) is a common malady of the aging population, with dire personal and socioeconomic consequences. The past 2 decades have seen little progress in the development of new pharmaceutical agents to treat HF. A major factor contributing to the progression of HF and adverse outcomes is exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity. Current pharmacological treatments for HF target the peripheral effects of this augmented sympathetic nerve activity, but not the central nervous system source. Recent studies in my laboratory have implicated the extracellular signal- regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway as an obligatory step leading to sympathetic excitation by many of the neurochemicals (i.e., angiotensin II, aldosterone, pro-inflammatory cytokines) that are known to be upregulated in key cardiovascular regulatory regions of the HF brain ? effectively acting as a final common pathway for these excitatory agonists. Working with a rat model of ischemia-induced HF that closely mimics systolic HF in humans, we found that reducing brain ERK1/2 activity in these regions ? and in particular in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus which is a source of presympathetic neurons ? reduces sympathetic nerve activity and ameliorates the peripheral manifestations of HF. In addition, our preliminary studies suggest that this molecular pathway is amenable to treatment with peripherally administered drug-loaded microparticle preparations. The present proposal will address both basic mechanistic and potential therapeutic aspects of this molecular pathway. The mechanistic studies will focus specifically on the role of ERK1/2 signaling in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, a locus of presympathetic neurons known to contribute to augmented sympathetic nerve activity in HF. We will examine the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor as a putative ?gateway? to the ERK1/2 signaling pathway by multiple excitatory agonists, the effect of ERK1/2 signaling on transcription factors that upregulate the expression of excitatory agonists, the effect of ERK1/2 signaling on a potassium channel mechanisms that may increase the excitability of presympathetic neurons. The therapeutic studies will explore the possibility that an advanced drug delivery system that facilitates passage of drug across the blood brain barrier can reduce brain ERK1/2 signaling and thereby reduce sympathetic nerve activity to improve peripheral manifestations of HF and survival in HF - a critical translational issue. We anticipate that these studies will lead to better understanding of the role of brain ERK1/2 signaling in sympathetic excitation and will lay the groundwork for the development of novel pharmacological approaches to the treatment of HF."
"9386117","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This proposal is for renewal of our postdoctoral research training grant in Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine that was initiated in 2001. The program provides a highly organized 2-3 year program of focused dedicated didactics, seminars, and, most importantly, an intense research experience with one of 24 well-established, highly interactive, and well-funded cross-disciplinary mentors representing eight different primary departments. The goal is to generate productive MD and MD/PhD physician- scientists as well as PhD scientists and clinician-scientists, who will be launched on a lifelong investigative career pursuing basic and translational research in this underrepresented field. Careful career development by an individualized Career & Research Committee is a hallmark of the program. Three degree-granting tracks are also available, in addition to the core post-doctoral program: an Investigative Medicine PhD available to MD-only trainees who wish to obtain a more expansive research background mimicking that of an MD/PhD; a Masters of Health Sciences under the aegis of the Yale CTSA for those with a clinical/translational research goal; and a Masters of Biomedical Engineering for trainees with a past basic biomedicine emphasis who wish to add an engineering dimension to their knowledge base. Drawn from a candidate pool focused on those whose background is Laboratory Medicine & Pathology (a pool which has always included at least 10 fold more excellent candidates than are accepted into the program), outcomes have been quite positive. Of the graduates of the T32 program, 25% have successfully completed a degree-granting track, 50% have secured tenure track academic investigative positions, with the remainder retained in research at earlier career development stages; all have obtained some subsequent funding with 25% moving directly to K08 awards. The T32 program currently supports four post-doctoral positions per year and, based on results and candidate pool, we are requesting an increase to six positions. The core T32 is leveraged, since the entire Laboratory Medicine Departmental Immunohematology-Transfusion Medicine training program is greater than the T32 - it includes individuals on other funding mechanisms. When they are included, 69% of graduates have investigative tenure track positions and 38% have attained PI-level R01 funding. We believe that this program fills an important research training need both at Yale and nationally."

"9197341","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defects in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases but the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with focal atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes. FTLD is one of the most common forms of presenile dementia. Increasing clinical and molecular evidence indicates that FTLD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis share many common pathogenic mechanisms. Indeed, several genes, including CHMP2B, VCP, TDP-43, FUS, Ubiquilin 2, and C9ORF72, have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of both diseases. During the first funding cycle of this R01 grant, we established a neuronal cell model and a Drosophila model of mutant CHMP2B toxicity and investigated the roles of ESCRTs and autophagy in neurodegeneration. To more closely model human disease, we established a novel transgenic mouse model that exhibits several key features of FTLD-associated neurodegeneration. In this renewal application, we propose to carry out molecular, cellular, genetic, and behavioral analyses to further characterize this novel mouse model of FTLD, with the goal of gaining mechanistic insights into pathogenic events in vivo. The proposed studies will significantly enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms in FTLD and may reveal novel targets for therapeutic interventions."

"9208403","Pathology Specimen Locator Shared Resource Project Summary / Abstract The Pathology Specimen Locator Core facilitates DF/HCC member access to tissue through a web-based, integrated network of distributed, searchable databases that contain de-identified, coded, pathologic information on post-diagnostic, excess human materials (including frozen or paraffin-embedded tissues). Access to annotated human tissues with cancer is critical for translational research, which provides an increasingly important bridge between basic scientific research and clinical medicine. The pathology departments in the DF/HCC member institutions have paraffin archives with millions of specimens, with thousands more being added each year. These specimens provide the essential substrate for the development of new molecular classifications of tumors and the discovery and validation of new biomarkers, which may improve diagnosis and prognostication, or serve as targets of new rational therapies."
"9196546","This application develops a Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (TCC) for Health Disparities Research  on Chronic Disease Prevention within the DHHS-defined Region 5 titled The Flint Center for Health Equity  Solutions (FCHES). Core Academic Faculty and their community partners bring significant research and practical  expertise in health equity efforts, behavioral health interventions and epidemiology, geography and the effects  of built environment on health, and physical fitness and healthy eating in economically distressed, minority-  majority communities. The TCC targets its initial activities within Flint, Michigan, with plans to extend the scope  and reach of Center activities more generally across the state and nation. Our long-range goal is to eliminate  disparities in physical and behavioral health developing, implementing and disseminating community-based  multilevel interventions and creating sustainable health equity solutions in partnership with a broad cross-section  of multi-sectorial stakeholders.   The Methodology Core will be responsible for development of consistent definitions, theoretical  frameworks, key approaches, and analytic methods for multilevel chronic disease prevention for the TCC. The  core includes expertise in epidemiology, sampling, geospatial methods, longitudinal and clinical trials data  analyses, and health economics (include cost and cost-effectiveness analyses). The Core will conduct a  comprehensive needs and assets assessment in the community including social stratification, community  ecological context, cultural factors, and environmental factors. Multimodal methods will be used to triangulate  findings and identify the underlying mechanisms of disparities within Flint, Michigan and across Region 5,  including the development of a Regional Database to assess and monitor health disparities and structural factors  related health inequities. The Core will also provide statistical and cost-effectiveness analyses for Center  research projects. The theoretical model supporting the multilevel chronic disease prevention model is grounded  in the social ecological theory and maps onto the analytic plan to address the interventions impact on individual-  level and contextual factors, the interaction between them and how they influence each other dynamically. The  Specific aims of the Methodology Core are to: (1) Formulate a theoretical framework, study design, data analysis  plan, and assessment of community-based multilevel interventions that supports TCC activities; (2) Create an  accountability structure that ensures the overall success of the TCC and consistency across Cores; (3) Identify  the unit of intervention and the unit of analysis to address the research questions of the TCC; and (4) Provide a  systematic appraisal of costs and benefits of community-based multilevel interventions."

"9391851","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the third competing renewal application for Yale University's Vascular Research Postdoctoral T32. Of fellows who have completed training to date, 86% have obtained academic faculty positions and/or careers in science, and many have received independent grant support, strong indicators of program success. The continued goal is to provide laboratory and translational research training for highly qualified physician (M.D. and M.D./Ph.D.) and Ph.D. postdoctoral fellows in vascular biology, in preparation for careers as independent investigators in blood vessel biology- and medicine-related disciplines. Trainee selection will be based on a commitment to vascular biology and strong prior research experience or potential of same. Applications will be encouraged from clinical and basic science departments, with a nationwide competition for 7 yearly slots. Minority applicants will be specifically solicited through numerous avenues. 57% of the currently enrolled fellows are underrepresented minorities. The training will be mentor-based, also including advisory committees and didactic courses. The minimum duration of training will be 2 years. The Cardiovascular Medicine Division and Yale's Interdisciplinary Program in Vascular Biology and Therapeutics will be the foundations for the program. A key asset is Yale's interdisciplinary strength in vascular biology. Departmental affiliations for participating faculty include Cardiovascular Medicine, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Immunobiology, Pharmacology, Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology, Pathology, Genetics, Bioengineering, Physiology, Epidemiology and Public Health, and Cardiothoracic Surgery. This is a testimony to the wide spectrum of strong vascular biology laboratories at Yale and the program's institutional nature. Faculty were chosen based on impressive histories of mentorship, ongoing vascular research productivity, strong extramural support and commitment to serve as mentors within the program. Examples of research opportunities include: (1) molecular determinants and consequences of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions; (2) molecular imaging of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling utilizing nuclear and MR imaging in animal models; (3) mapping and identification of genes that contribute to the development of vascular disease (arterio-venous malformation, coronary artery disease) in humans; (4) engineering of vascular biomaterials, and molecular determinants of healing responses post-implantation; and (5) generation of angiogenic gene regulators for use in clinical trials. This represents a wide range of disease-related vascular research, with key translational components. Trainee progress will be monitored by each mentor, the trainee's advisory committee and the Program Co-Directors. It is the expectation that we will train future national and international leaders in vascular research. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and a major cause of mortality world-wide. This program will provide important opportunities for individuals from multiple disciplines to eventually lead high impact efforts at reducing the incidence of, and improving outcomes in, cardiovascular disease."
"9174912","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Missense mutations in heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins A1 and A2 (hnRNPA1D262V and hnRNPA2D290V) cause inclusion body myopathy with frontotemporal dementia, Paget's disease of bone, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a complex disorder known as multisystem proteinopathy (MSP). Thus, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 join the ranks of RNA-binding proteins with prion-like domains that are implicated in the pathogenesis of devastating and untreatable human neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanism by which hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 cause pathology in MSP patients, however, is unknown. Based on preliminary data, I hypothesize that hnRNPA1D262V and hnRNPA2D290V must misfold and bind RNA to confer cytotoxicity. I have established a yeast model that recapitulates the toxicity and mislocalization of hnRNPA1D262V and hnRNPA2D290V to cytoplasmic foci seen in human disease. I have shown that, in yeast, both hnRNPs require an intact RNA recognition motif (RRM) and some portion of the prion-like domain to confer toxicity, and that this toxicity can be suppressed by disruption of RNA-binding capability through RRM missense mutations. I will investigate the domain requirements and RNA-binding requirement for misfolding and toxicity in cultured motor neurons using a series of truncation and deletion protein constructs and RNA-binding deficient constructs. The ability to suppress hnRNPA1D262V and hnRNPA2D290V toxicity would provide a therapeutic strategy for MSP patients. Thus, I will investigate candidate toxicity suppressors that have shown promise for other neurodegeneration-linked RNA-binding proteins with prion-like domains, including TDP-43 and FUS. A potentiated variant of the yeast protein disaggregase Hsp104 appears to mitigate the toxicity of prion-like proteins via disaggregation of misfolded structures, and I have demonstrated that it has the ability to suppress the toxicity of hnRNPA2D290V but not hnRNPA1D262V. Deletion of the lariat debranching enzyme, Dbr1, ameliorates TDP-43 and FUS toxicity, and will also be explored as a strategy for suppressing the toxicity of hnRNPA1D262V and hnRNPA2D290V. In addition, a yeast deletion screen will be used to uncover additional toxicity suppressors, which will offer insight into the mechanisms underlying toxicity and reveal potential therapeutic targets. Our studies will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying MSP and the link between neurodegeneration and prion-like RNA-binding proteins."
"9404701","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Training Program, Mechanisms of Hypertension and Cardiovascular Diseases, Suzanne Oparil, MD, PD/PI, offers postdoctoral training in fundamental aspects of the pathophysiology of hypertension and cardiovascular (CV) diseases and in innovative approaches to the treatment of these conditions. The Program has recently been enriched to include new training opportunities in free radical biology, vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, matrix biology, obesity/metabolism, statistical genetics and genomics, cardiac remodeling/ failure, and arrhythmogenesis, as well as clinical and translational research in chronic kidney disease, diabetes/metabolism and resistant hypertension. The UAB CCTS offers advanced training in quantitative sciences, including bioinformatics, systems biology and computational techniques, that will augment our existing Program and equip trainees to function in these important new research areas. The UAB Office for Postdoctoral Education (OPE) offers our trainees valuable guidance and instruction in survival skills, including counseling re-career opportunities in academia and the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry. Our multidisciplinary faculty has expertise in molecular and cell biology, physiology, biostatistics, and clinical and translational research. Training opportunities are available in four Thematic Groups: Vascular injury/inflammation/ atherogenesis; oxidative stress/free radical injury; cardiac remodeling/failure, and clinical/ translational research. Each trainee is given in-depth experience in one area of research and will be exposed to other areas through seminars, conferences, and course work. Trainees will have a concentrated 2- 3 year experience in laboratory or clinical/translational research under the direction of mentors from the training faculty. Trainees will spend at least 80% of time in investigation, in taking relevant courses, and in attending scientific meetings. The goal of this Program is to prepare trainees for careers in both fundamental and clinical/translational research in CV disease. The educational experiences available to our trainees are sufficient to equip graduates of the Program with the appropriate technical skills and theoretical background to make them competitive for faculty positions in prestigious academic institutions through the country or in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry. Relevance: There is a shortage of basic, translational and clinical scientists who are trained to use cutting edge approaches to problems related to hypertension and cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death and disability in the US. Ours is the only Program in Alabama that provides highly integrated bench to bedside training in cardiovascular science for MD- and PhD-prepared trainees."
"9405127","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for competitive renewal of a T32 in Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine research training at the Brown University Centers of Behavioral and Preventive Medicine (CBPM) and The Miriam Hospital. The program goal is to train a total of 13 postdoctoral fellows for two year periods to conduct research to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by changing the most prominent lifestyle risk factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking. During our first four years of funding, we were extremely successful in recruiting 10 outstanding fellows and developing their independently funded scientific careers. All 5 graduates now hold faculty appointments and 4 of the 5 have their own NIH funding. The T32 develops researchers who advance the basic science understanding of the etiology of behaviors associated with CVD and who develop and disseminate effective interventions targeting these behaviors to prevent or treat CVD. Increasingly, our program focuses on translational research in which findings in basic science (e.g., genetics and neuroimaging) are used to inform behavioral interventions and dissemination research in which efficacious interventions are tested in community settings and with high risk populations. These approaches require multidisciplinary approaches which are facilitated by the ongoing collaborations between the CBPM and the Brown Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, the Department of Medicine and the Program in Public Health. There are large numbers of federally funded trials that provide outstanding research training opportunities for our fellows including projects on the effects of behavior change on CVD endpoints, studies of genetic and environmental contributions to health and CVD, and projects using innovative channels (e.g., Internet and text-messaging) and sites of delivery (e.g., YMCAs).  We have retained and augmented our successful training model for this cycle, with Program Director Rena Wing, PhD, Associate Director Bess Marcus, PhD, and Administrative Director Justin Nash, PhD, continuing in their leadership capacity. Alfred Buxton, MD (Director of Cardiology), Jeanne McCaffery, PhD, and Anthony Spirito, PhD join the Training Committee. Training is highly individualized with all fellows developing core competencies in areas such as CVD-related behavioral research and specialized competencies in their specific areas of research. Formal didactics and mentored research experiences are combined to develop competencies. Mentoring teams are headed by a senior behavioral scientist and complemented with a physician or public health scientist mentor and a junior faculty mentor. Trainee progress in achieving training objectives is formally evaluated. Given our initial success and our ability to recruit highly competitive candidates, provide extensive research and training opportunities, provide outstanding mentors with established track records, and produce funded researchers and junior faculty members, we feel uniquely qualified to continue our T32 research training in behavior change and CVD."

"9209326","Project Summary/Abstract Despite extensive knowledge of metabolic pathways, understanding the basic metabolic mechanisms of prominent diseases is limited by the ability to grasp the regulation of complex metabolic systems. Genetic gain/loss of function approaches have provided a wealth of information about how metabolism can be regulated, but have not been very successful at identifying the cause of complex disease. Ideally, top-down approaches would be used to examine the function of metabolism using quantitative approaches, then to guide gain/loss of function studies. The scientific community is moving quickly to stable isotopes because of high information yield, convenience, and the capacity to translate methods between human subjects, rodent models and cell preparations. To accomplish this goal, it is essential to extend earlier concepts using computational methods, and to integrate mass spectrometry (MS) with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). However, in order for the approaches to be embraced by the molecular physiologist/geneticist or clinical scientist interested in disease physiology, they must be flexible, reliable and easy-to-use methods relevant in a wide range of conditions. In this TR&D project we will perform cell, rodent and computational studies to develop translation methods to address these needs. First, we will integrate tracer flux approaches and metabolomics to identify target enzymes in the regulation of metabolism or its dysregulation during disease. Secondly, we will leverage the specificity of NMR isotopomer analysis and the sensitivity of mass isotopomer analysis to measure flux with high confidence on milligram scale samples. Finally, we will develop and distribute a free, open source software platform that simulates NMR and MS data based on flux/tracer input and calculates flux from experimental data in a single, easy to use graphical interface complete. Accomplishing these aims will provide the scientific community with new tools that will guide tactical studies in pharmacology, genetics and clinical science."
"9404110","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application requesting funding for Years 36-40 of a long-standing, highly successful Institutional Training Grant that supports postdoctoral research training in transfusion medicine and benign hematology. Since the last competitive renewal in 2007, funded research at the BloodCenter of Wisconsin (BCW) has continued to increase, and faculty available to mentor fellows has increased to 32. Available research space has been roughly doubled by an addition to the Blood Research Institute that was completed in December 2006. An agreement has been negotiated with the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) under which BloodCenter physicians now constitute the Section of Benign Hematology in the Division of Hematology-Oncology. Together, these developments enhance basic research training opportunities, open new avenues for clinical/translational research, and provide training grant faculty with unprecedented access to residents and fellows who have an interest in research training. Research opportunities available to trainees cover a broad range of clinical and basic research subjects relevant to transfusion medicine and hematology, including Immunology, Vascular Biology/Hemostasis, Transfusion Medicine, Stem Cell Biology, and Clinical Research. The research training experience will be essentially full time. Trainees will be expected to gain a basic understanding of the disciplines in which they undertake their investigations, develop competency with a variety of research technologies, strengthen their grasp of their chosen research by taking selected courses in the graduate studies program of MCW, and develop the ability to conduct independent research. Time spent in fellowship training is regarded as one of several stages of professional development. Accordingly, additional tracks will be offered to selected trainees, including the opportunity 1) to apply for a Clinical Investigator Development Award (K08) for continued mentoring, 2) to apply for independent grant support, and 3) for those oriented toward a career in transfusion medicine, an opportunity for further training as a junior member of BloodCenter's medical staff. Ultimately, trainees are expected to pursue academic or alternate careers in transfusion medicine, hematology, or closely related fields."
"9391448","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health manpower projections for the United States consistently indicate a shortage of well-trained researchers in the fields of epidemiology and prevention. This five-year proposal is for renewal of a longstanding training grant in the epidemiology and prevention of cardiovascular disease held by the Division of Epidemiology & Community Health of the University of Minnesota. The program is highly successful, having graduated four dozen fellows since 1977. Among graduates in the past 10 years, 91 percent are in research careers, mostly in cardiovascular research at academic institutions or government agencies. The training program's excellent facilities, large and diverse faculty, and broad research opportunities offer an outstanding training environment. Our training program has continued to evolve and improve, to offer a cutting-edge training experience in cardiovascular disease epidemiology and prevention.  In the most recent period (2009-2014), the program was awarded five predoctoral and two postdoctoral fellowship positions. Positions have been filled throughout and we continue to have outstanding applicants. Fellows have been highly productive, generating many useful publications and presenting at national and international meetings. Our proposal for renewal (2014-2019) is to maintain seven fellowship positions per year - three postdoctoral and four predoctoral.  The University of Minnesota two to three year fellowship program offers outstanding training opportunities in direct research experience combined with a strong curriculum of formal courses and seminars. The participation of disadvantaged trainees is a high priority for the fellowship. The uniqueness of the training is the commitment of its faculty and the breadth of existing research, from the laboratory to the community. The continued need for qualified cardiovascular epidemiologists and the program's documented success justify its renewal."
