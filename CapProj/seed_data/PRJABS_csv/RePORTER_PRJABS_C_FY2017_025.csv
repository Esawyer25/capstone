"9274555","ABSTRACT This revised application requests funds to purchase an ABSciex 5500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and HPLC system (Shimadzu UPLC with a multiwell plate handling/rack changing autosampler) and workstation computer. This instrument is needed to augment services currently provided by an ABSciex 4000 Q-TRAP system that was purchased in 2007 with funds provided by an NIH S10 award (S10 RR024598) and has been in continuous service for the past 9 years as a mainstay of the University of Kentucky Small Molecule Mass Spectrometry Core Laboratory (services provided to 42 unique investigators and data generated for 90 peer reviewed publications). The requested instrument offers moderate improvements in speed, sensitivity and robustness over the 4000 series instrument and the UPLC system and rack changing/multiwell plate autosampler provide further improvements in sensitivity and sample throughput. This is an institution-wide facility core with permanent technical staff and faculty and administrative oversight necessary to ensure productive and financially sustainable operation. The core facility is directed by the PI of this application, Dr Morris. During this time, the instrument has provided services to NIH funded researchers engaged in Cancer, Cardiovascular, Metabolic Disease, Drug Discovery, Nutrition and Environmental Toxicology research both at the University of Kentucky and at several other regional and national institutions. The instrument has been used to generate data that were reported in 104 publications, to provide services that were critical to successful applications for multiple personal and programmatic research awards and to provide training in biomedical applications of mass spectrometry to students and fellows. The requested instrument is required to maintain the overall research capacity of the facility (~12,000 services/year) which is currently dependent on use of a second ABSciex 4000 Q-Trap that was purchased in 2009 with a supplement to one of Dr Morris's personal research grants. This instrument includes an ABSciex Flashquant vacuum MALDI source which enables its use for multiwell plate format enzyme assays and its use in this configuration for personal research purposes limits its availability for core facility services. The Major Users conduct NIH sponsored research in Lipid Metabolism and Signaling, Nutrition and Environmental Toxicology and Drug Discovery and Natural Products. Minor Users with relevant interests and qualifying support are also included. The facility core employs two analytical chemists with broad experience in mass spectrometry that will be responsible for day to day oversight, upkeep and operation of the requested instrument. Dr Morris and staff have extensive track record of success in the development and application of mass spectrometry-based methods for biomedical research and the facility core is overseen by an advisory committee staffed by individuals with appropriate and complementary expertise in analytical chemistry, mass spectrometry, data management and facility core oversight. Financial operation of the core adheres to federal cost accounting standards with a sustainable business plan underwritten by the College of Medicine and the Vice President for Research."
"9436708","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) results from the progressive degeneration of motor neurons. Astrocytes are important for neuronal function and survival, but exactly how astrocytes contribute to ALS pathogenesis is not known. Compared to neurons, astrocytes can be replaced much more easily and thus are the focus of regenerative medicine. Familial ALS is caused by pathogenic mutation in individual genes, including TDP-43. A critical need in ALS research is determining how astrocytes contribute to the initiation and progression of motor neuron degeneration in the presence and absence of the disease gene in astrocytes. Using a tetracycline- inducible gene expression system, we have created transgenic rats that restrictedly and reversibly express mutant TDP-43 in astrocytes. By microarray assays, we have determined the expression profiles of astrocytic genes. Many secretory genes are induced in astrocytes expressing mutant TDP-43. Functional analyses of astrocytic genes suggest a loss of neuroprotective functions and a gain of neurotoxic properties in astrocytes expressing mutant TDP-43. Here we will further determine how mutant TDP-43 in astrocytes causes non-cell- autonomous motor neuron death in transgenic rats. In response to neurodegeneration, astrocytes become reactive and may play important roles in disease pathogenesis. Increasing evidence strongly suggests that reactive astrocytes gain neurotoxic properties, but how reactive astrocytes execute neurotoxicity remains to be determined. Using various approaches, we have identified an inducible gene that is secreted by reactivate astrocytes. We will further define the route by which reactive astrocytes use to promote neurodegeneration. This proposal will determine how astrocytes contribute to the initiation and progression of motor neuron death in the presence and absence of mutant TDP-43 in astrocytes, advancing our understanding of ALS disease mechanisms."
"9420082","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Perinatal lung maturation allows transition to independent extrauterine life and requires concerted expansion of the epithelial gas exchange surface and the juxtaposed capillaries. Interruption of this process by premature birth is a major risk factor for serious lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that frequently manifests as alveolar simplification and dysmorphic capillaries. Although covering >95% of the alveolar surface and overlaying most of the alveolar vasculature, alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells are traditionally considered a passive structural component and attention has been focused on alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells because of their stem cell potential and role in surfactant production. This, combined with technical challenges in studying the ultra-thin (<0.1 um) AT1 cell extensions, results in our limited knowledge of the role of AT1 cells in normal and pathological alveologenesis. An in-depth understanding of AT1 cells during development is necessary to catch up with recent progress in studying AT2 cells and fibroblasts to obtain a complete picture of perinatal lung maturation. Our preliminary data support a novel hypothesis that AT1 cells have a signaling role in coordinating alveolar morphogenesis and angiogenesis during perinatal lung maturation. This proposal has the following three specific aims. (1) To determine whether AT1 cell development promotes alveolar angiogenesis. (2) To determine whether AT1 cell derived angiogenic factors promote alveolar angiogenesis. (3) To determine whether AT1 cell dysfunction contributes to hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. In summary, this proposal employs novel quantitative imaging and genetic tools to study the poorly understood and unexpected role of AT1 cells in perinatal lung maturation, and represents a step toward our long term goal of elucidating mechanisms and therapies of lung immaturity."
"9319428","Project Summary Hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (HCN) are highly expressed in the heart and central nervous system where they responsible for slowly activating currents that contribute to pacemaking activity. In addition to their role in generating rhythmic oscillations in neuronal circuits, these channels also play a crucial role in working memory and motor learning. They are important pharmacological targets for new drug development to treat disease conditions such as epilepsies and neuropathic pain. Despite the progress in un- derstanding the structure and physiological role of these ion channels, there remains a significant gap in our knowledge of the biophysical mechanisms that underpin HCN channel behavior. These channels are unique in the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily and have the potential to provide new insights into inward rectifica- tion and ligand activation. For instance, ensemble ligand binding measurements using patch clamp fluorimetry have recently suggested a remarkable model of ligand activation that involves a sequence of positive and neg- ative modulation of channel activity by physiological ligand. Although numerous crystal structures of cyclic nu- cleotide-binding domain (CNBD) from HCN channels are available, the mechanisms that underlie this unusual form of cooperativity remain unclear. The central goal of this project is to understand how the chemical struc- ture and the resulting forces orchestrate ligand activation in HCN channels. This proposal takes advantage of the interdisciplinary expertise at UW-Madison to combine single molecule measurements of ligand binding with structural and functional analysis of ligand activation. We will test the hypothesis that ligand activation in HCN channels may involve a symmetry-breaking switch to a dimer of dimer configuration. In specific aim 1, we will use zero-mode waveguides to measure the binding of individual ligands to the cyclic-nucleotide binding do- mains. This will allow us to directly measure energetics of each ligand-binding step and to track the coopera- tivity associated with this process. With this analysis in hand, we will be able to identify the key molecular de- terminants responsible for each of the four ligands. In specific aim 2, we will use X-ray crystallography to de- termine the structures of the unliganded states of the HCN CNBDs as well as new conformations of their liganded forms. In specific aim 3, we will carry out functional analysis of ligand activation using electrophysio- logical and biochemical binding studies. These studies combined with mutagenesis will identify the molecular bases for isoform-specific differences in ligand activation. The proposed studies are expected to shed new light on the molecular forces that underlie conformational changes during the ligand activation in a voltage- and lig- and-activated ion channel."
"9322798","Necrosis has long been recognized as a major form of cell death after cellular exposure to radiation. Necrosis is generally thought to be a passive form of cell death caused by exposure to stress that leads to initial swelling and eventual rupturing of cellular membrane. Thus it is traditionally considered to be an unregulated form of cell death, in contrast to apoptosis, where a defined cascade of molecular events leads to programmed cell death. The discovery of necroptosis, which involves the systematic activation of select molecular factors that leads to active permeabilization of cellular membrane, indicates that necrosis could be actively regulated, similar to apoptosis. However, despite a recent surge of studies on the molecular signaling events involved in necroptosis, its role in cancer radiotherapy remains unclear. In this project, we propose to examine in the counter-intuitive hypothesis that the necroptotic factors play key roles in sustaining tumor growth and mediating tumor resistance to radiotherapy. Our hypothesis is based on recent results in our laboratory that indicated genetic deficiencies in necroptotic genes led to weakened tumorigenic abilities and increased radiation sensitivities of cancer cells. We will use state-of-the-art genome editing technologies such as CRISPR to examine the role of the necriptotic genes in tumor growth and tumor resistance to radiotherapy (Aim 1). We will also conduct studies to unveil the mechanisms through which the necroptotic factors promote tumor growth and tumor resistance to radiation (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the small molecule inhibitors of the necroptotic factors alone or in combination with radiotherapy (Aim 3). Upon completion of the project, we hope to obtain a clearer picture of the role of necroptotic factors in tumor growth and tumor response to radiation therapy."
"9325265","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and neurodegeneration, but no disease-modifying therapy is available. The Presenilin (PSEN) genes harbor ~90% of the mutations linked to familial AD (FAD), highlighting its importance in AD pathogenesis. These FAD PSEN mutations are mostly missense mutations (>260) scattered throughout the coding sequence, consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism. Presenilin (PS) is essential for learning and memory, synaptic function and neuronal survival during aging, and contains the active site of ?-secretase. Presenilin conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice lacking PS expression in the adult cerebral cortex recapitulate key features of AD, including profound age-dependent neurodegeneration, gliosis, inflammatory responses and tau hyperphosphorylation. Studies in C. elegans, Drosophila and cultured mammalian cells showed that FAD mutations impair PS function and ?- secretase activity. We recently developed two knockin (KI) mice expressing FAD PSEN1 mutations, L435F and C410Y, and homozygous KI/KI mice show striking resemblance to PS1-/- mice, including perinatal lethality, abolished ?-secretase activity, impaired neurogenesis and decreased Notch signaling, demonstrating that FAD mutations resemble the PS1-null mutation in vivo. The molecular mechanism by which PS maintains neuronal function and survival is unclear. Identification of PS downstream targets and ?-secretase substrates will not only elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying PS function and dysfunction, but may provide novel therapeutic targets as well. In the current application, we will take advantage of the power of fly genetics to identify PS downstream targets and ?-secretase substrates involved in the regulation of neuronal survival and longevity. Specifically, we will generate conditional mutant flies, in which Presenilin ortholog (Psn) or Nicastrin ortholog (Nct) are inducibly knocked down by shRNA in adult neurons, and then use these mutant flies to screen for ?-secretase substrates involved in mediating neuronal survival and lifespan followed by validation in fly and mouse models (Aim 1). We will also perform whole-genome RNAi-based genetic screens in Drosophila primary cultured neurons to identify RNAi lines that can correct PS dysfunction, and then validate the identified genes in fly models for their abilities to restore PS dysfunction (Aim 2). Completion of the proposed studies will elucidate the molecular pathways by which PS protects neuronal survival during aging and may provide novel targets that can be further explored for disease-modifying therapy of AD."
"9246991","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) is considered a national priority, EBPs remain underutilized in mental health care settings. Quality therapist training programs are necessary to successfully bridge this science-practice gap, however, research has not yet discovered optimal methods to ensure sustainable EBP implementation. Evidence has demonstrated the presence of significant obstacles for the successful administration of implementation efforts, such as high clinician turnover rates (30-60%). These high turnover rates produce considerable costs to agencies and consumers, and threaten the long-term sustainability of EBPs. The prevalence and potency of staff turnover emphasize the need to understand and prevent workforce instability. A mixed method design will be utilized to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence clinicians to leave their agency or stay long-term. This study will provide  strong foundation for intervention research targeting workforce stabilization as a way to support the implementation of evidence-based interventions with the goal of improving client services and outcomes. Advancement of this knowledge will cost a small fraction of what we are paying to maintain a status quo that is costing significant loss in money, time, resources, and patient improvement.  The current study is unique in a number of ways: (1) to our knowledge, this study is the first to separate and examine factors related to turnover and factors related to long-term retention; (2) unlike the majority of research on this topic that use turnover intention as a proxy for turnover, our study will assess the factors associated with actual turnover; and (3) the proposed study is innovative in that it incorporates transdisciplinary collaboration and utilizes theories, empirical findings, and methods from the field of organizational behavior (OB). The unfolding model, from OB, offers a unique advantage to turnover research, because it focuses on the reasons people leave, which offers more direct links to turnover management strategies than traditional turnover models. Ultimately, this research aims to inform staff-retention strategies that can be consistently and systematically employed in community mental health settings to enhance workforce stability, support the implementation and delivery of EBPs, and improve services and outcomes for consumers. If strategies studied in this proposal are effective and feasible, these strategies can be included in other EBP implementation efforts and will have a substantial public health impact in the area of child and adolescent mental health."
"9223620","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite growing interest in cerebral small vessel diseases (SVD) such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), no effective disease-modifying treatment to prevent SVD- related vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) has been identified. We propose to use novel MRI-based analyses of subjects with advanced CAA to test the hypotheses that SVD-related neurologic dysfunction represents the sum of many pathologically heterogeneous, anatomically distributed, and often undetectably small lesions, and that the collective effect of these brain injuries is best measured at the larger scale of whole- brain structure and connectivity. Three complementary quantitative measures of large- scale cortical structure and connectivity will be evaluated: high-resolution T1 mapping of cortical gray and subcortical white matter tissue by multi-echo multi-flip angle FLASH sequences, structural connectivity by diffusion-tensor imaging-based network methods and functional connectivity by resting-state functional MRI methods. Specific experiments will analyze differences in these three measures between 60 non demented CAA subjects and 30 healthy elderly controls (SA1a), and within the 60 CAA subjects, the relationships of the three measures with each other (SA1b), with defined focal lesion types such as microbleeds, white matter hyperintensities, and foci of amyloid deposition on amyloid PET imaging (SA2), and with clinically meaningful cognitive and gait outcomes (SA3). Each analysis of CAA subjects will be performed globally in the brain as a whole, locally in individual brain regions, and longitudinally across time points, and each will control for accompanying Alzheimer Disease pathology by tau PET imaging. The proposed experiments build on the PI's ground-breaking success in establishing CAA as a disease that can be diagnosed and analyzed during life, his highly productive record of influential publications in the field (including 20 published/in-press original reports over the fist 3.5 years of the current funding cycle), and strong preliminary data supporting the feasibility and promise of the proposed neuroimaging methods. The impact of the proposed studies will be further leveraged by comparison to harmonized studies performed in a hereditary CAA cohort and a non-CAA sporadic SVD/VCI cohort and by extension of the in vivo results to separately proposed ex vivo imaging and histologic examination. Successful completion of these aims has very high potential for identifying biological mechanisms linking SVD to clinically meaningful neurologic dysfunction and directly translating to efficient clinical trials of candidate SVD treatments."
"9260791","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Proteomics Shared Resource provides state-of the-art biological mass spectrometry analyses to cancer researchers at NYU to help them identify and characterize proteins of medical importance. In many cases, it is only by studying proteins directly that one can achieve a useful understanding of the processes that underly the functioning of cells and tissues in normal and diseased states such as cancer. The shared resource has the capability to identify single, hundreds or even thousands of proteins in a single analysis, often at subfemtomole levels, by state of the art liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry followed by database searching or de novo sequence determination. In most cases the facility strives to obtain accurate information about the absolute and/or relative quantities of these proteins from cells under various conditions to obtain important information about the functioning of the proteins. The shared resource also has special expertise in characterizing posttranslational modifications of proteins such as phosphorylation, acylation, glycosylation and ubiquitination. In addition to its technical expertise, one of the strengths of the facility is its ability to advise clients in the design and interpretation of experiments so that useful data can be obtained and meaningful information can be had from these data. Reliance on cutting edge technology and its expert and dedicated staff allow these services to be performed in a cost effective manner. Indeed, many experiments by investigators at NYU and the NYU Cancer Institute (NYUCI) could not have been done without the assistance of the Shared Resource. The Resource also has established a Clinical Proteomics Core for the detection of protein and peptide biomarkers for the early detection of cancer."
"9249393","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young MSM, are more likely to contract HIV than White MSM. Research thus far has been unable to account for the mechanisms driving this racial disparity, as HIV research has largely targeted individual risk factors, but Black MSM consistently report comparable or fewer of these behaviors than other MSM. In addition, little research examining racial disparities acknowledges that substance use and other HIV risk behaviors are socially and spatially dependent; thus, differences in network and venue affiliation may shape the risk environments and behaviors of YMSM of different racial groups, and may be key in understanding differences in HIV. Emerging research with Black MSM documents racial differences in the network, venue, and neighborhood affiliations of YMSM. These findings suggest that although rates of drug use and other HIV risk behaviors may be lower among Black YMSM than other racial groups, their consequences may be different due to the nature of the risk environments experienced by these young men. The overall objective of this project is to contribute to knowledge about structural mechanisms (e.g., stigma and discrimination) that shape these risk environments, which in turn shape consequences of substance use and other HIV risk behaviors for young Black MSM. However, appropriately interpreting the empirical data describing these social and cultural contexts (i.e., the structure of social, sex, drug, venue, and neighborhood affiliation networks) i problematic without the incorporation of the voices, lived experiences, and knowledge of participants. Therefore, the innovative mixed methods approach proposed by this project will guide the interpretation of network-level structures captured within an existing NIH-funded cohort of YMSM. Three phases will occur in which network and geographic data is visualized (Phase 1) and used to guide interviews with YMSM, leading to a theory of mechanisms and functions in this population (Phase 2), which will be subsequently tested using multilevel modeling (Phase 3). The overall project has two aims: 1) identify how networks, venues, and neighborhoods operate as risk environments that shape the consequences of substance use and HIV risk behavior for YMSM of different racial groups, and 2) identify how structural mechanisms, such as stigma and discrimination, influence the networks, venue attendance, and neighborhood affiliations of YMSM of different racial groups."
"9318837","Project summary The long-term goal of this research program is to develop therapeutic strategies that improve the outcome of patients with disseminated melanoma. Melanoma is a highly metastatic tumor, with a propensity to disseminate to the skin, lungs and brain. In ~5% of cases, patients also develop leptomeningeal melanoma metastases (LMM: e.g. melanoma cell infiltration into the pia mater, the arachnoid membranes and cerebrospinal fluid) which have an even worse prognosis and a median survival of 8-10 weeks. It is likely that the leptomeninges represent ?sanctuary sites? for melanoma cells that evade both targeted and immune therapies. At this time, no therapeutic strategies have been identified that are effective against LMM. Melanomas are genetically heterogeneous, suggesting that distinct genetic clones/patterns of mutation determine which cells home to the brain and leptomeninges. Progress in this area has been limited due to the technical difficulties of obtaining specimens from the leptomeninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and sub-arachnoid space. Recently our group has begun the routine collection of CSF from patients with LMM, which we have shown to contain circulating melanoma cells (circulating tumor cells: CTCs). We have also established protocols to obtain serial CSF samples from patients undergoing off-label treatment BRAF-MEK inhibitor treatment for LMM. Methods for the isolation and amplification of RNA and DNA from single cells have become available and are ideally suited for analyzing rare populations of cells, such as those found in the CSF. The overarching goal of this R21 is to define the genetic and transcriptional profiles of the CTCs from patients with LMM and to identify novel therapeutic targets for these tumors. We will use the Fluidigm C1 platform to perform sophisticated single cell RNA and DNA analysis to define the clonal relationship between LMM CTCs and matched melanoma specimens from other sites. We will then collect serial CSF specimens from LMM patients undergoing treatment with targeted therapy and will determine how treatment drives clonal selection. Validation experiments will be performed in which BRAF-mutant LMM cells are orthotopically implanted into the leptomeninges of mice and treated with personalized drug combinations based upon dabrafenib-trametinib and drugs targeted against the actionable mutations/pathways that we identify. These studies are expected to provide critical new insights into the biology of brain and leptomeningeal melanoma metastases and form the groundwork for the development of clinically relevant drug combinations."
"9273877","PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal requests funds that will be used in combination with funds provided by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR) to purchase an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (MS) to empower the research projects of biomedical research investigators at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine, including those also affiliated with the San Diego Branch of the LICR. The requested Orbitrap Fusion MS has greatly improved technical capabilities in throughput, accuracy and sensitivity, thus providing a major upgrade from the existing and ageing mass spectrometers that have been supporting proteomics research at UCSD and the LICR for the past fourteen years. The Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS is an indispensible tool for cutting edge proteomics research, and currently, there is no such instrument on the UCSD campus.  Our user group consists of both basic and clinical scientists working on a wide range of projects in (a) cancer genetics, DNA repair and genome instability (Kolodner, Zhou and Putnam), (b) aneuploidy and birth defects (Corbett, Desai and Hollingsworth), (c) glioblastoma and drug resistance mechanisms in cancer (Furnari and Mischel), (d) cancer biology (Wang, Fu, Guan and Field), (d) genomics and chromatin organization (Ren) and (e) neurodegeneration (Cleveland). All of the user projects involve characterization of protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein associations as well as various post- translational protein modifications in both normal and diseased tissues and cells. The application of quantitative proteomics implemented with the proposed Orbitrap Fusion MS is essential to the success of the research projects presented in this application. The proposed Orbitrap Fusion MS, with its superior technical capabilities, will allow us to investigate physiological and pathological processes with improved precision and to generate new insights relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases."
"9380028","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regulatory T cells (Tregs) specified by the Forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 are important to suppress unwanted inflammatory responses in order to maintain immune homeostasis. The gut represents a specific microenvironment for Treg-mediated immune tolerance due to large amounts of antigens derived from food or microbiota, and proinflammatory cytokines produced by various immune cells. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) is an environmental sensor that detects not only xenobiotic ligands such as environmental pollutants (e.g., dioxin) but also physiological compounds generated by host cells, microbiota, and/or diet (e.g., amino acid tryptophan metabolites). The goal of the proposal is to understand the molecular regulation of Tregs by Ahr, a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Our preliminary data suggest that Ahr-expressing Tregs were preferentially enriched in the gut. Using an RNA-Seq approach, we showed that multiple genes that have been previously implicated in Treg cell development, maintenance, and function were perturbed by Ahr deficiency in Tregs. Using a T cell transfer model of colitis, we further showed that Tregs lacking expression of Ahr could not suppress disease in vivo. Using a combination of biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches, in the proposal we will test the hypothesis that Ahr expression in Tregs plays a key role in gut immune homeostasis by regulating Treg cell development, maintenance, and/or function. Specifically, we will determine 1) the mechanism(s) underlying the enrichment of Ahr-expressing Tregs in the gut under the steady state; 2) the molecular mechanism(s) by which Ahr regulates expression of the genes involved in Treg development and maintenance; and 3) the in vivo role of Ahr in Tregs during gut inflammation and infection. These experiments will offer an opportunity to elucidate environmental impacts on immune tolerance via the Ahr-mediated pathway. Our study will provide novel cellular and molecular insights into the development and function of Tregs regulated by Ahr in a tissue- and cell-specific manner. Since Ahr is a ligand-dependent transcription factor and its activity can be modulated by small molecules, better understanding of the role of Ahr in Tregs may lead to development of novel therapeutic approaches by modulating Ahr expression and/or function in Tregs to treat autoimmunity and inflammation."
"9392226","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the competitive renewal of a T32 training program, the Research Training Fellowship in Substance Abuse Program (RTFSA-P), which has been in existence since 1998. Despite recent advances in understanding the neurobiology of addiction, there is a persistent gap in the application of knowledge gained from basic science studies to clinical practice in the field of addiction. A new generation of behavioral, psychopharmacology, neuroimaging, molecular genetics and molecular neuroscience studies has broad clinical implications and these studies bring the potential to bridge the gap between basic and clinical research. Despite the quality of the available science, actual progress in bridging this gap depends also upon the availability of appropriately trained young scientists. This purpose of the RTFSA-P is to meet this need by providing post-doctoral training for a total of 4 physicians or PhDs interested in careers in translational or intervention research in the fiel of substance abuse. The proposed RTFSA-P is a two-year program in the Division of Substance Abuse (DSA), Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, and will afford post-doctoral trainees the opportunity to devote virtually full-time effort during the initial phas of their careers to developing the skills and experience needed to become independent researchers in the field of clinical or translational research in substance use disorders. The DSA is an ongoing, stable substance abuse research program that now encompasses over 98 major funded projects including 5 Centers (and another one that is currently undergoing competitive renewal) covering a broad scope of topics and research methodologies. This facilitates research that moves rapidly and in both directions from preclinical projects (bench) to clinical studies (bedside and community). Applicants will be MD's or PhD post-doctoral candidates trained in specialties that include psychiatry, internal medicine, clinical psychology or neuroscience.

The training facilities include the major institutions affiliated with Yale School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry. At the conclusion of training, applicants will be well suited for independent careers in translational or intervention research in  the field of addiction."
"9240231","Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the US. Medical imaging is integral to the diagnosis and management of CAD fueling the development of new technologies and applications. However, imaging of the heart continues to be a challenging task. There is always a degree of temporal blur or motion artifact, the impact and documented limitations of which remain uncertain. Additionally, patient body habitus and technical limitations may contribute to high noise and degrade spatial resolution. For imaging modalities involving ionizing radiation like CT, radiation dose is also an ever-present reality that needs to be minimized without compromising image quality. Clinical trials are the best avenue for the evaluation of imaging technologies, but the ever-expanding number of technologies and parameters make a trial for every application or protocol unfeasible, pragmatically and financially. As a result, medical imaging researchers, industry, and the FDA are increasingly moving toward computerized simulations or `virtual trials'. Virtual trials involve the use of computational tools to perform experiments entirely on the computer. Realistic patient models or phantoms are combined with validated imaging simulations to emulate imaging examinations and patient conditions. These can subsequently be used to ascertain how differing patient attributes and imaging conditions impact dose, image quality, and depiction of pre-defined known conditions. The findings can be used to prescribe specific imaging protocols and optimal scan parameters that are customized to individual patient anatomy to provide a sufficient degree of certainty for effective clinical decision-making. The goal of this project is to develop, validate, and distribute to the research community a computational platform (including a series of anatomically variable phantoms with realistic finite-element cardiac models, accurate models for modern imaging devices, and a suite of image quality metrics) to perform virtual trials in dynamic cardiac imaging. The virtual framework can be extended to any number of cardiac conditions, imaging modalities, and technologies. As a first case study in our long-term strategy, the focus of this project is on CT as it has both a great need for and great potential to provide high spatial and temporal resolution for the optimized evaluation of CAD. If CT image quality is not optimal, the evaluation of CAD, particularly the degree of stenosis and characterization of high-risk plaque features, may be compromised. The tools we develop will provide the first practical platform to characterize the precise impact of the technical aspects of CT on image quality over a wide range of patient anatomies with the view to enable optimal visualization of cardiac conditions at the lowest possible radiation dose for a given patient. The approach has great potential to significantly improve clinical investigations of heart disease, extending beyond CT imaging and CAD, paving the way towards faster translation of new cardiac imaging technologies into the clinic and more precise and personalized patient management."
"9222686","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to form associative memories is one of the most important functions of an organism's nervous system. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying learning and associative memory formation have yet to be fully elucidated. Identifying molecules involved in these processes is important not only to gain an understanding of normal brain function, but can also lead to an understanding of disease states such as age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. We will use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has a simple nervous system and its genes have conserved functions in higher organisms, to identify molecules that are most essential for learning and memory. We will identify these molecules combining two techniques developed in our lab, a novel long-term associative memory (LTAM) assay and RNA-seq of individual populations and compartments of neurons. In Aim 1, we will identify postsynaptic molecules that are involved in regulation of LTAM by labeling postsynapses with a translational RFP fusion of a scaffolding protein important for learning and memory, MAGI-1. After LTAM training, MAGI-1:RFP worms will be lysed and subjected to FACS in order to isolate fluorescent postsynaptic compartments. RNA will be purified from the neurons and subjected to RNA-seq. We will then determine the profile of postsynaptic genes induced by memory training. In Aim 2 we will characterize mRNAs identified in Aim 1. In Aim 2a we will use utilize RNAi and deletion strains to identify novel and conserved postsynaptic regulators of learning and memory. In Aim 2b, we will determine which mRNAs of interest may be locally translated by utilizing single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization. Bioinformatic analysis of these RNAs will also reveal potential RNA binding proteins that regulate LTAM. In Aim 2c, we will determine if the protein products of mRNAs identified in Aims 2a and 2b are also synaptically localized. This will allow us to identify novel proteins that are located in the postsynaptic density and may regulate synaptic remodeling during learning and memory. In Aim 3, we will determine if aging causes defects in the postsynaptic processes involved in LTAM, including transcriptional reprogramming, local translation, and postsynaptic remodeling. We will accomplish this by repeating the experiments in Aim 1 and 2 in aged worms, to identify molecules that contribute to age-related cognitive decline."
"9417404","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are a leading cause of disability, afflicting 5-10% of individuals worldwide with no existing cure. Fear generalization, in which conditioned fear responses occur in an altered, unconditioned context, is a primary symptom in many anxiety disorders such as phobia, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients and animal models of PTSD consistently show altered activity in brain circuits such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, but precise circuit mechanisms and their causal role in fear generalization remain largely unclear. Furthermore, very little is known about the genetic factors that predispose individuals to PTSD. We have already shown that increased activity in the PFC to hippocampus circuits is sufficient to cause fear memory retrieval in an unconditioned context (fear memory generalization). Here, I propose to further dissect the role of circuit and genetic mechanisms of fear generalization behavior. The central hypothesis of this study is that dissection of the PFC to hippocampus circuit, as well as local hippocampal circuit dynamics, in genetic mouse models of fear generalization will provide significant insight into brain mechanisms of PTSD. Aim 1 and 2 will be focused on the generation of accurate and reproducible mouse models of fear generalization, which will then be used in Aim 3 to determine whether the local hippocampal network dynamics have ensemble features that are associated with increased fear generalization behavior. This project will yield novel insights regarding the important circuit level mechanisms of PTSD, while in the future, providing potential circuit-level handles for manipulation of neural activity toward therapeutic value."
"9326453","PROJECT SUMMARY  Defects in DNA damage response and DNA repair are the driving forces of genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Gaining a better understanding of the pathways involved in DNA repair not only increases our understanding of cancer etiology, but also provides new targets for cancer therapies. A key protein involved in DNA repair and tumorigenesis is p53-binding protein 1, i.e. 53BP1.  My laboratory has been working on 53BP1 for many years. Our group was one of the first to demonstrate the role of 53BP1 in DNA damage response. We established the first 53bp1 knockout (KO) mice; we also revealed that 53BP1 is required for DNA repair and acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo. In addition, we elucidated the regulation of 53BP1 after DNA damage. We and others demonstrated that the H2AX-dependent DNA damage signaling pathway controls the recruitment and accumulation of 53BP1 at sites of DNA breaks. However, 53BP1 can also localize to DNA damage sites in an H2AX-independent manner, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. Moreover, we showed that 53BP1 is critical for a particular repair process called class-switch recombination, indicating that 53BP1 is involved in a special DNA repair pathway that is distinctly different from the canonical nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Our recent studies and those of others suggest that 53BP1 suppresses homologous recombination repair in BRCA1-deficient cells, which is critically important for response to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor-based cancer therapies. Together, these data highlight the importance of 53BP1 in counteracting homologous recombination repair in response to DNA damage. In this proposal, we plan to focus on 53BP1 and elucidate at the molecular level how 53BP1 is regulated after DNA damage and contributes to DNA repair and genome maintenance.  To further understand the regulation of 53BP1 localization and function at DNA damage sites, we recently performed tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry analysis to identify proteins that would specifically associate with a region of 53BP1, which is necessary and sufficient for its localization to DNA damage sites. Surprisingly, we uncovered several novel 53BP1-binding proteins, including NUDT16, NUDT16L1, and DEK. In this proposal, we will 1) further determine the roles of NUDT16L1 and NUDT16 in 53BP1 regulation and in the DNA damage response, and 2) elucidate the functional significance of DEK and other newly discovered 53BP1-associated proteins in damage-induced 53BP1 localization, DNA repair, and the maintenance of genomic integrity. These studies will help us understand the key components that act upstream of 53BP1 and function together with 53BP1 in DNA repair and genome maintenance."
"9288414","Virtually all patients with Down Syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer?s disease (AD)-like neuropathologies including Amyloid-? (A?) neuritic plaques, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. While the extra copy of A? Precursor Protein (APP) on chromosome 21 is thought to play a major role in the development of this type of pathology in DS, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these changes and their precise contribution to neurodegeneration and dementia have remained largely elusive. Compelling evidence supports the hypothesis that the subcellular localization and trafficking of APP via the vacuolar protein sorting complex is of critical importance for A? production in vivo. However, no data are available on the role that the system plays in the AD-like DS pathogenesis. In our preliminary studies, we found that the vacuolar protein sorting-associated 35 (Vps35), a major component of the retromer complex recognition core, directly modulates APP metabolism and governs its trafficking. Vps35 is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system, and its knock-out in mice results in neuropathologies resembling those found in AD and DS patients. In other preliminary studies we found that compared with controls, DS brains have a significant reduction in Vps35 levels, which is also evident in brains from a transgenic mouse model of DS, Ts65Dn mice. We hypothesize that Vps35 down-regulation in DS is responsible for the development of the AD-like phenotype in these subjects and represents a novel therapeutic target for neurodegeneration and dementia. In this proposal, we will assess the temporal relationship between dysregulation of Vps35 in the brains of DS patients and the development of the AD-like neuropathology. We will then investigate whether a pharmacological chaperone by increasing Vps35 levels in the central nervous system of a relevant DS transgenic mouse model will produce neuroprotective effects. Finally, we will determine whether increase brain Vps35 expression level will protect against the neuropathology and cognitive decline that occur in the same mouse model. The results of our proposed studies will elucidate the functional role that Vps35 plays in neurodegeneration providing novel molecular mechanisms for disease pathogenesis/pathology and most importantly new therapeutic opportunities for delaying and/or treating the AD-like phenotype of DS."
"9247224","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) covalently link the Watson and Crick strands of DNA and are extremely cytotoxic. Widely used chemotherapeutics (e.g. nitrogen mustards, cisplatin compounds, mitomycin C) are thought to act through the generation of ICLs. However, tumors almost invariably become resistant to these agents, in part due to upregulation of DNA repair. Importantly, ICLs are also generated by endogenous metabolites (e.g. reactive aldehydes, abasic sites), and failure to repair endogenous ICLs appears to cause human disease. For example, mutation in FANC genes renders cells sensitive to ICLs and causes Fanconi anemia, which is characterized by bone marrow failure and dramatically elevated predisposition to leukemia and other cancers. In addition, mutations in the FAN1 nuclease cause kidney disease. Why two classes of mutations, both of which disrupt ICL repair, cause such different diseases is unknown. To answer this question, it will be critical to understand the molecular functions of the FANC and FAN1 proteins in ICL repair. We have discovered that Xenopus frog egg extracts recapitulate three distinct forms of ICL repair. We previously showed that egg extracts recapitulate replication-coupled ICL repair that depends on the FANC proteins, and we used this approach to show that the FANC proteins lead to DNA incisions that cut-out or unhook the ICL from DNA. In unpublished results, we discovered a second, replication-dependent ICL repair reaction that is however independent of the FANC proteins. In other unpublished results, we recapitulated a third, replication-independent ICL repair reaction that requires the nucleases FAN1 and SNM1A. We hypothesize that the two replication-dependent pathways represent alternative means of repairing ICLs in proliferating tissues, whereas the third pathway is critical in non-proliferating cells. In this proposal, we wil use the power of Xenopus egg extracts to elucidate how ICLs are resolved in the FANC-dependent ICL repair pathway (Aim 1). We will also investigate the mechanism of the FANC-independent ICL repair pathway and determine which of the two replication-dependent pathways are utilized to repair a variety of exogenous and endogenous ICLs (Aim 2). Finally, we will elucidate the roles of FAN1 and SNM1A in replication-independent ICL repair, and we will address whether they perform similar functions in mammalian cells (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of three distinct ICL repair pathways and explore when they are utilized. The potential impact of the work for human health and cancer biology is significant. Small molecule inhibition of factors that promote the novel, FANC-independent ICL repair pathway might re-sensitize FANC-deficient tumors that became resistant to ICLs. Conversely, stimulation of this pathway may have therapeutic benefits for Fanconi anemia patients who are deficient in FANC-dependent ICL repair."

"9204391","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Gabriela Schmajuk, a rheumatologist and health services research at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC). Combined with a training plan focused on advanced biostatistical methods, qualitative techniques, and health policy, the goal of the current study is to use rich administrative and electronic health record data to develop a rational approach to drug toxicity monitoring using methotrexate, the first-line treatment for patients with inflammatory arthritis, as a model drug. Building upon her prior work which evaluated quality measures and patient safety in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (JAMA 2011;305(5):480; Semin Arthritis Rheum 2011;40(6):559), the proposed series of projects will provide a framework to characterize the outcomes of current drug toxicity monitoring practices (including unintended harms) and individualize monitoring strategies that will improve patient outcomes and reduce health resource overuse. Although the National Quality Forum (NQF) recently endorsed several quality measures that address laboratory toxicity monitoring for outpatient drugs used in chronic rheumatic conditions, it is not known whether frequent toxicity monitoring in the absence of patient-reported symptoms leads to improved patient outcomes. On the contrary, stopping a drug due to benign or transient laboratory abnormalities can result in diagnostic and treatment interventions that are inappropriate, burdensome, and expensive. In the case of methotrexate, new NQF measures require testing of liver function tests (LFTs) every 12 weeks with the intent of reducing the incidence of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. But frequent, untargeted monitoring, and the detection of potentially clinically insignificant LFT elevations, may have unintended consequences. For example, patients may have increased pain or disability if methotrexate is unnecessarily stopped, increased costs if they are switched to high-priced biologic agents, or increased harm if methotrexate is substituted by glucocorticoids, which have more long-term toxicities. The uncertainty around the effects of frequent, untargeted toxicity monitoring represents a critical gap in knowledge that hinders efforts to improve patient safety, reduce unintended harms, and maximize the quality of care for patients with rheumatic diseases. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will leverage administrative and clinical data from the Veterans Affairs system to (1) assess current practice patterns and downstream consequences of liver toxicity monitoring among methotrexate users with inflammatory arthritis and (2) develop and validate a prediction rule that identifies patients at low risk of developing LFTx > 2 x the upper limit of normal and thus may be candidates for less frequent monitoring. Aim 3 will convene focus groups of a diverse group of patients and clinicians to determine attitudes and identify barriers around using a potentially less intensive monitoring schedule for selected low- risk patients. The knowledge gained here will inform the next iteration of patient safety measures in this area, potentially reducing unnecessary testing while promoting screening that is effective. In addition, it will provide preliminary data for a R01 that will implement and test the value of a clinical decision support tool to guide medication toxicity monitoring for methotrexate users. The paradigm developed here can serve as a model for studying monitoring in other common clinical scenarios (for example, for users of anti-hypertensives, statins, or antidiabetic agents) where drug toxicity monitoring plays a key role in medication choice and disease management. Dr. Schmajuk has assembled an exceptional mentorship team with expertise in issues of medication monitoring, quality of care, and rheumatic diseases, as well as experience in using national VA data to address these questions. She will have access to a rich research environment, including the UCSF Arthritis Research Group and the San Francisco VA Geriatrics division, with their respective work-in-progress seminars, biostatisticians, and large faculties with similar research interests to mine. The resources of the SFVAMC and our academic affiliate will provide me with training opportunities, including a second year of VA Quality Scholars Fellowship and enrollment in the UCSF Training in Implementation and Dissemination Sciences Program. Dr. Schmajuk's long term goal is to become a rheumatologist at a leading academic institution where she can pursue an independent research career in health services research. Her research agenda will address the questions of quality of care, drug utilization, and drug safety for patients with rheumatic diseases. This mentored career development award will provide the skills, mentorship, and experience necessary to propel her to independence."

"9229053","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While elective total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty relieve pain and improve mobility function for thousands with end-stage osteoarthritis (OA), up to 35% endure persistent muscle atrophy and mobility limitations for several years that impact life quality, increase morbidity, and burden the healthcare system. Given that THA/TKA volumes are increasing exponentially with >1.1 million in the US annually, refractory mobility impairment is a major public health problem. Together, the available data raise two important knowledge gaps in THA/TKA rehabilitation: (i) poorly understood factors that limit responsiveness of a large number of patients to current usual care; and (ii) the absence of rehabilitation programs proven to overcome these limitations. The proposed project is designed to fill these gaps. Our fundamental tenet is that restoration of mobility function following THA/TKA requires: (i) regeneration of surgically damaged muscle; and (ii) regrowth of muscles that have atrophied over years of OA and limited usage. We suggest a major cause of muscle regeneration impairment in some individuals is what we identified as muscle inflammation susceptibility (MuIS) - hyperactive inflammatory signaling in muscle of MuIS(+) individuals despite no systemic inflammation - which also manifests in isolated primary satellite cells and inhibits myogenesis in vitro, indicative of a true cellular phenotype beyond the niche. Our preliminary findings in THA/TKA patients strongly suggest the TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) signaling pathway may be central to MuIS and impaired THA/TKA recovery, as high perioperative muscle TWEAK signaling in the ipsilateral thigh was the most sensitive indicator of impaired muscle protein synthesis and failed strength recovery after 8 wk of usual care. Progressive resistance exercise training (PRT) is a putative anabolic intervention that we find consistently increases muscle mass to meet healthy standards in atrophied and mobility-impaired adults, by activating muscle protein synthesis and the myogenic activity of muscle satellite cells. Together, these findings raise the central hypothesis that PRT plus adjunctive functional mobility training (PRT+FM) after THA/TKA will more effectively restore muscle mass and mobility function to healthy standards than usual care and, because MuIS(+) are predicted to suffer failed muscle recovery and persistent dismobility under usual care, the impact of PRT+FM will be greatest in MuIS(+). We will thoroughly test this hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial of 88 THA/TKA patients with the following aims. Aim 1: To determine the effects of 16 wk of PRT+FM vs. usual care after elective THA/TKA on muscle mass, performance, and mobility function. Aim 2: To determine whether MuIS status modifies the effects of PRT+FM or usual care after THA/TKA. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of muscle mass regulation will be studied in detail. Aim 3. To determine the long-term impact of 16 wk PRT+FM by re-assessing outcomes at 6 mo and 1 y. We fully expect the novel findings to lead a paradigm shift in THA/TKA rehabilitation that will have a profound impact on a growing segment of the population."
"9217540","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysregulation of glutamate receptors (GluRs) has been observed in various neurodegerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down Syndrome (DS). However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the changes in GluRs and the contribution of GluR dysregulation to neurodegeneration have remained largely elusive. In our preliminary studies, we found that the Sorting Nexin 27 (SNX27) protein can interact with GluRs and govern their trafficking to the plasma membrane for recycling. SNX27 is abundantly expressed in the brain and SNX27 homozygous knockout (KO) mice exhibit severe neuropathologies resembling those found in AD and DS patients. SNX27 heterozygous KO mice have memory deficits and their neurons have reduced GluR levels and synaptic dysfunction. DS is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 which results in over- dosage of the genes on this chromosome. We found that in DS patient brains, a microRNA gene on chromosome 21, miR-155, which negatively regulates the transcription factor C/EBP?, was upregulated, accompanied by a concomitant reduction of C/EBP? and SNX27. We also show that C/EBP? positively regulates SNX27 expression. These  results  reveal  a  miR-155/C/EBP?/SNX27  pathway  that  leads  to  GluR  dysregulation and synaptic dysfunction in DS. Since late stage DS patients develop AD-like pathologies and cognitive deficits, we studied the effect of SNX27 on the generation of ?-amyloid (A?), which is the primary culprit in AD pathogenesis and is derived from ?-amyloid precursor protein through sequential cleavages by ?- and ?-secretases. We found that overexpression of SNX27 reduces A? production and the level and activity of ?-secretase as well. Therefore, we hypothesize that SNX27 plays an important role in regulating GluRs and thus synaptic function, and that SNX27 deficiency may contribute to neurodegeneration in DS and AD. In  this  proposal, we  will  further  ascertain  the participation  of  SNX27  in  DS  by: (1)  corroborating  the  regulation of GluRs by SNX27 and its modulators (miR155 and C/EBP?) in primary neurons~ (2) using virus  systems to modulate miR155, C/EBP?, and SNX27 levels in SNX27 deficient mice and Ts65Dn mice, and  study whether the impaired phenotypes in these mice can be ameliorated~ and (3) generating brain-specific  SNX27 transgenic (Tg) mice and crossing them with Ts65Dn mice to study  any  amelioration  of pathology  through SNX27 overexpression. Moreover, we will explore the role of SNX27 in AD. We will: (1) modulate the levels of SNX27 and determine whether and how ?-secretase level/trafficking/activity and APP processing/A? generation are affected~ (2) study whether SNX27 is affected by and involved in A?-mediated neurotoxicity and examine any changes in SNX27 in AD brains~ and (3) cross SNX27 Tg mice with Tg2576 AD mice and attempt to rescue impaired phenotypes in AD mice. These results will elucidate the role of SNX27 in regulating GluRs and synaptic functions in DS and AD, providing novel molecular mechanisms for disease pathogenesis/pathology."
"9391836","Abstract Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the U.S. Each year approximately 30% of smokers try to quit, with the vast majority of attempts (~90%) ending in relapse. This is complicated by treatment barriers related to cost and accessibility. Identifying cost effective ways to aide in cessation success, which can be widely disseminated, remains vitally important. According to the dual-process model of substance use, addiction develops via an imbalance between effortful control and automatic psychological processes. The affective processing model suggests that during withdrawal, automatic psychological processes increase implicit drug seeking motivation. Implicit motivation is hypothesized as the underlying mechanism through which automatic psychological processes exert control over behavior. Research suggests that behavioral impulse control may attenuate the association between implicit motivation and substance use. Response inhibition, one form of behavioral impulse control, is the ability to inhibit behavioral responses to salient approach cues. Smokers tend to have less behavioral impulse control. In addition, poor behavioral impulse control makes individuals more vulnerable to various risk factors associated with relapse (e.g., positive expectancies, higher craving during abstinence, etc.). Improving smoking relevant behavioral impulse control may affect multiple indices of relapse. Research in cognitive retraining has shown that response inhibition can be modified through training. Recently this has been extended to training using mobile devices. The development of mobile interventions which specifically target underlying mechanisms of addiction may provide a novel adjunct to current cessation programs. The current proposal builds on previous research by implementing a response inhibition training paradigm in the context of a cessation trial. It is hypothesized that this task will reduce the likelihood of relapse following a quit attempt. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that training effects will operate via decreases in implicit motivation and global craving. If successful, the current study will provide evidence for a relapse prevention tool that can (1) increase overall cessation success and (2) be widely and easily dispersed."

To accommodate the breadth of neurochemistry as well as cellular and molecular neurobiology and to provide in depth analyses of particular topics, the ASN continues to build its scientific program around four interwoven, but distinct, themes. These themes have been selected to increase our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of neural development and disease. These four themes are: 1) Building the Nervous System/Neurodevelopment, 2) Cellular Metabolism and Neurotransmission/Cognition, 3) Glial Function in Health and Disease, and 4) Neurodegeneration. Four Plenary/Presidential speakers have accepted our invitation to participate in the 48th ASN meeting, each one addressing one of the four themes. The ASN is strongly committed to the representation of women and racial/ethnic minorities at its meetings. In this regard, two of the four Plenary/Presidential speakers are female, 44% of the Plenary Session Speakers and 34% of the Chairs/Co-Chairs of Symposia and Colloquia are female, and 5% of the Chairs/Co-Chairs/Plenary Session Speakers are from racial/ethnic minorities. The ASN meeting provides numerous opportunities for delegates to exchange ideas and to form new collaborations because total attendance is approximately 500, and there are numerous opportunities incorporated in our program for delegates to congregate informally. The Society also has several mechanisms to enhance the professional development of junior investigators during the meeting. We organize meetings with the Plenary/Presidential speakers, which gives attendees a chance to discuss topics directly with the speakers. The fees for these meetings are reduced for students and postdoctoral fellows. There is a social mingle, including an educational component, exclusively for students and postdoctoral fellows, which is repeatedly recognized as an outstanding opportunity to network. There is a function entitled ?Women in Neurochemistry? that is open to all attendees, and junior investigators have reduced fees. There are Oral Sessions, which are selected from abstracts submitted, with an emphasis on choosing presentations from graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. There are travel awards for outstanding graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior researchers from Latin America to defray their costs of attendance. We host a job-posting site and students can meet with potential future mentors or colleagues during the meeting. In 2010, we added a half-day program for visiting high-school students to engage these future scientists during their formative years. From results of yearly exit surveys, we know that the annual ASN meeting has and will continue to provide an excellent venue for cutting edge neurochemistry and neurobiology, and for enhancing the careers of young investigators."

Mentors are faculty with actively funded alcohol research projects and matching of trainees with mentors is by mutual consent. The NIAAA training program has been successful in placing trainees in highly-productive postdoctoral and faculty-level positions through which they continue to contribute to alcohol research."
"9212552","ABSTRACT Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a complex disorder associated with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Unlike systemic hypertension, PH is difficult to detect in routine physical examinations and the current gold standard for diagnosing PH is through invasive right heart catheterization. Unlike in systemic hypertension, for which patients have effective pharmacological management of blood pressure for decades, PH prognosis remains poor with 15% mortality within 1 year on modern therapy. Challenges in early detection of PH, as well as structural differences in the cardio-pulmonary system (e.g., thinner ventricular wall, more distributed compliance and larger number of peripheral vessels) may explain the stark differences in clinical outcomes between systemic hypertension and PH. Our current understanding of PH has largely been obtained through animal models, clinical studies and computational modeling. However, surgical banding or chronic hypoxia animal models do not fully reproduce the etiology of human PH. Invasive clinical measurements of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), stiffness and ventricular elastance provide limited insight into disease progression. Computational models have been developed to study growth and remodeling (G&R) in the ventricles and hemodynamics in PH. However, these models are incomplete: ventricular G&R models lack coupling with evolving pulmonary hemodynamics, whereas pulmonary hemodynamic models have not included ventricular-arterial coupling. Given that the interactions between RV and the pulmonary vasculature are a key determinant of the clinical course of PH, specifically, the transition from compensated to decompensated remodeling, we submit that there is a pressing need to develop a multi-scale (MS) computational model that can couple the short term (e.g. hemodynamics) and long-term G&R interactions between the RV and the pulmonary circulation. In this project, we propose to develop a multi-scale, multi-physics computational model of the cardio-pulmonary circulation and calibrate it using longitudinal data acquired on cohorts of pediatric pulmonary hypertension and control (e.g., cardiac transplant) subjects. The model will be the first of its kind because it will be able to describe the bi-directional interactions between evolving ventricular and vascular biomechanics and hemodynamics using human pulmonary hypertension data."
"9258771","Project Summary  Cardiac sarcomeres represent the basic units of contraction driving the beating of the heart. At their core, cardiac sarcomeres are composed of stacks of beta cardiac myosin II (? CMII) which hydrolyze ATP to generate force by pulling on actin filaments. Mutations in ? CMII account for ~40% of all cases of inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM can lead to arrhythmias, debilitating lifestyle, heart failure, and is the leading cause of death among young adults and athletes. A postmortem hallmark of HCM is sarcomere disarray. Despite their importance, how cardiac sarcomeres are formed and maintained in healthy individuals, and how this is perturbed in disease states is not understood. The lack of a mechanistic understanding of sarcomere formation precludes effective treatment and therapeutics for diseases which affect sarcomere organization, such as HCM. Highlighting this, there are currently no FDA approved drugs that specifically treat HCM.  Our lab has recently leveraged super-resolution microscopy to show how non-muscle myosin II (NMII) based contractile systems assemble into large ensembles which resemble cardiac sarcomeres in structure and function (i.e., to generate force). Referred to as NMII stacks, these large ensembles formed via two non- mutually exclusive mechanisms. 1.) NMII stacks grew from an expansion of single NMII filaments via a series of distinct structural steps, and 2.) via concatenation of multiple filaments (i.e., multiple NMII filaments ?running into? each other). Due to their structural and functional similarities, I hypothesize that the mechanisms underlying NMII stack formation are conserved in ? CMII filaments during sarcomere formation.  Expanding upon our previous work in ?non-muscle? contractile systems, this project will leverage recent advances in human stem cell technology and super-resolution microscopy techniques to elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac sarcomere formation. Specifically, we will test how ? CMII filaments assemble into larger ? CMII stacks found at the core of sarcomere structures. Our lab has recently developed a live-cell imaging approach which allows us to observe sarcomere formation in live cells. Fluorescently tagged ? CMII will be used in conjunction with this assay to determine if ? CMII stacks form via similar mechanisms as NMIIA stacks. We will also utilize genetic mutants to test if mutations in ? CMII which lead to HCM affect sarcomere formation and/or maintenance. Having established a model of sarcomere formation, we will test the requirement of NMII isoforms during sarcomere formation, as mice lacking NMIIB fail to develop organized sarcomeres, and NMII isoforms are found in ?nascent? sarcomere structures. Together, these experiments will elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac sarcomere formation, and how this is perturbed in disease states which lead to HCM."

"9264448","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):In line with the stated goals of PA-14-047, midcareer investigator award in patient oriented research (parent K24), the goals of this application are to allow me to devote more time to augment my capabilities in Patient- Oriented Research (POR), with a focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers for use in AD risk factor and prevention research, and to provide mentoring to junior clinical investigators in the conduct of POR, with a focus on research in AD risk factors and prevention. Many studies have shown associations of diabetes with AD. However, whether diabetes causes AD neuropathology remains unclear. In order to answer this question I will begin a new R01 award (Diabetes Status and Brain Amyloid in Middle Aged Hispanics; 1R01AG050440- 01A1; 09/01/15-08/31/20) that will be funded shortly after the submission of this K24 application. This 5-year R01 project will conduct Amyloid ? (A?) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 18F-Florbetaben in 150 late middle-aged persons in order to examine in-vivo the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of diabetes status and glycemia with AD. I propose to complement the new R01 by adding plasma-based biomarkers, lipidomics, and by piloting Tau imaging to further the study of mechanisms linking diabetes to AD. The new R01 and the proposed K24 research project will be integrated with the proposed mentoring and raining program. The primary research aim of this award is to examine the association of soluble receptor of advanced glycosylation end-product (sRAGE) with plasma and brain cortical fibrillar Amyloid ? (A?). I will also examine whether these associations mediate the association of glycemia (examined continuously with HbA1c) and diabetes status (Normal glucose tolerance [NGT], pre-diabetes, diabetes), with brain A?. The secondary research aims are to explore the plasma lipidomic profile predictive of brain A? and whether this profile mediates the association of glycemia and diabetes status with brain A?, and to conduct a pilot study of tau imaging using 18F-THK-5351 PET comparing persons with NGT (n=5) and diabetes (n=5) to demonstrate feasibility in preparation for an independent grant application. The mentoring aims of the application are: 1) To train early investigators on POR in the cognitive complications of diabetes and related conditions, the potential mechanisms linking these conditions to AD, and methods to study these associations; 2) Mentees will have access to the training resources of the applicant related to lipidomics; 3) Early investigators will learn about the importance of tau as an AD mechanism, methods to ascertain it, and will have access to the training resources of the application. The training aims of the application are: 1) To trainin the potential application of blood based AD biomarkers to research in AD risk factors and prevention, with an initial focus on diabetes and related conditions; 2) To acquire new knowledge in lipidomics and how it can be applied to the study of risk factors for AD and its prevention and treatment (I will also seek training in genomics and proteonomics); 3) to learn the application of Tau imaging to research in risk factors for AD."
"9372337","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Children with severe burns manifest a catabolic state up to two years after burn. This catabolic state results in significant muscle wasting, weakness, immunosuppression, chronic bone loss, decreased growth, and concurs- rent increases in metabolic, hemodynamic, inflammatory, and scarring responses. In burned children, exercise training improves lean body mass (LBM), muscle strength, and cardiovascular endurance, though it does not restore these parameters to levels seen in healthy children. Similar improvements have been reported in burned children receiving oxandrolone, an oral synthetic testosterone analogue. In a preliminary study by the PI, the combination of exercise and oxandrolone eased burn-induced catabolism to a greater degree than ei- ther exercise or oxandrolone alone. Thus, the objective of this project is to compare the therapeutic and func- tional efficacy of the combined exercise-oxandrolone therapy with that of exercise alone, our current standard of burn care (SOC). The central hypothesis to be tested is that the combined exercise-oxandrolone therapy will be superior to exercise alone in attenuating burn-induced catabolism and increasing LBM, exercise endurance, and cardiovascular function. To this end, 100 severely burned children (7 to <21 years; burns e30% of the total body surface area) will be prospectively randomized to receive liquid oxandrolone (0.2 mg/kg/day, N=50) or placebo (N=50). Drug or placebo will be administered from hospital admission to the end of a 12-week exer- cise program (aerobic and resistive exercise), which will begin at hospital discharge. Two Specific Aims will be simultaneously pursued. Aim 1 will determine the physiological therapeutic efficacy of exercise train- ing/rehabilitation plus oxandrolone relative to that of exercise alone. The working hypothesis is that the combined therapy will be superior to exercise alone in improving LBM, muscle function, and overall cardiovas- cular function-all clinically relevant and vital functional endpoints. Aim 2 will determine the biochemical consequences of exercise training/rehabilitation plus oxandrolone relative to those of exercise alone. The working hypothesis is that the combined therapy will be superior to exercise alone in increasing protein balance, improving insulin sensitivity, and decreasing liver/tissue adiposity. This project is expected to estab- lish a new therapeutic approach that delivers more substantial improvements in the clinical and functional out- comes of burn-induced catabolism. It is also expected to provide a foundation for similar treatments in other muscle-wasting or muscle loss disorders. The long-term goal in this project is to identify clinically-effective, therapeutic interventions i the rehabilitation and recovery of severely burned children and NICHD's mission of improving rehabilitation of injured children so that they can fulfill their potential to live healthy productve lives."
"9309766","PROJECT SUMMARY The serrated pathway to colorectal carcinoma (CRC) accounts for 35% of all CRC. A subset of lesions arising along this pathway are characterized by methylation of CPG islands in the promoters of genes involved in tumor suppression and mismatch repair leading to their epigenetic silencing. Accordingly, this group of tumors is known by the acronym CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype). Epidemiological studies suggest that serrated lesions leading to CIMP CRCs may be more likely to be missed with colonoscopy perhaps due to their predominance in the proximal colon, morphology, or rapid growth rate. CIMP tumors have also been associated with an increased risk of CRC-related death. Despite the public health importance, the underlying cause of these aberrant epigenetic changes remains unknown. Identification of factors contributing to aberrant methylation in CIMP could lead to new strategies for risk assessment and preventative therapeutic interventions. We recently conducted a preliminary study to examine the role of the microbiome in CIMP CRCs. Our research suggests that prominent butyrate-producing bacterial (BPB) populations and the butyrate they produce are deficient in CIMP compared to Non-CIMP CRCs. We hypothesize that deficiency in colonic butyrate, a bacterial metabolite of fiber fermentation with known anti-neoplastic and epigenetic effects, is the primary cause of abnormal CpG island methylation in CIMP CRCs. To test this hypothesis, we will characterize biopsies from patients with CIMP and Non-CIMP tumors and pursue mechanistic studies in a transgenic mouse model. In Aim 1, we will use high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, to evaluate group-specific differences in the microbiota between patients with CIMP and Non-CIMP tumors and investigate functional differences between the CIMP and Non-CIMP tissues, including synthesis of butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids, such as propionate and acetate. In Aim 2, we will quantitate and compare concentrations of butyrate and other fatty acids directly in tumors and normal tissue from patients with CIMP and Non-CIMP tumors. In Aim 3, we will interrogate the transgenic HBUS mouse model of serrated tumorigenesis to investigate the functional consequences of dietary fiber deficiency and deficient BPB populations and butyrate on tumor progression and CIMP. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have expanded our knowledge of the role of the microbiota in different molecular phenotypes of CRC and provided evidence for or against a causal role for BPB and butyrate deficiency in aberrant CpG island methylation found in CIMP tumors."
"9228869","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Taxi drivers are a marginalized, large, growing, minority male population with multiple health risks. In New York City (NYC) alone, there are over 50,000 yellow taxi drivers and a similar number of livery drivers. Ninety nine percent of the taxi driver population in NYC is male. A large majority, 94 percent, are immigrants, mainly originating from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and West African countries. Taxi drivers are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors, and for lung cancer, compared with the general population. They are a sedentary population with high rates of stress and overweight/obesity, have high rates of uninsurance, long work hours that often interfere with their ability to access primary care, limited knowledge about health care resources, and cultural and linguistic barriers to care. To improve health outcomes in this vulnerable population, a tailored approach is necessary. Increasing access to primary care improves health status, particularly in minority populations living in poverty. Health fairs with screenings, referrals, and case management by health workers have been shown to increase health care uptake. Taxi HAIL builds upon the successful, ongoing work of the Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities (IHCD) Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) with taxi drivers to address their overwhelming health risks. Our work with drivers in NYC has highlighted their significant underuse of health care services, high rates of overweight, abdominal obesity, and undiagnosed and untreated hypertension. We have developed and implemented a multifaceted intervention, an occupationally tailored worksite screening health fair with case management, which has facilitated health care access and reduced health risk. However, this approach is costly. Taxi drivers, while facing tremendous health risk, also have notable potentially health promoting assets within their own taxi driver communities. In our NIMDH-funded R24 project, Taxi Network, 10 percent of NYC taxi drivers participating in a health fair intervention were teachers and several were physicians in their home country. Drivers, through their existing social networks, constantly exchange information about traffic, food vendors, cricket and soccer games, and home country news. They are highly networked by telephone, presenting a potentially powerful, inexpensive resource for health promotion and systems linkage. This project will use a three arm cluster randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of the proposed Taxi HAIL interventions on increasing the proportion of drivers with a Usual Primary Care Provider, the Primary Outcome. These interventions incorporate a worksite screening health fair intervention (Arm 1), with navigation case management in Arm 2, and a mobile messaging health care reminder system (`Mobile Technology') and telephone-based peer support (`Taxi health Improvement Promoters' or `TIPs') in Arm 3. We will also assess the interventions' incremental costs. Secondary Outcomes include changes in: Health Access Barriers, Blood Pressure Control, BMI, and Waist Circumference."
"9255959","The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop and conduct clinical translation of a novel visualization technology that provides minimally invasive surgeons the ability to visualize normally invisible internal anatomy together with organ surfaces. The technology addresses a long-standing need in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery to see inside and around a structure before dissecting, a need that currently used laparoscopes, even when high-definition and stereoscopic, cannot meet. We plan to achieve our objective by integrating 2 real-time surgical imaging modalities: (1) real-time laparoscopic video that shows the surface view, and (2) laparoscopic ultrasound capable of visualizing internal structures. We call the resulting visualization capability augmented reality (AR), in which laparoscopic video (the reality) is augmented with ultrasound findings, especially the tumors and the blood vessels. Children's National Medical Center and IGI Technologies combined their complementary expertise in Phase I to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a compact, accurate and clinically viable AR visualization system, based on electromagnetic (EM) tracking. The two performance milestones, pertaining to system's registration accuracy and interactivity, were met. We now propose developing a fully integrated, clinical system and performing its preclinical and clinical evaluation in Phase II. To perform a thorough evaluation of the technology and to cater to the entire surgical market (necessary for commercial success), we have expanded the partnership to include an adult surgical center in University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Overall, the specific aims of the proposed research are to (1) convert the EM tracking-based Phase I prototype to a clinical AR visualization system, (2) evaluate the system performance through animal studies, and (3) conduct preliminary clinical demonstration of AR visualization. These aims are designed to fully develop a clinical AR visualization system and then conduct its preclinical and clinical demonstration and validation. The Phase II results should allow us to obtain investigational device exemption designation from the FDA for multi-center clinical trials in a follow-on phase. Successful completion of the proposed research will create a smart surgical visualization system that promises to provide surgeons greater confidence, minimize complications, shorten procedure times, reduce blood loss, and help expand the utilization of minimally invasive surgeries to beyond their current share of all surgeries. The anticipated benefits will apply equally to pediatric and adult surgery."
"9254583","The general goals of this study are to use neuroimaging methods to measure possible changes during development and in adulthood as a function of differential birth interventions. The neuroimaging studies proposed in Project 11 will examine different potential mechanisms and behavioral outcomes following exposure to synthetic oxytocin (sOT) or blocking the OT receptor with an oxytocin antagonist (OTA) during birth in prairie voles. The prairie vole has been chosen as the animal model because it has a human-like autonomic nervous system, a social system characterized by high levels of sociality, long lasting pair bonds, high levels of paternal care and high levels of endogenous OT (eOT) - in the range of those measured in humans. (For details of the model see Overview and Project I). The following specific aims and questions will be addressed. Does exposure to synthetic OT (or alternatively blocking the OT receptor) at birth alter functional connectivity? Functional magnetic imaging in awake voles will be combined with independent component analysis to identify differences in resting state networks in control and experimental groups. Do manipulations including exposure to sOT or OTA at birth alter white matter tracts and fiber microstructure? Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative anisotropy will be used to identify areas of the brain showing changes in white matter fiber tracts and fiber microstructure between control and experimental groups. Does exposure to synthetic OT or an OT antagonist at birth affect brain activity related to perception, cognition and emotion? Imaging in awake voles will be used to identify differences in integrated neural networks functioning in: a) motivation/reward, b) anxiety/fear, and c) social recognition, as a function of birth-related interventions. These studies will be conducted and analyzed in the context of behavior, endocrine, autonomic and epigenetic measures taken in the Projects 1 and Ml."
"9327579","Summary/Abstract The Southeastern Medical Scientist Symposium (SEMSS) was established in 2010 by students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Emory University, and Vanderbilt University Medical Scientist Training Programs (MSTPs). The three programs have co-hosted the symposium for six years with the location rotating among Birmingham (2010, 2013), Atlanta (2011, 2014), and Nashville (2012, 2015). The objective of the symposium is to encourage a collaborative and interdisciplinary educational environment within the Southeast region of the United States. This fully student- organized symposium seeks to foster connections between the MD/PhD students at multiple institutions across the Southeast, exposing students to trends, challenges, and opportunities inherent in careers of academic physicians. Future SEMSS meetings will continue to rotate locations between Birmingham, Atlanta, and Nashville in order to optimize regional student participation. The program of each SEMSS has and will continue to include keynote speaker presentations, multiple topic-specific breakout sessions, MSTP student research oral and poster sessions, and social events. The breakout sessions are divided into sessions of interest to MD/PhD students, undergraduates, and residents/fellows. The meetings span two days, with content starting in the early afternoon on a Saturday and ending in the early afternoon on Sunday. The target audience for the SEMSS is MD/PhD students in training programs in the southeast and residents/fellows, MD students, and undergraduate students at southeastern institutions who have an interest in future careers as physician-scientists. An additional purpose of this symposium is to expose undergraduate students to physician-scientist trainees and faculty in order to foster excitement about careers in academic medicine and increase the pipeline of future physician-scientists. We think that this additional focus on undergraduate students from the region is critical to our purpose of enhancing the pipeline of students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine (URIM), as according to US News and World Report, nine of the top twenty historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are located in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, or Louisiana."
"9279577","PROJECT SUMMARY ? OVERALL The objective of this Conte Center is to take maximal advantage of recent advances in chromatin biology, so- called epigenetics, to fundamentally increase our understanding of the long-lasting abnormalities in the brain that cause depression. Our work focuses on key limbic brain regions, such as nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex, which have been implicated directly in the control of mood in health and disease. The Center is composed of four Projects led by Eric Nestler (Mount Sinai), Schahram Akbarian (Mount Sinai), David Allis (Rockefeller), and Carol Tamminga (UT Southwestern), and two Scientific Cores?the Animal Models Core led by Venetia Zachariou (Mount Sinai) and Chromatin and Gene Analysis Core led by Li Shen (Mount Sinai). The PIs, along with several Co-PIs, are leaders in their fields who use their complementary expertise and approaches to execute a multidisciplinary program of research focused on transcriptional and chromatin abnormalities both in mouse models of depression and in postmortem brains of depressed humans. A defining feature of the Center is bidirectional translation, with findings from mice validated in humans, and with discoveries in humans put back into animal models to study underlying mechanisms. The Center's research is defined by four themes. First, we study a broad range of epigenetic mechanisms, including histone and DNA modifications, nucleosome turnover, and the 3D structure of chromatin, which work in concert to control gene transcription. This involves the use of several next generation sequencing methods and advanced bioinformatics to analyze the resulting complex datasets. Second, we use this insight to understand how exposure to stress early in life controls an individual's susceptibility vs. resilience to stress-related disorders for a lifetime through long-lasting epigenetic mechanisms. Third, we focus on sex differences in this epigenetic regulation, having defined shared as well as many distinct mechanisms operating in male vs. female brain. Fourth, these studies are identifying numerous key target genes and molecular pathways that are defining novel mechanisms underlying depression and other stress-related disorders, which will help drive the field toward improved treatments and diagnostic tests."

"9260788","The objective of the Exposure Facility is to provide a highly specialized shared resource to support the scientific needs  of NYUCI members for animal exposure research in carcinogenesis models and administration, as well as analytical  chemistry to measure exposure in both animal and human samples. In the last competing renewal, the Experimental  Animal and Exposure Facility consisted of two integrated units, the Animal Care and Exposure Unit and the Inhalation  Exposure Unit, which provide specialized animal care, technical assistance for experiments with rodent species  involving delivery of carcinogenic and toxic chemicals for challenge experiments, or chemoprevention/chemotherapy via  various routes of exposure including inhalation, systemic, dermal, and oral administration. These unique services for  animal exposure are not offered elsewhere at NYUSOM. In recent years, the influences of metals, often associated with  inhaled air pollution particulate matter or nanoparticles, are being investigated In ongoing studies in animal and human  exposures. To effectively meet the evolving research needs of NYUCI Investigators for metal analyses which frequently  involve specialized rodent inhalation exposures to carcinogenic metals, ambient air pollution or contrived particulate  atmospheres, many of which are comprised of metal nanoparticles, the Analytical Chemistry Shared Resource, a  previously stand-alone shared resource since 1975, Is now incorporated as the Analytical Chemistry Unit within the  Experimental Animal and Exposure Facility. The Analytical Chemistry Unit will continue to provide NYUGl investigators  with routine access to Atomic Absorption (AA) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy for the qualitative and  quantitative determination of metal content in biological and environmental samples. This newly merged shared  resource entitled the Exposure Facility now consists of three integrated units, namely, the Animal Care and Exposure  Unit, the Inhalation Exposure Unit and the Analytical Chemistry Unit. This reorganization allows consolidation of  manpower and significantly increases the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of this shared resource to provide seamless  integration of exposure research with metal analysis and provide expertise in experimental design and conduct for  cancer-related studies from exposure to necropsy services and metal measurements in animal and human exposures."
"9224502","Project Summary (Abstract). Sleep apnea (SA) is a common disorder, associated with increased mortality and multiple adverse health outcomes. Yet major aspects of the genetic architecture of SA remain largely unknown. Knowledge of genes that influence physiologically relevant SA phenotypes can provide an important avenue for the development of therapeutic interventions. Decreasing costs and increasing genetic resolution continue to raise the attractiveness of genetic analyses to aid in discovery of the molecular mechanisms of complex disorders such as SA. I have played a central role in the genetic analysis of SA with the assembly and harmonization of the largest genomic dataset of individuals with objective sleep phenotyping in the world. This has led to the discovery of several genome-level significant associations with SA traits, which include loci in biologically compelling pathways. Further advances require analysis of larger datasets with higher resolution genetic data, permitting detailed characterization of rare and functional variants, as well as strategic follow-up physiological studies to elucidate mechanistic pathways. An unprecedented opportunity to conduct this research has emerged through genetic data linked to electronic health records (EHR) in over 150,000 individuals and the establishment of the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Consortium. Maximal genetic resolution will be provided through whole-genome sequencing of 1,000 members of the Cleveland Family Study, and >3,000 additional unrelated individuals in cohorts with polysomnography. To discover causal genetic variants for SA, I will a) perform a GWAS using an EHR-based case-control design; b) use these associations and 88 other associations we recently identified to interrogate causal variants for SA using TOPMed whole-genome sequencing data from well-phenotyped cohorts; c) apply multivariate analyses that exploit the shared genetic architecture for SA with cardiometabolic traits to increase statistical power and elucidate shared biology. Highly heritable, physiologically relevant SA traits will be used to discover additional associated loci that are not evident using the clinical Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) measure. Advanced statistics that integrate association analyses, linkage results from families enriched with rare variants, regulatory regions, and protein mutation severity will maximize power for common and rare variant association fine-mapping. The prominent NIH commitment to large-scale studies such as TOPMed and the Precision Medicine Initiative demonstrates a promising and sustained future for the field of genetic epidemiology and a need for suitably trained investigators. The proposed genomic analysis of SA is further responsive by addressing multiple goals of the NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan. The proposed work and developed skills will position me as an independent researcher capable of further identifying the role of genetic variants in the etiology and co-morbidity of sleep apnea."
"9281302","Project Summary/Abstract Obesity represents a major health issue, and Pennington Biomedical Research Center is at the forefront of the fight to both understand the causes of obesity and develop treatments to combat metabolic disease. In order to effectively purse this research mission, Pennington has relied heavily on the study of mouse models of obesity using research core infrastructure that allows the specific assessment of energy balance via the simultaneous measurement of food intake, energy expenditure, substrate oxidation and physical activity. We currently have 16 funded NIH awards that depend on this equipment in some fashion. In order to continue this tradition of excellence, this S10 application seeks to upgrade and expand our capacity to support metabolic research by requesting funds to purchase a 32 cage Sable Promethion metabolic/indirect calorimetry chamber system. Our current metabolic chambers are at max capacity, require long wait times, and the older Oxymax system is functionally limited and practically beyond its life-expectancy. Research productivity is currently limited because demand outstrips the availability and capability of our metabolic chambers, our aging infrastructure increases the risk that eventual equipment failure will severely compromise the ability to execute funded research, our aging Oxymax system is both more stressful to the animals and functionally insufficient for many experimental goals. The purchase of a Sable Promethion system to replace the over 10 year old Oxymax would expand capacity, upgrade aging infrastructure, and allow novel science that is not currently possible with our current systems."
"9311088","Project Summary  Lung cancer is one of the most common and most deadly malignancies worldwide. Recent advances in radiation therapy treatment planning and delivery has led to the increased utilization of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in early stage lung cancer patients. This technique delivers higher than conventional doses in only a few fractions, and has been associated with a high degree of local control. In order to ensure that the tumor is accurately treated, and to minimize the volume of healthy tissues irradiated, monitoring/tracking of the tumor position during treatment is important. Current methods rely on markers that are implanted into the patient?s tumor, or on the use of external surrogates. Both approaches have limitations. Real time x-ray imaging without implanted markers is desirable, however, the presence of bony anatomy in the thorax often obscures the view of the tumor. In this study, we propose incorporating dual energy (DE) imaging (a technique that can effectively remove overlaying bones from planar x-ray images) into the radiation therapy linac to provide high frequency, markerless motion tracking of lung tumors.  The integration of DE imaging with a linear accelerator involves the following steps: A) Optimize x-ray beam quality and pulse sequence for DE imaging with template matching. A phantom will be designed that will be used to determine the optimal DE imaging parameters for template-based tracking. This phantom will also allow for quality assurance of the proposed system; B) Implement DE capability in Developer Mode on Varian linear accelerator. DE capability will be developed on a stand-alone imager/generator image, and subsequently incorporated into a linear accelerator. A workflow will be designed to allow for the clinical utilization of this system; C) Optimize performance of template-based matching using X-ray images. Methods will be identified to produce high quality templates from the treatment planning CT that can accurately track the tumor location. Additionally, phantom studies will be performed to elucidate those conditions where DE imaging is advantageous over conventional, single energy x-ray imaging; D) Evaluate improvement in tumor localization in patients using DE imaging. Improvement in the accuracy of markerless tumor tracking will be assessed in a small cohort of lung cancer patients.  Since this study involves both engineering design and clinical implementation, we have assembled a group of researchers from industry (Varian Medical Systems) and academia (Loyola University Chicago), who individually have expertise in these respective areas. Through this combined effort, we expect the successful implementation of this approach will provide a practical, low cost method for enhanced tumor visualization and tracking that will improve the ability to treat lung cancer using radiation."

"9258833","Inhibikase Therapeutics is a clinical stage, biopharmaceutical company that has developed a host- targeted mechanism of action to treat AIDS-related and drug-induced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and was rarely seen clinically until the era of the HIV epidemic began in the mid-1980s. During the height of the epidemic, the rate of PML occurrence rose 20-fold, with 5% of patients with a diagnosis of clinical AIDS afflicted by the disease. Indeed, the PML became the first clinical syndrome associated with the AIDS epidemic. With the introduction of immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies (mAb), PML has become a growing concern for most mAb therapies in addition to its occurrence in patients with AIDS. PML results from pathogenic conversion of the polyomavirus JC, a virus that persistently infects adult humans. When a patient becomes immunocompromised, however, JC undergoes a genomic rearrangement, converting the virus to a pathogenic form with tropism for brain oligodendrocytes. Once infecting brain, the infection is lytic and leads to severe dementia, loss of limb function and death. Despite numerous clinical efforts, no polyoma antiviral has been identified, a failure that is largely due to the sparse testing landscape for drug discovery and no permissive non- human host for JC. Inhibikase Therapeutics has taken a different approach and identified host-targets that can disrupt JC reproduction in host cells. The Company has demonstrated that host Abl-kinase inhibition can disrupt JC polyomavirus entry, and demonstrated in human patients that this mechanism of action can control JC replication. The Company's medicinal chemistry program has now discovered 2 high potency active pharmaceutical ingredients ready to advance through IND-enabling and initiation of human clinical trials."

The control of gait and posture is dependent upon cognition and is linked to prefrontal brain function in healthy adults. The proposed K99 phase research has been designed to, for the first time, study the effects of aging, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer?s disease (AD) on prefrontal brain activation during standing and walking. Both DM and AD exaggerate age-related declines in gait and posture, and it is expected that this is caused at least in part by shared cerebrovascular complications; namely, a reduced ability to sufficiently activate the prefrontal cortex during these activities due to decrease blood flow and increased vascular resistance. With this information in hand, the proposed R00 phase research will then attempt to increase prefrontal brain activation using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in order to improve walking and standing in these patients. Thus, the following Specific Aims will be completed: K99 Aim 1 will determine, cross-sectionally, the relationship between gait and postural control and markers of brain activation during these activities in younger and older adults, as well as older adults with DM or AD. Brain activation markers (i.e., blood flow, blood oxygenation) will be quantified using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. We hypothesize that H1) those who exhibit slower gait speed when walking and greater postural sway speed when standing will exhibit less brain activation during these tasks and H2) brain activation during gait and postural control will be greatest in healthy young, lower in healthy old, and lowest in the disease groups. R00 Aim 2 will determine, using a 10-day tDCS intervention, a) the effects of tDCS targeting the prefrontal cortex on gait and postural control and brain activation, and b) the immediate and longer-term (i.e., over a one- month follow-up) effects on these outcomes in patients with DM or AD. Those who exhibit gait and postural control difficulties at baseline will be randomized into real or sham (i.e., control) tDCS intervention groups. We hypothesize that H3) the real tDCS group will exhibit an increase in gait speed when walking and reduction of postural sway speed when standing, and an increase in brain activation during these tasks, both immediately and over the 30-day follow-up period. Together, these discoveries will provide insight into the cerebrovascular control of gait and postural control in aging and age-related disease; and new therapeutic targets (i.e., blood flow and blood oxygenation) for balance rehabilitation. Moreover, it will identify tDCS as an important tool in balance research that may translate into a new low-cost and safe intervention for these vulnerable populations."
"9217578","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This disease of breast cancer (BrCa) has been intensively studied over the past quarter century, yet major gaps remain in our understanding of causal mechanisms operating at the level of molecules, cells and tissues; these shortfalls continue to compromise our ability to predict malignant progression of primary BrCa's and identify novel targets for clinical intervention. This Project involves an interacting consortium o BrCa researchers who intend to uncover causative mechanisms operating at a succession of steps of tumor development. One project examines how defects in the BRCA1 protein generate the mutations that create mutant BrCa cell genomes in genetically predisposed patients and in a portion of sporadic tumors. A second examines how the reproductive history of women interacts with the differentiation of distinct cell types to increase or reduce BrCa formation. A third studis how the hormonal environment of a woman together with the actions of the BRCA1 gene lead to changes in gene regulation, the outgrowth of these tumors, and the acquisition of resistance to existing therapies.. A fourth examines how signals released by oncoproteins affect the cell-cycle apparatus and how these signaling channels offer a striking opportunity for therapeutic intervention. A fifth will determine whether distinct subpopulations of carcinoma cells within primary BrCa's collaborate with one another in enabling tumor growth, while a six examines how signals released by the BrCa-associated stroma induce primary BrCa cells to acquire traits of highly malignant cells that enable them to invade and metastasize. This last program becomes highly relevant to reducing BrCa-associated mortality, since the vast majority of deaths derive from the metastases generated by these tumors rather than from primary growths within the breast. Together, the proposed Projects hold the promise of elucidating key steps in tumor formation that have offered or will offer novel molecular targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9439326","?    DESCRIPTION: There is an urgent need to develop novel strategies for treatment of advanced and metastatic colon cancers since they have limited responses to conventional chemotherapies. In this proposal, we will apply a new RNA-based strategy to deliver therapeutic miRNA and siRNA for targeted colon cancer therapy. We (Bin Guo's group) have recently found that miR-627 is induced by calcitriol and acts as a key mediator of calcitriol's suppression of colon cancer (Gastroenterology, 2013, 145(2):437-46). We have further demonstrated that miR-627 targets histone demethylase JMJD1A, an epigenetic regulator that has growth-promoting activity. Both miR-627 and JMJD1A-targeting siRNA can significantly inhibit colon cancer growth in vitro and in vivo (nude mice xenografts). We hypothesize that if we could employ targeted delivery of miR-627 or siRNA to directly inhibit JMJD1A, it would be possible to bypass the side effects associated with calcitriol and achieve tumor suppression. The co-investigator's (Peixuan Guo) group has discovered an unusually stable phi29 pRNA three-way junction (3WJ) motif that can be used as a scaffold to construct multivalent RNA nanoparticles with very high chemical and thermodynamic stability (Nature Nanotechnology, 2011, 6:658-67; Nano Today, 2012, 7:245- 257). The resulting RNA nanoparticles harbor different siRNA, miRNA, and cancer targeting module (such as RNA aptamer) that retain their folding and independent functionalities for gene silencing and cancer targeting both in vitro and in vivo. These RNA nanoparticles are resistant to denaturation in 8 M urea and do not dissociate at ultra-low concentrations in vitro and in vivo. Systemic injection into the tail-vein of mice has revealed that they remain intact and strongly bind to cancers without accumulating in the liver, lungs or other vital organs. This nanotechnology approach has enhanced the half-life of the RNA nanoparticles by 10-fold compared to the bare siRNA. The 3WJ-pRNA nanoparticles are non-toxic and display favorable pharmacological profiles that include biodistribution, pharmacokinetics (stability, half-life, and clearance rate), and undetectable immune responses (Molecular Therapy, 2011, 19:1312-22). The goal of this research project is to construct multivalent nanoparticles composed of RNA, to obtain enhanced or synergistic therapeutic effects for the treatment of colon cancer. We will conjugate (1) EpCAM aptamer for targeting tumor antigen EpCAM or A33 scFv for specific binding to colon cancer specific cell surface antigen A33 resulting in the internalization of RNA nanoparticles into the colon cancer cells; and (2) therapeutic modules, miR-627 and/or JMJD1A siRNA, to silence the expression of JMJD1A. Emphasis will be on specific tumor targeting and efficiency of gene silencing in vivo for treatment of primary tumor as well as suppression of metastasis. We will systematically evaluate the pharmacological profiles concerning biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and immune responses (antibody induction, and interferon, toll-like and innate immunity, PKR effect, and cytokine induction) of this innovative RNA delivery platform. The combined effect of the multivalent RNA nanoparticles for enhancing chemotherapy will be evaluated. We are confident that our RNA-based approach will result in an innovative therapeutic for colon cancer."
"9253973","Project Summary  Since its commercial introduction in 1981, pulse oximetry has become a widely adopted standard of care in operating rooms, intensive care units, and hospital wards. The ability to measure arterial oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry is so useful that it is considered the ?5th vital sign?. Despite their ubiquity, pulse oximeters have suffered from two fundamental limitations since their inception: poor signal quality when patients experience vasoconstriction, and erroneous data caused by motion. Although advanced signal processing techniques have been use commercially to address these problems, false alarms that lead to increased staff workload and decreased vigilance (?alarm fatigue?) remain very common.  The long-term goal of the proposed research is the development of a next-generation pulse oximeter which addresses the limitations above by performing arterial blood oxygenation measurements in new and fundamentally different manner than the photoplethysmographic methods used today. The proposed method leverages established blood flow measurement techniques based on light scattering to perform measurements, which results in a signal that is often hundreds of times greater than a typical pulse oximeter signal and which is significantly less susceptible to vasoconstriction and motion.  This long-term goal will be achieved by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) integrating a multi-wavelength VCSEL light source into an established clip-on blood flowmeter, (2) validating this multi-wavelength instrument in a rabbit model via comparison to bench top blood gas analysis during an oxygen challenge, and (3) completing a formal framework for relating SpO2 to measured blood flow waveforms using collected empirical data from in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations. Aim 1 will be accomplished by modifying instrumentation already developed by the PI to measure blood flow with multi-wavelength light sources fabricated through a commercial partner. Aim 2 will be accomplished through close collaboration with the Beckman Laser Institute and their established veterinary team who performs photonics-based small animal studies daily. Aim 3 will be accomplished by utilizing validated light propagation modeling tools to create a robust lookup table based generated from the data collected in Aim 2."
"9274662","Abstract: A molecular imaging initiative has been underway at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) for the recent several years. Specifically, with the recent expansion of the UNC Biomedical Research Imaging Center (BRIC) radiochemistry program, there is an ever increasing need for PET focused research in both preclinical and clinical areas at UNC. Indeed, our small animal PET/CT scanners have been a valuable research tool for basic and translational research by investigators from a broad range of clinical and basic science departments and schools, and in a wide variety of investigation areas. Unfortunately, our current small animal PET/CT scanner is outdated and lacks the desired imaging capabilities needed for many research projects. Specifically, the deficiencies include but not limited to the inability for whole body dynamic scan, the limited resolution and sensitivity, and slow CT acquisition process, etc. More seriously, this system has been extremely unreliable with 423 hours downtime in the past 12 month. We urgently need to enhance PET imaging capability by replacing the current scanner. This proposal requests fund for the acquisition of a small animal PET/CT system for use at UNC BRIC, as a shared research tool for users in UNC BRIC, Lineberger Cancer Center, School of Pharmacy, and School of Medicine. Moreover, investigators from nearby universities (such as NC State University) will also benefit from this technology. Indeed, with dedicated clinical PET/CT scanner available for research at UNC BRIC, it is essential to obtain the corresponding small animal imaging counterparts with cutting edge technology, which will seamlessly integrates preclinical PET/CT research with clinical research studies. The requested nanoScan PET/CT will be used by investigators in the fields of medicine, cardiology, neurology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and pharmaceutical sciences. Addition of the nanoScan PET/CT will significantly increase the productivity of UNC investigators who are working in various areas of basic and translational research (including cancer, neuro, and diabetic research), enabling access to in vivo systems to evaluate fundamental biological processes. The discoveries and advancements made by our investigators will ultimately have a direct positive impact on public health."
"9325954","Summary: Globally, the vast majority of HIV infections occur as a result of vaginal transmission. In the absence of an effective vaccine, novel HIV prevention strategies are desperately needed. Systemic use of current antiretroviral treatments is expensive and potentially toxic to recommend for uninfected persons as prevention, and may result in emergence of resistant HIV strains. However, coitally dependent strategies have failed either as the result of inadequate safety testing in laboratory animals, or due to marked, and unexpected rates of non-compliance. Thus to have an actual impact on the HIV epidemic, an optimum prevention strategy must be safe, non-toxic, inexpensive, and free from the possibility of promoting the emergence of resistant strains. It also must be deliverable in a manner in which compliance can be assured. The most promising method of prevention remains an intravaginal ring that can be inserted once every three months and that provides consistent, sustained delivery of effective concentrations of antiviral drugs incapable of promoting HIV resistance. Further, the drug must be inexpensive to produce, highly stable at ambient temperatures for months, and safe with prolonged exposure to mucosal tissues. Here we submit that the latest generation of an HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NCp7) inhibitor called SAMT-247, delivered in a novel intravaginal ring formulation with unparalleled release characteristics, fits all of these criteria. We will also test the promising integrase inhibitor dolutegravir (DTG) in combination with SAMT-247 for safety and efficacy in preventing vaginal transmission, as data suggests it is also is not subject to viral resistance. Here we will test the safety, efficacy, and duration of protection against multiple high dose vaginal SHIV challenges in a rigorous nonhuman primate model. We hypothesize a SAMT-247/DTG combination delivered in a novel vaginal ring formulation can provide safe and sustained protection against repetitive SHIV challenge SHIV for at least 90 days, which would be a remarkable advance in HIV prevention strategies."
"9308365","7. ABSTRACT Since 2009, despite insufficient evidence, 24 states have enacted legislation that encourages supplemental breast cancer screening with advanced breast imaging to all women with dense breasts. Patient advocacy efforts that led to the legislation contend that breast density may modestly increase risk for breast cancer but reduce the accuracy of screening mammography. Nearly 31 million women have ?dense breasts?, more than 60% of whom live in states with notification legislation. Because of the potential for increased cancer detection with tests such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), their use as supplemental screening is expected to overcome some of the limitations of screening mammography. However, such use will also increase false-positives and unnecessary biopsies as ultrasound and MRI have lower specificities than mammography. Further concerns have been raised about the potential for over-treatment and overdiagnosis from supplemental screening. The critical question is whether state-level laws requiring breast density notification and encouraging use of supplemental screening tests will improve the detection of cancer, down- stage these cancers when they are found, and ultimately, increase the number of deaths averted from breast cancer. To fill this evidence gap, we will capitalize on the natural experiment formed by state-specific legislation and use interrupted time series with comparison series to analyze data from 50 states spanning 18 years (January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2018) to rigorously assess the impact of breast density reporting legislation on: 1) breast cancer imaging (including ultrasound, MRI, tomosynthesis) and diagnostic workup and patient costs using claims data from a large cohort of commercially-insured women; and 2) breast cancer detection rates using cancer registry data. Our overarching hypothesis is that density notification laws have led to a significant increase in diagnostic resource utilization without a corresponding clinically significant decrease in detection of late stage breast cancer. We have assembled a multidisciplinary research team with internationally-recognized clinicians and methodologists in health policy evaluation, particularly the use of interrupted time series and in breast density and breast cancer screening policy. This research will move the field forward through the combination of a rigorous quasi-experiment design and two unique and complementary datasets to address these critical and time-sensitive questions about benefits and harms from density notification legislation. Our research can inform the ongoing policy debates in additional states and at the federal level. Further, by examining diagnostic burden and financial cost, we will provide women and their clinicians with information essential for deciding whether to undergo supplemental screening."
"9249413","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in a three-fold increase in progression to end stage liver disease and cirrhosis compared to HCV alone. Although curative treatments exist, less than one quarter of people with HCV are linked to care and even fewer have received treatment. The proposed study is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial to improve the HCV treatment cascade among people coinfected with HIV. This study will test whether a nurse case management intervention can 1) improve linkage to HCV care and 2) decrease time to HCV treatment initiation among people coinfected with HIV. Participants will be recruited from an urban HIV clinic that serves a primarily low income African American population with 50% of patients coinfected with HIV/HCV. Barriers to HCV linkage and treatment among people with HIV include low knowledge, competing demands, and HIV/HCV drug interactions, which can be addressed with nurse case management. The nurse case management intervention will be conducted in two phases. The first phase includes nurse-initiated referral, strengths-based HCV education, patient navigation, and appointment reminders. The second phase includes care coordination of antiretroviral modifications to minimize the impact of HIV/HCV drug interactions. The intervention components are guided by the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, which will be used to explain why participants engage or do not engage in HCV care. The findings from this study will ensure that the most effective linkage to care and treatment approach is integrated into care of this population. This study supports the President's Care Continuum and Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis, as well as the latest Guidelines for Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-infected Adults and Adolescents. This study's purpose is directly aligned with the NINR's strategic plan to improve health in minority and underserved populations through evidence-based interventions that promote wellness and self-management."
"9233209","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Roughly one-third of the non-olfactory GPCRs in the human genome are 'orphans' whose endogenous or natural ligands are unknown, with many more understudied (ie., `dark') from a chemical perspective. This represents an enormous gap in our understanding of human health and disease. This has particular relevance for mental illness since many orphan GPCRs are enriched in the brain and associated with neurological conditions, suggesting they play critical (patho)physiological roles. To test this hypothesis, Dr. Strachan will identify small molecule tools to modulate the functions of candidate brain-enriched orphan receptors GPR85, GPRC5B, GPR123, and GPR162. Working closely with his mentoring team, Dr. Strachan will develop new expertise in areas of robotic high throughput screening, multidisciplinary drug discovery (ie., medicinal chemistry, cheminformatics, and computational screening), and mouse genetics that he will carry over to his own independent research career establishing the (patho)physiology of these orphan GPCRs. The insight gained here has the potential to establish new signaling paradigms in the brain, thus exposing new therapeutic avenues for treating seemingly intractable psychiatric diseases. In addition to the implications for patient mental health, this K01 provides an uncommon training environment for Dr. Strachan to mature as a productive faculty member and to acquire new expertise in cutting-edge academic drug discovery techniques, genetic strategies, and neurobiology. Dr. Strachan's strong background in molecular pharmacology will synergize with the skills he acquires here to position him for a successful independent research career investigating the therapeutic potential of brain-enriched orphan receptors."
"9235271","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this NRSA F30 award is to provide support for my M.D. /Ph.D. training at Tufts University School of Medicine. A comprehensive training plan that encompasses both coursework and the activities associated with the proposed research is designed to facilitate the pursuit of a successful career as a clinician investigator. y proposed research investigates the mechanisms by which a quiescent neurogenic stem cell population in the olfactory epithelium (OE), horizontal basal cells (HBCs), is activated after severe injury. We have recently found that a decrease in p63, a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family, is necessary and sufficient for activation of HBCs; however, the mechanisms underlying and subsequent to p63 gene down regulation remain unknown. Understanding the mechanisms that govern p63, and thus activation, in HBCs is critical for developing targeted therapeutics for activating and expanding quiescent neural stem cell populations in humans. Notch signaling has been implicated in the regulation of p63 in a tissue-specific manner. However, the crosstalk between Notch and p63 in the OE remains unclear. My work focuses on identifying the specific roles neighboring cells play in cell-cell Notch signaling to HBCs and the molecular mechanism by which Notch signaling controls p63 gene expression. My central hypothesis is that Notch signaling from neighboring Sustentacular support cells provide critical cell-cell communication that significantly contributes to maintenance of p63 expression. This is based on my preliminary data that demonstrate that Notch overexpression increases p63 expression and suggests removal of Sustentacular support cells is necessary for HBC activation. I plan to test this hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: (1) Systematically determine how injury to each cell type in the OE is responsible for signaling HBCs to activate, and (2) determine the molecular mechanism by which Notch signaling regulates p63 transcription in HBCs. By performing this study, I will gain new knowledge on the signaling events that govern p63 regulation and HBC quiescence, which will help provide a better understanding of activation of quiescent neural stem cell populations. Thus, this work will help further the basic science understanding of neural stem cell biology and also provide a translational approach to activating dormant stem cell populations for neurologic tissue repair. The proposed research activity will be coupled with opportunities to develop communication, writing, and mentoring skills, including attending and presenting at scientific conferences, writin manuscripts and grants, and supervising undergraduate students and graduate trainees in the laboratory. Completion of these training activities will provide me with a necessary foundation to achieve my career goal of becoming an independently funded physician scientist."
"9235274","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad goal of this project is to contribute to understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern podocyte cytoskeletal dynamics with the expectation that understanding these processes will expose potential disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. We have been guided by the hypothesis that precisely regulated cytoskeletal dynamics are essential during normal podocyte maturation, in maintenance of the differentiated podocyte phenotype, and in determining podocyte behavior in response to glomerular disease.  While a decade of work has made this hypothesis dogma, a detailed understanding of mechanisms that govern podocyte cytoskeletal dynamics remains incomplete and therapeutic targets based on these mechanisms do not exist. Because integrated podocyte intercellular junction and foot process actin cytoskeletal remodeling are nearly always encountered in glomerular disease, we have focused on investigating the functions of the intercellular junction Nephrin-Neph1-Podocin complex because mutation or loss of any one of these receptor components causes proteinuria and podocyte cytoskeletal remodeling.  The present proposal is based on our recent observations that podocyte foot process spreading is regulated by mechanisms that parallel those used by cultured cells to induce lamellipodial protrusion. Nephrin ligation induces lamellipodial activation by a focal adhesion kinase-p130Cas-Crk1/2-dependent pathway.  In mice, podocyte-specific deletion of Crk1/2 blocks injury-induced foot process effacement.  Phosphorylation of FAK and Cas are induced in podocytes of patients with human minimal change disease and in membranous nephropathy relative to normal tissue.  These results provide compelling initial evidence that Crk-dependent signaling represents a therapeutic target that might be useful in blocking foot process effacement in human glomerular disease. Given these results and additional preliminary data suggesting a molecular mechanism by which Crk-dependent signaling is necessary in foot process spreading, this project will address the hypothesis that Nephrin-FAK-Cas-Crk signaling is necessary for foot process effacement and can be targeted in both acute and chronic glomerular disease processes. Two specific aims are proposed.  In aim 1, we will examine in mechanistic detail the hypothesis that Nephrin signaling and function requires endocytosis and endocytic recycling and subsequent signaling from a Nephrin signaling endosome, a process that requires Crk1/2. In completed work, we have demonstrated that targeting Crk attenuates the glomerular disease phenotype in acute murine glomerular disease models.  In aim 2, we will extend this pre-clinical work by testing the hypothesis that targeting Crk-dependent signaling attenuates the disease phenotype associated with chronic glomerular disease models that more closely mimic progressive human chronic glomerulopathy."

"9329196","Project Summary/Abstract In this proposal, we have found the germ cell-specific gene TDRD1 is a potential novel prostate cancer gene. In normal tissues, TDRD1 is exclusively expressed in the germ cells. Strikingly, TDRD1 is overexpressed in 68% of human prostate tumors, indicating TDRD1 as a novel prostate cancer biomarker. Furthermore, at mRNA levels, TDRD1 expression is linked to favorable clinical outcome for prostate cancer patients, indicating that TDRD1 has prognostic value. Taken together, our preliminary results suggest that TDRD1 is a novel prostate tumor biomarker with diagnostic and prognostic value, and as an ERG target gene, TDRD1 may have biological functions impacting prostate cancer initiation and progression. Importantly, we have successfully developed a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes human TDRD1 protein with exceptional specificity and sensitivity, in a variety of assays, including Western Blot analysis and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human prostate tumor samples. Using this anti-TDRD1 antibody, we have demonstrated that full length TDRD1 protein (~130 kDa) is expressed in the majority of human prostate cancer samples, but not in adjacent normal prostate tissues. This antibody will be an extremely valuable tool to determine the expression of TDRD1 by IHC in human prostate samples, including prostate needle biopsies. In this application, we will investigate the role of TDRD1 in human prostate cancer development, diagnosis, and prognosis by the following three specific aims. Aim 1 will evaluate TDRD1 as a diagnostic marker by IHC staining of prostate needle biopsies with limited cancer. Aim 2 will determine whether TDRD1 protein has prognostic value by IHC in clinically localized cancer. Aim 3 will investigate the in vivo function of TDRD1 in prostate cancer development by using (a) prostate cancer cell line xenograft mouse models and (b) transgenic mouse model with prostate-specific overexpression of TDRD1. Results from Aim 1 and 2 could be quickly translated into a new tool for prostate cancer diagnosis and/or prognosis prediction in the clinic. Results from Aim 3 will shed light on the function of TDRD1 in prostate cancer development."
"9387648","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This submission is for continuation of a graduate training program in investigative gastroenterology at Yale University. The program, which is in its 35th year, provides training in laboratory-based and patient-oriented research for: 1) physicians-scientists who have completed their clinical gastroenterology training (either in the Departments of Medicine or Pediatrics) to establish independent investigative careers in digestive tract research and 2) Ph.D. scientists who are seeking post-doctoral training in the biology of the digestive tract. Resources and mentors come from the Digestive Diseases Section, the Departments of Cell Biology, Cellular and Molecular Physiology, and Biology with the educational programs of the Yale Investigative Medicine Program (YIMP) and the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program. Preceptors have expertise in three primary areas: Intestinal epithelial biology and the microbiome, Cell biology, and Clinical/translational/genetic Sciences. Training opportunities in clinical and translational science have dramatically expanded over the most recent funded period, aided by recruitment of new preceptors and the development of new educational and degree programs. Training duration depends on the trainee background. Physician-trainees who have completed their clinical training will receive three years or more of research training; Ph.D.s with an interest in the digestive tract will receie two years of training. The trainees' curriculum includes didactic learning, research seminars, and journal clubs and their research will be presented locally and nationally. Formal application and interviews will be required to enter the program. Each trainee will have a progress committee comprised of their mentor, the Program Director (Fred Gorelick) or an Associate Director (Henry Binder or Judy Cho), a member of the Digestive Diseases faculty, and faculty from another section or department. Over the past 10 years, 27 trainees have entered the program and 21 will have completed their training by July 1, 2011. About 60% hold or have held full-time academic positions. The success of the Program with respect to Pediatric GI trainees has been particularly strong over the most recent funding period: all four have appointments as Assistant Professors and two are members of under- represented minorities. Renewal of the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) and establishment of a Yale Center for Scientific Teaching has substantially increased the resources and educational opportunities for our trainees."
"9390604","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competing renewal of the University of California, San Diego Gastroenterology Training Grant requests five additional years (years 38-42) to continue its outstanding record of training predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows in basic science and translational research in digestive diseases. The aim of the research training program is to develop independent investigators who will devote their career to research in digestive diseases. The program is designed for graduate students and MDs or PhDs, committed to academic careers in digestive sciences. Special efforts are made to attract minority candidates. The program builds on the significant progress made by the previous PI/Director, John Carethers, MD, who left UCSD in 2009 to become Chair of the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan. Since then, Gastroenterology at UCSD has undergone a significant expansion with the addition of Dr. William Sandborn, Chief, Division of Gastroenterology (Medicine), Dr. Robert Gish, Medical Director, Transplant Hepatology, Dr. Ariel Feldstein, Chief, Division of Gastroenterology and Nutrition, (Pediatrics), and Dr. Sheila Crowe, Director of Research and new PI/Director of the Gastroenterology Training Grant. Dr. Crowe is a NIH- funded investigator with a longstanding commitment to training and mentoring students, residents, GI fellows and post-doctoral fellows. She has served nationally in many capacities and was T32 Director at the University of Virginia until moving to UCSD this year. Since the previous renewal five years ago, 19 trainees have been supported by the grant. Of the 3 predoctoral trainees no longer in training, 2 are postdoctoral fellows, 1 is in a research career and 6 of 7 postdoctoral MD trainees are in academic careers such that 9/10 (90%) who completed training remain in investigative training or have careers in research institutions. In this renewal application, support is sought for an increase from four MD or PhD postdoctoral positions (three adult GI, one dedicated pediatric GI) to five positions in order to support a second dedicated position for a trainee researching children's digestive health. Continued support for two predoctoral trainees per year who train under the auspices of the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program is also requested. Traditionally, postdoctoral Gastroenterology training at UCSD involved basic science or translational research but this continuation application aims to also train clinically-oriented independent investigators. Accordingly, new faculty with expertise in clinical research have joined the Training Grant faculty now totaling 42, comprising basic and clinical scientists at UCSD and affiliated research institutes. Over the past decade 100% of predoctoral trainees and 90% of postdoctoral trainees who were supported by the USCD T32 Gastroenterology Training Program and have completed their training, are now in careers in academic or research institutions. Given our past successes and the continued expansion of resources, facilities and mentors at UCSD available for training future digestive health investigators we look forward to receiving continued support for the UCSD Gastroenterology Training Program."
"9239487","PROJECT SUMMARY Although late sleep timing is emerging as a significant risk factor for chronic health conditions, a gap exists in understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of a delayed sleep phenotype. This is particularly true for early childhood, a sensitive period in the maturation of sleep regulation and a time when poor sleep patterns first emerge. Late sleep timing and behavioral sleep problems are prevalent in ~25% of preschoolers. Central to the proposed research are our published data indicating that evening sleep problems and delayed sleep timing are linked to a later timing of the circadian system. Light is the primary zeitgeber of the circadian clock, and even low intensities of light can suppress melatonin levels and delay or advance circadian timing. For several reasons, we believe that light may be significant for determining sleep and circadian timing in early childhood: (1) the melatonin suppressing effects of evening light in school-age children are ~2x that of adults; (2) children are proposed to be more sensitive to light than adults based upon differences in ophthalmological features; (3) the enhanced transmission rate of the crystal lens in developing humans is prominent in the short wavelength of light, which is emitted from light-emitting diode electronic devices; and (4) media use has almost tripled in preschoolers in the past years and is associated with delayed sleep timing and evening sleep problems. This research will build upon our pilot data showing that 1 h of bright light before bedtime leads to high (~90%) suppression of melatonin in preschoolers. We will examine the sensitivity of the circadian clock to varying intensities of morning and evening light in preschool age children. We will obtain key data on light as a pathway by which delayed sleep timing is promoted and early sleep timing is protected in early childhood. Children (ages 3.0-4.9 years) follow a stable sleep schedule (7 days) and then enter an in-home dim-light environment (3 days), where they are exposed to a single illuminance of light for 3 h, ranging from 1 lux to 10,000 lux in either the morning (Advance condition; n=45) or the evening (Delay condition; n=45) starting 1.5 h before scheduled bedtime or wake time. Salivary melatonin onset assessments are performed using our established protocol at Baseline and the day following light exposure. In Aim 1, we will examine the sensitivity of the circadian clock to evening light, and in Aim 2, we will examine the sensitivity of the circadian clock to morning light. We hypothesize that evening/morning light exposure will induce circadian phase shifts and acute melatonin suppression in a non-linear intensity-dependent manner. This research is innovative, timely, and we expect that results will have a high payoff by addressing fundamental knowledge gaps relevant to modifiable targets (i.e., light, circadian timing) that may promote risk for or resilience to late sleep timing. Our data will make important contributions to the field by establishing the minimum and saturating light levels needed to produce circadian phase shifts, which are critical for making recommendations about light exposure and developing countermeasures for late sleep timing in early childhood."
"9318764","In the last decade, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the care and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose cancers harbor oncogenic kinase alterations such as chromosomal rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). ALK rearrangements define a unique molecular subset of NSCLC with characteristic clinicopathologic features and marked sensitivity to ALK TKIs. Based on recently conducted clinical trials, the standard treatment for advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC consists of sequential treatment with the first-generation ALK TKI crizotinib, followed by a second-generation ALK TKI like ceritinib or alectinib. While patients derive significant clinical benefit from first-and second- generation ALK TKIs, the majority of patients relapse within a few years due to acquired resistance. Recent work has identified a number of secondary ALK resistance mutations that can mediate resistance to second- generation ALK TKIs. These on-target resistance mechanisms are found in about one-half of patients relapsing on a second-generation ALK TKI, and can be overcome in the clinic by the newest third-generation, pan- inhibitory ALK TKI lorlatinib. However, patients who initially respond to lorlatinib still relapse within a year or two due to acquired resistance. Moreover, up to one-half of patients relapsing on a second-generation ALK TKI demonstrate intrinsic resistance to lorlatinib, likely due to the development of off-target, or ALK-independent, resistance mechanisms. As treatment options are extremely limited after failure of multiple ALK TKIs, there is an urgent need to understand resistance so that new and effective therapies can be developed. In this application, we seek to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying both acquired and intrinsic resistance to the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib. We will use in vitro generated models of resistance, comprehensive genetic assessment of lorlatinib-resistant patient specimens, and accelerated mutagenesis screens to identify lorlatinib-resistant ALK mutations. We will test whether these mutations are susceptible to other clinically available ALK TKIs. To define ALK-independent mechanisms of resistance, we will perform two independent screens in cell lines derived directly from patient biopsies, one involving combinations of drugs and the other utilizing CRISPR-based genome editing technology. Based on the results, we will design and test novel combinatorial strategies to overcome ALK-independent resistance in vitro and in vivo. As tumor heterogeneity may play an important role in driving the development of resistance, we will evaluate both intra- and inter- tumoral heterogeneity by sequencing single cancer cells, spatially distinct sites of disease obtained at autopsy, and circulating tumor DNA. These results will lay the groundwork for future studies investigating the impact of tumor heterogeneity on TKI response in the clinic. Overall, the proposed studies should lead to fundamental insights into the biology of TKI resistance and to the discovery of actionable mechanisms of resistance that may ultimately translate into highly effective, life-prolonging therapies for our patients."
"9215704","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral injury often leads to epilepsy via epileptogenesis, the process by which the brain is transformed into an enduring state (epilepsy) characterized by repeated unprovoked seizures. Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common example of epiletogenesis in young adults, and leads to epilepsy in 20-50% of instances. This epileptogenic period provides a window of opportunity where patients at risk for developing seizures may be identified, and where anti-epileptogenic therapy may be administered. Yet, there is no reliable clinical biomarker for epileptogenesis to identify whether epileptogenesis has started and how far it has advanced. Accordingly, the long-term goal of the proposed experiments is to use a rat epileptogenic TBI model to develop a safe, inexpensive and noninvasive electrophysiologic biomarker of epileptogenesis that is based on measures of cortical excitability by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). As a secondary goal, we will test if similar measures can be obtained by cortical EEG. We recently developed methods for focal motor cortex TMS in rats, demonstrated that these reliably reflect the magnitude of GABA-mediated cortical inhibition, and showed that such inhibition is depressed in rat seizure models, including a model of posttraumatic epilepsy. Here we propose to use the rat lateral fluid percussion (LFP) possttraumatic epilepsy model to test (1) whether the loss of cortical inhibition is progressive in time during epileptogenesis, (2) whether loss of intracortical inhibition after injury can predict seizure onset, and (3) whether potentially reversible cellular changes such as loss of GABA-ergic interneurons underlie the TMS-derived measures of cortical inhibition loss. Although the proposed experiments are limited to a rat model of post-TBI epileptogenesis, we anticipate that the results will inform studies of TMS as a biomarker in other forms of epileptogenesis. Further, as we will record EEG in all animals, we will test whether gamma frequency EEG power, which also reflects the integrity of GABA-mediated cortical inhibition, can serve as an epileptogenesis biomarker. Since TMS and EEG are already in wide human use, we anticipate that favorable data from the proposed experiments will be rapidly translated to clinical trials in human TBI."
"9411464","Enter the text here that is the new abstract information for your application. This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text. Substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease. However, current systems of care typically respond to SUD as an acute problem requiring short-term residential and/or outpatient treatment. As currently treated, people with SUD continue to have high relapse rates, with few opportunities for long-term recovery and relapse prevention supports. One approach to continuous care is for substance use counselors to engage clients in systematically monitoring their own progress and to offer therapeutic feedback in response. This approach aligns with the Institute of Medicine's explicit recommendation for the use of client monitoring systems, which offer continuous monitoring and feedback, allowing the counselor to intervene when needed. The SUD field has begun to explore promising strategies for using monitoring and feedback, including through the use of technologies such as telephone and mobile devices. Building on NIDA-funded research on RecoveryTrack, a computer-based client outcomes monitoring system (OMS), the Center for Social Innovation, LLC (C4) has partnered with Treatment Research Institute (TRI) to develop and evaluate RecoveryTrack- Mobile: A Monitoring and Feedback Intervention (RT-M). The goal of this intervention, to be developed into a mobile application, is to mitigate the risk of relapse among clients during and after outpatient treatment, using an evidence-based OMS assessment. This extends continuous monitoring beyond the clinical setting and into a client's day-to-day environment. Clients will complete core RecoveryTrack assessment questions weekly and daily, and the results will be used to prompt feedback or support from the counselor and family, friends, and/or sponsors that the client has elected to connect with the app. The app will include recovery supports such as motivational and alert messages, information, and resource links that promote recovery and wellness. During Phase 1, we will conduct a small-scale pilot study that is designed to evaluate feasibility and counselor and client acceptability of RT-M, and to determine whether RT-M supports clients' post-discharge functioning. We will use quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the product/intervention prototype in order to provide proof of concept for a larger Phase 2 effectiveness study. We will recruit a sample of clients (n=30) and counselors (n=6) from a large medical center in Philadelphia, PA that offers outpatient drug and alcohol services. Quantitative data will be collected through baseline and follow-up assessments (one-month post discharge), using instruments with strong psychometric properties to measure changes in substance use and other relevant functional indicators, as well as urine testing. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected on counselors and clients, to understand their use of and experiences with the app and the intervention, and suggestions for Phase 2. The project will be informed and enhanced by a Community Advisory Board of former clients and counselors."
"9313350","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden on racial and ethnic minorities. Substantial inequities exist in the pain treatment received by African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. Data suggest that members of these minority groups are not only more likely to develop chronic pain but also to have this pain accompanied by greater pain burden, i.e., greater suffering, poorer life quality, and worse functional impairment. Only modest headway has been made in understanding why race and ethnicity confer pain inequities and how best to address these disparities. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to contribute to the reduction or outright elimination o racial and ethnic pain disparities. The near-term goal of the planned research is to identify a small set of the most promising intervention targets, from among the plethora of posited explanations, for reducing or eliminating racial/ethnic pain disparities. The planned study would be, to our knowledge, the first ever prospective examination of factors posited to underlie racial and ethnic disparities in the transition from acute to chronic pain. The study would also be the first to investigate these issues in the important context of recovery following serious physical injury requiring hospitalization. For the proposed research, a sample of 900 adult survivors of serious physical injury, comprised of roughly equal proportions of African-Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Whites, will be recruited during hospitalization from large trauma centers in Los Angeles, CA and Philadelphia, PA. Interviews will be conducted during hospitalization and at 3-, and 12-month follow-up. Medical records will provide information on injury severity and medication use in-hospital which may influence the course of pain. The specific aims are (1) to determine whether African-American and Latino physical injury survivors experience more severe pain following injury relative to their non-Latino White counterparts; (2) to determine whether African-American and Latino injury survivors experience greater pain burden relative to their non- Latino White counterparts; (3) to determine whether African-American and Latino differences in pain severity or pain burden can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for interventions aimed at reduction or elimination of pain outcome disparities; and (4) To determine whether pain outcomes in at-risk minority groups can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for group-tailored interventions to reduce pain severity and pain burden irrespective of whether these candidates contribute to between-group pain disparities. The knowledge gained from the proposed research has high potential to accelerate efforts aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic pain disparities by identifying promising targets for prevention and intervention efforts to close the pain gap."
"9361943","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma affects >300 million people, with high morbidity and healthcare costs. Improved therapies are needed, because current therapies have adverse side effects and are ineffective in many patients. Asthma pathophysiology involves complex regulatory mechanisms in many different cell types, still little-understood at many levels. This research will test the role of a novel regulatory target in asthma, the orphan nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?). Based on preliminary findings that PPAR? acts within the lung to modulate asthma severity, we will determine if its dysregulation contributes to asthma, test feasibility of its therapeutic targeting, and elucidate key mechanisms. Airway epithelial cells (AECs) are important as both mediators and targets of asthma-related inflammation. Preliminary data suggest that PPAR? is downregulated in AECs of asthma patients and lungs of mice with allergic airway disease (AAD), and that globally downregulating PPAR? exacerbates AAD, whereas increasing PPAR? activity alleviates it. Our overall goal is to elucidate the role of PPAR? in regulating asthma severity and the mechanisms involved. The aims are: 1) to determine the mechanisms underlying induction of PPAR? ubiquitination and degradation by asthma- related cytokines and whether the resulting PPAR? deficiency exacerbates AAD pathogenesis and severity, comparing responses of wild-type AAD-bearing mice with those of novel strains having global or AEC-specific PPAR? deficiency; 2) to test whether treatment with novel PPAR? agonists blocks effects of asthma-related cytokines and agonist-induced or constitutive PPAR? activation ameliorates asthma severity specifically via AECs. These studies will exploit our novel resources including PPAR? KO mice lacking the fetal mortality that has hampered previous studies, a novel mouse strain expressing constitutively active PPAR? specifically in AECs, and PPAR? agonists we developed that are uniquely suited to administration by inhalation, preferred for asthma treatment. Taken together, our results will significantly advance understanding of PPAR? roles in lung biology and disease, and identify a new target for improved asthma therapy."
"9230805","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this revised second competitive renewal is to continue our investigations on the role of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in treating localized infections. PDT employs non-toxic photosensitizers (PS) and harmless visible light (frequently red light for increased tissue penetration) that combine in the presence f oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species that damage biological molecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and subsequently cause cell death. In the two funding periods of this grant we have synthesized and characterized several novel highly active antimicrobial PS and demonstrated their effectiveness in treating mouse models of infected wounds, burns and abscesses. In some cases PDT can save mice from a certain death due to sepsis that develops from an untreated localized infection. A combination of the appropriate molecular design of the PS, together with topical or local application of the PS to the infected area and a short drug-ligh interval allows high selectivity for microbial cells compared to the surrounding host cells. The broad motivation for this line of research is the relentless worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance amongst pathogenic microbes, and it has been found that multi-antibiotic resistant strains are in general as sensitive to photodynamic inactivation (PDI) as nave strains, and moreover that microbial cells are unable to develop resistance to PDI. Aim 1 will explore a finding that the clinically approved PS, methylene blue and related penothiazinium salts could have their antimicrobial PDT effect potentiated by addition of simple ions like iodide. While we initially interpreted this to involve electron transfer (oxidation) from hydroxyl radicals, we have now discovered that we can still get killing in the absence of oxygen. In addition to studying the contribution of Type 1 and Type 2 photochemical mechanisms we are now investigating a possible mechanism involving direct oxidation of iodide (and azide) anions by excited state MB to produce iodide/azide radicals that efficiently kill microbial cells. Aim 2 proposes a solution t the biggest barrier to the effectiveness of antimicrobial PDT in vivo i. e. delivering the photosensitizer (PS) into the infected tissue. Since all highly effective antimicrobial PS have cationic charges they are ideally suited for delivery into tissue by electricity. We will explore te use of iontophoresis and electroporation singly and in combination to deliver antimicrobial PS (and iodide) into ex vivo pigskin and into hairless mouse skin. Aim 3 responds to the reviewers' criticisms by exploring the combination of PDT with traditional systemic antibiotics to prevent regrowth of bacteria after PDT. Preliminary data has shown that a sub-therapeutic regimen of tobramycin can synergistically combine with a PDT regimen mediated by a fullerene and white light to save mice from dying in a Pseudomonas wound infection model. We will study possible synergy in vitro using MIC determinations with PDT and/or antibiotics In aim 4 in response to the reviewers' criticisms we will study selectivity for killing microbial cells (both fungi and bacteria) over mammalian skin cells (both mouse and human) and look at possible damage in tissue removed from mice. We have found some highly effective antifungal PS and will study these in vitro and in vivo with emphasis on selectivity. We now have access to Candida albicans that has been genetically engineered to express Gaussia princeps luciferase and Aspergillus fumigates expressing firefly luciferase that form localized infections that can be imaged by bioluminescence imaging."
"9309877","ABSTRACT Dental caries is the most common infectious disease in the world caused in large part by the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus mutans. Associated annual health care costs tens of billions of dollars, and rates of childhood caries in the U. S. are rising. There is a clear imperative to address this unmet health care need and identify new approaches to stem caries pathogenesis. Organisms that cause cavities form recalcitrant biofilms, generate acids from dietary sugars, and tolerate acid end products. While amyloid was first identified in the context of pathology, it does not always represent a protein mis-folding pathway. Functional amyloid is now recognized. Amyloid represents an evolutionarily conserved fibrillar, cross ?-sheet quaternary structure in which the ?-sheets laterally self-assemble to form fibers. Amyloid aggregates have common biophysical properties including uptake of amyloidophilic dyes, typical diameters when viewed by transmission electron microscopy, and birefringent properties when stained with Congo red and viewed under cross-polarized light. Several microorganisms are now known to produce functional amyloids that are integral to biofilm development. Our group was the first to identify Streptococcus mutans as an amyloid-forming organism. We have now extended that work to identify a total of three amyloid forming proteins in this bacterium. We have provided extensive tertiary and quaternary structural characterization of adhesin P1 and have identified its carboxy-terminal C123 truncation derivative as the amyloidogenic moiety. We have also identified S. mutans WapA and a previously uncharacterized protein Smu_63c as amyloid forming proteins. Like P1, WapA is a surface-localized sortase substrate whose truncation derivative, AgA, is amyloidogenic. Smu_63c is a secreted protein that serves as a negative regulator of genetic competence and biofilm cell density. All three of these proteins contribute to S. mutans biofilm development, which can be inhibited by small molecule inhibitors of amyloid fibrillization. Biofilm development by S. mutans mutants lacking genes encoding the amyloid forming proteins is significantly less susceptible to inhibition by compounds that target amyloids indicating the feasibility of amyloid inhibition as a therapeutic approach to preventing biofilm formation by this pathogen. In this renewal application we will utilize state of the art methods, including solution and solid state NMR, to identify and characterize the structural transitions underlying amyloid fibrillization by the amyloid forming proteins of S. mutans (Aim 1). This will enable us to follow their structural progression from monomer to amyloid within biofilms and will reveal mechanisms of action of inhibitory compounds. We will also develop and optimize methods to differentiate monomeric and fibrillar forms of the S. mutans amyloid forming proteins in vitro and within biofilms (Aim 2). Lastly we will apply these detection methods to assess and identify relevant environmental triggers that regulate protein monomer to amyloid conversion within S. mutans biofilms (Aim 3), a process that is not yet well understood in any system studied to date."
"9446255","BRAINS Project Description Retention of highly skilled scientists from diverse and underrepresented groups is critical for creating the diverse leadership necessary for innovation in neuroscience. Unfortunately, individuals from underrepresented groups often have higher turnover rates due to a greater sense of isolation and inequitable access to networks, mentors, and key resources that affect career success. Neuroscience postdoctoral researchers and assistant professors from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds (including racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities) are not immune to these issues. BRAINS: Broadening the Representation of Academic Investigators in NeuroScience adopts novel approaches to diversify neuroscience such that career advancement and retention of post-Ph.D., early-career neuroscientists from underrepresented groups (URGs: racial and ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities) are increased. BRAINS explicitly seeks to plug the neuroscience early career leaky pipeline by offering a novel professional development program that addresses factors known to impact persistence and career decisions of individuals from URGs in science. Such factors include one's sense of belonging and self-efficacy, the belief in one's ability to perform particular behaviors to produce a specific outcome. BRAINS intentionally targets talented neuroscientists considered at risk for leaving science and academia due to lack of professional support and career self-efficacy. BRAINS has already significantly impacted the career self-efficacy, career satisfaction, and sense of belonging of 56 participants. BRAINS will next enhance the breadth and depth of its impact by tripling the number of neuroscientists participating in the program, and by introducing formal cross- cohort activities that deepen the program's influence on participants' career advancement. Specifically, BRAINS' increased impact on the leaky pipeline will occur by 1. Expanding the longitudinal evaluation of all prior BRAINS participants and non-selected applicants, and  growing the program by adding two new cohorts of BRAINS Fellows. 2. Foster additional synergistic networks, career skills, and the leadership potential of BRAINS Fellows  through new cross-cohort activities. 3. Broadening BRAINS' reach amongst early-career neuroscientists from URGs by introducing a BRAINS  Affiliates Program."
"9259393","PROJECT SUMMARY Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of acquired epilepsy, which often results as a consequence of CNS infection and other insults. A high proportion of patients who have developed TLE following encephalitis are often resistant to current anti-seizure drugs (ASDs). As the majority of ASDs target neuronal mechanisms, the role of glial cells in epilepsy is now being actively investigated to identify alternative treatments and disease modifying therapies. The most common pathology associated with TLE, hippocampal sclerosis, involves activation and proliferation of astrocytes that form a glial scar. Astrocytes that comprise the scar have been hypothesized to play an important role in high levels of glutamate found within that tissue. The astrocyte-specific glutamate transporter GLT-1 accounts for approximately 90% of glutamate uptake in the brain. The overall goal of this project is to better understand the contribution of astrocyte-mediated glutamate homeostasis to seizures and to determine if compounds modulating the expression of GLT-1 may act as novel ASDs with potential disease modifying properties. To achieve this goal, we will conduct multidisciplinary experiments in the Theiler?s Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV) mouse model of infection-induced TLE. This animal model, the first infection induced model of TLE, recapitulates clinical observations including neurodegeneration, formation of a glial scar, and the development of spontaneous seizures. Aim 1 will investigate changes in GLT-1 expression in reactive and glial scar astrocytes following TMEV infection. The use of electrophysiology in combination with immunoblot techniques is a superior way to observe functional alterations in glutamate regulation during the acute seizure phase in TMEV infected animals. Aim 2 will determine if a modulator of GLT-1 expression can be used as a tool to manipulate glutamate transmission and ameliorate neurotoxicity following TMEV infection. Ceftriaxone (CEF) is a safe and commonly used ?-lactam antibiotic that has been shown to increase GLT-1 expression and prevent neuronal injury in other animal models of neurological disease. Thus, conducting these experiments will provide an outstanding training environment and determine the role of GLT-1 modulation in a clinically relevant epilepsy model. Additionally, the proposed experiments may provide valuable information for future disease modifying therapies for the patient with CNS infections that could lead to epilepsy."
"9253902","Abstract  This project aims to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HIV capture and transmission by dendritic cells (DCs) using an improved humanized mouse model.  HIV invades the human body via mucosal surfaces or blood, however it only actively replicates in lymph nodes. It is generally accepted that HIV transmission from invasion site to replicating site depends on DCs, which are antigen presenting cells uniquely potent in initiating T cell immunity. DCs capture antigens in the periphery and migrate to the lymphoid organs where they process and present the antigens to and activate T cells. HIV hijacks these features of DCs for its viral transmission. DCs distribute in the mucosa and blood where HIV invades the human body and are thus the primary target of HIV. In vitro studies show that DCs can bind HIV via multiple receptors, retain the viral infectivity and transmit the virus to T cells that are activated during DC-T cell interaction, thereby amplifying viral productive replication. These studies, together with DCs' superior migration ability, leads to a general idea that HIV exploits DCs as a Trojan horse for entry into the lymph nodes and transmission to T cells, a process yet to be recapitulated in vivo.  It is known that HIV can bind to cells through several receptors including CD4 and CCR5. Another fascinating HIV receptor is DC-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), a receptor with multiple ligands and thus multiple functions. DC-SIGN, first identified on monocyte-derived DCs, is especially interesting because it not only mediates HIV capture and transmission but also controls DC migration, thus bridging invasion and replication of the virus. It does so by binding different ligands on HIV envelope (gp120), blood vessels (ICAM-2) and T cells (ICAM3) respectively. Importantly, DC-SIGN expression is not homogeneous on all DCs in vivo. It has been shown that microbial stimuli increases DC-SIGN+ DC numbers and DC-SIGN expression level, which suggests that environments with microbial stimuli amplify DC-SIGN mediated antigen capture. Might this, for example, help explain why circumcision, which dramatically reduces the bacterial load in the male genital area is correlated with reduced risk of HIV infection? If DC-SIGN and DCs serve as molecular and cellular links between microbial stimuli and HIV transmission, then it suggests two important questions: (a) Can microbial stimuli affect the HIV binding and the migration of these DCs in vivo? (b) Which DC subsets bind HIV in vivo and do they depend on DC- SIGN for binding and migration? Understanding these dynamic processes could prove crucial to designing strategies to prevent HIV transmission through targeting DC and DC-SIGN. We hypothesize that microbial stimuli increase recruitment and migration of DC-SIGN+ DCs in humans, thereby increasing DC-SIGN mediated HIV binding and transmission. To test this hypothesis, we will perform experiments with the following three specific aims. Aim 1. Optimize the humanized mouse model and determine reconstitution efficiency and HIV receptor expression in the steady state and in response to microbial stimuli. We will (1.1) determine how transplant of human thymus and fetal liver CD34+ cells, and Flt3L injection affect the reconstitution efficiency of DC and T cells in NSG-SGM3 recipient, (1.2) measure expression of multiple HIV receptors on different DC subsets in different tissues in humanized mice, and (1.3) assess alteration of DC population in response to injection of LPS, a microbial stimulus. AIM 2. Genetic targeting of DC-SIGN in humanized mouse and its effect on DC development and function. We will (2.1) compare shRNA and CRISPR/CAS9 strategies for their efficiency of transduction and knockdown of DC-SIGN in humanized mice, (2.2) evaluate how DC-SIGN knockdown affects development and migration of DCs and their interaction with T cells in humanized mouse, and (2.3) evaluate the development and migration of DCs and their interaction with T cells in humanized mouse lacking DC-SIGN in response to microbial stimuli. AIM 3. Determine gp120 binding to multiple DC subsets in vivo with absence and deficiency of DC-SIGN. We will (3.1) determine binding of gp120 to DCs with DC-SIGN presence or deficiency in vitro, (3.2) determine binding of gp120 to distinct DC subsets in vivo in the steady state and in response to LPS, and (3.3) determine how DC-SIGN knockdown affects binding of gp120 to DCs in vivo."
"9395099","Substance use disorders are among the leading causes of disability in the world, and improved strategies to reduce their burden are needed. The goal of this training program is to produce the next generation of drug dependence epidemiologists who can address this need by conducting research that will advance our understanding of the etiology and natural history of substance use; developing, implementing, and evaluating interventions to prevent and control substance use; and critically examining substance abuse services and systems of care to improve substance abuse outcomes including HIV-related risk. Recent scientific advances such as in genomics, brain imaging, and informatics present new opportunities for accelerating the discovery and translation of findings into public health gains. This training program will capitalize on the interdisciplinary resources at Johns Hopkins University and collaborations within outside institutions to provide trainees with the skills and experiences needed to lead multi-disciplinary research that takes advantage of these emerging opportunities and promotes overall health and well being of communities. Trainees will achieve this through a rigorous program of coursework, research apprenticeships, and integrative activities that provide a solid foundation in the core proficiencies of drug dependence epidemiology. The program will include 7 predoctoral students and 5 postdoctoral fellows who are supported by an experienced group of 14 Core Faculty and 6 Affiliate Faculty. The trainees will be prepared to assume leadership positions in academia carrying out drug dependence epidemiology and HIV research typically as faculty in Schools of Public Health or Medicine, in government formulating research priorities and substance abuse policy at the local, state, national, and international levels, in private industry conducting applied research for pharmaceutical companies, and in non-profit agencies or non- governmental organizations advocating for those with substance use disorders. This training program has successfully trained drug dependence epidemiologists for close to 20 years. The former Director of the program, Dr. William Latimer, recently transitioned to a new position at the University of Florida and leadership was transferred to Dr. Debra Furr-Holden, a former DDET pre-doctoral trainee. Dr. Furr-Holden is now an accomplished Associate Professor with expertise in drug and alcohol dependence epidemiology, psychiatric epidemiology and prevention science. In this competing renewal, she is poised to build on the rich tradition of the program and lead it in new directions that will prepare the next generation of leaders in drug dependence epidemiology and HIV research who will advance the field beyond traditional studies of the incidence and prevalence of substance abuse disorders (i.e., descriptive epidemiology) and drive research that focuses on etiologic mechanisms, targeted interventions, and delivery of services (i.e., analytic epidemiology)."
"9222911","ABSTRACT The proposed research project and my mentoring and career development plan will enable me to become a successful independent investigator in cognitive aging and cognitive epidemiology with a focus on longitudinal statistical modeling of cognitive function, harmonizing datasets using coordinated integrative analytic approaches, epidemiology, and intensive cognitive assessment. Non normative cognitive decline is a major issue in our aging society; amongst the many dementias, Alzheimer?s disease (AD) alone is estimated to affect 17% of individuals between the ages of 75 and 84, and accounts for $226 billion for our annual health-care budget without accounting for other dementias, some of which are potentially reversible, with mixed etiology. The heterogeneity among the presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias contributes to the limited effectiveness of clinical treatment and prevention trials. To this end, the proposed research project and training plan will investigate individual differences in cognitive trajectories in older adults; it will also characterize individual differences in vascular risk factors, physical function, and emotional states, using techniques from structural equation modeling, latent variable modeling, and Bayesian approaches. The training plan includes didactic course work, experiential learning, and structured tutorials with well-recognized mentors in various areas of their expertise. The research plan takes advantage of a large and rich NIH-funded longitudinal dataset, the Einstein Aging Study (EAS) to parse heterogeneity in cognitive decline across individuals and to identify factors that are associated with different trajectories. Through the use of latent trajectory models fit to data from EAS participants to partition heterogeneity and to identify candidates who are eligible for early intervention we will be able to establish the type of intervention that may benefit specific profiles. We propose to use prediction models that employ vascular risk factors (including diabetes, CVD, and hypertension), physical function (gait speed, grip strength, lung function, and frailty), and measures on emotional states (stress, depression, and cortisol) because these can be controlled or reversed, and because they are also associated with cognitive impairment. By classifying individuals, we will be better able to predict who will benefit from specific treatments. By harmonizing our results and replicating our findings in other datasets that are part the NIH-funded network, the Integrative Analysis of Longitudinal Studies on Aging (IALSA), our results will comply with the new NIH guidelines on Rigor and Reproducibility; our results will also have increased generalizability. Our project will thus have implications for both behavioral and pharmacological interventions. These outcomes will impact mild cognitive impairment (MCI), presymptomatic Alzheimer?s disease, and dementia research, especially in furthering forward classification and early detection, and in designing targeted intervention programs for individuals at high risk.

"9307230","Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological disease affecting women. The higher rate of mortality is attributed to the fact that women with ovarian cancer do not show symptoms at an early stage but are often (>85% of cases) diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease progression resulting in a poor (27%) 5-year survival rate. Cancer prevention strategies, therefore, assume a greater importance in reducing the incidence of ovarian cancer. Metformin, a generic anti-diabetic drug, has been used in the past for improving insulin sensitivity and to manage type 2 diabetes symptoms.!!Several retrospective surveys have found indirect clinical evidence that metformin intake is correlated with greater survival in cancer patients including ovarian cancer patients. However, there are no prospective clinical studies to suggest that metformin intake reduces the incidence and/or severity of ovarian cancer. We seek to address this critical gap in knowledge by conducting a pilot preclinical study utilizing a naturally and spontaneously occurring ovarian cancer model. Preliminary studies have revealed that in the preclinical chicken model, hens develop ovarian tumor naturally at a very high rate that exceeds 25% during 2-4 years of age. Metastatic ovarian cancer cells isolated from the chickens were found to be aggressive and invasive and expressed genes and proteins commonly found in human ovarian cancer cells. Ovarian cancer stem cells recovered from ascites formed extensive network of ovospheres and were found to be highly invasive. The proposed pilot study will be conducted with two specific aims: 1) determine if long term dietary metformin intake affects incidence and severity of ovarian cancer; and 2) determine the extent to which metformin affects invasiveness and viability of ovarian cancer stem cells. Under the first aim, chickens will be fed with a diet supplemented with various levels of metformin for 18 months. Under the second aim, ovarian cancer stem cells isolated from the hen model will be treated with various levels of metformin. This project is innovative because it uses a substantively different approach for preclinical testing of potential anti-cancer effects of metformin. Furthermore, this research will utilize ovarian cancer stems cells isolated from hens to test their susceptibility to metformin treatment. The proposed research is significant because a positive outcome of this pilot study would lead to further testing of metformin in a population of euglycemic women who are at risk for developing ovarian cancer. Furthermore, this pilot study would lead to elucidation of the ovosphere microenvironment and the vulnerability of ovospheres to cancer prevention strategies.!"

The Pharmaconeuroimmunology Training Program <www.facebook.com/pniprogram> has operated for ten years and resulted from the combination of two previously NIDA-funded programs at the University of Minnesota, Training in Drug Abuse and Neurobehavioral Pharmacology (T32 DA07097-20) and Training in PNI and Substance Abuse (T32 DA07239-10). The combined training program meets a well-recognized need to train biomedical scientists at the pre- and postdoctoral levels in an interdisciplinary and translational field that focuses on the interactions of drugs of abuse with the nervous and immune systems, and integrates our understanding of these physiological interactions with their behavioral counterparts. We train basic scientists and clinicians in these fields to talk to one another productively. A critical component of the training program considers the role of drugs of abuse as co-factors in HIV/AIDS, specifically relating to NeuroAIDS. Former trainees (25 predoctoral and 22 postdoctoral in the past 10 years) hold influential positions in academia, government, and industry. Our 32 primary faculty trainers are a talented group of neuroscientists, psychologists, pharmacologists, immunologists, and microbiologists at the University of Minnesota. Across these disciplines we have both laboratory-based scientists and clinical faculty, allowing the program to attract outstanding trainees. Our well-funded faculty trainers have extensive experience as mentors and are committed to training predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in this interdisciplinary setting. We also have co-mentors with selected expertise who will provide specialized training components. To fulfill our training mission with our available resources, we request funding for 10 predoctoral and 5 postdoctoral positions. All of the elements of a successful training program are in place and are functioning efficiently and effectively: a formal predoctoral curriculum, including courses in neuro-immune interactions and neuropsychopharmacology; a bimonthly seminar series; and most importantly, linkages established, collegial, and creative relationships among the faculty across the disciplines. Since the last submission, we have built on our accumulated experience and implemented two components that have further strengthened our trainees' interdisciplinary translational research experiences: 1) a clinical course on Substance Abuse to the Bedside that focuses on heroin, cocaine/methamphetamine, nicotine, and the medical complications of addictions, including complications from AIDS, and 2) a new colloquium on HIV/AIDS: Pathogenesis, Treatment, and Prevention led by clinical faculty who deal directly with AIDS patients."
"9305717","SUMMARY Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that persists for life. Although HCMV is generally benign in healthy individuals, the virus can cause disease in immunocompromised populations and HCMV is the leading infectious cause of congenital disease in newborns. The reasons why the immune system is able to control, but unable to eradicate HCMV are unknown. Our main hypothesis is that immunomodulatory CMV genes, particularly modulators of innate and adaptive cellular immunity, enable the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection in immunocompetent individuals. A better understanding of these immune modulatory processes will be essential for the development of vaccines against HCMV as well as for the optimization of CMV-based vaccine vectors that have recently assumed center stage in the development of vaccines against HIV and TB. Our work in non-human primate models of CMV infection revealed a series of unexpected results that indicate a complex relationship between CMV and the innate and adaptive cellular immune response involving viral evasion, viral recruitment and viral manipulation of the host's immune response. Particularly novel is our finding that CMV-encoded genes enable the virus to control the epitope specificity of the adaptive, CD8+ T cell immune response. We discovered that wildtype RhCMV and HCMV elicit MHC-I restricted CD8+ responses that are exclusively directed to sub-dominant or ?non-canonical? epitopes. However, in the absence of the MHC-I inhibitors Rh189 (in RhCMV) or US11 (in HCMV), additional CD8+ T cells are induced that recognize ?canonica?l MHC-I epitopes, i.e. epitopes that predominate the CD8+ T cell responses elicited by unrelated viruses or vaccines not based on CMV. Since such stringent control of T cell specificity has not been observed before for any infectious agent, we will elucidate why, how and where primate CMVs prevent the induction of canonical CD8+ T cells. In Specific Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that canonical CD8+ T cells are particularly efficient in controlling viral dissemination and, therefore, rhesus and human CMV developed specific measures to both prevent their priming and to escape their control. In Specific Aim 2 we will investigate which structural features enable Rh189 to inhibit the induction of canonical CD8+ T cells in comparison to related MHC-I-inhibitory proteins of the same gene family that do not prevent canonical CD8+ T cell priming. In Specific Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that spreading of Rh189-deficient RhCMV to myeloid cells is required for the induction of canonical CD8+ T cell by a direct priming mechanism. We will examine the role of viral dissemination by deleting Rh189 from single cycle viruses. Moreover, by inserting targeting sites for cell type-specific microRNAs into the 3'-UTR of Rh189 we will identify which cell types need to be infected to enable canonical CD8+ T cell priming in the absence of Rh189, The results of this work are expected to provide new insights into the control of non-canonical CD8+ T cell targeting by CMV that will ultimately lead to improved vaccines for HCMV and improved vaccine vectors based on HCMV."
"9224916","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal describes a 5-year training program for the development of an academic career with a research focus on immune regulatory mechanisms that govern epidermal stem cell differentiation in inflammatory skin disease. Dr. Mathur obtained an M.D. and Ph.D. from Indiana University School of Medicine's MSTP program. His graduate work focused on the transcriptional regulation (including roles for Stat3, Stat4, and T-bet) of IL- 17-secreting CD4+ T cells (Th17 cells). These cells have now been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. This along with his clinical training in dermatology and fellowship training in pediatric dermatology has uniquely prepared him to examine how skin-resident regulatory T cells function to influence stem/progenitor cell differentiation and epidermal regeneration in inflammatory skin disease. Dr. Mathur recently graduated from a dermatology residency at Indiana University. Thereafter, he was recruited to UCSF's Physician-Scientist Training Program, an NIH supported T32 program combining clinical training in Pediatric Dermatology with a post-doctoral research fellowship. During his post-doctoral work and over the past year as a junior faculty member in UCSF's Department of Dermatology, Dr. Mathur has strategically sought out additional training and mentorship in cutaneous immunology, skin barrier function and epidermal stem cell biology. Through the proposed training program, he will expand upon his expertise in these areas as well as gain skills critical for professional development, ethical conduct of research, statistical analysis, and clinical care of pediatric patients with inflammatory skin disease. Dr. Mathur's goal is to become an independent investigator studying the mechanisms responsible for establishing and maintaining immune homeostasis in the skin. He will accomplish this through coursework, participation in seminars and conferences, national presentations and engagement in a mentored research project. Currently, little is known about how skin-resident immune cells influence epidermal stem cell function in inflammatory skin diseases. Nevertheless, stem/progenitor cell activation is necessary to repair skin barrier defects following inflammatory insults. The proposed research will focus on uncovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which regulatory T cells (Treg) support stem cell activation and epidermal regeneration. Dr. Mathur has made the novel observation that skin Tregs are abundant and co-localize with a population of epidermal stem cells that reside within the hair follicle bulge (HFSCs). Furthermore, Tregs influence HFSC activation, which supports keratinocyte differentiation and skin barrier repair after inflammatory skin injury. In the proposed experiments, Dr. Mathur will elucidate how skin-Tregs promote epidermal regeneration. Using sophisticated mouse model systems, he will dissect how regulatory T cells control epidermal cell differentiation both at the cellular and molecular levels. The aggregate data will provide a major advancement in our understanding of how Tregs promote epidermal barrier homeostasis, and have the potential to establish a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies for inflammatory skin disease. Dr. Mathur will benefit from a co-mentorship model that draws on the experience of senior faculty members as well as the resources and scientific expertise of a promising junior faculty member. Drs. Richard Locksley M.D. and Abul Abbas M.D. will be the senior mentors guiding Dr. Mathur's scientific and career development. Dr. Locksley is an HHMI investigator, Professor of Medicine at UCSF, and a preeminent scientist whose laboratory focuses on allergic inflammation in barrier tissues including skin, lung and intestines. Dr. Abbas is Professor and Chairman of the Department of Pathology at UCSF and a world-renowned leader in the field of immune tolerance. Their combined record of mentoring postdoctoral fellows and graduate students is outstanding. The research will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Rosenblum, who is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Dermatology and a former trainee of Dr. Abbas. Dr. Rosenblum will provide the resources and space required for the proposed work as well as guidance on skin-specific aspects of immune regulation. To enhance Dr. Mathur's training, a scientific advisory committee consisting of all three co-mentors as well as Dr. Theodora Mauro, a senior physician-scientist and cutaneous biologist who has expertise in keratinocyte biology and barrier function, Dr. Ophir Klein M.D., Ph.D., a physician-scientist with expertise in adult stem cell and regenerative biology, and Dr. Bruce Wintroub, chair of the UCSF dermatology department, will meet twice yearly to review his progress and support his career development. The proposed training program draws on the combined resources of the Rosenblum Laboratory, the UCSF Immunology Training Program, The UCSF Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, and the UCSF Department of Dermatology. This will provide an ideal setting for Dr. Mathur's transition to an independent investigator."
"9425252","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gestational diabetes (GDM), diabetes with onset during pregnancy, can result in acute and chronic adverse outcomes for mother and offspring. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the role of the novel hexokinase gene HKDC1 in the pathogenesis of GDM. In a recent genetic study of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) cohort, the PIs and co-authors reported a novel loci associated with maternal glycemic traits specifically during pregnancy. The lead candidate gene in the region, hexokinase- domain containing 1 (HKDC1), has not been characterized. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that HKDC1 is a novel fifth vertebrate hexokinase that controls glucose homeostasis during pregnancy. Testing that hypothesis is important because it will reveal new mechanisms contributing to one of the most common complications of pregnancy worldwide. The results will also have broad-reaching impacts on understanding vertebrate metabolism because hexokinase is the first step in glycolysis, and the dogma in the field is that there are only four vertebrate hexokinase isoforms. Characterizing the function and regulation of the fifth hexokinase will challenge that dogma and will open up several new areas of study. The central hypothesis will be tested at three complementary levels. First, the hexokinase activity of the HKDC1 protein will be extensively characterized. Preliminary data from the PIs already demonstrate that HKDC1 has hexokinase activity. This aim will place HKDC1 in the context of the other hexokinases by systematically characterizing the kinetics of HKDC1 and its subunits. Second, the in vivo role of HKDC1 in glucose homeostasis during pregnancy will be assessed. Tissue expression patterns suggest that HKDC1 regulates glucose homeostasis during pregnancy specifically through its role in pancreatic  cells and liver. Through global and tissue-specific ablation mouse models, glucose homeostasis during pregnancy will be assessed. Third, the role of HKDC1 in regulating glucose during human pregnancy will be investigated by testing the hypothesis that GDM-associated genetic variants alter regulation of HKDC1 in the pregnant environment. That hypothesis will be tested using novel high-throughput reporter assays (i) to discover the primary and secondary hormone and glucose response elements that regulate HKDC1 expression and (ii) to identify genetic variants that alter regulatory element function in the original GWAS population. The outcome of this proposal will be that HKDC1 encodes a novel hexokinase whose altered expression impacts glucose homeostasis during pregnancy. This outcome will provide new insight into glucose metabolism during pregnancy."
"9225197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world, but, with proper treatment, blindness can be avoided in the overwhelming majority of individuals. Our long-term goal is to improve the detection of early glaucomatous damage, as well as the detection of progression of such damage. We focus in large part on damage to the macula, the most important retinal region for everyday visual activities. The lack of knowledge about the nature and prevalence of glaucomatous damage of the macula is a major barrier to progress in this field.  In Aim 1a,c, we test hypotheses about the nature of macular damage using a combination of visual field perimetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and a cutting-edge imaging technique, adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO). In both Aims 1b and 2a, we use AO-SLO to directly view the retinal nerve fiber (RNF) bundles so as to better understand glaucomatous damage and its progression at the level of individual RNF bundles.  A second barrier to progress in the field is the sub-optimal clinical use of OCT. We attack this barrier in 4 ways. First, as part of Aim 1b, we compare AO-SLO images to OCT scans so as to improve the clinical utility of both spectral-domain (sd) and swept-source (ss) OCT, the widely available noninvasive, clinical techniques for assessing the integrity of the RNF layer. Our working hypothesis is that OCT scans contain information about local RNF bundle damage and that this information is currently going undetected. Second, in Aim 3c, we test the hypothesis that this damage can be better visualized with an en-face analysis of OCT scans than with the commonly used RNF layer thickness analyses. Third, in Aim 2b, we test the hypothesis that we can improve the detection of glaucomatous progression by focusing on local regions of damage, as seen on OCT scans of the optic disc. Finally, in Aim 3a, we test the hypothesis that the detection of glaucomatous damage can be improved if: 1. the OCT scans are carefully examined for local defects and algorithm failures; and 2. local thinning of both RNF and retinal ganglion cell layers, as seen with OCT cube scans, are topographically compared to local loss of visual field sensitivity, as seen with standard automated perimetry. In aim 3b, we compare this approach, which can be summarized in a single page, to other methods, including current clinical methods that use commercial reports and summary statistics."
"9405283","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The standard treatment for malignant glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) includes maximal surgical tumor resection followed by radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. However, recurrence rates of GBM and the associated patient mortality are nearly 100%. Despite the key role of tumor resection in clinical GBM therapy, most of the pre-clinical studies focus on treating solid intact intracranial GBM tumors without mimicking the clinical scenario of surgical resection. Therefore, implementation of tumor resection in mouse models that recapitulate the clinical disease features are critical in developing clinically translatable therapies for GBM. In the proposed studies, we will first create and characterize different GBM resection models using patient derived CD133+ GBMs based on 3 different phenotypes (invasive, semi-invasive and nodular). While resection of primary tumor has shown clinical benefit, systemically delivered chemotherapeutic agents or direct injection of viruses and placement of carmustine (BCNU) wafers in tumor resection cavities has provided very limited additional benefit. Based on our recent findings that encapsulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is necessary to prevent rapid wash- out of stem cells post-transplantation in the tumor resection cavity, we will encapsulate human MSC engineered to express in vitro and in vivo imaging markers into synthetic extracellular matrices (sECMs) and evaluate them for their retention, survival and tumor homing in mouse resection models of GBM with different phenotypes. Based on our preliminary studies which indicate that a novel anti-tumor agent consisting of a secretable version of epidermal growth factor receptor targeted nanobody fused to tumor necrosis factor apoptosis inducing ligand (Enb-TRAIL), induces GBM cell killing in both TRAIL resistant and sensitive GBMs, encapsulated MSC-Enb- TRAIL will be tested in different GBM models of resection. To ensure the safety of our approach, we will ultimately engineer human MSC-Enb-TRAIL to express HSV-thymidine kinase (TK), an activatable cellular suicide gene that will allow us to selectively eradicate MSC post-GBM treatment. The incorporation of genetically engineered fluorescent and bioluminescent imaging (BLI) markers into MSC and GBMs will allow us to follow GBM cell invasion, fate of MSC and pharmacokinetics of therapeutic proteins and their efficacy by in vivo BLI, intravital microscopy (IVM), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) and thus to fine tune the proposed approaches. Once validated, we will initiate a clinical study in which at the time of brain tumor surgery, the main tumor mass will be removed and sECMs encapsulated MSC will be introduced to target a broad spectrum of remaining tumor cells and micro-invasive tumor deposits in the brain. This will have a major impact in saving the lives of many brain cancer patients."
"9405955","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a first submission for an NHLBI K01 Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Faculty Diversity in Biomedical Research (RFA-HL-12-030) by Nia S. Mitchell, MD, MPH. Dr. Mitchell's overarching career goal is to be a leader in the development and implementation of weight loss programs to underserved populations. Her research proposal uses Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) as a model for generating new evidence of the effectiveness of community-based programs that provide services to underserved populations. Candidate: Dr. Mitchell is a board-certified internist and an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. She has completed a Master of Public Health degree and has conducted three database analyses of weight loss programs one of the TOPS program and two of the Weight Watchers program for Tennessee Medicaid recipients. She works closely with her primary mentor, James O. Hill, PhD, with whom she has one article in press and two currently under review. Training: The proposed K01 career development plan builds on prior experience from fellowship and early career development to focus on three areas that require additional training: 1) acquiring skills in geographic information systems (GIS); 2) improving skills in biostatistics, computer modeling, and subgroup analyses; and 3) improving skills in qualitative research methods. Accordingly, Dr. Mitchell proposes intensive topical mentorship, focused coursework, seminars, and contextual learning through the proposed research. These training activities will enable Dr. Mitchell to learn how to rigorously evaluate community-based programs that provide services to underserved populations. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Mitchell and her primary mentor, Dr. Hill, have assembled a strong mentorship team who will guide Dr. Mitchell through the proposed training and research activities. Additionally, Dr. Mitchell is the only underrepresented ethnic minority researcher at the Colorado Health and Wellness Center and she is the only researcher studying weight management interventions for underserved populations, which makes her a valuable asset to the Health and Wellness Center. Research: There is a pressing need to challenge the current paradigm of weight management programs, which has problems with affordability, weight loss maintenance, and implementation especially in low income and minority populations. This study will produce information of direct relevance to those working in clinical practice. Aim 1 will determine the reach of the TOPS program into underserved areas including those with low income and ethnic minority populations, which is essential to understanding the degree to which these populations are accessing the program. This aim will also help categorize chapters for subgroup analyses to determine the features that are associated with the variable effectiveness among chapters. Aim 2 will build upon Dr. Mitchell's prior research to determine the six-year effectiveness of the TOPS program as well as the differential effectiveness among chapters, which will allow Dr. Mitchell to rank chapters based on performance so they can be divided into quintiles and studied quantitatively in Aim 3. Aim 3 will provide a clear conceptual understanding of the implementation of the TOPS program as it discovers the chapter characteristics that influence performance and how these attributes might be modified to raise performance of chapters that serve low income populations to the highest levels. Summary: This project is innovative in several ways. Perhaps the most important way is that it offers a paradigm shift in weight management by applying scientific rigor to utilize the infrastructure of a national nonprofit organization. Instead of designing a new weight loss program with minimal infrastructure for wide- spread dissemination and implementation, it rigorously studies a program that is already present in thousands of communities across the country. This project will allow for a better understanding of the effectiveness of the TOPS program, especially in underserved populations, and allow Dr. Mitchell to maximize future implementation of the program in these populations. Conduct of this mentored research and training proposal, Evaluation of a Low Cost National Weight Loss Program in the Underserved, will facilitate Dr. Mitchell's development into a nationally-recognized independent investigator and leader conducting research that fundamentally changes and improves weight management in low income and minority populations.

"9217594","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 80,000 Americans are diagnosed with melanoma annually, leading to nearly 10,000 deaths. Despite recent progress in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, melanoma remains one of the deadliest human cancers and the vast majority of patients with advanced melanoma will die of their disease. Abnormal DNA methylation is nearly universal in melanoma, but the functional consequences and the role of DNA methylation in melanoma development is largely unknown. Our preliminary data from a genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma and human melanoma lines suggest important functional roles for DNA methylation in melanoma development and establishment of intratumor heterogeneity. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that DNA methylation is required for melanomagenesis and regulates melanoma sub-populations. Specific aims: This proposal is comprised of two specific aims. The first aim is focused on elucidating the role of the de-novo methyltransferase Dnmt3b in melanoma formation and growth. We will use a recently developed genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma (Braf/Pten) and tetracycline inducible Dnmt3b allele to study the effect on melanoma growth in vivo. We will also use RNAi to functionally evaluate the role of Dnmt3b in proliferation of human melanoma lines. To elucidate the mechanism of growth alterations that occurs with Dnmt3b loss, we will investigate the changes in PI3K/mTOR signaling. Furthermore, we will determine the mechanism of Dnmt3b upregulation in melanoma using a luciferase reporter assay and determine the value of Dnmt3b a prognostic biomarker, using quantitative immunofluorescence. The second aim will focus on the role of Dnmt3b and DNA methylation in melanoma tumor heterogeneity. Intratumor heterogeneity poses a significant challenge to cancer treatment in general, and may be an important factor that leads to primary drug resistance. The cellular mechanisms that give rise to and regulate intratumor heterogeneity are poorly understood, but epigenetic regulation including DNA methylation may play a central role in this process. Based on our preliminary data showing that treatment with 5-aza-dC, a DNA demethylating agent, dramatically alters the distribution of intratumor subsets, we hypothesize that DNA methylation by Dnmt3b plays key roles in defining and regulating tumor subsets in melanoma. We propose to investigate this hypothesis using flow cytometry, bisulfite sequencing, and quantitative immunofluorescence. Relevance: This project will evaluate the role of DNA methylation in melanoma formation, progression, establishment and maintenance of tumor heterogeneity. Results of proposed studies will advance our understanding of melanoma biology and could define DNA methyltransferases as therapeutic targets in melanoma."
"9251903","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of the proposed research is to determine the previously unrecognized role of the (long non-coding RNA) lncRNA NEAT1 (nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1) and its novel underlying mechanism in regulating the phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Many vascular diseases in humans, such as intimal hyperplasia post-angioplasty, are largely dependent upon VSMC phenotypic switching from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype that is associated with reduced smooth muscle-specific gene expression and increased cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, unraveling the mechanisms for the VSMC phenotypic switching is crucial for understanding the pathology of VSMC related vascular diseases and ultimately designing therapeutic agents for treatment. Emerging evidences demonstrate that lncRNAs represent a novel class of regulators for gene expression. In an effort to search for lncRNAs involved in the vascular injury, we conducted a large-scale lncRNA array screen using the rat carotid artery injured by a balloon denudation, a procedure resembling angioplasty in humans. This screen revealed that the lncRNA NEAT1 is induced in response to the arterial injury in vivo. Furthermore, expression of NEAT1 is also induced upon the stimulation of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation in vitro. Loss- and gain-of-function NEAT1 revealed that NEAT1 not only increases proliferation and migration of VSMCs but also decreases expression of smooth muscle-specific contractile proteins. Therefore, experiments described in this proposal will test the hypothesis that, the induction of NEAT1 plays a critical role in promoting smooth muscle phenotypic switching. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of NEAT1 in neointima hyperplasia following arterial injury. We will perform femoral artery wire injuries in the control and NEAT1 knock out mice and assess the effects of NEAT1 KO on the progression of neointima hyperplasia. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which NEAT1 abrogates smooth muscle-specific gene expression. Specifically we will evaluate the role of WDR5, a critical histone modifier for inducing an active form of chromatin, in mediating NEAT1 function in VSMCs. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanism by which the transcription of NEAT1 is up-regulated upon the stimulation of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation by testing the role of an evolutionally conserved cAMP response element identified in the NEAT1 proximal promoter. Completion of these studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms controlling smooth muscle phenotypic switching and determine if preventing the induction of NEAT1 may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for ameliorating occlusive vascular diseases."
"9223347","Project Abstract  We intend to validate [18F]FNDP for PET imaging of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in healthy human subjects. sEH is important in cerebrovascular pathophysiology in the context of mild cognitive impairment, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), Alzheimer?s disease, stroke and other conditions. Post-mortem studies have shown highly increased expression of cerebral sEH in patients with VCI, stroke and other disorders of the central nervous system. We developed [18F]FNDP to understand better and to quantify the vascular and potentially inflammatory components to these disorders non-invasively and to promote the development of new drugs targeting sEH, which are beginning to proliferate. Notably [18F]FNDP is the first and only radioligand highly specific for PET imaging of sEH, as we now show in rodent and non-human primate brain. The proposed imaging project addresses measurement of the availability and distribution of sEH throughout the human brain with fewer confounding variables than the post- mortem studies, and could be done repeatedly according to a variety of scenarios. Consonant with the format of the R21/R33 we will complete pre-clinical studies with [18F]FNDP during the R21 (eIND enabling) phase, including optimization and automation of the radiosynthesis, assessment of radiometabolites, calculation of dosimetry estimates, and determination of binding specificity in baboon brain. The R33 portion will involve first-in-human brain kinetic analysis, test- retest and whole body PET/CT-based human dosimetry. We have obtained independent funding for the toxicology studies also needed for the eIND. At the end of this project we will have a validated radiotracer targeting sEH, increasingly recognized as a key regulator of vasoactive phenomena within the brain, ready to be applied to a wide variety of conditions not heretofore studied directly and non-invasively in human subjects."
"9311171","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech- anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever- age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of vitamin D receptor, 1?-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran- domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti- tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam- mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa- tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se- quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi- fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum- mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy ? including immunotherapy ? with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC."
"9254579","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxytocin is known to regulate social behaviors, stress reactivity, mental health, cardiovascular and immune systems, in part through actions in the central and autonomic nervous systems. Preliminary studies have shown that exposure to exogenous synthetic oxytocin in early life can have long-lasting, epigenetic effects on behavior, neural systems and genes that are dependent on endogenous oxytocin. The proposed translational research will provide the first animal model specifically aimed at testing the behavioral, endocrine, autonomic and epigenetic consequences of exposure to oxytocin associated with the birth process. Although it is likely that many systems throughout the body are affected by oxytocin, we will focus initially on neural processes and genetic pathways known to be sensitive to endogenous oxytocin, including the expression of genes for oxytocin and the related peptide, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and selected receptors for each of these. Using a series of interrelated projects we will examine the consequences of (a) exposure during birth to synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin), commonly used to induce or augment later, and (b) blocking the oxytocin receptor by exposure to oxytocin antagonists (OTA), used to slow the birth process. The specific objectives of this proposal are: (1) to develop a translational animal paradigm designed to model and study selected features of human birth-interventions, (2) to test the hypothesis that the functional presence or absence of the neuropeptide, oxytocin associated with birth will influence the behavior and brain of the offspring, with effects on the oxytocin/AVP  pathway (including genes for the peptides and their receptors), (3) to gain a deeper knowledge of neural mechanisms which may be affected by birth-related interventions, and (4) to identify specific epigenetic consequences of oxytocin and other birth-related interventions. Both males and females will be tested, allowing us to examine the hypothesis that the effects of birth-related interventions may be sexually dimorphic. These studies also will test the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms, based initially on methylation of DNA for the oxytocin receptor {OXTR), allow the epigenome to be transformed by the birth experience. The newly developed paradigms described here can be used to discover the epigenetic consequences of birth interventions and improve methods for optimizing birth outcomes. Data from this study also will inform the present understanding of the normal developmental biology of social and emotional behaviors and will aid in the evaluation of the consequences for infants of treatments commonly used to manipulate the human birth process. These studies also will increase our basic understanding of neural, autonomic, endocrine and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie fundamental mammalian behaviors, including social behaviors, emotion regulation, and behaviors indicative of anxiety and depression. The animal model used here will be the prairie vole, which has a human-like autonomic nervous system, a social system characterized by high levels of sociality and all parental behavior, long- lasting pair bonds and high levels of oxytocin Measures to be taken in later life include indices of (a) social and emotional behaviors, (b) endocrine changes including measures of endogenous oxytocin and AVP and gene expression (mRNA) for their receptors using PCR, (c) autonomic nervous system function measured by radio telemetry and indexed by heart rate and rhythmic changes in heart rate mediated by vagal efferent pathways, (d) changes in neural activation and circuitry as measured by functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in response to social cues, and (e) measures of epigenetic modifications of the offspring's genome, using a detailed analysis of CpG DNA methylation of genes in the oxytocin pathway, such as OXTR."
"9401309","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since its inception in 1984, the Behavioral Science Training in Drug Abuse Research Program (BST) has become one of the nation's largest and oldest NRSA training programs, specializing in behavioral science research on drug abuse and related issues, especially HIV/AIDS and criminal justice. The BST program has trained 185 predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees-nearly half of them racial/ethnic minorities. This application requests authorization to maintain the current levels of appointments (7 postdoctoral and 9 predoctoral trainees) during each of Years 31 to 35. The BST program operates in a trans-academic environment and involves four collaborating institutions: Public Health Solutions, the grant administrator; National Development and Research Institutes, Inc. (NDRI), the training site; NYU's Center for HIV and Drug Use Research (a collaborating agency with NDRI); and the Department of Sociomedical Sciences in the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University, the university affiliate. The Principal Investigator, Dr. Gregory Falkin has managed the BST program for 28 years; he works closely with Dr. George De Leon, the program's Scientific Director, in all aspects of scientific and administrative operations. The BST core faculty consists of 45 leading researchers from the 4 participating organizations who provide highly structured and rigorous mentoring for BST trainees. The BST mission is to prepare behavioral scientists, especially racial/ethnic minorities, for careers in drug abuse research and allied fields. This is accomplished by (1) recruiting and appointing promising scientists, at least one third of whom are minorities, for traineeships; (2) providing advanced training in substantive topics including theory, research methods and practices, and the responsible conduct of research; and, (3) mentoring and advising trainees on their careers as well as their research and NIH grant submissions while in BST. In addition to a variety of weekly seminars and workshops, trainees participate regularly in supervised research-ample opportunities exist on about 180 grants and contracts of BST core faculty-and are encouraged to develop and conduct their own independent research. In addition to operating in a quasi-academic environment, distinguishing features of the BST program are that trainees comprise a multidisciplinary group from a wide range of behavioral disciplines, have the flexibility to choose the projects they will apprentice on from a large number of NIH studies, are encouraged to work on independent research, and postdocs are required to submit their own grant applications to NIDA. Together, these key features make BST a truly unique T32 training program. The BST's long-standing success is evident in the significant contributions of its 170 graduates and 15 current fellows. Many former trainees have distinguished themselves through research and publications-the number of publications by current and former trainees is conservatively estimated at over 1,250. BST trainees have been funded as PIs on over 30 grants from NIH, been Co-investigators on more than 40 NIH-funded projects, and obtained over 100 grants from other sources."
"9273813","The relationship between protein structure and function is fundamental for understanding the biological mechanisms that contribute to disease pathogenesis. Proteins are dynamic molecules that are capable of changing their shape, or conformation, in response to changes in their environment and upon ligand binding. Many important therapeutic protein targets undergo conformational change as part of their molecular mechanism of action. Recent drug development strategies have been focused on understanding the effects of small molecules on protein conformation, prompting efforts to rationally design specific and potent conformation-disrupting inhibitors. Thus, tools that can measure conformational changes induced by low- molecular weight modulators are necessary to accelerate the pace of basic research and the drug discovery process. We propose to acquire a Biodesy Delta system to complement the protein structure and characterization equipment that is currently available to investigators in the San Francisco Bay Area Region. The Biodesy Delta platform is based on an optical phenomenon called Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) which can be used to very precisely measure protein conformational changes in real-time following analyte binding or exposure to environmental stimuli. The system can work with any protein target, regardless of size, and a wide variety of ligands, including small molecules, fragments, proteins and mixtures. This high-throughput, automated method can be utilized to analyze thousands of wells per day, as opposed to standard methods that are low-throughput and labor intensive. The SHG conformational signatures provide a high-resolution means of mapping compound structures to function (e.g., activity data) via protein conformation. As a result, the Biodesy platform can be used to enhance primary screening and follow-up work, including protein structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Preliminary data that was generated by the major users demonstrates the utility of the SHG method for conducting initial library screening, as well as dose-response measurements, washout experiments, and real-time kinetics for hit triage. The proposed research will be conducted by 4 major PIs who oversee 16 NIH-funded grants. Additionally, 9 minor users will employ the technology in their current research projects. By obtaining the technology proposed in this grant, San Francisco Bay Area regional researchers will be uniquely positioned to accelerate protein characterization and drug discovery efforts. This tool will help revolutionize the understanding of the complex ligand-protein interactions that affect disease pathways which should ultimately lead to discovery of new therapeutics to improve human health."

"9333612","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is especially deadly due to the lack of early detection and effective therapies. The unique plasticity of differentiation states of PDA, starting at tumor formation and continuing throughout tumor progression and metastasis, may be partially responsible for the recalcitrance of PDA to current therapies. Exposing the true identity of the normal cell origin(s) of PDA may help us characterize differentiation pathways run awry in the pancreatic oncogenesis and teach us how to approach the disease. By interrogating the earliest steps of tumor formation, we may learn to design new therapies to constrain or even reverse the aberrant differentiation that is an intrinsic part of the devastating PDA.  In this application we will focus on pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), one of the three precancerous lesions of PDA. Patients with PDA derived from IPMN often face better prognosis than those derived from PanIN (Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias), and the underlying reason for the differential prognosis is not understood. In this application we will in Aim 1: determine the cell of origin of IPMN and genes/pathways that may regulate the dichotomy of PanIN and IPMN development. In Aim 2: investigate if DCLK1+ cells share the same cell of origin as IPMN tumor cells and if they are potential therapeutic targets.  One major challenge in caring for IPMN patients is to identify those who would benefit from surgical intervention. Despite the Sendai guidelines, the management of branch BD-IPMN under the guidelines regarding surgery or surveillance is not always deemed adequate or satisfactory. In contrast to PanINs, which are difficult to identify and monitor clinically, IPMNs represent a unique opportunity to block the progression of pancreatic tumor before an incurable invasive cancer develops. Additional biomarkers to assist with the identification of malignancy (invasive carcinoma or high-grade dysplasia) and in making the surgical decision would be highly desirable. Therefore in Aim 3, using both our newly reported genetically engineered mouse model for IPMN and human samples, we seek to identify protein biomarkers in sera exosomes that can aid in making these difficult clinical decisions and/or impact IPMN growth and progression.  The success of the application will magnify our knowledge of an understudied pancreatic precancerous lesion, which hopefully will not only result in better treatment and detection for patients with PDA derived from IPMN, but will also those with PDA associated with PanIN."
"9233895","DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): A major conceptual advance in innate immunity is the discovery of Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRR), which profoundly shape adaptive immunity to affect host response to pathogens. Major PRRs crucial for  innate immunity against viral pathogens include toll-like receptors and RIG-I like receptors, while the role for  NLR (nucleotide-binding leucine rich repeat containing, or NOD-like receptor) family in viral infection  is just  emerging. In this Program, we will focus on the revelation of novel nucleic acid sensing pathways relevant to multiple NIAID priority pathogens. The Program is comprised of three Projects, each led by an international leader in his/her field. The Program will be performed in a highly collaborative fashion with two Cores which will provide cutting edge proteomics and protein purification capabilities, headed by directors who have contributed seminal work in the field of PRRs. The overarching goals are:       * To investigate the role of novel PRRs as receptors of viral nucleic acid which affect subsequent innate immune responses to NIAID high priority viral pathogens in human.       * To apply cutting edge quantitative proteomic approaches for the identification of novel paradigm-shifting pathways of pathogen sensing.       * To contrast and compare role of PRRs across diverse NIAID high priority human viruses.       * To reveal cross-talk between multiple PRRs in host response to NIAID priority human viruses       * To investigate intracellular trafficking of viral ligands to sites of recognition by PRRs.       * To capitalize on unique biochemical capabilities that are technically challenging to quantify the ligand-binding functions of PRRs.       *  To maximize opportunities for validating experimental findings with primary human materials.       These goals are highly response to the RFA-AI-12-048 and are in precise concordance with the stated purpose of the RFA that emphasis of research proposed in response to this FOA should be in defining novel cellular and molecular immune mechanisms involved in immunity to virus infection. It is also responsive because the pathways explored are broadly relevant to multiple high priority pathogens and will be studied in the context of five high priority RNA and DNA viruses. Finally, the proposed work is responsive to the purpose of the RFA because it specifically expands our understanding of novel PRR interaction with viruses and the accompanied changes in signaling pathways by profiling proteomic modifications in human innate immune cells caused by NIAID priority viral pathogens."
"9206993","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9328253","PROJECT SUMMARY  AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptor in the central nervous system. Dynamic regulation of the density, subunit composition and trafficking of AMPARs into and out of excitatory synapses is a key mechanism to facilitate changes in synaptic strength important for various forms of synaptic plasticity relevant to learning and memory. Over the last twenty years, work from Huganir Laboratory and others has made significant contributions to uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic targeting of AMPARs that strengthens (long-term potentiation, LTP) or weakens (long-term depression, LTD) synaptic transmission. These studies have contributed to the prevailing model of LTP, whereby subunit-specific protein interactions and post-translational modifications within the cytosolic, carboxy (C)-terminus of AMPARs facilitate the trafficking of AMPARs to synapses and thereby enhance synaptic transmission. Recent work challenged this model and the requirement for the C-termini of AMPARs, as well as their interacting partners, to mediate LTP. It was found that not only could AMPAR mutants that lack the C- terminal domain rescue LTP in mice deficient all AMPARs (GluA1-A3), but so could GluK1, which belongs to the distinct, Kainate subclass of ionotropic glutamate receptors not normally found at these synapses. While these data remain a topic of debate, AMPA and Kainate receptors shared conserved structural architecture in their extracellular domains, raising the intriguing and less explored possibility that the extracellular domains of specific AMPAR subunits might also play key roles in regulating the synaptic targeting of the receptors.  In this research proposal we will investigate the hypothesis that synaptic targeting of AMPARs required to induce long-term changes in synaptic strength is bi-directionally regulated by coordinated protein-protein interactions with the N- and C-termini. To test this hypothesis we have developed an assay that uses proximity- labeling with APEX2-tagged to the N- or C-termini of AMPAR subunits to perform an unbiased, proteomic screen to identify proteins that endogenously interact with either the extracellular or intracellular domains of GluA1- and GluA2-containing AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. Selected candidate proteins that demonstrate validated, dynamic and specific interactions with AMPAR subunits will be further characterized using overexpression and knockdown approaches to evaluate their role in regulating the synaptic targeting and function of AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. By identifying and characterizing new, functionally-relevant interactions between synaptic proteins and AMPARs, the proposed research will provide significant insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity relevant to learning, memory and higher brain function. Further, these studies have broad implications for brain disorders involving synaptic dysfunction as they might reveal novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases."
"9309867","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in American women. It is estimated that over 240,000 new breast cancer patients will be diagnosed, and approximately 40,000 patients will die each year in the U.S. Breast cancer is characterized by uncontrolled growth of breast epithelial cells, which can detach, migrate, and invade to other organs causing metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer are not yet fully understood. One subtype of metastatic breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), is the most aggressive and the most difficult to treat. Therefore, development of new treatments is important in eliminating the mortality and morbidity associated with metastatic breast cancer.  Breast cancer develops due to dysregulated gene expression, dysfunctional DNA-damage repair pathways, and is also affected by environmental factors, which epigenetically regulate gene expression and DNA repair pathways. Epigenetic modifiers, such as Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, are crucial in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis by modifying histones and non-histone proteins. One member of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), EZH2, specifically methylates histone H3 protein at lysine 27 to regulate gene expression and is upregulated in invasive breast carcinomas and metastatic breast cancer. High expression levels of EZH2 are strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. The DNA repair protein, PARP1, is also upregulated in breast cancer, but PARP1 inhibitors have been limited to BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (Breast Cancer 1 or 2)-deficient breast cancer patients (5-10% of all breast cancer cases). EZH2 can actually impair DNA damage repair. However, whether EZH2 and other members of PRC2 regulate PARP1 is unknown. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that PRC2 proteins methylate PARP1 lysines, repressing DNA repair activity, and act as PARP1 co-factors in TNBC and the DNA damage response by recruiting PARP1 to genomic loci. Overexpression of EZH2 and PARP1 together may promote TNBC progression, and inhibition of both EZH2 and PARP1 may benefit TNBC patients. Aim 1 will determine whether PRC2 proteins directly interact with PARP1, methylate lysines of PARP1, and repress its activity. The preliminary data strongly suggests that PRC2 proteins and PARP1 coordinate their expression and oncogenic function in TNBC. Therefore, how this complex regulatory network operates between PRC2 and PARP1 and whether this network contributes to the progression of TNBC through DNA repair mechanisms will be investigated (Aim 2). In addition, combined inhibition of EZH2 and PARP1, using commercially available inhibitors, may synergistically and significantly reduce TNBC than either single agent alone (Aim 3). Although the focus of this proposal is to target TNBC, this type of therapy could lead to a breakthrough for other subtypes of breast cancer as well and can have a global impact on ending breast cancer."
"9240473","Project Summary/Abstract: Facilitating completeness in children?s maltreatment disclosures  Child maltreatment is one of the most serious threats to children?s well-being. However, substantial percentages of children either fail to disclose abuse or provide unconvincing disclosures. In order to justify legal intervention, decision-makers expect children to disclose abuse without excessive prompting, but also to provide sufficient details about time, number, and physical interactions to convince adults that abuse occurred. Interviewers are unsure how to elicit such details; children appear unlikely to produce them spontaneously, but extensive questioning risks error and miscommunication. Given the critical importance of maltreated children?s disclosure for the protection of children, it is imperative to identify the most sensitive interviewing approaches. The proposed program of research will involve a series of novel laboratory and field studies designed to identify interviewing methods that help maltreated children provide complete reports. The project has two aims: 1) To maximize children?s capacity and willingness to disclose adult transgressions; and 2) To identify optimal question types for eliciting details about time, number, and physical interactions. The aims will be achieved through five projects. Project 1 will identify and assess field methods for eliciting maltreatment disclosures and details about time, number, and physical interactions. It will involve detailed analysis of trial testimonies and forensic interviews with children. Project 2 will test the efficacy of novel interviewing methods in eliciting transgression disclosures, and Project 3 will identify optimal question types for eliciting details about time, number, and physical interactions. Projects 2 and 3 will involve laboratory experimental studies with children who are questioned about suspected transgressions. Valenced questions (questions about ?something bad? or ?the worst thing?), paired yes/no questions (yes/no questions followed by a requests for elaboration), and open- ended questions about time, number, and physical interactions will be assessed for their effect on the completeness of children?s disclosures. Project 4 will experimentally assess adults? perceptions of children?s disclosures and denials of transgressions. It will involve laboratory experimental studies with adults asked for their evaluation of children questioned utilizing the techniques tested in Projects 2 and 3. Project 5 will test the efficacy of novel interviewing methods in field experiments with children disclosing sexual and physical abuse. In addition to the techniques described above, it will test the efficacy of conversation questions (questions about the child?s conversations with the suspect), the subject of our currently funded research. Our research program is unique: it combines field observational research, laboratory experimental research, and field experimental research in an attempt to identify the most successful child interviewing approaches. The research provides an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of child development and provide critical insight into best practice for professionals who interview children. It promises to improve interviewing, and in turn to enable child professionals to better protect children and their families."
"9230337","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricemia.  Over the past few decades, growing evidence supports that gout and hyperuricemia are independently associated with an increased risk of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, metabolic syndrome including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and mortality. Several studies suggest that the excess mortality in gout patients is attributable to cardiovascular disease. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI), including allopurinol and febuxostat, lower serum uric acids and are common treatments for gout. Allopurinol has been shown to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive adolescents and improve endothelial function. Furthermore, an animal model showed a beneficial effect of allopurinol on metabolic syndrome. However, to date, it remains largely unknown whether XOIs decrease risks of gout-associated conditions such as MI and T2DM. The primary objective of this proposal is to produce high-quality evidence on the effect of XOI in preventing MI and T2DM in gout patients. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of XOI on the risk of incident MI in patients with gout, 2) to investigate the effect of XOI on the risk of incident T2DM in patients with gout and 3) to estimate the effect of XOI on MI and T2DM adjusted for treatment adherence in patients with gout. The proposed study will use data from the United HealthCare insurance claims databases (2004-2013) linked to laboratory test results, and utilize a number of rigorous and innovative approaches for pharmacoepidemiologic research and causal inference to study the effects of XOI on MI and T2DM risks. Given the increasing interest in big data and data linkage in clinical research, it is important to understand the value of using a claims database linked to outpatient lab test results for pharmacoepidemiologic research and to determine the best strategy to incorporate lab data for further confounding control. This proposed study will make an important contribution because it will be the first and largest to investigate the effects of XOI on major medical conditions such as MI and T2DM, adjusting for adherence. Furthermore, the proposed, advanced and innovative epidemiologic methods will extend our understanding of how to deal with confounding by indication, time-varying selection bias, and missing data on laboratory test values in pharmacoepidemiologic research."
"9225209","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decisions about visual stimuli are frequently shaped by inputs from other sensory modalities. The goal of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms that enable integration of visual and auditory inputs for decision-making. Behavioral experiments have established that subjects can integrate information across sensory modalities to make better decisions. Further, subjects weight each sensory modality in proportion to its reliability. Experimenters can estimate subjects' perceptual weights by presenting conflicting information to two sensory modalities and examining the degree to which decisions are biased toward one modality or the other. Despite a wealth of data about the behavioral consequences of multisensory stimuli, much remains unknown about the underlying neural mechanisms. By collecting electrophysiological and behavioral data together, we are in an ideal position to connect multisensory decision-making to its underlying neural mechanism. My central hypothesis is that neurons will show greater stimulus-driven modulation for multisensory stimuli than for unisensory stimuli and that the neural weights that we estimate by comparing unisensory and multisensory responses will be similar for reliable and unreliable stimuli. The posterior parietal cortex is a candidate area for supporting multisensory improvements in rats: it receives inputs from auditory/visual areas and plays a role in motor planning. In Aim 1, we will estimate humans' and rats' perceptual weights on a novel decision-making task in which subjects judge the overall rate of a stream of events: i.e. flashes, clicks or both together. In Aim 2, we will collect electrophysiological data from posterior parietal corte of rats while they are engaged in the task to establish that responses reflect decision-related activity. In Aim 3, we will measure responses for unisensory vs. multisensory stimuli at different levels of stimulus reliability. For each level of reliability, we will estimate the neural weights that describe the degree of stimulus-driven modulation for auditory vs. visual inputs. If the neural weights, like the perceptual weights, change with reliability, this would suggest that stimulus reliability is explicitly encoded by single neurons. If, instead, the neural weights remain unchanged for high- vs. low-reliability stimuli, this would suggest that reliability is automaticaly encoded by a population response that naturally become more variable when it has a lower gain. The latter possibility is predicted by an optimal model of decision-making."
"9308638","Human Epidermal Growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) is overexpressed in 20-25% of breast cancers. Targeting Her2 using antibodies, kinase inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates has improved outcomes for patients bearing this subtype of breast cancer. However, Her2-targeted therapies suffer from the drawbacks of inherent and acquired resistance, leading to metastatic disease relapse and patient lethality. Recent studies, by our lab and others have begun to establish that the mechanisms that drive metastasis are similarly essential in facilitating resistance to targeted molecular therapies. These mechanisms broadly fall under the processes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the similarities and differences between drug-induced EMT and those induced by known physiologic mediators of EMT, such as TGF-?, remain poorly defined. Therefore, the overall OBJECTIVE of the proposed studies is to identify and target molecules that are similarly regulated during metastasis-associated EMT and drug-induced EMT as a means to develop therapies that specifically target drug resistant metastases. To this end, our preliminary studies have compared the gene expression profiles generated from models of Her2-therapy resistance with our established models of metastasis that are specifically driven by TGF-?-induced EMT. This approach has yielded critical genes that are involved in cellular production and sensing of alternate growth factor pathways and the extracellular matrix. The current application focuses on fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), two potently upregulated genes in both Her2-therapy resistance and EMT-driven metastatic progression. Directed overexpression of FGFR1 has validated the FGF2:FGFR1 signaling axis as capable of facilitating resistance to the clinically used Her2/EGFR kinase inhibitor Lapatinib. Therefore, AIM1 of our proposal will utilize several molecular and genetic approaches to establish the transcriptional mechanisms that are responsible for EMT- driven expression of FGFR1. Members of this transcriptional network will be evaluated across patient tumor samples and correlated to patient outcome. The most recently approved Her2-targeted therapy is the antibody- drug conjugate Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1). We observe T-DM1 to produce dramatic regression of established Her2+ tumors, but minimal residual disease (MRD) remains detectable by bioluminescence and after a period of dormancy eventually grows out and is resistant to T-DM1. In AIM2 we will utilize inducible models of FGFR expression to elucidate its role in the survival and eventual outgrowth of T-DM1 resistant MRD. Finally, together with our collaborators we have recently established the in vivo application of FIIN4, a novel covalent kinase inhibitor of FGFR. Therefore, in AIM3 we will continue our use of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of Her2+ breast cancer to establish therapies utilizing this next-generation compound in combination with Lapatinib and T-DM1. These preclinical studies will establish combination therapies targeting Her2 and FGFR as capable of eradicating metastatic and primary breast cancer."
"9234037","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overwhelming infection and sepsis causing many vital organs to fail remains a leading cause of mortality in America's children and in children the world over. Present management includes antibiotics to kill germs and the use of organ support machines for failing organs without any standard use of inflammation based therapies. Among the children who receive this standard of care approach many live but too many others die. The reasons for these divergent outcomes remain an important knowledge gap. We wondered whether insight might be gained from considering the very different approach used in inflammation induced multi system organ failure caused by rheumatologic disease. Standard of care in pediatric rheumatology identifies inflammation pathobiology phenotypes unique to rheumatologic disease and then uses phenotype specific therapies directed to reducing inflammation reflected by biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin. Examining this paradigm in sepsis, we performed a single center study and found that three inflammation pathobiology phenotypes unique to sepsis were related to death from multiple organ failure. Furthermore, evolution of CRP and ferritin responses within these phenotypes was associated with outcome. We propose to assess the clinical relevance of these observations to the nation's children by performing an observational cohort study in 400 sepsis patients recruited from within the NICHD Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) addressing three specific aims: 1) Determine the incidence and outcomes of three unique sepsis MOF phenotypes: Thrombocytopenia Associated MOF defined by three organ failure with new onset thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, and an ADAMTS 13 activity < 57%; Immunoparalysis / Lymphoid Depletion associated MOF defined by an ex vivo whole blood endotoxin stimulated TNF response < 200 pg/mL after 3 days; and Sequential MOF defined by respiratory distress followed by liver dysfunction with sFasL level > 200 ng/mL, in children with severe sepsis; 2) Determine the relative contribution of genetic and environmental risk factors to the development of each of these three sepsis induced MOF phenotypes; and 3) Demonstrate that systemic inflammation reflected by CRP and / or Ferritin levels is increased in children with these sepsis induced MOF phenotypes with changes in CRP and Ferritin levels over time being associated with outcomes. If national outcomes are found to be related to this spectrum of inflammation pathobiology and systemic inflammation biomarker responses then further studies of use of phenotype specific therapies directed to normalizing CRP and Ferritin levels in children with severe sepsis induced MOF will be warranted."
"9392268","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery continues to be the most common and costly post-operative complication. Despite rigorous investigation of POAF by physicians and scientists, significant gaps remain in our understanding as to why it occurs, and specifically why it only occurs in certain patients. Our laboratory has obtained exciting preliminary data showing that high activity of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO), a mitochondrial outer membrane-bound enzyme and substantial generator of H2O2 in atrial myocardium, is strongly correlated with POAF independent of other known risk factors. So are, to a lesser extent, glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), both critical for maintaining intracellular redox balance. These enzymes were all measured in discarded right atrial appendage (RAA) obtained during cardiac surgery. From a mechanistic perspective, these findings are compelling and scientifically plausible because they integrate catecholamine overload, mitochondrial dysfunction and redox imbalance in the atrial myocardium, all factors in the peri-operative period that are known to contribute to arrhythmogenesis. In the current proposal, by obtaining tissue and performing analyses using a much larger cohort of cardiac surgery patients, we will build on this highly promising data in order to establish a statistical model of POAF risk based on MAO as a predictive biomarker, and to elucidate mechanisms connecting elevated MAO activity in right atrium to POAF by focusing specifically on mitochondrial energetics in the atrial cardiomyocytes. In Aim 1, we will validate MAO as a predictive biomarker of POAF, alone or in combination with other redox enzymes, by obtaining the RAA tissue intra-operatively from a large cohort (N=770) of adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery and immediately measuring activity of these enzymes. As an exploratory component of this Aim we will examine if MAO and/or GPx in platelets and RBC's, respectively, obtained pre- operatively from this same cohort of patients, can alternatively be used as predictive biomarkers of POAF. In Aim 2, using a much smaller subset of the patient cohort recruited for Aim 1, we will begin to dissect mechanisms by which high MAO activity in atrium leads to POAF by focusing on the interaction between MAO and mitochondrial function in atrial myocardium. Thus, these studies will have both a practical, applied research component (Aim 1) as well as a basic research component (Aim 2). It is anticipated that the findings from the first Aim will have immediate and sustained clinical impact because they will provide clinicians the ability to predict with high probability which patients are predisposed and therefor at high risk to develop POAF. This would create a pathway to specifically target the 'high-risk' patients with prophylactic anti- arrhythmic medication in the near future. We expect the findings from our basic research on interactions between cardiac MAO and mitochondrial energetics to enhance our understanding of mechanisms connecting high levels of MAO activity in right atrium to POAF."
"9245564","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Medication non-adherence is common and a serious threat to patient safety, individual health and well-being. Currently, healthcare professionals lack evidence-based guidelines regarding the relative efficacy of medication management strategies (including devices and technologies). Further, most medication management and adherence tasks are performed at home, however, the role of the home environment in supporting medication management is poorly understood. A better understanding of the current medication practices of visually impaired persons served by VA Healthcare, and the relative efficacy of these practices as they are employed in the home context, will allow greater specificity in targeting real-world interventions. OBJECTIVE: The overarching objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of medication management strategies currently employed in the home environments of visually impaired veterans relative to age and regimen matched non-visually impaired veterans. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) identify the number and types of medication management strategies used in the home-environment, and 2) compare the extent to which these strategy-types and strategy-combinations predict adequate medication management and adherence among visually impaired and matched non-visually impaired veterans. We hypothesize that greater frequency of strategy use supported by the home-environment will predict greater likelihood of adequate medication management (DRUGS score >95%) and adherence (Morisky >6; CMG <20%) among the visually impaired participants (n=40) than non-visually impaired matched comparisons (n=40). RESEARCH PLAN & METHODS: We will evaluate the efficacy of medication management strategies via multiple indicators of medication adherence using both performance-based assessment and administrative data analysis with interview and self-report measures. These measures will allow us to capture capacity (i.e., skills for managing medications), actual adherence behavior (i.e., refill adherence) and self-reported adherence as outcomes. In addition we will assess strategy use in the home environment by recording strategy types (what is used), their implementation (how used), locations in the home in which they are applied (where used) and routine and time based links to location (when used). We will measure demographic, psychosocial, visual and cognitive predictors of adherence to identify important covariates of strategy use and efficacy. Veterans with visual impairment (n=40) and age and regimen matched Veterans without visual impairment (n=40) will be enrolled to complete 2 study visits of approximately 2 hours each. Potentially interested participants will respond to posted flyers or a letter by phone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interventions that promote adherence are likely to increase the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the health system. The multivariate approach in this study, will allow us to collect the efficacy data needed to inform an evidence-based medication management toolkit comprised of patient-centered strategies that are targeted to users based on individual, interpersonal and environmental characteristics and will be tested in a subsequent controlled trial proposal with veterans newly diagnosed with vision loss. Targeted interventions to support the health self-management of veterans with visual impairment, particularly medication management and adherence, will optimize health, independence and ensure the best possible quality of life."
"9260804","PLANNING AND EVALUATION     The NYUCI has engaged in continuous strategic planning across the entire cancer enterprise at the NYU Langone Medical Center. Accomplishments include the new Epidemiology and Cancer Control Research Program that is the center of the Institute's population sciences research, and through partnership with David Levy, PhD, Assistant Dean for Collaborative Sciences, developed the Medical Center's initiative to invest $26m in the strategic expansion of and oversight of shared core facilities. Results from this partnership included a new Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource, an established RNAi Shared Resource, new technologies for the Genome Technology Center including next generation sequencing, a completely revised Proteomics Shared Resource, an enhanced Biorepository Center Shared Resource that is an outgrowth of the TABs facility previously hou.sed in the Experimental Pathology Shared Resource, and the complete redesign of the Core Clinical Laboratory, through a merger with a similar service of the CTSA, into a vibrant Translational Research Laboratory Shared Resource.    Through strategic efforts, the Cancer Institute invested heavily in clinical research infrastructure to support access to and accrual of patients to clinical research protocols at Bellevue Cancer Center that led to an almost 50% increase in accrual to clinical trials since the previous review. Organizationally, the Cancer Institute merged the Divisions of Hematology and Medical Oncology to create the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology housed in the Institute and recruited the Division Chief. Owen O'Connor, MD, PhD was recruited and named the new Division Chief in 2010, yet returned to Columbia University this year. Recruitment for a new division chief is currently underway. NYUCI leadership developed this organizational structure to create full alignment of mission and vision, and the ability to effect change quickly to take full advantage of the unique academic, financial and community resources to meet the needs of our members and to achieve the overall goals of the Institute.    Senior Leadership recognizes the importance of transparency in planning initiatives, and supports several venues to involve membership in both the planning and evaluative process. Since the last review, the NYUCI held a senior leadership retreat and updated the original Strategic Plan in 2010, (approved in 1999 and amended in 2002, 2004, and 2008); chaired an internal shared resource evaluation July, 2011; re-evaluated membership criteria; expanded the External Advisory Board (EAB) membership to include expertise in epigenetics, radiation oncology, prevention and control, and cancer center leadership; brought in ad hoc consultants to advise on our population sciences initiatives; reviewed and evaluated research programs; cochaired the committee that planned and implemented the institutional investment and development of an Office of Collaborative Sciences to manage shared core facilities; and was instrumental in the institutional planning process to build a new community cancer center at the Woodhull Medical Center, in Brooklyn, a sister New York City public hospital of Bellevue Hospital. Funds over the past five years supported the EAB, planning meetings to develop scientific rigor and collaborations in population sciences, and to host the annual NYU Cancer Institute Translational Research Retreat."
"9233889","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects an estimated 5.4 million Americans costing the society more than $160 billion annually, and this figure is expected to triple by the middle of the century. This emphasizes the urgent need for efficacious therapies for the treatment, delay of progression, or prevention of AD. A major proinflammatory molecule which levels are increased in the AD brain is TNF alpha (TNF? Preliminary data obtained after administration of high doses of the TNF?ntagonist thalidomide to APP23 transgenic mice showed decreased brain TNF?evels, plaque number, and amyloid beta loads. These data were the basis to conduct an NIA-sponsored human AD pilot study with thalidomide at our clinical research center. However, patients on high doses of thalidomide experience pronounced adverse events. This led us to search for safer and less toxic alternatives for chronic administration for AD treatment, and we identified the FDA-approved anti-cancer drug lenalidomide as a very promising candidate. We hypothesize that lenalidomide can significantly decrease AD-like neuropathology by modulating chronic inflammation and BACE1 levels. Overall, our project is designed to 1- identify the most efficient regimen to reduce chronic brain inflammation and amyloid burden; 2- assess the potency of lenalidomide to treat tau pathology independently and in presence of A?eposits; and 3- dissect the main molecular mechanisms underlying lenalidomide-mediated reduction in AD-like pathology. To reach these goals, we will use a combination of AD transgenic mouse models and extensive cell culture work. If successful, our project will provide critical information regarding the potential of lenalidomide t treat AD. Since lenalidomide is FDA-approved for human malignancies treatment, repurposing this drug would help provide the pre-clinical underpinnings for translation into clinical trials aiming at using patient-acceptable regimens. We strongly believe that the combination of the PI, mentors, consultants, and the environment are perfectly fitted for this career development award project. The PI is a young neuroscientist with a very good publication record and is extremely motivated by this project that will continue to develop a very promising career in drug pre-clinica development related neuronal disorders. In addition, the project will provide him a path towards independence. His mentors are experts in Alzheimer's mouse models (Dr. Oddo), and in clinical diagnosis of neuronal disorders and clinical trials (Dr. Sabbagh and Dr. Reiman). Along with Drs. Coleman, Lahiri, and Chen, they will teach new techniques and working methods to the PI. The in-house training will be completed by attending international trainings in drug discovery and development, as well as scientific meetings. Banner Research is fully supportive of this application. Collectively, all the factors are assembled for the success of the project which is highly significant to the NIA's mission, and for the development of the PI as an independent scientist who will apply first hand all the training associated with this award throughout his career."
"9203054","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inherited enamel malformations are caused by defects in genes essential for dental enamel formation and are grouped together under the collective designation of Amelogenesis Imperfecta, or AI. AI is a serious condition and may be associated with health problems in other parts of the body. AI patients are often self- conscious because of the disfiguring appearance of their teeth. They have lower self-esteem and perceive themselves as having an inferior quality of life. They avoid cold food and drinks. Some undergo extensive dental rehabilitation procedures, but the majorities simply suffer the effects of the disease. There are numerous forms of AI, each caused by defects in a different gene. In syndromic forms of AI, enamel malformations are accompanied by serious, sometimes hidden systemic problems, like blindness, kidney calcifications, immunodeficiency, or skin blistering. Isolated and syndromic forms of AI often cannot be distinguished clinically, so genetic testing that identifies the causative genetic defect would establish the diagnosis and discern whether or not other tissues or organs besides enamel are affected. Better understanding of the causes of AI provides hope for improvements in the diagnosis, assessment of prognosis, treatment, and cure of AI diseases. Some mutations cause synthesis of a protein to stop prematurely, which can potentially be treated with readthrough molecules. Other gene defects cause cell pathology related to protein misfolding rather than to a protein's loss of function. Chemical chaperones can prevent cell pathology resulting from mutations that cause secreted or membrane proteins to fold improperly. In this study we test the following three Hypotheses: 1) Whole-exome analyses can identify causal mutation(s) in kindreds with enamel defects in proven AI candidate genes, and also identify novel AI-causing genes and mutations. 2) Causality of novel gene defects identified in AI kindreds can be supported by the demonstration of enamel malformations in the corresponding knockout (KO) mice. 3) Some AI is caused by potentially reversible pathological mechanisms. To test these hypotheses we propose the following two Specific Aims: SA 1: Identify novel genes and mutations that cause inherited enamel defects in AI kindreds. SA 2: Determine if AI-causing premature translation termination or ER stress is reversible. Significance: Identifying the genes that cause inherited enamel defects will permit genetic testing to diagnose AI, improve assessment of the patients' prognoses, and recognize mutations that can be treated with chemical chaperones or readthrough molecules to promote normal tooth development in patients with a defective genetic background."
"9290224","Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the US, in part due to the lack of effective therapies for advanced disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify molecules/pathways involved in colon cancer development and metastasis for cancer treatment.  Glutamate is an essential amino acid that plays important roles in signaling as a major neurotransmitter in mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Glutamate signaling is mediated by glutamate receptors. GRM3 is one of the group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. The glutamatergic system is mainly restricted to the CNS. However, it has been recently shown that GRM3 is frequently mutated in melanoma and that mutant GRM3 increased anchorage- independent growth and migration of melanoma cells. In addition, activation of GRM3 has been reported to sustain tumorigenic potential of glioma-initiating cells. Pharmacological blockade of GRM3 reduced growth of glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that GRM3 may play a role in cancer. Our preliminary data showed that expression of GRM3 is significantly elevated in more than 90% of colon cancer specimens examined. Knockdown of GRM3 in colon cancer cells suppresses cell survival and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model in vivo. Mechanistically GRM3 inactivates protein kinase A (PKA) and activates AKT. In addition, TGF? increases GRM3 expression and that knockdown of GRM3 enhances TGF?-mediated tumor suppressor function. These studies suggest that upregulation of GRM3 expression is a functionally important molecular event during colon cancer development and progression. Therefore, GRM3 may play an important role in colon cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis and could be a potential target for colon cancer treatment.  In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanisms by which TGF? regulates GRM3 expression and whether their crosstalk plays a role in colon cancer metastasis. We will also determine GRM3 function in colon cancer using genetic mouse models and whether GRM3 contributes to development and/or maintenance of colon cancer metastasis using an orthotopic mouse model. Furthermore, we will demonstrate the clinical relevance and significance of elevated GRM3 in colon cancer patient samples. The completion of these studies will identify TGF?/GRM3/PKA as a novel signaling axis regulating colon cancer development and progression and establish GRM3 as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer treatment."
"9444809","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell Reprogramming & Therapeutics LLC will develop new cellular reprogramming technology to produce cell therapeutic product for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Advances in cell reprogramming technologies to generate patient-specific cells of a desired type will revolutionize the field of regenerative medicine. Over the lat decades several cell reprogramming methods such as nuclear transfer, cell fusion and transfection or transduction with pluripotent factors have been developed. However, the majority of these technologies require the exposure of cell nuclei to reprogramming large molecules via transfection, transduction, cell fusion or nuclear transfer. This raises several technical, safety and ethical issues. Chemical genetics is an alternative approach for cell reprogramming that uses small, cell membrane penetrable substances to regulate multiple cellular processes including cell plasticity. The main advantages of this approach over the above-mentioned technologies are that the biological effects of small molecules are typically rapid, reversible and dose-dependent, allowing precise control over specific outcomes by fine-tuning their concentrations and combinations. Recently, using chemical genetics approach (the combination of small molecules that are involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and function and specific cell signaling pathways), we have been able to generate neuronal cells from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) that expressed mature dopaminergic (DA) markers, released dopamine, exhibited electrophysiological properties of maturing neurons, and formed synapses. The goal of the proposed Phase I studies is the optimization of this cell reprogramming technology to increase the production of engraftable (FOX2A+/TH+/Nurr1+) midbrain DA neurons and elucidation of the therapeutic effects of these specialized cells in an animal model of PD. Phase II studies will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical pathogenic and etiologic animal models of PD. Commercial and clinically compatible research products emerging from Phase I/II work include a DA neuron differentiation kit and a technology for large-scale clinical grade production of DA neurons. The ultimate post-Phase II product will be the production of clinically relevant DA neurons for PD therapy. To achieve these goals, the Phase I aims include: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the efficiency of DA specification and maturation can be further improved by addition of specific cell signaling modulators and growth factors to our recently developed neural induction protocol at a certain time and in a specific order. Immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR will be used to evaluate the expression of markers specific to immature and mature dopaminergic neurons. Dopamine release will be assessed by ELISA. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that DA cells transplanted into the 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mice and rat models of PD, will survive, integrate and will promote restoration of amphetamine-induced rotation behavior and will show improvements in tests of forelimb use and akinesia."
"9270036","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Resource Informatics and Production Core Discovering the functions of the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome is a required step for understanding human biology and disease. Genetic model organisms, including zebrafish, play a critical role in this discovery process, because genetic analysis can connect gene sequence and function. Model organism databases, like ZFIN, provide tools required to make this connection.  The zebrafish has emerged as a premier organism to study vertebrate biology. Powerful techniques allow rapid efficient generation and recovery of mutations affecting genes that orchestrate developmental patterning, organogenesis, physiology, and behavior. It is easy to study gene function by generating transgenic zebrafish, by knocking down gene function with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, or by altering gene function by genome editing. The genome has been sequenced and about 50% of the protein coding genes have been mutated by targeted gene knockout technology. Large-scale projects are underway or planned that will produce functional data about almost all the genes and sequence-based functional elements in the genome. Multiple mutations and gene knockdowns can be combined in the same individual to study gene modifiers and other genetic interactions. The functions of most of these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups. Thus, analysis of zebrafish mutations provides insights into gene functions in other vertebrates, including humans.  The long term goals for ZFIN are a) to be the community database resource for the laboratory use of zebrafish, b) to develop and support integrated zebrafish genetic, genomic, developmental, and physiological information, c) to maintain the definitive reference data sets of zebrafish research information, d) to link this information extensively to corresponding data in other model organism and human databases, e) to facilitate the use of zebrafish as a model for human biology, and f) to help serve the broad needs of the biomedical research community.  This core will make ZFIN data widely accessible. We will continue to make the entire ZFIN database publically available, including bulk downloads, processing, and analysis. We will develop the infrastructure necessary to annotate the genome and make it available through Ensembl, UCSC, NCBI, ZFIN, and other browsers. We will develop and improve curator interfaces to improve the efficiency of curation, and we will migrate the ZFIN database server platform from Informix to PostgreSQL."

"9393774","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to alcohol can have major deleterious effects as documented for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and more recently and broadly as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These disorders are associated with a range of debilitating neurodevelopmental and psychiatric problems after birth. Myriad molecular and cellular defects have been associated with fetal brain exposure to ethanol, which generally lack common, underlying mechanisms. This proposal will examine a newly identified, somatic change in the genomes of central nervous system (CNS) cells produced by fetal ethanol exposure that could help to provide a common mechanistic foundation: mosaic aneuploidies. These cells show somatically produced chromosomal gains and/or losses, constituting an inherent, if surprising element of normal brain organization. Constitutive aneuploidies (where all cells have the same form of aneuploidy) have clear consequences for cellular dysfunction in cancers, and deleterious behavioral consequences as observed in Down Syndrome, suggesting that deviations from the normal mosaic aneuploidy states could contribute to the range of neural deficits seen in FASD. Here, we will test the hypothesis that identifiable changes in neural mosaic aneuploidies represent a common endpoint of prenatal exposure to alcohol. Three aims will be pursued over the next 5 years. Aim 1 will identify effects of fetal alcohol exposure that alter neural progenitor cell (NPC) aneuploidies after embryonic exposure ex vivo. Aim 2 will determine cell fate and functional consequences of alcohol exposure to aneuploid & aneusomic NPC populations during development, and neurons in adult cortical cell populations. Aim 3 will determine neuronal and non-neuronal identities and distributions of specific aneusomies produced by fetal alcohol exposure using a novel in vivo reporter system. Completion of these Aims could provide a new framework for understanding and therapeutically approaching FASD."
"9231514","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Veterinarians are broadly trained health professionals who are uniquely qualified to participate in biomedical research, having an understanding of health and disease in the context of the whole organism1,2. The One Health concept, integrating discoveries in both human and veterinary medicine, has received increased attention with the emergence of zoonotic pathogens as well as increasingly common chronic aging conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. As translational research with animal models continue to expand to approximately half of all current NIH research projects1, veterinarians, particularly those with research training, make increasingly valuable contributions to biomedical research.3 Two reports by National Academy of Sciences National Research Council Committees concluded that there is a critical shortage of such veterinarians4,5. For example, the lack of an adequate number of comparative pathologists, physiologists, laboratory animal veterinarians, and other veterinary specialists to evaluate genetically engineered mice has resulted in erroneous publications in which normal anatomic structures were interpreted as lesions.1 Texas A&M University is prepared to expand our current summer research training program for veterinary students. The goal of our summer Veterinary Scholar Research Program (VSRP) is to introduce veterinary students very early in their veterinary training to the biomedical research environment, facilitating trainees to discover research as an exciting career option. In this competitive renewal, the program will be led by a new Program Director, a reconfigured Advisory Committee, and 39 research mentors. The summer program includes: 1) research in a mentor's laboratory, emphasizing the One Health approach to a biomedical research problem; (2) a weekly lunch meeting of seminars on topics related to research ethics and scientific and professional development, or journal clubs discussing peer-reviewed research papers; (3) participation in the annual CVM research symposium; and 4) presenting a research poster at the National Veterinary Scholars Symposium. The program has exceptional institutional support and a broad array of state-of-the-art facilities, including preclinical GLP lbs, a national biodefense lab, primate center, strong institutional collaborations, and a recently funded DHHS Biodefense vaccine center. A major obstacle to the efforts of academic institutions to produce more research veterinarians is the difficulty of providing adequate salary sources to introduce trainees to research. The training positions provided by this T35 would assist recruiting efforts, increase numbers of veterinarians in research, and help alleviate this national shortage."
"9237683","RESEARCH SUMMARY The role that diet plays in brain development will be probed by determining the components of the brain that are directly impacted by nutrition. Human milk is highly glycosylated containing short oligosaccharide chains that are more abundant than proteins. In early nutrition, there is a big burden on diet to accommodate the rapidly developing brain. The brain is rich in sialic acids, which are involved in neuronal outgrowth thereby creating synaptic connectivity through cell-cell interactions that in turn create memory. Human milk oligosaccharides are rich in sialic acids. It has long been proposed that sialic acids in human milk are an important source of sialic acids in the brain. However, the compounds in the brain that incorporate the exogenous sialic acids are not known, although they are generally believed to include proteins and lipids. This research will determine with high specificity the glycoconjugates in the brain that incorporate exogenous monosaccharides, particularly those from human milk oligosaccharides during the normal course of breast- feeding. A method combining advanced separation, mass spectrometry and chemical biology will be developed to determine the glycan structures, the glycoprotein, and the glycolipid involved in the incorporation of glycans from breast milk. Structural heterogeneity will be determined with lipid-specific characterization. Glycans in glycoproteins will be determined with structural heterogeneity at the site-specific level for both N- and O- glycosylation sites. We will develop deep glycomics tools to probe the glycoconjugates as glycoproteins and glycolipids that incorporate components from human milk. Determining the specific protein and lipid glycoconjugates that incorporate milk oligosaccharides would provide the most direct link between nutrition and brain development. 1"
"9278488","Project Summary/Abstract  Excellent oncology care requires the close collaboration of numerous professionals. Extending and enhancing interdisciplinary care will require interprofessional education (IPE)for students which develops their understanding of the strengths, capabilities, skills, roles, and cultures of other professionals and teaches the communication and collaboration skills essential for effective teamwork. Integration of palliative care is now recommended at the time of a cancer diagnosis?regardless of prognosis?and palliative care, by its very nature, requires interdisciplinary patient-centered care to meet the complex needs of oncology patients. This project will develop a critical mass of competent equipped oncology educators skilled in the development and implementation of IPE for palliative oncology care. Through faculty development webinars and materials, a train-the-trainer workshop, ongoing educational activities and mentoring by experienced interprofessional educators, 160 health science educators (representing the fields of medicine, nursing, social work and chaplaincy) from 35-50 institutions will develop the skills, knowledge and resources to overcome barriers to IPE and teach oncology palliative care and teamwork to students of multiple disciplines. Guided by this project?s faculty, the trainees will work in interprofessional faculty teams to develop a plan for implementing an IPE curriculum in palliative oncology at their site. Trainee and institutional outcomes will be evaluated using validated instruments and a pre/post-test design. A national summit on interdisciplinary palliative oncology education will be held at the completion of the project; sites will share their experiences and other interested educators will be invited to attend and present their own initiatives."
"9244661","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this proposal are to define the mechanisms by which alternatively spliced isoforms of the serine- threonine kinase, BRAF, are expressed in the context of melanoma targeted therapies and to elucidate how these isoforms mediate therapy resistance. Approximately 50% of melanoma patients harbor an activating mutation in BRAF, a protein in the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. Recently approved therapies targeting this pathway have increased treatment options for melanoma patients but multiple resistance mechanisms inevitably arise leading to therapy failure. A fuller understanding of these mechanisms of resistance offers the possibility for improved treatment design and identification of additional therapeutic targets. One of the most prevalent resistant mechanisms is the aberrant splicing of BRAF, which has been identified in patients resistant to RAF inhibitor mono therapy, as well as in patients receiving combination RAF and MEK inhibitors. This alternatively spliced protein exhibits enhanced dimerization and downstream ERK1/2 signaling in the presence of RAF inhibitors. Through the successful completion of the following three aims, we will gain an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the expression of BRAF splice variants and the mechanisms by which BRAF splice variants confer resistance. In the first aim, we will elucidate the mechanism by which BRAF is alternatively spliced. RNA-seq analysis of in vivo derived BRAF splice variant expressing melanoma cells revealed altered expression of the SRRM family of splicing-related proteins. We hypothesize that the observed differences in expression of the SRRM protein family contributes to the prevalence of BRAF splice variants. The second aim will identify residues on the BRAF splice variants that are critical for continued ERK1/2 signaling in the presence of RAF inhibitor. All reported BRAF splice variants lack the regulatory Ras binding domain and a single 14-3-3 scaffolding protein binding site. We hypothesize that removal of the S365 14-3-3 binding site and retention of the S729 site promote kinase activity in the presence of RAF inhibitors. Finally, we aim to investigate the role that BRAF splicing plays in mediating resistance to next generation, paradox-breaking BRAF inhibitors. Current RAF inhibitors lead to the paradoxical activation of wild type BRAF in healthy cells. Plexxikon has recently developed a next-generation RAF inhibitor, PLX8394, which selectively targets mutant BRAF but does not elicit deleterious paradoxical responses. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of PLX8394 in vitro; however, the resistance mechanisms against PLX8394 that will arise in vivo remain unstudied. We show that PLX8394 blocks BRAF splice variant dimerization in vitro and thus hypothesize that PLX8394 will block splice variant signaling in an in vivo xenograft model. The data generated in this proposal may implicate specific spliceosome components and protein signaling mechanisms as novel targets for treating patients with RAF inhibitor resistant melanoma."
"9307310","Modified Project Summary/Abstract section Major depressive disorder is a prevalent disease that is debilitating, recurring, progressive, and often inadequately treated with available medications. A better understanding of mechanisms contributing to depression is critically needed to develop new interventions. In this project, we will investigate the influence of microbiota on depressive-like behaviors in mice. Recent evidence has shown that alterations of the gut microbiota influence responses to stress. Microbiota also influences immune responses, in particular certain bacteria regulate the production of T helper (Th) 17 cells. We recently showed that Th17 cells are required for the induction of depressive-like behaviors. Therefore, our overall hypotheses are that stress that induces depression-like behaviors in mice alters signals generated by certain residents of the microflora, that these signals promote the production of pathogenic Th17 cells, which in turn mediate the induction of depression-like behaviors after stress, and that establishment of depression augments changes in the microbiota that facilitates the continued susceptibility to depression, in part through up-regulated production of Th17 cells. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the microbiota regulates stress-induced pathogenic Th17 cells that promote depressive-like behaviors in mice. We will expand our proof-of-concept data that modulation of the microbiota affects depressive-like behavior and influences Th17 cells in mouse brain during depressive-like states. We identified bacteria that are increased during depressive-like behavior and will confirm their role in controlling depressive-like behavior and Th17 cells production. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that in mice bacterial quorum-sensing molecules are signals that regulate the production of Th17 cells, which promote depression-like behaviors. We generated proof-of-concept data identifying the importance of the quorum sensing molecule AI-2 in predicting depressive-like behavior. We will expand these results by developing therapeutic intervention strategies to modulate bacterial microflora via AI-2 quorum sensing molecules to regulate Th17 cells and depressive-like behavior. Altogether this project will provide evidence that the microbiota regulates depressive-like behavior through the production of Th17 cells."
"9274605","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This NIH S10 High-End Instrumentation grant application request funds to purchase a GE SPINlabTM dissolution DNP (dynamic nuclear polarization) instrument for the purpose of creating hyperpolarized (HP) 13C- and 15N- labeled metabolic substrates, thereby enabling high sensitivity magnetic resonance (MR) interrogation of metabolic pathways in vivo in small-animal models and bioreactors (cultured cell systems). The GE SPINlab is currently the only commercially available hyperpolarization device. In the ?open path? configuration, as specified herein, it is well-suited for preclinical research. The Washington University School of Medicine (Saint Louis) has a rich history of metabolic research in basic science and in medicine. As evidenced by descriptions herein of the currently funded metabolic research programs of the Major User Group, there is a pressing need for SPINlab-enabled HP MR spectroscopy-driven metabolic pathway analysis capabilities. Importantly, the SPINlab will be sited in a centralized preclinical PET/CT/MRI resource, in close proximity to a new, preclinical, simultaneous PET/MR scanner (to be acquired, recently funded, NGA issued). Upwards of four million dollars in institutional support have been committed to ensure the success of this new HP MR metabolic research program. The addition of SPINlab-enabled HP MR to our capabilities to synthesize and image the full armamentarium of PET radiotracers (metabolic, and non-metabolic), and to simultaneously measure both imaging readouts with PET/MR, has the potential to open entirely new avenues of scientific discovery not otherwise possible. For example, it will now be possible to cross-calibrate and cross-validate both imaging technologies. From a HP MR perspective, metabolic measurements using various 13C tracers can be compared with their PET 11C- radiotracer counterparts to determine the impact of non-tracer doses of substrate on cellular metabolism. Conversely, measurements of various components of metabolism by PET with compartmental modeling (e.g., oxidation and storage) can be referenced to the true metabolic fate of the exogenous substrate measured with HP MR. Most exciting is the potential use of the quantitative capabilities of PET to facilitate the HP MR quantification of substrate flux through metabolic pathways of interest. Such information will enable/enhance the accurate interpretation of HP MR derived measurements of disease effects and dose response. SPINlab-enabled HP MR is a promising and powerful technology for metabolic assessment and pathway analysis. Washington University presents a near ideal environment in which to initiate such a research program."
"9260800","The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) for the NYUCI is responsible for evaluating the scientific merit of all cancer-related population-based, translational and clinical research studies that take place on the NYU Langone Medical Center campus and those of its strategic alliances. Once the clinical protocol documentation has been completed, the PRMS provides a forum for multi-level review, confirming the scientific merit and programmatic fit. After the NYU School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB) approves the protocol, the PRMS monitors for scientific progress and performance. A central core of the PRMS is the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC). PRMC membership is drawn from the membership of the NYUCI based on expertise in the development and conduct of clinical trials, as well as leadership in key clinical positions. Physician members of the committee represent the different subspecialties providing care and participating in clinical research within the NYUCI. In addition, the PRMC includes bench scientists, biostatisticians, members of the administrative staff of the NYUCI, oncology nursing and the investigational pharmacy. PRMC approval is required for IRB submission and approval. PRMC review includes the underlying hypothesis, design, and the likelihood that the trial will lead to clinically meaningful results. The PRMC monitors accrual yearly and requires that investigators provide a formal plan to increase enrollment if accrual is < 50% of projected target. The PRMC has the authority to close under-accruing trials. Investigator initiated studies are the highest priority for the NYUCI especially those involving novel agents based on laboratory results from NYUCI basic and/or translational scientists. The number of reviewed protocols has increases since the last review. In 2011, PRMC reviewed 126 protocols as compared to 94 in 2007."
"9274404","The field of cellular biology is undergoing a revolution due to recent advancements in serial block-face imaging scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). This technology combines automated sectioning of plastic-embedded tissue blocks with imaging by SEM, and does so in a fully-automated fashion. SBF-SEM enables users to generate and image many hundreds (>1000) of serial sections at a rate of 30-40 seconds per section. This Z stack of sections is then computationally assembled into a 3D image, creating a very high-resolution volume. The most recent advance in SBF-SEM has been the development of automated multi-energy deconvolution (MED) technology by the company FEI. MED enables users to obtain resolution in the z dimension of less than 10 nm. Previously, z resolution was limited to the minimum thickness of microtome-generated sections (~30 nm). FEI has now incorporated MED technology into their SBF-SEM system, which they have named the Teneo LoVac VolumeScope (Teneo VS). This microscope enables users to generate 3D isotropic data at 10 nm resolution, and to do so over a very large volume (up to ~1000 m x 1000 m x 1000 m). With this combination of volume and resolution, cell biologists can now generate ?Google Earth? representations of complex tissues such as brains and liver. Such datasets will enable a researcher to quickly scan their specimens for features of interest, and then zoom in 100,000 fold to examine these features in exquisite detail. Equally important, these datasets will enable researchers to visualize how complex tissues are assembled from their cellular components, and even how the internal components of cells are structured in 3D. This proposal seeks funds to purchase an FEI Teneo VS, which will be installed in the Indiana University Bloomington-Electron Microscopy Center (IUB-EMC). The IUB- EMC is a multi-user facility that serves the entire IU system (8 campuses), and is a service core of the NIH- funded Indiana Clinical and Translation Sciences Institute (CTSI), which includes Purdue University and Notre Dame University. To date, no EM center in Indiana has installed an SBF-SEM. Indeed, the Teneo VS is so new that only two have been installed in the USA, thus the IUB-EMC seeks to become a regional center for SBF-SEM imaging. To demonstrate the broad impact of this technology on NIH-funded research at IUB, projects from seven major users are described. These users are Dan Tracey, who is investigating the neural circuits underlying pain perception, Andy Zelhof, who is investigating eye development, James Glazier, who is investigating how acetaminophen damages liver, Mike Lynch, who is investigating the evolution of cellular structures, Ke Hu, who is investigating the cell biology of Toxoplasma gondii, an important human pathogen, Tuli Mukhopadhyay, who is investigating arbovirus assembly inside mammalian cells, and Roger Innes, who is investigating the role of extracellular vesicles in the immune system of plants. Although extremely diverse, these projects will all be greatly accelerated by access to SBF-SEM."
"9244288","Efforts to legalize marijuana are currently sweeping the nation, and the degree to which empirical scientific research is informing such policy change in unknown. Because future policy tends to build upon current policy, it is imperative that we understand how empirical scientific research is used in the public health policy decision process, i.e., the conditions under which science will inform policy making, and ways to facilitate policy makers? utilization of science in their policy making process. Our long-term objective is to contribute to the science of translation by using this case study to explain and predict the conditions under which research will be used to inform public health policy decisions. We will conduct a comparative analysis of four cases of the legalization of marijuana: legalization in Alaska and Oregon (autumn 2014), and defeated/failed legalization attempts in Ohio (autumn 2015) and New Mexico (2016). For each of these cases we will collect and analyze the written commentary, public hearing testimony, and media coverage of the proposed marijuana legalization. We will assemble the evidence submitted as commentary on the proposed marijuana legalization efforts, and analyze quality and quantity of the science. In addition, we will interview elected or appointed public officials who were involved participants in the policy arena regarding marijuana legalization in their state.  We aim to discover the scientific research that effectively informed policy decisions regarding marijuana legalization, and how that scientific research is distinguished from research that failed to inform policy. Our specific aims are: (1) To identify research users, examining how public health policy makers define (what constitutes ?research?), acquire, interpret, and use scientific research; (2) To explore the social and political conditions under which scientific research will be used or adapted to inform public health policy; (3) To compare and contrast the relevant scientific research that was used to inform policy with the relevant scientific research with that that was not used; and, (4) To contribute to the science of translation by delineating the conditions under which policy makers will make decisions based on research findings, i.e., who makes for the best translators and how to create productive contexts for successful translation of research to policy.  With a better understanding of what facilitates or hampers the uptake of scientific evidence regarding the health effects of marijuana use, we would know what makes the scientific evidence more valuable to public health policy makers."
"9274057","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria continues to be one of the greatest threats to health and life in Malawi, and recent control efforts have yielded only moderate success. New insights into what determines risk and how to design more effective interventions are imperative to enhance control and ultimately eliminate malaria in the region. This Global Infectious Diseases Research Training Program is established on the basis of long-standing and productive collaborations between senior faculty members at the University of Malawi College of Medicine and a core team of international investigators who have been engaged in malaria research in Malawi for decades. The training program was crafted to train the experts required to develop independent research teams in Malawi capable of designing, leading and analyzing results of locally and internationally relevant studies, and to create a robust and sustainable graduate program in Malawian universities. Careful selection and training of a molecular epidemiologist, a vector biologist and two biostatisticians will prepare leaders in the health research agenda, focused on hypothesis-driven scientific questions. We will also provide formal short course training in specific research methods and tailor opportunities for laboratory rotations to provide succession planning to create a pipeline of future PhD candidates and the junior faculty members who support them. Through the direct supervision, guidance and mentorship of the training team members, these trainees will benefit from outstanding didactic educations and also from the hands-on mentoring provided by experienced colleagues and recent graduates who are now faculty members in Malawi. This interdisciplinary training program is designed achieve the following specific aims: (1) Train successful investigators in molecular epidemiology, vector biology and biostatistics, (2) Establish core faculty for a rigorous, independent PhD program in Malawi, and (3) Support succession planning for future PhD trainees and mentors within Malawi. The specific areas of training were identified as essential to on-going and future health research in Malawi, reflect strengths of the collaborating institutions (University of Maryland, Michigan State University and University of the Witwatersrand), and create synergies with emerging opportunities within the University of Malawi. Cross- cutting, innovative, well-executed and expertly analyzed studies will address specific challenges of malaria treatment, prevention, and transmission reduction. In addition, the skill sets developed by all the trainees in this proposed effort will be applicable to a wide range of infectious as well as non-communicable diseases."
"9225212","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The optic nerve of adult humans shows little potential for regeneration or self-repair, which presents a major challenge to restoring vision in patients with optic nerve injury or diseases, including glaucoma. These patients thus suffer from the pathological consequences and vision loss for the rest of their lives. A regenerative therapy is vital for preserving sight or reversing vision loss. Yet an in depth understanding of the molecular basis that controls optic nerve growth/regeneration remains ambiguous. We here propose to investigate why the optic nerve fails to regenerate and how nerve regeneration can be enhanced to improve neuronal function after injury. Long-standing work from my and other laboratories has shown that optic nerve growth is a programed event during development whose shut-down contributes critically to the failure of optic nerve regeneration. A recent discovery in my laboratory has identified a novel potent regulator, insulin-like growth factor (IGF binding protein like 1 (IGFBPL1) whose presence activates the growth program and regenerative process of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and induces activation of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and its downstream signals. Administration of exogenous IGFBPL1 promoted optic nerve regeneration and RGC survival in adult mice; whereas, blockade of IGF-1R-induced signals, at least in culture, abolished IGFBPL1-mediated axonal growth or regeneration. This points to a central role for IGFBPL1 functioning through IGF-1R-induced intracellular events to regulate optic nerve regeneration. Importantly, IGFBPL1 as a secretory factor presents a clinically feasible candidate for manipulating nerve regeneration and restoring vision after injury in humans. This proposal thus seeks to further explore the underlying mechanisms through which IGFBPL1, particularly its relation to IGF-1R-mediated signals, promotes RGC axon regeneration. Moreover, it will evaluate the efficacy of IGFBPL1 on promoting optic nerve regeneration in an established animal model of optic nerve injury. Completion of the proposed studies will uncover a previously unknown signaling loop in IGF-1R-mediated cascades in the regulation of RGC axon growth and will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that control optic nerve regeneration and repair. This will accelerate the preclinical development of a novel regenerative therapy for currently untreatable conditions. As the optic nerve has long served as a standard model for the study of CNS injury, results may also have a broad impact on the development of new therapies to treat brain and spinal cord injury or diseases."
"9283894","Project Summary Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a promising approach to treat cancer by restoring T cell effector function and breaking a tumor-permissive microenvironment. Remarkable clinical efficacy, durable response, and low toxicity of PD-1 checkpoint blockade have been observed in various malignancies including hematological cancers. However, in a phase 1 study of nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody; BMS-936558), none of 27 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) experienced a partial or complete response, whereas objective responses were observed in about 40% of patients with follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma. As we and others have shown that MM cells express high levels of PD-L1, that bone marrow (BM)-infiltrating T cells are largely PD-1 positive, and more importantly MM cells carry somatic mutations in amounts similar to as B-cell lymphomas, the absence of response to PD-1 antibody therapy for MM cannot be explained by a lack of tumor-infiltrating T cells or PD-L1 or neoantigen expression by MM cells or immune cells. We speculated that PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade alone is insufficient to break the permissive microenvironment in MM because BM-infiltrating immunosuppressive cells, such as tumor-associated M?s, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and/or regulatory T cells (Tregs) could still inhibit the function of MM-specific effector T cells restored by the checkpoint blockade. Indeed, our preliminary studies showed that, similar to human MM, PD-1 mAbs had no significant therapeutic effect against established MM in murine models. However, to our surprise, in vivo depletion of M?s, but not MDSCs or Tregs, resulted in significant anti-MM effects following PD-1 checkpoint blockade. This application will test our hypothesis is that M?s, as one of the major BM-infiltrating cell types, are crucial in suppressing T-cell immunity in the tumor microenvironment, and targeting these cells will significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of checkpoint blockade in patients with MM. Aim 1 will determine the role and mechanism of M?s in the primary resistance to PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapy in MM. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms of M?-mediated immune suppression, and Aim 3 will determine the translational potential of combining M?-targeting and PD-1 antibodies to treat human MM. Accomplishing these aims will provide the justification and tools to clinically target BM-infiltrating M?s to sensitize MM patients to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. The proposed studies will also lead to a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the primary resistance to PD-1 checkpoint blockade and could pave the way to the first substantial improvements in the treatment in MM and other hematological malignancies by way of targeting M?s and PD-1 inhibition."
"9310595","Contribution of Osteocytes to the Musculoskeletal Effects of Multiple Myeloma MPI: Roodman and Bellido 7. Abstract Osteolytic cancer in bone (OCIB) occurs frequently in cancer patients and is a major contributor to decreased survival and quality of life. Pathologic fractures caused by OCIB in multiple myeloma (MM) increases their risk of death >20% compared to patients without fractures. In addition, OCIB induced severe systemic muscle dysfunction further negatively impacting the performance status, quality of life, and survival. Although much is known about the contribution of tumor cells, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, stroma cells, and immune cells to the bone destructive process in OCIB, the role of osteocytes (Ots), the most numerous cell type in the skeleton and major regulators of bone remodeling, is unknown. Studies leading to this application showed that, although Ots reside deep in mineralized matrix, they are major contributors to the effects of OCIB. MM cells and Ots physically interact in vivo, and these interactions activate bidirectional Notch signaling driving MM cell proliferation and Ot apoptosis, and enhance the osteoclastogenic potential of Ots. MM-Ot interactions increase RANKL, TNF?, cyclinD1 and Notch1-4 receptor expression in MM cells, and upregulate RANKL and the inhibitor of bone formation, sclerostin, in Ots. Our studies also suggest that MIP-1? and HMGB1, known stimulators of RANKL, may also be involved because MM-derived MIP-1? acts directly to increase acid- induced HMGB1 by Ots. Further, RANKL, MIP-1? and HMGB1-driven bone resorption could also induce muscle dysfunction in MM. This proposal will test the hypothesis that MM-Ot interactions are major contributors to OCIB through increasing tumor growth and bone resorption, decreasing bone formation, and inducing muscle dysfunction. This hypothesis will be advanced by pursuing specific aims that combine in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches, using osteocytic cell lines, authentic osteocytes, human and murine MM cells lines, primary MM cells derived from patients, bones from genetically modified mice, and a mouse model of MM. Aim 1 will determine the impact of bidirectional MM/Ot Notch signaling on OCIB using genetic and pharmacological tools that interfere with Notch activation. Aim 2 will determine the contribution of MM- and Ot-derived RANKL to OCIB and the role of HMGB1 and MIP-1? in RANKL regulation. And Aim 3 will determine the role of sclerostin induced by MM/Ot interactions in tumor burden, bone disease, and muscle dysfunction induced by OCIB."
"9390567","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests a second renewal of five years of support for a successful interdisciplinary and translational training program in broad-based contemporary aspects of drug abuse research. Training the next generation of drug abuse researchers is critical to current and future public health challenges associated with drug addiction. The goal is to prepare trainees for productive and successful careers in drug abuse research. This program proposes to support 4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral trainees. We will vigorously recruit individuals from underrepresented minorities, disadvantaged backgrounds, and individuals with disabilities to increase diversity. This program provides a highly collaborative environment of interdisciplinary and translational training in drug abuse research. The 17 training faculty represent 7 academic units, have excellent training records, and will provide a rich interdisciplinary training environment. The program fosters the development of essential experimental and critical thinking skills, and provides the opportunity to gain an in depth understanding of and expertise in the interrelationships of the molecular/cellular aspects of receptors and signaling mechanisms involved in the neural and behavioral response to drugs of abuse and to become immersed in drug discovery and development in the pursuit of novel treatments for drug abuse. The overarching theme of the program is that drug addiction alters fundamental cellular and macromolecular processes resulting in long term changes in neural plasticity and behavior, which can be treated using pharmacotherapeutic intervention. The curriculum provides knowledge from physicochemical properties of molecules to structural biology, neurophysiology, neurochemistry, to animal and human behavior, with numerous opportunities for in depth study of focused areas of drug abuse research. The breadth of drug abuse research opportunities is enhanced by strong links to the University of Kentucky's (UK's) Center on Drug and Alcohol Research, the Center for Drug and Alcohol Research Translation, the Center for Clinical and Translational Science, the Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation, the Laboratory on Human Behavioral Pharmacology and the Residential Research Facility. This program provides value added by serving as a linchpin to networking, interactions and collaborations with other trainees and training faculty focused on human behavioral and clinical aspects of drug abuse research and supported by a second T32 program directed by Dr. Craig Rush at UK. All positions in both T32 programs have been filled completely during the last funding period, indicative of the large number of promising trainees in drug abuse research at UK. UK provides solid infrastructure and institutional support, optimizing the training environment. The majority of program graduates continue to actively pursue drug abuse research and advance towards independent investigator status. In the upcoming funding period, we propose to continue our record of success and develop responsible and ethical drug abuse researchers, who will move the field of drug abuse forward."
"9441437","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past 30 years, dramatic advances in the understanding of HIV infection and its therapy have transformed HIV into a highly treatable, chronic disease. With this evolution, critical questions have arisen about how basic research and clinical trials relate to clinical epidemiology and outcomes research, both in the U.S. and internationally. The goal of the Program for AIDS Clinical Research Training (PACRT), which has successfully trained leading HIV clinical investigators for the past 20 years, is to provide training in quantitative research methodologies with a focus on HIV clinical research to predoctoral PhD students and physicians at formative stages in their careers. This training has prepared both groups: to conduct clinical research of the highest quality and of direct relevance to the prevention and treatment of HIV infection. They will make important contributions to the scientific literature and successfully develop as independent investigators. In the next grant cycle, the PACRT candidates will receive two years of research training under the close supervision and mentorship of one or more of the 14 experienced program faculty members. Trainees will receive didactic training at Harvard School of Public Health or other Harvard University sites. Primary performance sites for the five post-doctoral fellows will be the Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School. The primary site for the two predoctoral fellows will be the Harvard School of Public Health. This program has three specific aims for its trainees: 1) To acquire a sufficient body of knowledge of quantitative methods to conduct independent research in:  clinical epidemiology, clinical trials, cost-effectiveness analysis, outcomes research, and/or implementation science. 2) To foster the creation of important scientific contributions with the close and longitudinal mentorship of program faculty. 3) To develop a primary research focus and a broad understanding of the various aspects of HIV disease for novel interdisciplinary research. Relevance: PACRT has a clearly defined and unique direction among HIV T32 programs, with its focus on clinical outcomes research, and how that research interfaces with translational research, clinical trials, and health policy. This program will play a crucial role in training the next generation of highly successful investigators to address the complex issues arising today in HIV clinical research."
"9335081","Project Summary/Abstract Understanding the complex neural circuits involved in drug addiction is a major challenge which, if met, could provide insight into the disease and guidance for treatment. Efforts focused on understanding mechanisms that underpin addictive behaviors have contributed to illuminating relevant brain circuitry, including connections between the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. While much is known and emerging about this circuitry relevant to addiction, the intrinsic complexity ? interconnections between a number of distinct and widely separated brain regions ? make difficult high-resolution circuit-wide longitudinal studies of addiction that track neuron-level changes across the system. In our proposed investigations, we set forth to develop and apply an innovative technology, syringe-injectable mesh electronics, to overcome previous limitations of in-vivo chronic recording and thereby enable stable long-term mapping and modulation of neuronal signals with single-neuron resolution across the multiple brain regions associated with addiction. First, we plan to investigate simultaneous targeting of critical regions of the rodent brain involved in drug addiction with minimal chronic immune response using syringe-injectable mesh electronics, including demonstration of targeted injection of mesh electronics probes that each bridge simultaneously multiple brain regions involved in the overall addiction circuitry, such as the medial prefrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens and hippocampus to amygdala. Second, we propose to demonstrate long-term stable simultaneous recording from these critical regions of the rodent brain defining the addiction circuitry in mice, to quantify correlations between neurons within and between different areas of the overall circuitry, to demonstrate the ability to modulate recorded signals using stimulator electrodes integrated within the mesh electronics probes, and to record and subsequently quantitatively analyze changes in the signals across multiple circuit regions following alcohol self-administration and subsequent cessation in mice. By opening up the potential for simultaneous stable chronic recording from neurons in a minimally invasive manner from key brain areas during longitudinal studies, our proposed work can provide a new technology as well as unique data to illuminate system-wide changes within the addiction circuitry. These innovative technology capabilities will help to advance circuit-level studies of addiction by other researchers, and moreover, the development of this new technology could serve as a means for more effective treatments based on electrical stimulation to modulate specific circuit components that might preclude chronic abuse and relapse."
"9272261","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) RNA transcripts are used to translate viral proteins, and are also selectively incorporated into nascen virions as the genetic material. HIV-1 is capable of packaging a single copy of dimeric, full-length genomic RNA (gRNA), ensuring correct propagation of its genetic information. Despite extensive study, the mechanism governing the selective incorporation of gRNA by HIV-1 remains poorly understood. The viral Gag protein is responsible for packaging gRNA via interactions with its 5 untranslated region (5UTR), specifically the Psi packaging signal. The 5UTR is known to adopt multiple conformations and dimerize, and this has been proposed to affect gRNA packaging. Gag has also been shown to adopt multiple conformations, fluctuating between bent and straight conformers depending on the presence of phospholipids and/or nucleic acids. The current model explaining genome packaging is that the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag recognizes gRNA and targets it to the plasma membrane (PM) via the Gag matrix (MA) domain, nucleating further Gag oligomerization and leading to virus particle formation. A few Gag molecules likely interact with gRNA in an NC-only conformation to allow MA to bind the PM. However, a clear understanding of Gag conformation and specific gRNA interactions that lead to RNA packaging is lacking. I hypothesize that Psi-containing, dimeric gRNAs promote Gag interaction in an assembly-competent mode, leading to their preferential incorporation into virions. The following experiments will elucidate the RNA sequence and conformations that can alter Gag's binding mode and conformation, in order to establish how Gag interacts with these RNAs in a manner that leads to their selective encapsidation. This proposal seeks to answer the following outstanding questions: 1) What gRNA sequence and conformation are required for Gag interactions in the specific binding mode? 2) How does gRNA sequence and conformation affect the Gag conformational equilibrium? 3) Do these same gRNA sequences and conformations lead to selective gRNA packaging during infection? Elucidation of the molecular mechanism employed by Gag to successfully target and package its gRNA will facilitate future efforts at targeting this interaction with novel antiretroviral therapies."
"9289601","Project Summary Single amino acid mutations in p97 AAA ATPase (also known as VCP, CDC48, TER ATPase) cause autosomal dominant human disorders embracing inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease of bone, frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) among others. The most common p97 mutation (R155H) accounts for half the incidence of this rare, progressively debilitating, currently untreatable, fatal disorder. Strong data from IBMPFD/ALS human patients and mouse models suggests that targeting the disease-mutations of p97 will lead to a treatment. Since wild type (WT) p97 and its many ubiquitin-binding cofactors regulate the functions of protein substrates, WT p97?s essential functions must remain intact for human health. Previous studies demonstrated that R155H-p97 has differential sensitivity to inhibitors, higher basal ATPase activity, and is differentially regulated by interacting proteins. This suggests that mutant-selective small molecules can be identified which will inhibit R155H-p97, without effects on wild type. The goal of this project is to identify those mutant-selective small molecule candidates for drug development to treat or prevent IBMPFD/ALS pathology. Three specific aims are proposed to achieve our goal. AIM 1: Identify compounds that inhibit R155H, the most common p97 mutant causing IBMPFD/ALS. Conditions for high-throughput screening were developed and validated during a R155H-p97 pilot screen with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Pharmaceutical Collection of 2,400 approved drugs. This project will carry out a quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) of 500,000 diverse compounds for inhibitors of R155H-p97 in the presence of p47 (one of the major cofactors of p97) in collaboration with the NCATS. The compounds will be ranked according to selectivity followed by potency. AIM 2: Test the compounds identified in AIM 1 in a cascade of biochemical and cell-based assays to ensure that the compounds will have the same effect inside as well as outside cells. The compounds will be characterized in established and validated cell-based assays to monitor the expression of seven potential IBMPFD/ALS disease biomarkers. Finally AIM 3: Use the lead compounds that emerge from Aim 2 to evaluate whether they correct disease in fibroblasts obtained from diseased and healthy mice and both human subjects with IBMPFD/ALS and healthy individuals. This data along with evaluation of Blood, Brain Barrier permeability should identify best candidates for further therapy development."
"9345458","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging disease of global public health importance. Originally identified in 1952, sporadic CHIKV outbreaks occurred in Africa and Asia for several decades. Beginning with an outbreak on the island of La Reunion in 2004 the virus has continued to spread to new regions around the globe. CHIKV is now endemic in the Caribbean, is present in the Americas, and continues to cause devastating outbreaks in India and Southeast Asia. Chikungunya vaccine development began with the generation of both traditional inactivated whole virus vaccines as well as live attenuated candidates. Additional advancement came in the development of viral vectored and subunit vaccines. Recently, two candidate vaccines have progressed into Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical testing. However, until these vaccines are proven, additional candidates are sorely needed. The recent development of vector independent RNA based delivery systems represents an attractive platform for rapid and inexpensive development of new vaccine candidates. RNA based antigen delivery candidates may be generated and purified using a common fully synthetic process, which alleviates the need for time consuming antigen specific process development. Central to the utility of this platform is the development of an effective RNA delivery formulation, capable of promoting in vivo expression of antigen proteins from vaccine candidates following injection. This phase I SBIR proposal will utilize a proprietary and compositionally unique RNA delivery formulation to develop novel RNA based CHIKV vaccine candidates. Following generation of vaccine candidate RNA, we will verify viral protein expression and quantify secreted virus-like particles in vitro. In addition, we will verify that RNA vaccines do not generate replicating virus relative to a full length CHIKV [181/25] genome control by titration of transfection supernatants. Candidates shown to generate viral proteins in the absence of replication competent virus will be advanced into immunogenicity studies in mice. Comprehensive analysis of the immune response including the induction of CHIKV neutralizing antibody will confirm potency of RNA vaccine. Following down selection to two lead candidate RNA vaccines, we will carry out efficacy testing in multiple mouse challenge models. The results of these challenge studies will define two novel CHIKV vaccine candidates, which will then be advanced into cGMP manufacturing, toxicology and clinical testing in a subsequent SBIR Phase II proposal."
"9272941","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developmental disorders are one of several disorders that interrupt normal development in childhood. These disorders may affect only one or several different areas of development, including language, motor, social and learning skills. Learning disabilities in particular are one of the most common forms of developmental disorders and are typically diagnosed early in children. Notably, learning disabilities and developmental disorders, in general, are more often diagnosed in boys than in girls and it is thought, at least in part, to e the result of immune activation during early brain development. Despite these theories, the underlying etiologies of many developmental disorders are not well understood, particularly in the context of peripheral immune function, microglial function, and sex. The purpose of the proposed experiments is two-fold. First, we will seek to understand normal hippocampal development of microglia and the developmental expression of synaptic plasticity molecules during the onset of hippocampal dependent contextual fear learning in juvenile male and female rats. Second, we will examine how activation of the developing immune system in males and females may result in subsequent delays in microglial development, the expression of synaptic plasticity molecules in the hippocampus, and developmental delays in hippocampal dependent learning in a sex-dependent manner. The results of these experiments will significantly increase our understanding of the interactions between intrinsic factors (such as sex) and environmental factors (such as immune activation) that perturb the normal development of brain and behavior from the juvenile period and into adulthood. In addition, these experiments will identify new molecular targets of neuronal and glial interactions that are likely disrupted throughout development as a result of early-life immune activation, providing potential targets for future therapeutic interventions."

The supportive scientific advisory committee includes Dr. Clary Clish, Director of Metabolite Profiling at the Broad Institute and Dr. Kenneth Bloch, a renowned cardiologist and pulmonary vascular biologist. Research: This proposal builds on preliminary studies that have identified a novel association of metabolites in the kynurenine pathway with PAH. This pathway is a major route for tryptophan metabolism catalyzed by the enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and has been implicated in the regulation of vascular tone. We will test the hypothesis that the kynurenine pathway leads to a compensatory pulmonary vasodilation in PAH. In Aim 1, we will characterize IDO1 and kynurenine pathway metabolites in the lungs of mice in a well-established murine model of PAH induced by chronic hypoxia. In Aim 2, we will examine the functional effects of IDO1 deficiency on the development of PAH in vivo. Furthermore, metabolite profiling will allow a broader view of the role of this pathway in the cell-based and animal systems described in this proposal."

"9282438","Project Summary/Abstract  Lack of effective strategies to achieve cytotoxic concentrations of anticancer drugs in deep-seated and metastatic cancers has been a major barrier to improving treatment outcomes in lung cancer. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess exquisite tumor homing capabilities, and thus have the potential to selectively deliver anticancer therapies to tumor tissues. A number of previous studies have shown that genetically modified MSCs can be used to deliver anticancer peptides and proteins to tumor tissues. However, MSCs have not been explored so far to deliver small molecules likely because of the difficulty in immobilizing small molecules in cells for sustained duration.  The overall objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of nano-engineered MSCs (Nano-MSC) in lung cancer. We hypothesize that MSCs engineered to carry drug-loaded, polymeric nanoparticles will allow for tumor-targeted and sustained delivery of cytotoxic drugs, resulting in effective inhibition of lung tumor growth. The specific aims of the proposed research are to 1) Nano-engineer MSCs for cytotoxic drug delivery and 2) Determine the anticancer efficacy of nano-engineered MSCs in a mouse orthotopic model of lung cancer.  Studies in Specific Aim 1 will focus on optimizing the cell engineering strategies to achieve high cytotoxic payload in MSCs without affecting their viability or tumor homing properties. Paclitaxel will be used as a model cytotoxic drug. We will compare the efficiency of simple endocytic uptake against (1) TAT peptide mediated cytosolic delivery and (2) covalent conjugation of nanoparticles to MSC surface for nano-engineering MSCs. In vitro studies examining the effect of nanoparticles on cell uptake, cytotoxicity and differentiation potential against human MSCs as well as inhibition of proliferation of cancer cells when co-incubated with nano-engineered MSCs will be used to optimize the delivery parameters. Studies in Specific Aim 2 will (i) determine the kinetics of paclitaxel delivery to lung tumors using MSCs and (ii) optimize the dose for achieving effective tumor growth inhibition in a mouse orthotopic model of lung cancer.  Relevance: High mortality rate associated with lung cancer warrants the development of novel approaches that are effective against advanced disease. The studies proposed in this application will advance a novel therapeutic strategy combining active targeting using MSCs and sustained drug delivery using a safe, non-toxic vector. The successful completion of the proposed studies will provide critical data establishing the feasibility of this approach.

"9345961","Project Summary Phase Diagnostics is aiming to create the new gold standard diagnostic for the detection of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The company aims to replace lab-based assays for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and expand testing accessibility to previously unreachable settings. The technology combines the ease-of-use and very low cost of rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnostics with the very high accuracy of lab-based tests, enabling unprecedented reliability at the POC and at home. CT infection is one of the most prevalent STIs in the United States. An estimated three million new cases occur each year with direct annual medical costs of greater than $3.5 billion. Untreated CT, symptomatic or not, may cause long term pregnancy complications, even infertility. Traditional lab-based CT assays prevent the ability to test-and-treat within one patient visit. This delay results in a high number of cases that do not get treatment due to loss-to-follow up (especially for young STI patients) and increased infection transmission. Existing rapid POC diagnostics currently fail to address these problems with sensitivities less than 50%. Phase Diagnostics? TruST, a handheld, one-step True Swab Test for CT will address the market?s demands with four key characteristics: (1) Fast: Results to the patient in less than 15 minutes; (2) Affordable: Costs less than $1 to manufacture; (3) Accurate: Sensitivity and specificity on par with lab-based assays; (4) Convenient: Handheld with no required equipment or training. TruST is one of the only products that combines the advantages of all testing options, allowing us to enter testing settings unreachable to existing diagnostics. The key innovation is to use aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to selectively pre-concentrate the pathogenic bacteria prior to detection, thereby dramatically enhancing the accuracy of conventional rapid LFA POC technology and enabling the use of vaginal swabs for the detection of CT. Phase I of the project will involve developing a low risk, easier to achieve two-step device, and a high risk, high reward one-step diagnostic. We will use vaginal swab samples collected in STI clinics to evaluate the feasibility of the two approaches, and the one that achieves superior sensitivity and specificity will be further investigated in Phase II. Successful completion of Phase I will result in finalized diagnostic components for prototyping and evaluation in Phase II. Phase II of the project will consist of developing a prototype of our TruST device. Small-scale manufacturing will be established to ensure a pilot lot can be manufactured with high precision. The manufactured pilot lot will then be used for Alpha and Beta product testing where the devices will be sent to multiple clinical sites for on-site evaluation by clinicians. Successful completion of Phase II will result in a device ready for FDA 510(k) clearance and CLIA waiver-enabling clinical studies."
"9444819","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The New York University School of Medicine has a long established record of training academic hematologists. In large part, this record has been fostered by the continuous support, since 1962, of a NIH Training Grant (T32) which supports 6 M.D., M.D., PhD, and PhD Trainees. The long term goal of the Training Program is to prepare Hematology Trainees for future careers in academic medicine. The interaction of both M.D., M.D./PhD, and PhD Trainees in a unified Training Program serves to increase the number of physicians and scientists committed to a career in research. The Training Program exposes Trainees to rigorous mentored lab based hematology research, a detailed curriculum, seminar series, a journal club, a clinical management conference, and the opportunity to participate (for M.D Trainees) or observe (for PhD Trainees) the practice of clinical hematology relevant to the Trainee's laboratory investigation. Trainees are selected from the ACGME accredited adult and pediatric hematology/medical oncology fellowship programs and from eligible post- doctoral PhD fellows in participating faculty member's laboratories. The program, led by a Director with three well qualified Associate Directors, is specifically dedicated to actively recruiting underrepresented minorities. Our 15 Mentors have experience in mentoring and documented productivity, and their laboratories are highly interactive and use a variety of model systems to study 1) benign hematology including PNH, platelet biology and Fanconi anemia; 2) the genetics of leukemia; 3) JAK/STAT and Ras signaling mechanisms in hematopoietic stem cells, lymphopoieis, leukemia and lymphoma; 4) lymphopoiesis and lymphocyte activation (including GVHD); 5) mechanisms of myeloid and lymphoid trafficking; 6) ubiquitination in hematopoietic stem cell biology, lymphopoiesis, and leukemia/lymphoma; and 7) the epigenetic and molecular basis of normal and abnormal hematopoiesis. Past graduates of our program have achieved the highest ranks of academia and have made lasting contributions to the field of hematology, and a high proportion of our recent graduates remain in academia, using the research skills gained as Trainees in careers as researchers, academic teachers and trialists. Over the last 10 years the majority of our graduates have obtained positions in academic institutions, have published their findings in the highest tier of journals, and have received multiple NIH and foundation awards."
"9345199","Significance: Despite decreases in the overall number of new breast cancer (BC) cases reported in the US annually, there are still about 40,000 BC deaths annually, ~80% from metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Thus the ability to monitor MBC is important to determine disease status and therapy response. While the gold standard, imaging is expensive, time consuming and slow to detect disease response or progression, circulating biomarkers such as CA15-3, CA27.29 and CEA, also used to monitor MBC have limitations due to low specificity and sensitivity. Thus, providing better safe, inexpensive, non-invasive, specific and sensitive tests for new biomarkers to monitor disease is a key component in improving MBC patient care. Strategy: Measurement of critical biological drivers as biomarkers of the disease will provide a clearer understanding of current disease state and improve proactive clinical management. The PI has characterized a proprietary target biomarker, GP88 expressed in BC tissue, secreted in BC patients? blood and playing a key role in BC tumorigenesis. GP88 IHC and EIA tests to measure GP88 tumor expression and circulating levels in BC patients were developed and clinically validated. Supporting Evidence: Pathological studies have established GP88 tumor expression as a predictive marker for recurrence. Clinical studies have shown BC patients with progressive disease have elevated GP88 serum levels compared to patients with no evidence of disease or healthy individuals. Patients with poor outcome had a significantly higher GP88 serum levels (56ng/ml, range 40-146ng/ml) than alive patients (36ng/ml, range 30-46ng/ml), p=0.016. These data indicate that if GP88 blood levels are maintained below a yet to be established cut-off level, then a patient can be expected to have a longer survival than patients with elevated GP88. Hypothesis: Measuring serum GP88 level could provide an ideal approach for monitoring disease status in MBC patients as adjunctive to imaging. This hypothesis will be investigated by measuring GP88 levels in sequential retrospective serum samples collected from 140 MBC patients enrolled in an IRB approved study at UMGCCC and correlate such levels with objective measures of clinical outcome determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Specific Aims: we will: 1a) establish by Kaplan-Meier survival graphs a GP88 threshold value that stratify BC patients for survival and clinical outcomes; 1b) determine if changes in GP88 serum level correlate with changes in RECIST1.1 criteria collected at the same time-points; 2) using receiver operating characteristics curves, identify GP88 cutoff values that effectively stratify patients by their clinical outcome; 3) using multivariate analysis and logistic regression evaluate if combining GP88 and CA15-3 results can improve upon, and enhance, the predictive performance of CA15-3. Overall Impact: Since GP88 is a driver of the disease, the use of the GP88 EIA test has the potential to provide real-time evaluation of the disease state, making GP88 a better biomarker to monitor MBC than those currently available. This will provide clinicians with a new assay to assess disease status to increase predictive values of existing techniques such as imaging."
"9207082","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. The 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer patients is only 6%, indicating a critical need for an improved understanding of pancreatic cancer development and identification of new therapeutic targets. MYC is a protein that strongly contributes to cancer progression in a wide variety of tissues and regulates several cellular functions that are corrupted during cancer development. Importantly, loss of MYC function can lead to cancer cell death and decreased tumor formation in mouse tumor models. Studies of MYC function have identified a modified form of MYC that has increased stability and activity. This form is found at high levels in several cancer cell types and leads to uncontrolled cell growth. Importantly, MYC is activated downstream of several factors known to be deregulated in pancreatic cancer. Specifically, the KRAS pathway, which is constitutively on in ~95% of all pancreatic ductal tumors, has been shown to contribute to MYC activation in other cell types. The role of MYC in pancreatic cancer, however, is poorly understood. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine if KRAS-mediated activation of MYC significantly contributes to pancreatic tumor progression. To achieve this goal, the proposed aims will utilize a novel mouse model of pancreatic cancer, patient tissue, and pancreatic cancer cells to investigate how MYC alters the initiation and progression of pancreatic cancer. Specifically, Aim 1 will determine if combining aberrant KRAS and MYC activity in a novel mouse model recapitulates the hallmarks of human pancreatic disease. Aim 2, will identify the stage at which MYC transitions to the more stable, active form in both human and mouse tumors. Finally, Aim 3 will determine if activation of MYC significantly contributes to the transformation of normal pancreatic cells to cancer cells downstream of KRAS signals. Pancreatic cancer remains highly resistant to cancer therapies. Alterations in the KRAS pathway occur in the majority of pancreatic cancer patients, however developing successful clinical drugs that target this protein has been unsuccessful. The proposed research will increase our understanding of the pathways that drive pancreatic cancer downstream of KRAS and potentially identify the proteins that control the activating modification of MYC as therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer."
"9333699","Zika virus (ZV) is a mosquito borne flavivirus (FV) with unique properties that permit it to persist in patient blood and urine for months, to be sexually transmitted, and to cause encephalitis and fetal microencephaly. In patients, ZV infects endothelial cells (ECs) and crosses the EC lining of capillaries, which normally separate maternal and fetal blood supplies, resulting in transplacental transmission and infection of fetal tissues. How ZV persists and crosses brain and placental barriers remains to determined. We recently found that ZV persistently infects and replicates in primary human cerebral MECs (CMECs) and human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). This target provides the potential for ZV to reside in patient ECs, disseminate in bodily fluids and concomitantly bypass placental and brain capillary barrier functions. Here we investigate the mechanism by which ZV establishes persistence and spread within primary human ECs.  The ability of ZV and other FVs to infect cells is acutely sensitive to the prior addition of Type I interferon (IFN?/?). In mice deficient in IFN?/? receptors, ZV infects placental and fetal brain tissues resulting in fetal demise that mimics human microencephaly. In IFN locus deficient Vero cells, ZV replicates to high titers, causing a self-limiting infection that is cytopathic, similar to the ZV effects on neurons. Cytotoxicity is consistent with acute transient infections caused by other FVs, but is contrary to findings of ZV persistence in patients. Distinct from Veros, we observed no cytopathology associated with ZV (PRV) infection of primary human CMECs or HUVECs. We found that ZV efficiently infected ECs, replicated to high titers and inhibited the induction of IFN? and IFN stimulated genes 12- 48hpi. Remarkably, we observed that ZV continued to replicate and spread in ECs, even after passaging ZV infected CMECs or HUVECs serially. This does not occur in dengue virus infected ECs where late IFN? induction restricts viral spread.  These findings suggest that ZV uniquely regulates and persists within primary human ECs. In addition to IFN inhibition, our transcriptional analysis of ZV infected CMECs revealed 2 novel responses critical to EC and neuronal function. We found that ZV highly induced TRAIL/Apo2 and Rnd1 in infected CMECs. TRAIL is a secreted ligand that causes neuronal apoptosis and Rnd1 is a Rho family GTPase that inhibits axonal extensions linked to human cognitive deficits. However, in ECs TRAIL uniquely directs cell survival and proliferative Akt and ERK responses that protect ECs from apoptosis, and Rnd1 is a novel, constitutively active, inhibitor of inter-endothelial cell adherence that causes permeability. These findings suggest novel mechanisms for ZV to persist in endothelial cells and cross fetal and cerebral capillary barriers. Persistently infected ECs may serve as a source of ZV spread, persistent viremia (1-3 months) and capillary permeability that permits ZV access to fetal and neuronal tissue. Thus ZV infection of ECs may play a strategic role in ZV persistence and spread.  My lab investigates EC permeability directed by RNA viruses, mechanisms of IFN regulation and therapeutic targeting of pathways to restore EC barrier functions. Here we analyze responses of primary human ECs to ZV infection. We define roles for IFN, TRAIL and Rnd1 in ZV persistence, cell survival and increased EC permeability, that in vivo may contribute to person to person and tissue specific ZV transmission. Analysis of ZV persistence in ECs may reveal therapeutic approaches to clear ZV infections, enhance EC barrier functions and reduce ZV access to fetal and neuronal tissues. !"
"9418766","?    DESCRIPTION: Chronic Opioid use and abuse has been well documented to induce bacterial translocation and sustained immune activation. In HIV patients, accumulating clinical observations show a strong correlation between microbial translocation and HIV disease progression. Given the overall detrimental effect of sustained microbial translocation on host health, it is conceivable that therapies to prevent/block microbial translocation can be exploited as novel therapeutic intervention in HIV/AIDS and may be particularly beneficial in HIV patients that are opioid users/abusers. The gut microbiota, play a significant role in maintaining gut homeostasis and gut barrier integrity. Disruption in the composition of intestinal microbes has been shown to have important implications in the development of a number of disease processes. Loss of microorganisms which are part of the normal flora of healthy hosts increases the susceptibility to a more virulent composition of organism that can contribute to barrier disruption and microbial translocation. Thus far, very little is known regarding the role of the gu microbiota in the underlying mechanisms involved in the increased microbial translocation in either opioid abusers or in HIV patients. This lack of knowledge has important negative health- related implications since gut microbial translocation leading to immune activation contributes to AIDS related pathology and possibly HAND. Our preliminary data show for the first time that when community composition dissimilarity was analyzed using microbiota profiles morphine treatment resulted in a significantly different cluster in gut bacterial microbial composition compared to placebo animals. Furthermore, factors that contribute to microbial dysbiosis such as significant decrease in the number of bacterial community and reduced bacterial diversity was also observed in the morphine treated group. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that morphine modulation of the gut microbiota and its virulence play a central role in morphine and morphine +HIV induced intestinal barrier disruption. This results in increased bacterial translocation, immune activation and contributes to HIV disease progression. To test the hypothesis we will in Aim 1: Determine the abundance and species diversity of the microbiota community (stool and mucosa associated) following morphine treatment and in the context of HIV infection and its contribution to gut barrier disruption and systemic microbial translocation and immune activation. Aim 2: Determine the virulence traits, clonality, and antibiotic resistance of the mucosa-associated microbial community in morphine treated animals and in the context of HIV. (Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli). Aim 3: Determine the therapeutic potential of methyl naltrexone and TLR2 antagonists in morphine HIV induced modulation of gut microbiota and bacterial virulence."

"9428749","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Alcoholism is a chronic disorder described by compulsive seeking and consumption of alcohol, the result of a transition from recreational alcohol use to abuse and dependence. Alcohol dependence and withdrawal are characterized by negative emotional states resulting from recruited brain stress systems. The amygdalar nuclei, in particular the central amygdala (CeA), are considered a hub for negative emotional circuitry, and the role of pro- and anti-stress neuropeptides in this brain structure is critical for the development of alcohol dependence. The CeA contains primarily GABAergic neurons, and the inhibitory synapses are very sensitive to acute ethanol and play a critical role in the behavioral effects of acute and chronic ethanol consumption. Pro- stress neuropeptides like corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) have been found to enhance GABAergic transmission in the CeA, while anti-stress neuropeptides like nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) decrease GABAergic transmission. The balance between anti- and pro-stress signaling is perturbed during the transition to alcohol dependence, characterized by an overactive CRF system. Importantly, one anti-stress neuropeptide, oxytocin (OT), has been shown to decrease drinking and block withdrawal symptoms when administered to human alcoholics. However, no studies have investigated the effects of OT and its interactions with ethanol on the GABAergic system in the CeA. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to characterize the effects of OT on CeA GABAergic signaling, its interactions with acute ethanol and the potential neuroadaptations induced by ethanol dependence in the OT system, using electrophysiological techniques. The data generated by this project will elucidate the mechanisms of action of OT in the CeA and provide important information to the neuronal changes that contribute to the transition from recreational alcohol consumption to alcohol dependence, and could lead to the development of better therapeutics in the treatment of alcoholism."
"9443304","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method for probing and modulating human brain function. It is approved for the treatment of depression and pre-surgical cortical mapping; it also shows promise in other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Exactly what TMS does to neuronal activity, however, remains unknown. This gap in our knowledge precludes us from biologically-based, rational design of TMS protocols. To fill this gap, we need a better mechanistic understanding of the effect of TMS on cerebral neurons and a database of dose-response curves that describe how the selection of TMS parameters (the dose) relates to changes of neuronal activity (the response). Our project aims to contribute such mechanistic insight and empirical data. Our interdisciplinary team has developed a novel repertoire of tools and techniques that permit us to manipulate the TMS stimulus parameters, model the resulting electromagnetic fields and neuronal responses, and record from cerebral neurons while TMS is applied. In our first set of experiments (Aim 1), we will vary the temporal parameters of TMS. Using a custom TMS pulse generator, we will systematically change what the individual pulses look like (the pulse waveform) and how they are applied sequentially (the pulse train). Concomitant recordings in the zone of stimulation will determine how the various parameters modulate the firing rates of axons, excitatory neurons, and inhibitory neurons. Second (Aim 2), we will vary the spatial parameters of TMS using various coil locations and types of stimulation coils, including macaque-scaled approximations to conventional figure-8 coils as well as less focal coils recently approved for depression treatment (H coils). With simultaneous targeted recordings in the brain we will map the neural response in various cortical regions. In parallel to these empirical studies, we will construct individual, realistic, MRI-based head models coupled with neural response models to simulate, respectively, the electric field spatial distribution and the resultin response of various neuron types. The simulations will both guide and be informed by the empirical neural recordings, enhancing our understating of the mechanisms of TMS and providing a novel simulation tool that could inform TMS dosage. The end result of this project will be to discover how TMS influences the brain at the level of single neurons and simple circuits. The outcome should be transformative in helping researchers and clinicians to navigate the vast parametric space of TMS so that it may be used more effectively as a probe in neuroscience, and as a clinical treatment."
"9286702","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The dynamics of human connectome reorganization following blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption during traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains poorly understood. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the human brain, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) has become the sequence of choice for the clinical identification of micro- hemorrhages, which are indicators of BBB disruption. Partly because blood vessel walls may be more mechanically elastic than axonal membranes, the presence of (micro-) hemorrhages is strongly correlated with that of traumatic axonal injury (TAI) as revealed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this day, few studies have quantified in systematic detail (A) how white matter (WM) connectivity is affected by BBB disruption and by TAI, and (B) how SWI-resolved micro-hemorrhages (presumably located in regions strongly affected by TAI) lead to changes in the structural and functional organization of the connectome. Without understanding these phenomena at the scale of the entire brain (rather than on a strictly regional or lobar level) it may be very challenging to assess their true impact upon patients' long-term well-being. The goal of this proposed research project is to (A) assess the sequelae of (micro-) hemorrhages in mild TBI and to (B) quantify the short- and long- term effects of hemorrhagic lesions and mechanical shearing upon neurological and neuropsychological function in patients with mild TBI. This work may provide novel insights into how BBB disruption and mechanical shearing of axons during TAI lead to neural and cognitive dysfunction. We propose to use novel quantitative methods for neuroimage analysis to answer fundamental questions pertaining to the role of BBB disruption and TAI in the reorganization of the human connectome. Specifically, we seek to (1) quantify the longitudinal evolution of WM connectivity in (peri-) lesional regions affected by BBB disruption as reflected by the presence of SWI-resolvable (micro-) hemorrhages, (2) resolve the spatio-temporal relationship between the presence of (micro-) hemorrhages, and TAI-related changes in the human connectome which occur within the first 12 months post- injury, and (3) quantify how the interplay between (micro-) hemorrhage-related BBB disruption, TAI and WM atrophy modulates the deterioration and/or recovery of neuropsychological function within the first 12 months after TBI. Improved understanding of these correlations between (micro-) bleed occurrence and functional sequelae could allow the true severity of concussions and other forms of traumatic injuries to be assessed at an early stage. In turn, this could allow clinicians to gain novel insights pertaining to the potential consequences of SWI-resolved (micro-) hemorrhages upon neurological and neuropsychological function."
"9419541","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mice and humans share approximately 20,000 genes. To date, little data exists for more than half of these genes and nearly one third have no functional annotation. Because of the high degree of similarity between the mouse and human gene set, genetic data generated in mice can often be extrapolated to human gene function. Mouse models of genes with common functionality between mice and men can lead to new models of human disease, which are useful for drug screening, preclinical studies and deeper understanding of biological and disease mechanism. The goal of the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) is to generate lines of mice that carry knockouts (KOs) for a genome-wide collection of mouse genes and subject the mice to broad based phenotyping. The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) proposes to merge its currently funded KOMP2 Mouse Production and Cryopreservation (U42) and Knockout Mouse Phenotyping (U54) operations as part of RFA-RM-15-017 Limited Competition: Knockout Mouse Production and Phenotyping Project (UM1). JAX KOMP2 proposes to use cutting-edge and cost-effective Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (Cas9 RGN, also called CRISPR/Cas9) technology to generate, breed, cryopreserve and phenotype1500 lines of mice during the project period. Continued effort will be made to improve the Cas9 RGN technology so as to reduce costs, increase targeting efficiency, and create more complex mutant alleles. Genes will be selected in coordination with our KOMP2 and IMPC partners, and will focus on those with poor annotation, genes that have significant community demand and integrate with other NIH-support programs, and genes predicted to function in select pathways. To guarantee ready access to the community, we will ship mice to outside investigators while they are alive on the shelf and deposit the lines into the Mouse Mutant Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) repositories for future use. Broad based phenotyping on juvenile animals up to 18 weeks of age will be performed on all 1500 lines of mice using International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)-required and JAX-specific protocols. We will assess body weight and composition, metabolic and physiological parameters, and behavioral and cognitive function. To detect age-dependent phenotypes, we will use the same pipeline to phenotype 20% (300 total) of the lines between 15-18 months of age. Based on data generated from the current phase of KOMP2, we expect about 30% of lines to be non-viable. We will characterize the non-viable mutants using high-throughput imaging modalities at three embryonic time points. All data generated from embryonic, juvenile and adult mice will be rapidly deposited into the Data Coordination Center (DCC) that supports KOMP2 and the IMPC. Lastly, JAX will work collaboratively with the KOMP2 Regional Network and with member organizations of the IMPC to share protocols, innovation, and new technology and to broadly and openly disseminate our findings to the international community through publication, presentations at meetings, web activities and social media."
"9327338","Project Summary  The vasculature in the central nervous system (CNS) is essential to support and maintain brain function throughout life. To do so, the brain vasculature acquires many unique cellular and molecular properties to make up the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Reduced vascular integrity, due to a loss of these properties, is a recognized consequence of many CNS diseases, like encephalitis. Even though altered vascular integrity is thought to exacerbate encephalitis, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Addressing these gaps in our knowledge will provide insight into the underlying causes of vascular instability during encephalitis. Furthermore, understanding these mechanisms could provide a potential for developing therapeutics aimed at improving the cerebral vasculature as a means to protect the brain from further injury.  During my thesis work, I have identified that the brain vasculature is undergoing endothelial- mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) in a mouse model of viral-induced encephalitis. EndoMT contributes to vascular malformations and loss of BBB properties in a congential vasculopathy called Cerebral Cavernous Malformations. Based on this, I hypothesize that EndoMT initiates vascular instability and this is mediated by TGF? signaling, an EndoMT effector pathway. I will test this hypothesis in two distinct aims. In Aim 1, I will establish a timeline for EndoMT progression in the vasculature to understand how this relates to loss of vascular integrity and BBB properties during viral encephalitis. In Aim 2, I will identify if TGF? signaling promotes EndoMT and vascular instability thereby exacerbating disease outcome. Completion of experiments in this proposal will provide new knowledge about the cellular and molecular properties that are affected within the vasculature during encephalitis."
"9310653","Protein?protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in most biological processes, and therefore represent an important class of targets for therapeutic development. Biologics based therapeutics, such as antibodies, exemplify success in PPI regulation. However, antibodies can only be applied to protein targets on cell surface due to their impermeability to plasma membranes. Although small molecule drugs can readily cross membranes, applying small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) to disrupt PPIs is a challenging task because approximately 750?1,500 2 of protein surface area is involved at the interface of PPIs, which is too large for SMIs to cover. In addition, these interacting protein surfaces do not have pocket-like small molecule binding sites. Therefore, these PPI sites are deemed as ?undruggable? targets for SMIs. The Holy Grail of drug development is to render small molecules the power of biologics to regulate PPIs. We recently developed a cell-based functional assay for high throughput screening (HTS) to identify SMIs for steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), a large and mostly non- structured nuclear protein. Without any SRC-3 structural information, we identified and improved a series of SMIs that can target SRC-3?the 1st generation SMI gossypol, the 2nd generation SMI bufalin, and the 3rd generation SMI SI-2, a highly promising drug candidate. In our recent report (PNAS 2016), we demonstrated that SI-2 can selectively reduce the transcriptional activities and the protein concentrations of SRC-3 in cells through direct physical interactions with SRC-3, and selectively induce breast cancer cell death with IC50 values in the low nM range (3-20 nM) while not affecting normal cell viability. Furthermore, the in vivo study demonstrated that SI-2 can significantly inhibit primary tumor growth and reduce SRC-3 protein levels in a breast cancer mouse model. Despite of the encouraging antitumor activities of SI-2, it has a relatively short plasma half-life (1 h). In the preliminary study, we have identified SI-12 that has similar biological activities to SI-2 but a much improved plasma half-life (6 h). In Aim 1, we will further optimize SI-2 SRC-3 SMI `unique' derivatives with improved drug- like properties. In Aims 2 and 3, we will take advantage of the novel SRC-3 SMI to address the two major challenges for current breast cancer treatment?resistance to endocrine therapy in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer and tumor metastasis in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Successful completion of this project will not only significantly improve breast cancer treatment through the development of a `first-in-class' drug that targets oncogenic coactivators, but also encourage other researchers to develop strategies to target protein-protein interactions that are designated as `important but undruggable' targets in the future."
"9258913","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million people in the United States. Family members of patients with CKD, particularly diabetic kidney disease, are at increased risk of developing CKD themselves. However, genetic studies cannot yet account for this apparent heritability; neither can known environmental risk factors, such as diabetes or hypertension. Our proposal is aimed at investigating whether the interaction between the environment and the DNA can account for this heritability. Environmental factors, such as diabetes, are known to affect DNA control mechanisms, called epigenetics. The epigenome controls whether DNA is active or inactive by making changes to the DNA that do not change the nucleotide sequence itself. These changes in turn lead to changes in the level of gene expression. Our study will investigate this mechanism on a genome wide level in human kidney tissue. We will examine both genome wide changes to the epigenome, specifically cytosine methylation, and gene expression levels in human kidney samples. We will compare human kidney samples with diabetic kidney disease to control samples, both with and without diabetes, in order to identify epigenetic changes that may cause disease development. We will compare samples with diabetic kidney disease to samples with hypertensive kidney disease in order to distinguish the effects of these environmental phenotypes. In addition, we will analyze changes to the epigenome, which are associated with rapid progression to kidney failure. We will analyze the genomic locations of these changes in order to identify novel pathways involved in CKD development and progression. These pathways may represent therapeutic targets for the prevention of kidney failure."
"9297917","Quantitative imaging technologies for the characterization of the size-dependent tumor vascular permeability (i.e., in the macro- to nano- size range) are of great clinical interest. Such technologies will be extremely useful for oncologists to assess the tumor vascular permeability to drugs at different sizes and, based on the drug accessibility, to stratify patients for the appropriate treatment. Moreover it can be used to monitor the tumor responses to any interventions that can potentially modulate the tumor vascular permeability and improve the drug delivery. In the current application, we propose to directly use the highly-safe, clinically-available dextrans as new MRI probes for assessing tumor vascular permeability without the need for any radioactive, paramagnetic, or super-paramagnetic label. In this approach, dextran is detected directly via its exchangeable hydroxyl (OH) protons using a recently emerged MRI contrast mechanism, Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), namely dextran-enhanced CEST (dexCEST). Because dextrans are available in a wide range of particle sizes-- from 5 to 54 nm for molecular weights (MW) from 10 kD to 2 MD, respectively, it is therefore feasible to use them as macro- and nano-sized MR imaging agents in a broad range of applications. As such, we hypothesize that dexCEST MRI can be used to assess the size-dependent tumor vascular permeability, and to monitor the response in the tumor vascular permeability of pancreatic cancer to stroma-targeting therapies. In particular, we will first fully optimize and validate dexCEST MRI detection to assess size-dependent tumor vascular permeability of experimental pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors. Then, we will use this technique to monitor the tumor response to stroma-targeting therapies in experimental PDAC tumors, which will lead to the evaluation of the use of dexCEST MRI as an imaging biomarker to quantify the efficacy of stroma-depleting drugs. The successful completion of this project will have an immediate impact on the pre-clinical development and clinical implementation of stroma-targeting therapies to treat hypo-permeable PDAC in a personalized medicine manner. Because many new drugs are in macro-size range (i.e., monocolonal antibodies) and nano-size range (nanomedicine), our approach is expected to play an important role in the clinical implementation of newly developed chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as well as their combination with stroma-targeting therapies. In addition, we expect that these developments can be easily tailored to other types of solid tumors."
"9241878","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Musculoskeletal pain is the most frequent and expensive condition for worker compensation and disability. Previous investigations into the pathogenesis of work- related musculoskeletal pain have tended to focus on the possibility of pathology in muscle cells; however, it is clear that chronic ergonomic muscle pain can occur without any signs of cellular injury in the muscle. During the current funding period we have provided extensive evidence, in two animal models of ergonomic muscle pain (vibration and eccentric exercise) that the muscle nociceptor is a primary locus of pathophysiological changes that produce chronic muscle pain. Furthermore, these models exhibit a neuroplastic shift from acute hyperalgesia to chronic hyperalgesic priming that enables us to study the cellular mechanisms of the transition from acute to chronic muscle pain. Based on those findings, this proposal outlines a project that will employ two innovative approaches to advance our understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms of chronic muscle pain. First, we will pursue our preliminary observations which suggest a discrete subpopulation of nociceptors plays a critical role in chronic ergonomic muscle pain, and that distinctive features of this subpopulation (sensitivity to GDNF and versican-dependent binding of IB4) are not just convenient markers to distinguish them from other subpopulations, but in fact, play a crucial role in their unique contribution to chronic muscle pain. Second, in view of the prominent clinical role stress plays in the pathophysiology of chronic muscle pain syndromes, we will investigate the nociceptor as a primary site at which activation of neuroendocrine stress axes contributes to chronic pain. The multi-disciplinary expertise of the PI's laboratory enables this proposal to outline a research plan based on the concerted use of behavioral, pharmacological, anatomical, and in vivo electrophysiological and in vitro neurophysiological methods."
"9206900","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a multi-organ systemic disease characterized by activation of immune cells, which results in vascular dysfunction (vasculopathy) and subsequent scarring (fibrosis). SSc has a higher than expect prevalence in the US military. Although SSc is heterogeneous in the extent of organ involvement and prognosis, it is accepted that all SSc cases have a progressive and usually devastating course. Since vasculopathy precedes fibrosis in this disease, a focus on understanding its natural history and preventative measures for vascular dysfunction has profound implications. On a national level there are 5,766 SSc patients (ICD-9 710.1) presently cared for in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). While there is no cure for SSc, studies of therapeutics that can help slow disease progression are valuable to our Veterans. This proposal addresses the solicitation for projects with attention to SSc requested by President Obama after reviewing potential contamination of water at Camp Lejeune. Our proposal is a patient-centered outreach for our Veterans with SSc to inform and prevent catastrophic end- stage vascular abnormalities, including digital ulcers, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and scleroderma renal crisis in SSc. Additionally, we propose a novel application of a therapeutic for this disease. Our pilot work suggests that measurement of endothelial dysfunction with flow mediated dilatation (FMD) holds promise as novel method to assess disease progression as well as the therapeutic efficacy of the pharmacologic compound tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in SSc. We believe that BH4, which targets the endothelium, has great promise to reduce SSc-related tissue hypoxia, end organ damage, and potentially may impact underlying disease progression. The objectives of the proposed studies are to take our pilot work forward. In our first aim, we will adopt an integrative approach and validate a novel, non-invasive technique, FMD to define vasculopathy in SSc. In our second aim, we will examine if BH4 is effective in ameliorating vascular dysfunction in patients with SSc. In our third aim, we will determine the role of oxidative stress in BH4- mediated improvements in vascular function in patients with SSc. Our overarching goal of these aims is to improve vasculopathy detection and management in our Veterans with SSc. A better understanding of the initiating insult and natural progression of SSc vasculopathy is needed in order to develop therapeutics with a goal of curing/treating the underlying disease. This project has the potential to impact not only our Veterans with SSc, but also those with vascular abnormalities including digital ulcers, PAH, and renal crisis. This proposal represents a potential major therapeutic advance for our Veterans with SSc."
"9328813","Project Summary/Abstract: Lung and breast cancer are two of the most common cancers in the United States with an estimated 224,390 and 246,660 new cases in 2016, respectively. Current treatment regimens for these cancers include extensive chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, but despite multiple modalities of treatment, the 5 year survival for lung cancer is only 17.7%, and the estimated number of deaths from breast cancer in 2016 is 40,450 individuals. Given these outcomes, new treatment options that can selectively kill cancer cells as well as early progenitor cancer stem cells that are believed to be responsible for development of drug resistance and metastasis are urgently needed. The repurposing of currently available relatively non-toxic FDA approved drugs such as D-penicillamine (DPEN) and disulfiram (DSF), which are possibly able to target fundamental differences in oxidative metabolism in cancer versus normal cells, could provide a promising and rapidly translatable strategy to target these deadly cancers. Preliminary data generated by the applicant has shown for the first time that DPEN and DSF are selectively toxic to breast and lung cancer cells, relative to normal breast and lung epithelial cells, when combined with physiologically relevant non-toxic concentrations of copper, and this toxicity was dependent on H2O2-mediated oxidative stress. In addition, DPEN and DSF were found to be capable of enhancing the effects of radiation on lung cancer cells and were able to inhibit the increased percentage of viable cancer stem cells (as detected by ALDH1 activity) in bulk populations of lung cancer cells exposed to radiation. These promising preliminary results have led to the overarching hypothesis that: DPEN and DSF selectively induce cytotoxicity and radio-chemo-sensitization in human breast and lung cancer cells (versus normal cells) and cancer stem cells via H2O2-mediated oxidative stress that is mitigated by disruptions in intracellular redox active metal ions. Aim 1 of this proposal will determine in vitro if DPEN and DSF are differentially cytotoxic to lung and breast cancer cells (versus normal cells) via H2O2-mediated oxidative stress and disruptions in redox active metal ions. Aim 2 will determine if DPEN and DSF combined with ionizing radiation and/or standard chemotherapy will selectively (relative to normal cells) enhance cancer cell cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo via a mechanism mediated by H2O2, redox active metal ions, and suppression of cancer stem cell survival. The successful completion of these studies will define biochemical mechanisms underlying DPEN and DSF selective toxicity in cancer versus normal cells and will provide new means for exploiting fundamental differences in oxidative metabolism between these cell populations in order to increase treatment efficacy using traditional cancer therapies. The proposed project will also allow the applicant to expand her basic science investigational skills, experimental knowledge base, and detailed mechanistic understanding of redox biology as it relates to cancer therapy that will greatly facilitate her ultimate goal of becoming a successful physician scientist faculty member and PI in translational oncology."
"9209356","SUMMARY Atherosclerosis and its consequences are the most common causes of death worldwide. Lipid accumulation and associated inflammatory processes are critical to atherosclerosis progression. Investigators from Projects 1 and 2 recently observed that chronic psychosocial stress accelerates hematopoiesis and promotes inflammation in atherosclerotic mice. It is currently unknown if this is relevant in humans. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), triggered by exposure to extreme traumatic events, is associated with elevated circulating markers of inflammation and higher risk for MI. PTSD patients therefore provide a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms linking chronic psychosocial stress and atherosclerosis. In Project 3 we will employ innovative PET combined with magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) to simultaneously study the hematopoietic system, the artery wall, and the brain's fear system, which comprises the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), to elucidate the relationship between psychosocial stress and systemic inflammation/atherosclerosis in a two center clinical study looking at: I) individuals with PTSD, II) individuals without PTSD but with exposure to severe psychosocial trauma (Trauma Control), and III) matched volunteers with neither PTSD nor exposure to trauma (Healthy Control). Participants in the three study groups, recruited from urban settings in New York and Boston, will be group-matched by age, gender, and Framingham risk scores (FRS). We will recruit 80 subjects in each group and in Aim 1, investigate the relationship between PTSD and atherosclerotic inflammation and burden measured by PET/MRI. In Aim 2, we will examine the relationships between brain's fear circuit responsiveness to threat assessed by functional MRI (fMRI) and white matter integrity assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and relate these data to hematopoietic system activation, and vascular inflammation measured by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and atherosclerotic burden measured by MRI. Additionally these parameters will also be related to blood hematopoietic progenitor migration measured using multiparametric fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Together, these data will provide a very unique picture of the multi-system link between the human brain, hematopoietic organs, inflammatory cells, and the artery wall."
"9269254","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to link events with their temporal and situational contexts. This ability allows for memories to be truly autobiographical, and failures of episodic memory are signs of normal aging and neurodegenerative disease. The proposed research aims to illuminate the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying human episodic (contextually-mediated) memory through both computational modeling and the analysis of intracranial and scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings taken as neurosurgical patients and healthy adults search their memory for recently studied material. Using a model-based approach coupled with multivariate pattern analysis applied to electrophysiological data our ?rst aim is to elucidate the interacting roles f context and content information in episodic memory. We further seek to identify the anatomical substrates of content and context information in the process of memory formation, retrieval and reinstatement (Aim 2). Finally, we will carry out parallel invasive (intracranial EEG) and non-invasive (scalp EEG) studies to assess the viability of decoding neural signatures of episodic memory using non-invasive methods. This work will serve as an important bridge between the behavioral and neurobiological approaches to human memory, and will provide insights into the mechanisms of memory decline both in normal aging and in neurological disease."
"9295937","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our work and that of others demonstrate that older men and women with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) have greater functional impairment and more rapid functional decline than older people without PAD. The functional impairments documented in older people with PAD are associated with mobility loss, increased mortality, and poor quality of life. Yet only two medications are FDA approved for improving the walking limitations associated with PAD.  Pre-clinical evidence shows that cocoa and its major flavanol component, epicatechin, have therapeutic properties that target pathophysiologic impairments in PAD. These therapeutic properties include improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, increased skeletal muscle capillary density, and favorable changes in skeletal muscle levels of myostatin and follistatin that increase muscle mass and strength. Cocoa also protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury, improves endothelial function, and reduces oxidative stress. In summary, epicatechin-rich cocoa targets and reverses several pathophysiologic processes that are common in PAD and that are associated with functional impairment and functional decline in PAD. However, the effect of chronic daily cocoa consumption on functional decline has not been studied in older people with PAD.  We propose a pilot study of 44 PAD participants age 65 and older: a double-blind, randomized controlled pilot clinical trial to provide preliminary data to address our hypothesis that chronic daily epicatechin-rich cocoa improves lower extremity functioning in older people with PAD by improving mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, increasing calf muscle capillary density, promoting calf skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, and improving endothelial function.  In our primary aim, we will determine whether PAD participants randomized to an epicatechin-rich cocoa beverage have greater increases or smaller declines in six-minute walk performance at 6-month follow-up, compared to those randomized to an identical appearing placebo drink with comparable caloric composition. In our secondary aims, we will determine whether PAD participants randomized to cocoa have improved treadmill walking performance, improved brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, and favorable changes in calf muscle biopsy measures of mitochondrial function, mitochondrial biogenesis, follistatin, myostatin, and capillary density. Ou outcome measures will be carefully timed relative to the last intervention dose to distinguish between the acute vs. chronic effects of cocoa-epicatechin.  If our hypotheses are correct, results will be used to design a large, definitive randomized controlled trial of epicatechin-rich cocoa to improve lower extremity functioning and prevent mobility loss in the large and growing number of older people who are disabled by PAD."
"9311744","Our earlier mechanistic analyses of estrogen action in brain led to the discovery that estrogen is a master regulator of the bioenergetic system in brain that promotes glucose transport, glucose metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation. Collectively, the data provided compelling evidence for estrogen as a systems biology metabolic regulator in brain and illuminated compensatory mechanisms consistent with an aging female brain that is starving. For estrogen to function as master regulator of the bioenergetic system in the female brain, estrogen must be integrating nuclear and mitochondrial genomic responses. Further from a systems level perspective, it would be necessary for estrogen to also regulate cytoplasmic signaling mechanisms for real time feedback on the functional outcomes of nuclear and mitochondrial gene transcription. The fundamental issues to be investigated are the mechanisms whereby estrogen integrates bioenergetic responses across two genomic compartments while simultaneously monitoring energetic demand and performance in real time. The proposed program of research is designed to test two hypotheses. First, estrogenic control of the bioenergetic system in the female brain requires: 1) both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes; 2) integration of gene expression across both genomic compartments and 3) activation of rapid signaling cascades to provide real time feedback on bioenergetic performance. Second, we hypothesize that loss of estrogen in the aging female brain leads to a systematic dis-integration of estrogenic control of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes followed by decline in bioenergetic sensing mechanisms. Estrogenic control of the bioenergetic system of the brain and the dismantling thereof has basic, translational and clinical significance. From a discovery perspective the proposed program of research is unique in exploring the mechanisms underlying estrogenic integration of nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression and the real time feedback mechanisms that control the bioenergetic system of the brain. Further, the process by which this control system is dismantled in the aging female brain is uncharted territory of high significance for understanding bioenergetic aging in brain. Translationally, determining the mechanisms underlying the systematic dismantling of estrogenic integration of bioenergetic compartments in brain has the potential to detect therapeutic targets to sustain bioenergetic function in the aging female brain. Clinically, the aging transition of menopause, unique to the female, is a process that dismantles both reproductive ability and potentially bioenergetic capacity in brain. This is particularly relevant to age-related neurological conditions associated with deficits in glucose hypometabolism such as Alzheimer's, depression and multiple sclerosis which have greater prevalence in postmenopausal women. Research proposed herein aligns with NIA Strategic Research Goals A and C and the ?need to better distinguish patterns of brain aging? https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/living-long-well-21st- century-strategic-directions-research-aging and to objectives of Office of Research on Women's Health."
"9440573","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurately measuring personal exposure to air pollutants remains the greatest obstacle to determining their impact on human health. The need for more precise exposure assessment is particularly evident for children and adolescents whose exposure can vary widely based on their time-activity patterns including time spent outdoors, at home, school, and in vehicles. In order to meet the need of epidemiologists to characterize personal exposure, we have developed and validated in laboratory settings a novel personal sensor capable of measuring, with high spatiotemporal resolution, exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP). Results of an initial field test found the sensor to be mobile, rugged, and able t provide accurate spatiotemporal measurements of personal UFP exposure. Feedback from children participating in the initial field test indicated that barriers to its use included its voume, weight, and noise. Therefore, we now propose a two-phase project to: 1) evaluate the usability of the sensor after reducing its size, weight, and noise while maintaining its previous measurement capabilities (R21 Phase) and 2) deploy the modified sensor to characterize personal UFP exposure for adolescents enrolled in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS) and assess the impact of short-term and peak UFP exposure on respiratory health (R33 Phase). The proposed study represents a continued collaboration between tool-developers and environmental epidemiologists and will allow for the iterative refinement of a personal sensor for UFP exposure. In addition, the application of the sensor in a large-scale epidemiologic study during the R33 phase will address a significant research question regarding the association between short-term and peak UFP exposure and respiratory health. Successful completion of the proposed project will result in a new tool for measuring personal UFP exposure in real world settings and demonstrate the value of the sensor to address novel hypotheses through improved exposure assessment."
"9269257","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aim of this grant proposal is to support a set of core facilities that spreads understanding and use of new technologies to the wide range of neuroscientists in our community. The scientific cores are: (1) Light Microscopy, which enables neuroscientists to visualize neural circuit structure and function with great specificity and resolution using the newest super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, multiphoton, and confocal instruments; (2) Electron Microscopy, with TEM and a new high-throughput, serial scanning EM; and (3) Neuroengineering, which provides design and fabrication expertise to allow individual users to adapt the latest electronic, imaging, and computer technologies for their  experiments. Two additional facilities, devoted to Neuroimaging (including human brain and small animal scanners) and Genome Modification (providing transgenic and targeted mutant mice for structural or functional analysis), are supported from other sources, but will be integrated with the three Cores supported here, providing neuroscientists with access to the full range of imaging modalities currently driving the field forward. An Administrative Core tracks the usage and finances of the scientific cores, oversees coordination among all cores, and facilitates interactions between the core users and core technical staff. Individuals will find equipment and services in these Cores that are difficult or impossible to support in individual labs, which lack sufficient technical expertise, money, and space. The users, members of Harvard's Cambridge-based neuroscience community, will be drawn closer together, through shared space, equipment, and techniques. We also understand that many of these newer technologies are difficult to understand and implement, and so they are not utilized as broadly as might be wished. Thus we propose not only to establish these Cores but also to adopt multiple strategies aimed at reducing barriers to their widespread utilization. These include formal and informal education, making most core services available without user fees, and providing ample technical support. Our ambitious model has begun to shift the paradigm for neuroscience research from complete reliance on individual laboratory-centered facilities to the more cost-effective and productive use of extraordinary shared facilities."
"9287713","Project Summary/Abstract A poor understanding of the heterogeneity of many complex diseases prevents their accurate early diagnosis and targeted interventions focused on etiology. Of particular concern, many subtypes exist among persons in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, each subtype with distinct contributing causes and phenotypes. Accurately diagnosing and predicting rates of progression for these illnesses will be essential for any disease-modifying treatments. To overcome this barrier, we believe it is critically important to develop and apply an innovative method of latent class analysis -- incorporating both (1) the longitudinal trajectories of a high-dimensional collection of clinical and biomarker information, and (2) the times to specific outcomes when such data are available -- in order to arrive at subclassifications that are relevant to the underlying etiologies and the rate of disease progression. Unlike current methods of latent class analysis, our new method is scalable and requires minimal modeling assumptions. Over the short-term, we will target the heterogeneity of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the first clinically detectable manifestation of the intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia. We will integrate the information in two existing longitudinal data sets of persons with MCI: the National Alzheimer?s Coordinating Center?s Uniform Data Set (UDS), a unique resource with 29 participating NIH-funded Alzheimer?s Disease Centers contributing standardized clinical and neuropathological variables on over 6500 unique MCI individuals; and the Emory Neurology-Cognitive Data Set (NeuCog), which addition to comprehensive clinical information also contributes standardized biomarkers on 1015 unique MCI individuals with MRI scans and 529 with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) specimens. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Develop a scalable method of latent trajectory class analysis that allows the researcher to model only the means, variances, and temporal correlations of the longitudinal observations; (2) Extend the method developed in Aim 1 for researchers to incorporate the times to specific clinical or neuropathological outcomes, subject to complex survival features, into the latent class analysis; (3) Apply our new statistical methods under the guidance of expert clinical scientists, using the information available in the UDS and NeuCog data sets, to identify clinicopathologically relevant subtypes of MCI; and (4) Develop freely available software to analyze data using our new statistical methods."
"9419697","ABSTRACT Patients with advanced breast cancer have a high propensity to metastasize to the brain with human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her2 negative) subtypes showing the highest incidence of brain metastases. Most patients have multiple metastatic lesions at the time of diagnosis making surgery an inadequate therapeutic option on its own. Furthermore, impaired cognitive decline induced by whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and the tight blood brain barrier (BBB) preventing the brain permeability of systemic therapies in the brain pose challenges for the success of existing therapies and result in failure to improve overall patient survival. To effectively treat multiple highly aggressive breast metastatic foci in the brain, there is an urgent need to develop tumor specific multi-targeting agents that simultaneously target multiple aberrant signaling pathways in TNBC and utilize delivery vehicles which specifically seek metastatic foci in the brain. In our previously published and preliminary studies, we have 1) extensively demonstrated that engineered human and mouse neural stem cells (NSC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) home extensively to primary and metastatic tumors in the brain and provide on-site means to deliver novel tumor specific agents; and 2) engineered EGFR-specific nanobodies (ENb) and their pro-apoptotic variant, bi- functional ENb-TRAIL and shown its potential to target both cell proliferation and death pathways in a mechanism based manner in broad spectrum of tumor cells. The long term goal of this proposal is to test the mechanism based therapeutic efficacy of systemically delivered NSC-ENb-TRAIL in TNBC derived mouse models of breast to brain metastasis that mimic the clinical scenario of breast metastatic tumor growth and progression. We will initially screen established and patient derived TNBC lines for their response to EGFR and DR4/5 targeted therapies and assess their propensity to metastasize to brain. The mechanism based response of TNBC to NSC-ENb-TRAIL and the fate and therapeutic efficacy of NSC-ENb-TRAIL in brain metastasis mouse models generated from brain seeking patient derived TNBC lines will be assessed. We hypothesize that simultaneous targeting of EGFR and DR4/5 will significantly influence epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor growth and progression. Based on our exciting preliminary data on the combined use BBB permeable histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), CN147 and ENb-TRAIL and the previous findings that concomitant use of HDACi with DR4/5 agonists and EGFR inhibitors, the combined therapeutic efficacy of NSC-ENb-TRAIL and CN147 will be assessed. We hypothesize that ENb- TRAIL and HDACi will have therapeutic efficacy in metastatic TNBC with a broader range of genetic backgrounds and with varying sensitivity to ENb-TRAIL in vivo. The proposed studies in this application are likely to unravel the mechanism-based, targeted stem cell mediated therapies for metastatic breast tumors. We envision designing a strategy in which NSC-ENb-TRAIL will be injected intra-arterially to target the metastatic tumor deposits in the brain of metastatic breast cancer patients. This will have a major impact in saving the lives of many cancer patients."
"9327240","Abstract The development of new methods to treat cancer is greatly needed. In this application, we have identified a macrocyclic small molecule that exhibits high differential selectivity for cancer cells vs. normal cells and aim to develop more simplified analogs of this molecule in an effort to maximize efficiency as well as to decrease the overall number of steps, which will likely lead to clinically useful molecules for the treatment of cancer. In addition, we aim to interrogate the activity manifested by these compounds in both cellular and animal models of cancer, with the goal of providing preclinical data to support the use of such compounds for translational development."
"9317785","Abstract The enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)glycohydrolase (PARG) is critical for the response of cells to DNA damage, and genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that PARG inhibition is a tantalizing strategy for the treatment of cancer and possibly other disease. Unfortunately, no potent, selective, and cell permeable inhibitors of PARG exist, thus there are no suitable small molecule probes to study the cellular function of this enzyme and to examine its therapeutic potential. The lack of suitable PARG inhibitors is directly attributable to the lack of an assay that can be used to monitor PARG enzymatic activity in a high-throughput fashion; the standard PARG enzymatic assay uses radiolabeled poly(ADP-ribose) and thin-layer chromatography. We have recently developed a novel PARG substrate in which a chromophore is liberated by PARG-mediated cleavage. Using this substrate, we have now conducted pilot screens in 384-well plates using liquid handling robots and full-length human PARG, and these experiments show this assay to be robust and excellent for the identification of PARG inhibitors. We now propose (in Specific Aim 1) to use this novel assay to screen ~200,000 compounds at the University of Illinois High- Throughput Screening Facility (HTSF). As described in Specific Aim 2, we have developed a critical path for follow-up experiments based on a tiered series of increasingly stringent secondary assays, both in vitro and cell culture analyses. Our goal by the end of the two-year funding period is to have identified a potent, selective, and cell permeable PARG inhibitor that can be widely used by the community for the interrogation of PARG activity in cells and for probing the potential of PARG inhibition for the treatment of various disease."
"9221363","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When disruptive behavior problems manifest in very young children, the risk of later antisocial behaviors- including substance abuse, school failure, and criminality-escalates significantly. Evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) interventions have demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness in a range of settings in preventing the negative outcomes and costs associated with disruptive behavior problems. However, the public health impact of these interventions has yet to be realized, in part due to reliance on delivery by trained mental health professionals in clinic or community settings. Although implementation studies of BPT have been reported, these results lack generalizability because of their methodological idiosyncrasies in implementation. To maximize the public health benefits of BPT, systematic implementation studies are needed, particularly in underserved community settings. In Appalachia, a region recognized for its dramatic health disparities, at least one in five children exhibits sub-clinical to clinical levels of disruptive behavior problems. Risk factor for child disruptive behavior problems are pervasive; Appalachian residents suffer high poverty rates, low education levels, disproportionately high rates of substance abuse and mental health disorders, and persistent disparities in a wide range of health problems. A challenging combination of cultural barriers and poor access to mental health services hinders the usual delivery model for BPT in Appalachia (i.e., by trained mental health professionals). The vast majority of Appalachian counties are designated as mental health provider shortage areas, and cultural considerations (e.g., distrust of outsiders, the primacy of kinship networks, history of authoritarian parenting styles, strong self-reliance) may limit uptake of the few services available. The goal of this mixed-methods pilot study is to prepare for a future large-scale hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of an evidence-based BPT intervention across rural Appalachian communities. Our preliminary data revealed community preferences for brief BPT delivery by local community health workers. Thus, to increase the accessibility and acceptability of BPT in this region, we will use the ADAPT-ITT framework to systematically adapt the delivery model for the Family Check-Up, a brief BPT intervention previously shown to be effective in reducing behavior problems and preventing negative outcomes when delivered by trained mental health professionals in clinic and community settings. Following the systematic adaptation of the Family Check-Up delivery model, we will pilot-test its implementation by community health workers in four high-need, under- resourced Appalachian communities to assess feasibility, acceptability, and costs. Our primary questions are whether we can effectively train community health workers in these communities to deliver the Family Check- Up with fidelity; whether we can enroll parents/caregivers and children to initiate and complete the intervention; and whether the battery of assessments and measures planned for the subsequent R01 effectiveness- implementation trial are feasible and appropriate for these community settings."
"9243006","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Career Development (K01) Award is to provide funding for the principal investigator (PI), Dr. Manoj Thapa, developing into an independent biomedical research scientist in the field of liver disease and liver immunology. After joining the Dr. Arash Grakoui?s laboratory at Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University, the PI initiated a new project with the intention of identifying factors that lead to T and B cell differentiation during liver disease. In this K01 proposal, PI will build upon his previous expertise and study the dynamics of cellular immune responses focusing on the mechanisms of B cell dysregulations during chronic liver diseases associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, alcohol liver disease (ALD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). PI will be allocating 75% of his time for the research as proposed in this K01 application and 25% of the time to didactic trainings such as participation in seminars, lab meetings, manuscript preparation, grant writing, and national and international conferences. This project will focus on the contribution of MyD88-specific toll like receptor (TLR) activation and BAFF/BLyS signaling in the B cell-mediated pathogenesis of liver disease and autoimmune disorder. The incidence of end- stage liver disease (ESLD) is increasing in the United States and poses a serious economic and clinical burden as it is expected to afflict more than 300 million individuals worldwide. Chronic HCV infection, ALD, and NASH account for the majority of ESLD cases, with chronic HCV associated with the highest incidence of liver transplantation. The orthotopic liver transplantation is the optimal treatment for ESLD and carries a high cost while benefitting relatively few. Understanding the mechanisms of the cellular immune responses that contributes to fibrosis and the progression of ESLD is critical for effective therapeutic intervention. PI will approach these questions from two different directions. First, by using murine models of experimental liver fibrosis, PI will delineate the role of MyD88-specific TLR signaling and BAFF/BLyS signaling in B cell dysfunction, liver fibrosis and autoimmune disorder associated with liver disease. Then, he will build his career into human translational science to improve an understanding of cellular immune response in human chronic liver diseases including HCV, ALD and NASH patients. These diseases while different have common themes (i.e. fibrosis/cirrhosis) and therefore proposed in this study to compare and contrast the effect of a viral infection (HCV), an inflammation without infection (NASH) and the absence of virus and an on-going inflammatory insult at the time of transplant (ALD) (alcohol abstinence is required for a minimum of 6 months prior to transplant at Emory Transplant Center) on B cell activation and function. The application will provide an immunological basis for the study of targeting therapeutics to reverse the progression and clinical sequelae of liver fibrosis. During the K01 award, PI plans to further master skills and acquire proficiency in the area of human liver biology, chronic liver disease and liver immunology by participating in didactic courses offered by the Emory University and other recognized professional organizations, training in responsible conduct of research, enrolling in Certificate Program in Translational Research, Junior Faculty Development Course and Faculty Development Lecture Series. PI plans to acquire in-depth trainings in human specimens (liver explants and blood) processing and immunological analysis of human tissues in understanding of the complex interaction between the immune system and the liver in multifactorial disease including liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, ESLD, and autoimmune disorders. In addition, PI also plans to actively participate in weekly or monthly seminar series available at Emory University and attend annual national conferences on Fibrosis, Signaling pathways, Immunology, Liver Diseases, and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Furthermore, PI will take advantage of multiple grant-writing workshops available at Emory University and plan to apply for NIH grants via the R21 mechanism in the third year, and R01 in the fourth year submitting revisions as needed during the fourth and fifth years. PI will greatly benefit from a team of mentors including Dr. Arash Grakoui, an expert in HCV infection and liver immunology, Dr. Max Cooper, a foremost B cell immunologist, Dr. Frank Anania, an expert clinician in hepatology and gastroenterology, and Dr. Bali Pulendran, an established immunologist.

"9232001","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental step in understanding sensation is understanding how neural circuits in the brain transform patterns of sensory neuron activity into robust and efficient representations of the external world. Sensation is an active process in which the detection and initial encoding of sensory information is dynamically modulated by sampling behavior and behavioral state. Understanding how central circuits process sensory information in the context of active sampling is critical for understanding the neural basis of sensation in the behaving animal. The goals of this project are to understand how neural circuits in the mammalian olfactory bulb transform sensory inputs in vivo and in the context of active odor sampling. We will ask how certain bulb networks - in particular those mediating interactions between glomerular modules (interglomerular circuits) and those mediating inhibition within a glomerulus (intraglomerular circuits) shape the patterns of olfactory bulb output that are transmitted to cortex as a neural code for odor information. We will also ask how active 'sniffing' of odors at high frequency changes the operation of these circuits. We will use an innovative toolbox of genetic, optical and electrophysiological approaches that we have optimized for the in vivo dissection of circuit function, applied primarily in the awake, head-fixed mouse. There are two broad Aims designed to generate an understanding of the how the olfactory bulb network transforms sensory inputs acquired by the behaving animal. The first Aim focuses on interglomerular circuits and will map how these circuits influence mitral cell output from olfactor bulb glomeruli and how they are organized with respect to the glomerular odor map. We will use optogenetic activation of sensory input to genetically-tagged glomeruli expressing different odorant receptors, combined with selective imaging of excitation and inhibition from mitral cells innervating these glomeruli. The second Aim focuses on intraglomerular inhibition and will ask what role this inhibition plays in shaping the input-output functions of mitral cells during natura odor sampling. We will quantitatively compare responses of periglomerular versus mitral cells to optogenetically- and odorant-evoked inputs using imaging in the awake mouse, and perform whole-cell recordings from mitral cells during selective optogenetic suppression of intra- (but not inter-) glomerular inhibition. The overall impact of this project will be to advance a mechanistic understanding of how central circuits transform sensory inputs into the neural patterns of activity that underlie perception and an understanding of how these circuits function during behavior."
"9243192","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is compelling evidence that accumulation of A? aggregates plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD); thus, multiple strategies targeting A? are being developed as therapeutics. Numerous preclinical studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting A? by active or passive immunization paradigms. Although anti-A? immunotherapies remain mainstays of disease modifying therapies being tested in humans, it is our general premise that current agents represent first generation therapeutics with suboptimal properties and that the therapeutic potential of immunotherapy can be dramatically improved by both enhancing the understanding of how immunotherapies work and by developing alternative biological immunotherapies. Indeed, there remain a number of unanswered questions regarding both mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of A? immunotherapies that are critical to address in order to optimize the approach. Herein, we propose three distinct, but interrelated, aims that will further explore aspects of A? immunotherapy. The experiments in Aim 1 represent a shift from previous studies in the area of AD immunotherapy. As opposed to using antigen specific antibodies targeting A? we will harness soluble Toll Like Receptors (sTLRs) as decoy innate immune pattern recognition receptors to therapeutically target amyloid and amyloid-like aggregates. The studies in Aim 2 stem from data showing that pro-inflammatory stimuli attenuate and anti-inflammatory stimuli promote A? deposition. We, therefore, propose that preexisting alterations in the innate immune activation state that are present in the aged human brain, but not as much in APP mice, might dramatically alter the efficacy of anti- A? immunotherapy. We will evaluate this hypothesis by exploring how pro- or anti-inflammatory preconditioning of the brain alters efficacy of anti- A? immunotherapy. In Aim 3 we will determine the cycling time of anti- A? antibodies between the brain and periphery and identify parameters that regulate this process. Establishing the cycling time is critical to understand the pharmacokinetics that regulate antibody exposure in the brain and has major conceptual ramifications regarding development of immunotherapies for A? and other CNS targets."
"9389308","Project Summary - SRA lncRNA recognition by the SHARP epigenetic regulatory protein studied by NMR Thomas Leeper, Kent State University. The aim of the proposed research is to use NMR to determine the structures of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) derived from SHARP, an epigenetic regulatory protein, and the steroid receptor activator epigenetic regulator RNA (SRA1). This RNA is part of a co-activator network for androgen receptor (AR) that modulates chromatin and enhances AR mediated oncogenic expression. AR response stimulates prostate cancer cell hyper- proliferation. Thus understanding the structures and biochemical details of AR regulator factors is important to understand this type of cancer. The SRA1 RNA molecule is a member of the emerging class of long-non- coding RNAs (lncRNA) that is a well established component of chromatin remodeling complexes. SHARP is also associated with the cancer related Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. These structures will give us some of the first glimpses of lncRNA ribonucleoprotein particle structures and suggest regions where structure-based drug discovery efforts should focus their attention if therapies are to be developed targeting lncRNAs. This project spans several disciplines but is most appropriately described as structural biology with the explicit goal of providing structures from this RNP scaffolding complex. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Determine the NMR structures of the RRM domains of human SHARP.  a. Express, purify, and NMR screen RRM domains derived from a fragment of SHARP.  b. Determine the NMR structures of the well-folded SHARP RRMs. Aim 2: Delineation of the human SRA lncRNA/SHARP interaction.  a. Assay RNP formation by immobilized protein RNA pull-down assays to find RNA-domain boundaries.  b. Chemical probe experiments to determine if RNA truncations have fold-parity with the full RNA.  c. Footprinting studies monitored by SHAPE and nuclease/DMS protection. Aim 3: Determine the structure of human SRA1 RNP complexes.  a. NMR monitored binding experiments to assess viability for structure determination.  b. RNP complex NMR structures of portions of SRA1 RNA (i.e. STR7) bound to SHARP RRM domains."
"9274548","In 2004 the National Institutes of Health awarded Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) an NCRR shared instrumentation grant to purchase a X-ray diffraction equipment. The instrument is housed at the Institute for Structural Biology, Drug Discovery and Development (ISBDDD) and is currently used by 24 investigators from the ISBDDD, the departments of Medicinal Chemistry, Chemistry, Internal Medicine, Biochemistry, Pediatrics, Microbiology, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Physiology and Biophysics, and the nearby University of Richmond. The investigators come from diverse research programs: cancer, infectious diseases, thrombosis/hemostasis, gene regulation, drug abuse and addiction, hemoglobinopathies, cardiovascular disease, systems biology, protein function and regulation, etc. Structure-based drug discovery is a major focus and has resulted in several preclinical and clinical drugs over the years. For example, Aes103 is being studied in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of sickle cell disease. Another compound, RSR-13 was investigated for several hypoxic-related diseases and emerged as a candidate for clinical applications, particularly as a radiation enhancer in the radiotherapy of hypoxic tumors. The current Rigaku X-ray diffraction instrument has not been manufactured since 2004, and is becoming very expensive to maintain. Moreover, service and replacement parts for the components are discontinued, and Rigaku has declined to offer any service contract. The age of the instrument has led to significant increase in down time, impacting the drug discovery program, which requires sustained access to in-house data collection integrated with rapid screening protocols of compounds as they become available. There is a need for reliable and enhanced in-house data collection capabilities for uninterrupted support of the investigators and their research programs. VCU is requesting funds from the NIH Shared Instrumentation Grant Program (S10) for the purchase of an X-ray diffraction system that includes the MicroMax-007HF generator, VariMax-HF optics, Pilatus 200K detector, AFC11 goniometer and Oxford cryostream 800. This diffraction system will significantly increase our ability to rapidly and routinely screen and/or collect full datasets to analyze for compound binding sites as well as aid in the optimization and prioritization of research samples to be forwarded for synchrotron data collection. The upgrade will improve the efficiency with which our many structure-related projects are prosecuted and allow us to undertake wide-ranging compound screening in parallel with concurrent major investments in compound libraries and screening infrastructure. It will have direct and indirect effects on the research of a large number of investigators and their collaborators and on the overall research mission of our institution. The proposed instrumentation will significantly advance current NIH-funded research projects and expand the community of users."
"9329950","Project Summary/Abstract  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a significant cause of morbidity and loss of developmental potential in children. An increasing number of genetic and environmental factors are being identified that contribute to ASD. Two major cellular pathways that have been implicated in both genetic and environmental causes of ASD involve mTOR signaling and GABAergic neurotransmission. In this project, we propose to investigate a mechanistic link between these pathways that may explain both the age dependence and male sex predominance of core ASD symptoms and comorbidities.  In this project, we propose to test the hypothesis that autism-associated mTOR pathway activation causes differential dysregulation of GABAergic neurotransmission in the immature versus the mature brain. Further, we hypothesize that this dysregulation will be more pronounced in males than in females. We will examine our hypotheses through pursuit of the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that mTOR pathway activation accelerates the development of hyperpolarizing GABAA receptor function in the immature brain. Cultured cortical neurons and transgenic mice with mTOR pathway activation, either via heterozygous loss of the Pten or Tsc2 genes or via expression of a constitutively active form of mTOR, will be used. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that mTOR pathway activation interferes with maintenance of hyperpolarizing GABAA receptor function in the mature brain. In Specific Aim 2, the studies of Aim 1 will be repeated in mature neuronal cultures and in adult mice. Specific Aim 3: To define the role of the transcriptional repressor REST (RE1-Silencing Transcription factor) in the age-dependent dysregulation of GABAergic neurotransmission by mTOR pathway activation. We will utilize cortical neuronal cultures and lentivirus-mediated manipulation of REST function in vivo to investigate the involvement of REST in the bidirectional regulation of KCC2 expression by mTOR pathway activation.  As a result of these studies, we will be able to identify the differential effects of mTOR pathway activation on inhibitory neurotransmission in immature versus mature and in male versus female brain, thereby suggesting pathways for development of novel, targeted interventions for ASD and its comorbidities."
"9209354","SUMMARY Atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of myocardial infarction and stroke, is a lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disease characterized by lipoprotein and leukocyte accumulation in the vessel wall. Among leukocytes, monocyte-derived intimal macrophages are arguably the most decisive contributors to the development, progression, exacerbation, and regression of atherosclerosis. As key effectors of inflammation, proteolysis, oxidative stress, lipid clearance, and efferocytosis, macrophages have long been therapeutic targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis. However, macrophage content in the vessel wall is highly dynamic, relying on multiple systemic and local processes that are governed by distinct biological pathways. Recently, we showed that psychosocial stress, which potentiates cardiovascular disease (CVD), aggravates atherosclerosis by disturbing the macrophage supply chain; animals subjected to intermittent psychosocial stress developed inflamed lesions containing more numerous macrophages than controls. In this project, we will ask how stress affects mechanisms related to influx of monocytes (medullary myelopoiesis, mobilization of monocytes and stem cells, extramedullary myelopoiesis, and monocyte influx to lesions), macrophage accrual in lesions (macrophage differentiation and local proliferation), and macrophage efflux (macrophage death through apoptosis, necrosis, or secondary necrosis, and macrophage emigration). Collectively, we refer to these as macrophage dynamics. We will investigate the impact of stress on macrophage dynamics in the progression and regression of atherosclerosis, with specific focus on the sympathetic nervous system and neuronal guidance cues. We will identify the decision nodes that control processes related to macrophage dynamics with the ultimate aim of targeting them therapeutically."
"9444562","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid tumors require new blood vessels to grow beyond a few cubic millimeters. Tumor blood vessels are complex and dysfunctional and multiple cell types may coalesce to form the tumor vasculature. In a striking example, some tumor cells may directly integrate within vascular structures or form tumor cell-lined conduits that carry blood and fluid (termed vascular mimicry, VM). We have recently isolated and characterized a novel subpopulation of vascular-like tumor cells identified by expression of the vascular cell adhesion molecule, CD31. These CD31+ tumor cells do not express VEGF receptors, they down-regulate the neural crest transcription factor/CD31 repressor AP-2alpha, and they form tumor blood vessels when engrafted in mice. Furthermore, CD31+ tumor cells do not respond to VEGF inhibition and are enriched in tumors challenged with VEGF neutralizing antibodies. In aim 1 we will use clonal populations of CD31- and CD31+ tumor cells we have derived from human and mouse cell lines and a spontaneous mouse melanoma model to determine the functional role of CD31 in forming perfused vascular structures in tumors. Aim 2 is to use cell ablation strategies and cutting-edge tumor perfusion studies to determine how CD31+ tumor cells mediate escape from anti-angiogenic therapy. In aim 3 we will define how loss of the neural crest specifer AP-2alpha controls CD31 expression and generates VM-competent tumor cells. For this aim, we will use genetic deletion and over- expression studies and intravital microscopy to visualize VM-competent tumor cells implanted in the mouse ear. Upon completion of our study aims, we will clarify how CD31+ tumor cells form functional connections with the host vasculature, the molecular mechanisms that generate and maintain this unique subpopulation, and how these vascular like tumor cells mediate escape from anti-angiogenic therapy."
"9273165","Project Summary/Abstract The Imaging Core of the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute (LRI) and a group of ten NIH-funded investigators request funds to purchase a small animal ultrasound imaging system ? specifically the VisualSonics Vevo 2100. The Imaging Core was established nineteen years ago to provide leading-edge imaging equipment and expertise for the Cleveland Clinic research community. Three years ago, the Core adopted a 9-year-old Vevo 770 from an investigator who left the LRI. Since it became available to a larger number of LRI investigators it has been used by members in the department of Molecular Cardiology and Cellular and Molecular medicine. This instrument has served our researchers well, but it is technologically inadequate for current research needs. As investigators translate their molecular discoveries into in vivo mouse models, we have come to realize the incapability of the current ultrasound imaging system to link phenotypic characterization to mechanistic alterations of pathways. The requested imaging system will allow us to interrogate cardiac function, tumor growth and aortic aneurysms. Acquisition of a Vevo 2100 will allow for significant insights into cardiac function including assessment of abnormalities of wall motion and the use of color Doppler to measure blood volume, flow and velocity. Its ability to measure capillary density following myocardial infarction will enable our investigators to discern mechanistic links in novel genetically altered mice. Furthermore, the capability to calculate the cardiac stress-strain relationship and its effect on cardiac output in mouse models of heart failure will provide important information regarding molecular signaling mechanisms that could potentially affect the structural component of the contractility system. Finally, unique contrast imaging capabilities will be utilized by investigators to assess tumor growth and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Therefore, the Vevo 2100 with its high resolution ultrasound imaging will allow investigators from diverse areas of research to capitalize on its capabilities to accelerate their basic discoveries into novel therapeutic targets or agents. Placing the system in the Imaging Core will not only maximize its benefits for a variety of health-related investigations, but will assure its management by a skilled staff. Dr. Judith Drazba, LRI Imaging Core Director and Co-PI has over thirty years of experience in biomedical imaging, nineteen of them running this facility. Dr. Sathyamangla Prasad, PI on this grant, has more than seventeen years of intensive experience in small animal surgery and imaging. He has significant technical and scientific experience using the Vevo 770. Other members of the Imaging Core staff will also assist with user services, training, and equipment troubleshooting and maintenance. Finally, the Lerner Research Institute which has a long history of strong support for centralized facilities continues its commitment to the Imaging Core by providing funds for salary support, service contracts, and infrastructure."
"9236506","Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most lethal and aggressive form of breast cancer, and metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with IBC. To date, there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies that are specific for patients with IBC, and the molecular mechanism underlying IBC?s aggressiveness is not well understood. The long-term goal of the applicant?s group is to decrease the mortality associated with IBC by developing a novel therapy. The overall objectives of this application are to determine how the EGFR pathway promotes the progression of IBC and, through understanding the pathway, to identify novel therapeutic targets that could enhance the efficacy of EGFR targeted therapy. The central hypothesis is that the EGFR pathway is highly exploitable as a therapeutic target in IBC because this pathway promotes inflammation and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) self-renewal. The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying and validating novel targets will lead to the development of an efficacious combination-therapy approach to prolonging the survival of patients with IBC. On the basis of strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine how the EGFR/COX-2 signaling axis regulates the CSC population in IBC cells; and 2) Determine predictive biomarkers of response to EGFR targeted therapy in patients with IBC. In the first aim, the effect of EGFR/COX-2 activation or inhibition on the IBC CSC population through the mediation of Nodal/TGF? signaling and the involved mechanism will be investigated. Further, potential combination approaches that could enhance the efficacy of EGFR targeted therapy will be identified. In the second aim, the role of EGFR/COX-2/TGF? axis molecules in predicting the response to PmAb will be determined, and the impact of PmAb on regulating the cross-talk between tumor cells and the adjacent microenvironment will be investigated. In addition, for patients receiving EGFR targeted therapy, RNA sequencing of before- and after-treatment samples will be performed to compare the differential gene expression profiles between patients who achieve pathological complete response and those who do not. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on the unique molecular features of IBC and uses a novel approach of targeting CSC in IBC through EGFR and/or inflammatory-related pathways; also, it utilizes a novel multiplexed immunostaining imaging technology that allows multiple sets of markers to be visualized within the same cells or tissue section. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to fundamentally advance the understanding of IBC and facilitate the development of a novel personalized therapy, leading to much more effective clinical trials for IBC and ultimately, reduced mortality from IBC. The regimen established from this work will also be adopted in a clinical trial for chemoresistant primary non-inflammatory breast cancers with triple-negative receptors, thus extending the clinical impact of this work for breast cancer patients."
"9245502","Background: Drug overdose is the leading cause of death among formerly incarcerated adults. Opioid use disorder (OUD) pharmacotherapy (i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) is the most effective treatment, but justice-involved Veterans may have lower access to these medications than other Veterans. Across Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities nationally, in FY2015, 69% of justice-involved Veterans did not receive pharmacotherapy for their OUD. Across facilities, there was variation in the gap between justice- involved and non-justice-involved veterans? receipt of pharmacotherapy; gaps ranged from 15% lower to 42% higher for justice-involved Veterans. The VA is the ideal health care system to address the addiction treatment needs of justice-involved Veterans because of the special services and dedicated funding for these Veterans; however, many Veterans still struggle in the transition from the justice system to health care. Leveraging VA resources, the proposed project will identify unique barriers and facilitators experienced by justice-involved Veterans and evaluate promising implementation strategies to improve access to OUD pharmacotherapy. Given the high risk for overdose and the effectiveness of these medications, it is imperative that we strengthen the transition from the justice system to VA and community health care systems to improve drug addiction treatment and outcomes for justice-involved Veterans. Objectives: Specific aims are to: (1) Quantitatively evaluate patient and facility characteristics associated with differences in receipt of OUD pharmacotherapy among justice-involved Veterans compared to non-justice involved veterans and within-facility changes over time; (2) Qualitatively identify drivers of higher or lower access to OUD pharmacotherapy among justice-involved Veterans compared to other Veterans with OUD at the same facility; (3) Evaluate stakeholders? perceptions of factors that explain within-facility changes in access to OUD pharmacotherapy over time; and (4) Develop and conduct a formative evaluation of implementation strategies to improve access to OUD pharmacotherapy. Methods: Aim 1 will use VA clinical data and mixed effects regression and propensity score methods. In Aims 2-4, 60 qualitative interviews total will be conducted with justice-involved Veterans with OUD and key stakeholders in the criminal justice system, VA and community treatment settings, and VA Justice Programs. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Stetler et al.?s (2006) formative evaluation strategy will guide qualitative data collection, coding and analysis. Summary: Results will be used to design and select implementation strategies that address identified barriers to test in a future grant, to improve access to OUD pharmacotherapy for justice-involved Veterans. Improving access to drug addiction treatments will help Veterans with OUD achieve recovery and reduce their risk for mortality, recidivism, and other negative health outcomes."
"9212148","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain organizes information about the sensory world into maps. Prominent examples are the maps of eye-preference and retinotopy in the lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus  and visual cortex. Experiments in this proposal will advance our understanding of mechanisms responsible for the development of precise neural circuitry in the mammalian brain. We will employ a broad range of techniques, including molecular biological, cell biological, neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and advanced optical imaging techniques in vitro and in vivo. We focus our experiments on maps of eye preference and retinotopy in the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus of the mouse. These structures are the dominant target of retinal projections to the brain. The lateral geniculate nucleus is the primary relay of visual information to the visual cortex, and the superior colliculu is a sensory motor structure that has emerged as an ideal model system for the examination of neural circuit development and function. It is widely hypothesized that molecular cues are responsible for the establishment of coarse map structure in the lateral geniculate and superior colliculus, and activity dependent processes subsequently refine these sensory motor circuits to functional precision. We first propose to definitively establish whether patterned spontaneous activity is necessary for the development of visual maps. We next propose to manipulate the temporal pattern of activity in the developing retina to examine the dependence of retinocollicular development of retinal ganglion cell activity. We finally propose to manipulate th spatial pattern of activity in the developing retina to examine the dependence of visual map development on the spatial character of spontaneous retinal activity. In all, the experiments in this proposal are designed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the development of precise neural circuits in the mammalian brain, with a specific emphasis on the emergence of visual maps in the mouse superior colliculus."

"9317962","Objectives: K-Ras is a normal cellular protein. Oncogenic K-Ras mutation, leading to the exacerbated activation of K-Ras protein, causes tumor initiation and progression. K-Ras mutation is found in more than 25% of human non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). However, lung cancers caused by K-Ras mutation are generally refractory to chemotherapy as well as targeted agents. Moreover, the identification of drugs to therapeutically inhibit K-Ras has been unsuccessful, suggesting that other approaches are required. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an important lipid mediator present in our body. Levels of S1P receptor subtype 3 (S1PR3, a receptor which binds S1P and mediates S1P functions) are increased in lung carcinomas. S1PR3 regulates various tumorigenic functions which are critical for the progression of human lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). Inhibition of S1PR3 profoundly diminishes lung carcinoma growth in animals. Furthermore, oncogenic K-Ras mutant stimulates S1PR3 expression in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, the objectives of this application is to characterize the critical role of S1PR3 in K-Ras mutant-driven LADC, and to investigate whether S1PR3 inhibition provides an effective therapy for K-Ras mutant-driven human LADC. Hypothesis, Specific aims, and Study designs: The hypothesis of this proposal is ?Exacerbated S1PR3 activity contributes to oncogenic K-Ras mutant-driven LADC progression, at least in part, by promoting macrophage infiltration to LADC. S1PR3 represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of K-Ras mutant-driven LADC.? Two aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1. A genetically engineered mouse strain, mice expressing mutated K-Ras protein and lacking S1PR3, will be utilized to determine the critical role of S1PR3 in K-Ras mutant-driven LADC. In addition, the role of S1PR3 in recruiting inflammatory macrophages to LADC will be investigated. Aim 2. TY-52156, a highly selective S1PR3 antagonist, will be used to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that S1PR3 inhibition is an effective intervention for oncogenic K-Ras mutant-driven LADC. Health relatedness of the project: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The main goal of this application is to characterize the critical role of S1PR3 in K-Ras mutant-driven LADC progression. The successful completion of this application is expected to provide multiple intervention points for the fight against oncogenic K-Ras mutant-driven LADC in the future."
"9263944","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is generally asymptomatic at early stages of the disease. Current state of the art screening tools such as mammography and breast examination miss early breast cancers due to the absence of mass lesions, are ineffective in detecting cancer in young women, and require invasive biopsy. New methods are needed to complement current methods for the detection and prognosis of precancerous and cancerous breast lesions while they are small and more easily treated. The analysis of the secreted glycoantigens, protein antigens and non-coding microRNAs (miRNA) in nipple aspirate fluid represents a very promising approach able to detect cancer-related biomarkers directly in body fluids mirroring the breast tissue-specific tumor microenvironment. Our long term goal is to develop a simple, sensitive and robust detection platform for diagnosing diseases at an asymptomatic early stage. Our diagnostic platform is based on the elegant and elaborate protein channel of a biological motor. We have inserted the motor channel into a lipid bilayer and the resulting system exhibits robust properties and generates extremely sensitive, stable and reproducible conductance signatures when analytes interact with the channel. We further demonstrated its utility as a highly sensitive device for detection of cancer-associated proteins i presence of many contaminants at single molecule level. The short-term goal of this proposal is to develop this motor channel as a nanopore for high-throughput single molecule detection of glyco-antigen, protein antigen and miRNA biomarkers extracted from breast cancer patient nipple aspirate fluid. The platform consists of: a membrane-embedded motor channel serving as a highly sensitive nanopore; programmable probes for capturing breast cancer associated antigens; and ultra-sensitive electrophysiological setup for multiplexed high-throughput single molecule detection. Incorporating our device into routine practice will enable physicians to monitor cellular changes within breast ducts earlier, before they develop into larger, potentially cancerous lesions."
"9253759","Project Summary  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting roughly 5.5 million Americans, and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Quantification of amyloid (A?) plaque burden with 18F and 11C- based Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agents, based on high affinity A? aggregate-binding radionuclides shows promise for identifying individuals with increased risk of progressing to AD. However, PET imaging has several drawbacks including high cost, limited access, and poor spatial resolution. Furthermore, PET involves radiochemistry, which is both expensive and complex, thereby limiting distribution potential to specialized medical centers with radiochemistry capabilities.  This Phase II project will seek to further develop ?ADx-Magnetic Resonance(MR)?, a targeted liposomal contrast agent that will be used in conjunction with 1.5T MR imaging systems, which are far more readily available than PET imaging systems, and much less expensive to use. The primary objectives of this Phase II grant is to gather safety/pharmacokinetic data in both small and large animals, and to transfer the synthesis process to a contract manufacturer in preparation for future GLP studies.  ADx-MR has the potential to provide imaging of AD pathology at high resolution, and a significantly lower cost, with 5-10x more patient access points, than PET amyloid imaging. Coupled with the exceptional spatial resolution of MR Imaging, this agent enables the visualization of features at a voxel size of 100 m, a significant improvement over PET approaches with centimeter size voxels.  To date, this novel, intravenously delivered A?-targeted liposome, ADx, has proven successful in in-vivo studies in three Alzheimer's mouse models. Alzeca has also performed dose ranging studies in mice and pilot PK studies in non-human primates. The goal of this project is therefore to advance ADx-MR, a liposomal T1-MR agent to qualify for a pre-IND meeting by establishing additional efficacy, safety, and scalability data."
"9217586","The overall goal of this proposal is to test whether targeting individual cell cycle proteins represents a highly selective therapeutic strategy in different types of human breast cancer. The proliferation of mammalian cells is driven by the core cell cycle machinery operating in cell nucleus. The key components of this machinery are proteins called cyclins, which bind, activate and provide substrate specificity to their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate cellular proteins, thereby driving cell proliferation.    Mouse gene knockout experiments demonstrated that individual cyclins and CDKs are dispensable for development and for normal proliferation of the majority of cell types. In contrast, these proteins are essential for the initiation and for maintenance of specific cancer types, depending on the genetic lesion they carry. Relevant for this application, our laboratory recently demonstrated that an ubiquitous, global shutdown of cyclin 01 in mice bearing MMTV-Erb82 (HER2) driven breast cancers blocked tumor cell proliferation and triggered tumor cell senescence, without having any obvious impact on animals' physiology. Importantly, administration of an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 (PD 0332991) to tumor bearing animals had the same effect, namely it caused senescence of Erb82-driven breast cancer cells. These observations suggest that inhibition of CDK4/6 kinase activity may represent a very effective therapeutic strategy in women with HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancers.  In the work proposed in Aim 1, we will extend our analyses to human HER2+ breast cancers. We will take advantage of a very large collection of human breast cancer cell lines (including several HER2+) assembled by Dr. Polyak. We will also use xenografts of primary HER2+ breast cancers, to test the effect of CDK4/6 inhibition on human mammary carcinomas. Lastly, we will elucidate how human HER2+ breast cancer cells develop resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. In Aim 2, we will extend our approach to triple-negative breast cancers, where very few therapeutic options are available. We will test our hypothesis that this specific cancer type depends of cyclin E-CDK1 and/or A-CDK1 kinase. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To determine the response of human Erb82-positive (HER2+) breast cancers to cyclin D-CDK4/6 inhibition; Aim 2. To study the requirement for CDK1 function in triple-negative breast cancers"
"9217582","A detailed understanding of interplay between genetics and epigenetics in the progression and hormone dependence of distinct breast cancer subtypes is critical to the development of new approaches to prevention and therapy. To address this problem we have begun to explore the epigenetic state of the normal mammary epithelial cells and of tumor cells. We have used cell surface markers and fluorescence? activated cell sorting of normal mammary cells from ostensibly normal women undergoing reduction mammoplasty to operationally define mature luminal, luminal progenitor and basal/mammary stem cell? enriched populations. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that estrogen receptor (ER) signaling in breast cancer recapitulates ER signaling found in luminal progenitors. An understanding of the ER-regulated program in normal luminal progenitors has important implications for both hormonal chemoprevention and for endocrine therapy.  We have also begun to investigate the potential impact of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotype on ER signaling and the epigenetic state of the normal mammary gland. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that BRCA1 and BRCA2 in addition to their well-documented roles in maintaining genomic integrity play important roles in determining mammary cell fate and that ER signaling influences these effects.  In preliminary studies we have found that the genes aberrantly expressed by luminal progenitor cells derived from BRCA2 carriers shows a striking overlap with the gene expression program that we recently defined as playing an important role in the oncogenic function of the epigenetic regulator EZH2 in castration-resistant  prostate cancer. Aim 3 will address the hypothesis that EZH2 plays a necessary role' in normal mammary development and an oncogenic role in breast cancer.  These three specific aims depend critically on the Pathology Core and the strength of the collaborations supported by this Program Project."
"9384142","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Studies in poxvirus host range genes and tropism Project Summary In this proposal we will uncover the fundamental mechanisms by which Myxoma virus (MYXV) host interactive proteins modulate cellular and tissue functions that mediate host range and cell tropism. MYXV is a rabbit specific poxvirus that also exhibits the capacity to infect a wide spectrum of human cancer and transformed cells. MYXV is currently being developed as an oncolytic virotherapeutic to treat various classes of cancer. We will examine the molecular mechanisms used by MYXV host range protein, M029, which interacts with multiple host proteins and signaling pathways that mediate host anti-viral responses. M029 is a member of the poxvirus E3 family of dsRNA Binding Domain (dsRBD) containing proteins, but unlike the vaccinia virus (VACV) E3 version, M029 lacks the entire N terminal Z-DNA binding domain. We have reported that M029 is essential for both in vitro and in vivo host and cellular tropism of MYXV, particularly in human cells. Indeed, the M029- knockout MYXV has the most pronounced host range defect we have ever observed, and this virus cannot replicate in any human cell tested to date, indicating that the M029 protein is a potent modulator of cellular factors and pathways designed to protect human cells from virus infections. Thus, deconstructing M029 targets in human cells is important not only for the development of MYXV as a therapeutic oncolytic virus, but also as a tool to investigate innate and intrinsic cellular restriction factors that have evolved to protect human cells from viral pathogens. We have recently reported that the M029 protein binds and unexpectedly activates a key cellular RNA helicase, RHA/DHX9, to mediate expanded cellular tropism, particularly in human cells. We have also identified several additional human DDX/DHX RNA helicases as protein-interacting partners of M029, suggesting that RNA helicases may have a much broader role in governing viral host and cellular tropism. In addition to RNA helicases, M029 also binds and inhibits protein kinase R (PKR) activation during MYXV infection. MYXV thus regulates both PKR and multiple cellular RNA helicases via a single immunomodulatory protein, and we propose to uncover novel molecular mechanisms that are crucial for successful MYXV replication in diverse cell types, particularly human cancer cells, and also how this modulator mediates pathogenesis in its permissive rabbit host. Based on our observations we propose to investigate the followings: Aim 1. Investigate the role of RHA/DHX9 and PKR in MYXV replication, pathogenesis and cellular tropism: We will examine the molecular mechanisms by which M029 modulates DHX9 and PKR functions. In addition, we will investigate how the co-regulation of PKR and DHX9 by M029 also affects DHX9-mediated tropism of MYXV. We will construct mutants of M029 within recombinant MYXV that alter these interactions and/or localization of M029, and examine the consequences of these specific M029-interactive alterations in both cultured cells and in virus-infected rabbits. We will also specifically dissect the mechanisms by which DHX9 and PKR regulate MYXV tropism and oncolysis of human cancer cells. Aim 2. Elucidate the role of other RNA helicases in MYXV replication and expanding cellular tropism: Using an siRNA library for all the human DDX/DHX RNA helicases, and specific M029 mutants, we identified several other RNA helicases that are required for optimum viral gene expression and replication in diverse cell types. Additionally, we have identified new RNA helicases that, in contrast, inhibit MYXV replication in human cells. We will study how these cellular helicases mediate the expanded host tropism of MYXV, particularly in human cancer cells. Some of these RNA helicases interact directly with M029, either in a dsRNA dependent or independent manner. We will use M029 mutants to investigate the significance of these interactions in MYXV tropism. We will specifically test the hypothesis that some of the helicases play role in titrating dsRNA levels and determine whether specific helicase members function as poxvirus sensors in a cell type specific manner."

"9274645","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to acquire a Bruker Opterra II swept-field confocal microscope with photoactivation module for live cell imaging for the Center for Cell and Molecular Imaging (CCMI) at Yale University School of Medicine. The ability to dynamically monitor cells in tissues, and organelles and proteins within cells has transformed our understanding of cell and developmental biology. Also, new fluorescent sensors enable the measurement of multiple physiological parameters including calcium levels and pH (as examples). Importantly, to fully take advantage of live cell imaging in order to probe cellular behaviors, we need microscopy that is highly sensitive to low light emissions from fluorophores, can acquire images quickly to capture rapid and dynamic behaviors, and has sufficient spatial resolution to detect cellular components. The combination of these three criteria poses a significant challenge for live cell imaging. Our preliminary results suggest that the unique imaging architecture of the Bruker Opterra II with its one dimensional array of pinholes/slits that creates a ?swept field confocal? performs optimally for our needs compared to other confocal technologies. Specific projects that would immediately take advantage of this proposal are diverse and numerous: 1) analysis of beating cilia during ciliogenesis and cilia regeneration in various organs and tissues 2) calcium fluxes in cardiac cilia 3) monitoring cytokinesis and proteins essential for the process 3) protein tracking in cells 4) axon regeneration 4) synaptic signaling and development in neurons 5) visualizing gene networks during the maternal to zygotic transition. By providing access to a live cell imaging microscope that optimally balances speed, sensitivity and resolution, the requested instrument will dramatic enhance the productivity and discovery in these NIH sponsored projects."
"9274882","PROJECT SUMMARY Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was first introduced to Arizona State University in 1997 through the formation of the WM Keck Bioimaging Laboratory. Since that time this facility has provided services to over 150 research labs both at ASU as well as with collaborators throughout Arizona. Although the primary users of the lab primarily fall into molecular, cellular, developmental, and neuroscience programs, there has been almost a twenty percent increase in researchers from the biomedical, engineering and the physical sciences who have become routine users of the confocal microscopes within the last five years. This facility has served as the only shared core laboratory since 2014 that provides confocal microscopy to researchers on the Tempe campus. The Keck lab strives to not only provide the most current instrumentation to its users so they are able to achieve their research objectives, but it continues to develop and enhance the equipment it provides to researchers so they have the opportunity to incorporate new and developing microscopy techniques as well as acquire equipment that can be readily upgraded to accommodate the potential needs required by new faculty or current researchers who have enhanced needs. This proposal is requesting funds to acquire a Leica SP8 inverted LSCM with a stage top incubation chamber, tandem scanner and sensitive GaAsP detectors enabling our primary NIH funded researchers to not only obtain their fixed cell images but to more easily incorporate live cell imaging of their samples as described in their research summaries. This capability has been very limited to researchers at the Tempe campus but acquisition of this system by our core laboratory will provide a resource not previously available and will pave the way for the next generation of NIH funded researchers."
"9253043","Project Summary First episode psychosis is a serious mental health condition that affects youth and young adults, often between the ages of 15 and 30. The illness is marked by hallucinations, delusions, withdrawal, poor organization skills, and diminished cognitive and social functioning. Recent research has demonstrated that programs designed to treat people experiencing early psychosis can reduce hospitalization, decrease psychiatric symptoms, improve quality of life, and result in better social and occupational functioning. Despite this promising picture, few tools have been developed to support optimal engagement and participation in care. In response to this need, the Center for Social Innovation (C4) has partnered with researchers at the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc. (RFMH); Columbia University; and the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) to develop and test OnTrack>An Online Role-Playing Game (OnTrack>The Game, or OTG). Based on cutting- edge practices in serious gaming, OnTrack>The Game offers players the opportunity to experience a community that includes the player's apartment, treatment provider's office, school, work, gym, parks, and a movie theater that shows videos of hope and recovery from real people who have experienced first episode psychosis. Interactions with family, friends, co-workers, and treatment providers allow players to simulate and rehearse real-life situations in a safe, non-threatening environment. To evaluate the impact of the game, this Phase II study involves a mixed-methods randomized controlled trial in which we will recruit 200 young people from first-episode programs in New York State. Participants will be randomized into 1 of 2 conditions: (1) OnTrack>The Game or (2) Recovery Videos (RV), a website that includes information and videos about first episode psychosis (FEP). We will use standardized measures and semi-structured qualitative interviews to achieve the following aims:  1. Refine, expand, and finalize OnTrack>The Game. Building on the Phase I prototype, we will improve  functionality, expand the play spaces and levels, add interaction with non-player characters, include  more resources on FEP, and expand the library of videos on hope and recovery.  2. Evaluate the effectiveness of a role-playing game (OnTrack>The Game or OTG) in increasing  empowerment, decreasing stigma concerns, and improving treatment engagement.  3. Determine if changes in empowerment and stigma concerns mediate the effect of OnTrack>The Game  on treatment engagement. Early intervention for psychosis has emerged as an effective way to improve outcomes for young people, yet few tools exist to connect them with supporting treatment providers and to build confidence in their recovery. OnTrack>The Game has the potential to fill this void and to help improve outcomes for young people with psychosis as they strive to build meaningful lives in community."
"9242515","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes that impairs quality of life for up to 75% of men with diabetes. ED strongly correlates with insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the poorly understood pathogenesis of ED in diabetic and pre- diabetic states. The brain serves a key role in healthy erectile function by initiating sexual desie and by controlling autonomic erectile responses. Melanocortin pathways, consisting of POMC neurons that produce a- MSH and downstream MC3 and 4 receptor (MC4R)-containing neurons, are critical for these processes. However, therapeutics targeting MC receptors have the disadvantage of altering blood pressure and heart rate. The objective of this proposal is to determine if reduced endogenous a-MSH production can lead to ED and to identify the neuronal circuitry to which POMC neurons project to uniquely control erectile function. MC4Rs are found on oxytocin neurons to which POMC neurons project, and administration of a-MSH, MC4R agonists, or oxytocin increases sexual motivation, elicits sexual behaviors, and causes penile erection in mice and humans. The central hypothesis is that insulin and leptin resistance in POMC neurons promotes ED by reducing aMSH production and oxytocin signaling. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories and will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Determine whether impaired insulin and leptin signaling in POMC neurons alters erectile function, 2) Determine whether restoring neuronal insulin and leptin sensitivity and a-MSH production improves sexual performance, and 3) Determine whether downstream oxytocin circuitry mediates the effects of a-MSH on erectile function. Under the first aim, novel cell type-specific tools will be used to allow acute neuronal manipulation to examine the role of POMC-specific insulin and leptin resistance in ED in a unique mouse model of prediabetes. In the second aim, the applicants will then determine whether reactivating hypothalamic leptin and insulin pathways restores normal sexual function and offers a potential treatment strategy in cases of central insulin and leptin resistance caused by diet-induced obesity. Under the third aim, the applicants will determine whether downstream oxytocin circuitry mediates the effects of a-MSH on erectile function using pharmacogenetics to examine whether this pathway is necessary and sufficient. A well-established cre-dependent viral tracer will then be employed to map downstream circuitry. The rationale for these studies is that they will be the first to address whether diabetes is accompanied by defective melanocortin signaling that may cause or exacerbate ED. The rising number of men with obesity and type 2 diabetes makes this research highly significant. Given the involvement of melanocortin pathways in regulating blood pressure, obesity, and glycemic control, the proposed research has the potential to guide the development of novel and effective therapies devoid of side effects that improve both the quality of life and overall health of these patients."
"9313334","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease affects 1% of adults over the age of 60 and is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease. It is characterized by progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, and clinically, it manifests with severe motor impairments including slowness of movement, bradykinesia, resting tremor, gastrointestinal disruptions, and sleep disturbances. There are currently no treatments to prevent disease onset or curtail disease progression, and identifying potential new targets for pharmaceutical interventions will be imperative to reduce disease incidence and severity. A promising target for PD therapeutics is the dopaminergic vesicle. It has been well-established by our lab and others that impaired vesicular function and capacity for dopamine-for example, as a result of under- expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2)-can lead to progressive dopaminergic degeneration and enhanced vulnerability to dopaminergic toxicants. [Conversely, enhanced vesicular function is neuroprotective]. Our lab is therefore interested in characterizing novel targets of dopamine vesicle function, such as the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C). SV2C genotype mediates the protective power of nicotine use, which is the strongest environmental mediator of PD risk. Targeting SV2C may allow us to harness the therapeutic potential of nicotine without exposing patients to negative health consequences associated with nicotine use. We have developed SV2C-KO mice that will allow us to determine this protein's role in mediating dopamine handling and release and its functional interaction with nicotine. Preliminary electrochemistry data suggest that SV2C mediates dopamine vesicular packaging and release, providing further evidence of a potential therapeutic value for targeting SV2C in PD. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that SV2C indeed mediates dopamine handling and release, vulnerability to dopaminergic toxicity by MPTP and neuroprotection by nicotine. Results from this study will show to what extent SV2C plays a role in protecting against pathological dopaminergic degeneration, and it will evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target for PD."
"9206121","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing body of research shows that sleep facilitates the consolidation of memories. For example, the number of sleep spindles (transient neural events in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, 9-15 Hz) in a post-training sleep period correlates with the magnitude of declarative memory improvement (e.g., conscious, episodic memories), whereas minutes in REM sleep correlate with improvement in non-declarative memories (e.g., unconscious, perceptual or sensorimotor skills). Although these studies report that individual sleep features correlate with improvement in specific memory domains, we do not know if manipulating these sleep features will lead to changes in these precise memory domains. The central aim of this application is to use pharmacological intervention to address the specificity of sleep-dependent memory with respect to 1) sleep feature (i.e., sleep spindles vs. other sleep features), 2) memory domain (i.e. declarative vs. non-declarative), and 3) pharmacological agents (i.e., zolpidem (ZOL) vs. sodium oxybate (SO) vs. placebo). Establishing a link between correlational sleep studies and pharmacological interventions that target precise memory domains will advance our long-term goal of developing pharmacological treatments for memory impairments. We hypothesize that increasing spindles with ZOL will improve declarative, but not non-declarative memory, and decreasing spindles with SO will reduce declarative memory. Strong preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of the project aim's in the applicant's hands. First, preliminary data from the PI's K01 demonstrates successful pharmacological modulation of sleep spindles (i.e., increased with ZOL and decreased with SO, vs. placebo); and second, pilot data shows that pharmacologically modulating sleep spindles does affect memory performance. Results of our pharmacological intervention on sleep-dependent memory consolidation in healthy young subjects will be leveraged to develop novel treatment approaches for older adults with pharmacologically tailored sleep. Outcomes from these studies will lead to future translational interventions in populations with more severe memory impairment (e.g., dementia and Alzheimer's patients). A compelling observation supports our approach: along with hallmark impairments in declarative memory, older adults and patients with dementia and Alzheimer's also have deteriorated sleep, including a reduced number of sleep spindles. Furthermore, older adults do not appear to benefit from sleep-dependent consolidation as much as younger adults. Yet, cognitive aging treatment strategies do not address the possibility of improving or tailoring sleep to reverse these memory impairments. The proposed studies investigate the hypothesis that pharmacologically boosting sleep spindles in older adults will improve declarative memory, compared with non-declarative memory and placebo. Outcomes of studies will have broad impact given 1) that over 70 million people in the U.S. suffer from disordered sleep at an annual cost of $150 billion; 2) the need to improve treatments for cognitive aging as well as the 5.5 million Americans affected by Alzheimer's at a cost of $200 billion annually; and 3) that improved mechanistic understanding of memory can influence education that costs $1 trillion annually."

"9344788","Despite significant increases in global health investment and the availability of low-cost, efficacious interventions designed to prevent mother to child HIV transmission (PMTCT) in low and middle income countries with high HIV burden, the translation of these scientific advances into effective delivery strategies has been slow, uneven and incomplete. As a result, pediatric HIV infection remains largely uncontrolled. The introduction of the Option B+ strategy ? where HIV-infected pregnant women rapidly initiate lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) independent of disease status ? has the potential to dramatically reduce HIV transmission during pregnancy, birth and the breastfeeding period, and as a result, it has been scaled up throughout high HIV burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite these significant investments to scale-up Option B+, results have been poor, with high rates of loss to follow-up and low viral suppression, leading to continued HIV transmission to children and HIV-associated morbidity among mothers. A previous research project (the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach ? or SAIA ? cluster randomized trial) demonstrated that a package of systems engineering tools including cascade analysis, process mapping, and continuous quality improvement, was effective at improving flow through the PMTCT cascade across three sub-Saharan African countries. The overall goal of this application is to develop a model to deliver the SAIA intervention (SAIA-SCALE) that is led by district maternal and child health (MCH) supervisors (rather than research nurses), to serve as a foundation for national scale-up. We propose to implement the SAIA intervention in all districts in one province in Mozambique using MCH supervisors as disseminating agents, who will implement SAIA in subordinate health facilities. Using a three-year phased-in design, 12 districts will be randomly allocated into three implementation waves, and a mixed-methods evaluation will be used to assess the impact of the intervention. Our specific aims are to: Aim 1: Develop an effective district-based dissemination and implementation strategy for the SAIA intervention (SAIA-SCALE), using the RE-AIM model to evaluate the program?s Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance; and Aim 2: Using activity based micro-costing and mathematical models of HIV transmission, estimate the budget and program impact from the payer perspective to scale-up the SAIA intervention compared to the standard of care. The results of this implementation research are expected to generate knowledge of global health significance, and by providing a real-world implementation model for the SAIA intervention and programmatically relevant information, is designed to lead to rapid policy translation for future scale-up in countries with high burden of HIV and weak PMTCT delivery systems."
"9411562","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput Electrophysiological Purification Array (HEPA) for cell based therapies Abstract: Patient-specific reprogrammed somatic cells (induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs) have raised hope for revolutionary regenerative treatments for heart, lung and blood diseases and drug development applications. For example, these iPS cells can be differentiated into cardiomyocytes and have the capability to regenerate and undergo extensive repair after myocardial infarction. However, the differentiation efficiency is low and differentiated cardiomyocytes are heterogeneous, containing mainly ventricular cardiomyocytes with varying maturation states. Since these iPSCs differentiate in vitro into a mixture of different lineages, purification of the differentiated cells, as well as their separatio from tumor-forming progenitors, is essential. But establishment of effective separation methods to isolate differentiated cells and exclude cells that lead to teratoma formation is the major challenge in translating advances in stem cell biology into tissue replacement therapies. Conventional separation techniques, such as microscope-assisted manual isolation is time consuming whereas fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and magnetic-activated cell sorting, require intensive labor, exogenous labeling or genetic modification and, as such, are not readily adaptable to clinical applications. To address these issues, therefore, Biopico Systems teams with the University of California, Irvine to develop High throughput Electrophysiological Purification Array (HEPA) system for label-free cell sorting of induced pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny based on their response to electrical stimulation. This Phase I effort will provide the foundation for deriving patient specific cells for potential clinical use in phaseII with a goal of obtaining 100% specificity at high viability, high throughput and a capacity to sort multiple cell phenotypes for therapeutic applications. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed platform, we will combine the technologies of flow- based field potential sensing in an electrode array with high speed signal processing and high throughput cell sorting to rapidly detect, identify, and sort millions of specific cells that will allow the successful translation of advances in stem cell biology into therapies for cardiac diseases."

"9332881","Project summary Many liver pathogens, like hepatitis C virus (HCV), have established mechanisms to subvert the host immune response and to establish persistent infection. Dissecting these mechanisms and gaining insight into factors that contribute to viral clearance versus chronicity in the liver is notoriously difficult. Access to human liver tissue is limited. The only immunocompetent animal model of HCV infection, the chimpanzee, is no longer readily available for research. However, we have recently succeeded in establishing the first immune- competent mouse model of an HCV-related virus, Norway rat hepacivirus (NrHV). Our preliminary characterization of this model revealed significant virological and immunological similarities with HCV infection in humans. This advance now opens the opportunity to interrogate hepatic antiviral immunity, host-virus interactions, viral adaptation, immune evasion strategies and pathogenesis of a hepatotropic virus at an unprecedented level. In this proposal we plan to comprehensively analyze innate and adaptive intrahepatic immune responses during hepacivirus infection in vivo and to define determinants of viral clearance. The natural host of NrHV is the rat. In immune-competent mice NrHV is cleared after several weeks of infection. Thus we plan to adapt this virus to the mouse, select for viral variants that can establish chronicity and systematically analyze mechanisms of host-adaptation and immune evasion. Through NrHV infection of the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross mouse colony at UNC, we will map the host genetic determinants of clearance and persistence. We anticipate that combined approaches of viral adaptation to the murine host and a host genetic screen will meet an important unmet need in establishing a robust model of virus-associated liver disease. Taken together, our proposed research will use a diverse and multidisciplinary approach to shed new light on hepatotropic virus infection in vivo. These insights should provide new strategies for vaccine development or treatment of virus-associated liver disease."
"9290231","The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and devastating complication of sepsis that is characterized by flooded lungs, need for mechanical ventilation, and severely low blood oxygen levels. ARDS inflicts a very high mortality yet pharmacoprevention or pharmacotherapy options are lacking. In addition, the risk for ARDS is incompletely explained by clinical factors suggesting that individual risk factors may be important. We previously identified and replicated a genetic variant in the angiopoietin-2 gene (ANGPT2) that strongly associated with ARDS risk. We demonstrated that carriers of the ARDS-associated genetic variant exhibited a higher proportion of full-length angiopoietin-2 (ANG2) isoform in plasma, suggesting to us that some patients are genetically predisposed to develop ARDS via the ANGPT2 gene, and that this risk may be mediated by changes in plasma expression of ANG2. We used genetic regulation of plasma ANG2 during sepsis, in a Mendelian Randomization analysis, to demonstrate that plasma ANG2 has a causal effect on the risk of ARDS. Thus our long term objectives are to identify subjects who will benefit from anti-ANG2 therapy and to develop compounds that effectively antagonize ANG2 as an early ARDS treatment. For this application, we will identify and validate thresholds of plasma ANG2 that objectively increase or decrease ARDS risk using classification and regression tree (CART) methodology on 2 large cohorts of critically ill patients with sepsis who are carefully phenotyped for ARDS. The output will be plasma thresholds that might help to include or exclude subjects for a future precision trial of anti-ANG2 therapy targeted to those likely to benefit. We will enact Mendelian Randomization analysis to test whether the true effect of day 0 and day 2 plasma ANG2 towards ARDS mortality is causal, because this could inform the utility of anti-ANG2 therapy for prevention alone versus for prevention and treatment. Finally, we will use a novel platform known as ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), whereby lungs declined for transplantation are ventilated and perfused in a highly controlled environment, to test whether 2 drugs that mimic ANG1 to activate the TIE2 receptor achieve an improved phosphoTIE2/TIE2 ratio and improved oxygenation and lung compliance after a one-time dose. The multidisciplinary team of investigators and consultants to enact these aims include 2 EVLP experts, 2 epidemiologists with expertise in lung injury prediction and molecular subphenotyping, a nanomedicine pharmacologist with expertise in rational drug design, and the PI, a translational scientist who first identified a link between ANGPT2 variation, plasma protein expression, and ARDS risk. Completion of these aims will provide key data to inform a future precision anti-ANG2 trial for ARDS, including who should be enrolled, whether the trial should focus on ARDS prevention or treatment, and which drug(s) to test."
"9229078","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The basal ganglia (BG) have been implicated in goal-directed locomotion for decades. However the mechanisms by which the BG regulates locomotion remain unclear. While most descriptions of the BG focus on outputs to thalamus which drive motor cortex, a more phylogenetically conserved target is the brainstem. One major brainstem target of the BG is the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). The MLR is defined functionally as a brainstem region in which electrical stimulation drives locomotion. Lesion of this area in humans causes akinesia and an inability to initiate locomotion. Our fundamental goal is to investigate the circuit mechanisms by which the BG regulates locomotion through the MLR. We hypothesize that neurons in this region are necessary for locomotion initiated by the BG.  The BG may be broken into two pathways, the direct and indirect, which begin in the striatum. The pathways are split between populations of medium spiny neurons (MSN's) at the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum. Direct pathway MSN's express dopamine receptor D1 while indirect pathway MSN's express adenosine receptor Adora2a. The direct pathway has been hypothesized to promote movement while the indirect pathway suppresses movement. We hypothesize that these two pathways oppositely regulate the MLR to initiate or suppress locomotion. The output of the BG is the Substantia Nigra pars reticulate (SNr) which provides tonic inhibition of downstream structures thought to be responsible for motor programs such as locomotion. Release of this tonic inhibition allows a program to be activated. We hypothesize that the SNr can regulate locomotion through the MLR by modulation of its tonic inhibition. In this set of experiments I will use cutting edge optogenetic and electrophysiological methods to 1) define the cell-types responsible for the initiation of locomotion in the MLR, 2) demonstrate the SNr's control of the MLR which results in the suppression or initiation of locomotion, 3) show how the direct and indirect pathways oppositely affect locomotion through the MLR. This study will shed light on the circuits and cells responsible for the initiation of goal-directed locomotio and provide valuable circuit-level insight to aid the development of new and innovative treatments of BG and locomotor disorders."
"9300669","Project Summary/Abstract The urea cycle is the major pathway for detoxification of ammonia in mammals. Arginase 1 deficiency, a distal urea cycle disorder, results in hyperargininemia. In humans, deficiency of this enzyme is characterized clinically by progressive mental impairment, spasticity, and growth retardation; periodic episodes of hyperammonemia are uncommon unlike the other urea cycle disorders where this is a much more frequent occurrence. In recent experiments, substantial anatomical, ultrastructural and electrophysiological differences between knockout animals and wild type controls were found. Interestingly, arginase deficient young mice have decreased dendritic arborization and decreased synaptic density in layer V cortical neurons. However, after adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy was administered on postnatal day 2, these abnormalities, when examined at two weeks of age, were rescued after nearly normalizing plasma arginine during this critical period of central nervous system development. The discovery of these measurable differences at the neuron and synapse level, and their prevention with gene therapy, have begun to elucidate the previously unknown functional neurological abnormalities that are present in arginase deficiency and have implications as new therapies are sought. This limited proposal will examine this further under the hypothesis that control of arginine and its metabolites are critical during early central nervous system development and if this can be achieved, will lead to long-term prevention of neuronal dysfunction. Preliminary data: Our research group has: 1) constructed and characterized the arginase 1 knockout mouse; 2) demonstrated long-term survival and rescue with recombinant AAV; 3) demonstrated that only low-level ureagenesis is necessary for long-term survival; 4) shown, using an array of behavioral tests, that treated arginase knockout animals lack behavioral abnormalities and there is no difference in learning when compared to littermates; 5) shown that peripheral metabolism can result in control of circulating plasma arginine; and 6) shown that loss of arginase gene expression results in abnormalities of intrinsic excitability, synapse density, and the dendritic arbor of neurons. In this proposal, our existing studies will be expanded upon by testing the hypothesis that control of arginine and its metabolites during early central nervous system development results in long-lasting changes at the neuron and dendrite level and further will explore myelination as an additional source of dysregulation as suggested by microarray analysis. Successful completion of these studies will provide further evidence supporting neonatal gene therapy for arginase deficiency by demonstrating that rigorous control of plasma arginine during postnatal brain maturation, not attainable by current methods, is essential for the prevention of the neuropathology associated with hyperargininemia."
"9265519","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Although many interventions have now been developed to address palliative care for specific chronic diseases, little has been done to address the overall quality of life for older adults with serious illness, spanning not only the functional aspects of symptom and medication management, but the affective aspects of suffering in a scalable and cost effective manner. Over the past decade we have developed and tested embodied conversational agents (ECA) - computer characters that simulate face- to-face conversation using voice, hand gesture, gaze cues and other nonverbal conversational behavior to provide a natural and intuitive computer interface that is capable of expressing empathy and other emotions. We have successfully developed and evaluated this interface in several clinical trials involving older patients of all levels of health and computer literacy. We now propose to adapt this innovative cutting edge technology to create and test a mobile ECA for palliative care (ECA-PAL) for patients with advanced illnesses, spanning: symptom and medication tracking and management; assessment and counseling to reduce social isolation, depression and unmet spiritual needs; and, promotion of and communication about advance care plan. Design: Randomized Controlled Trial Hypotheses: In comparison to participants receiving usual care, ECA-PAL participants will: (1) have greater quality of life; (2) a higher rat of receiving of palliative care services; (3) a lower rate of hospital service utilization; and (4) lower cost per patient-month. Population Studied: Adult patients at Boston Medical Center or affiliated Health Centers with life-limiting illness, whose clinician endorses that it would not bea surprise if the patient died within 12 months. Methods: The ECA-PAL will be assessed with a randomized controlled trial of patients getting usual care (n=182) or usual care plus ECA-PAL (n=182). Each participant will be enrolled along with a caregiver surrogate subject. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is quality of life. Secondary outcomes will be measured in the domains of receipt of palliative care services, hospital service utilization, cost, social isolatio, depression, anxiety, physical symptoms, spiritual needs, advance care planning. Caregivers will also be interviewed to measure their quality of life. Expected Results: In this project we will evaluate a scalable patient-centered intervention to improve the quality of life for people with advanced illnesses."
"9445535","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for the Continuation of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) - Data Coordinating Center. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one out of every three adults and five children in North America and is a growing public health issue in the United States. NAFLD, and especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may lead to end-stage liver disease and primary liver cancer, as well as liver-, cardiovascular-, and cancer-related mortality, resulting in major increases in health burdens and costs. The NASH CRN is ideally and uniquely positioned to impact the growing public health significance of NASH that can only be addressed via a large research consortium. The primary objective of the NASH CRN is to perform clinical research on NASH and NAFLD in adults and children. A closely linked and high priority secondary objective is to conduct translational research in NASH and NAFLD focusing on the pathogenesis that will provide the basis for understanding the natural history and developing means of better diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management. In the next phase of the NASH CRN, the adult and pediatric therapeutic trials initiated during the previous funding cycle will be completed, and new therapeutic trials, including phase 2a proof of mechanism and phase 2b clinical trials will be initiated, to develop evidence-based treatment options that are safe, effective, simple, and inexpensive. The longitudinal cohort of adults and children with NAFLD will be extended, which will prospectively define the natural history of the disease, the cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and will aid in biomarker discovery and validation, and development and validation of non-invasive techniques to evaluate and identify those with NASH/NAFLD, who will respond, and how quickly the disease is progressing. The Data Coordinating Center will provide the NASH CRN with leadership, expertise (in biostatistical analysis, study design, data management, multicenter coordination, quality control methods) and project support, communication and organization and is eager to continue its collaboration with the clinical centers, NIDDK program staff, and private sector partners to complete these very important research objectives. The NASH CRN is poised to continue its major impact on the field and directly advance the mission of the National Institutes of Health to improve the health of the public."
"9293423","PROJECT SUMMARY: The development of cell and animal model-based systems for direct, efficient, titratable and reversible  degradation of target proteins  Our collective endeavor to determine the functions of the ~ 25,000 genes encoded within the human and mouse genomes has heavily relied on targeted gene knockout or RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown technologies. Despite these approaches being important for scientific progress they are hindered by a number of limitations and caveats, the most significant being that these technologies do not directly target the protein. To alleviate these limitations, we propose to introduce an auxin induced degron (AID) system in human and mouse ESCs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The AID technology will enable direct, efficient, titratable and reversible degradation of a target protein.  My laboratory studies the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes in the context of stem cell proliferation, differentiation, mammalian gametogenesis and neurodevelopment. SMC complexes include cohesin, condensin and SMC5/6. Malfunction of SMC complexes causes severe developmental disorders including microcephaly, and SMC mutations are associated with cancer development.  We will assess the depletion of the SMC5/6 complex for ?proof-of-principle? experiments with regard to the development of the AID-mediated protein degradation system in human and mouse ESC lines. Furthermore, the mouse ESCs will be used to create an AID mouse model to study SMC5/6 complex functions during mammalian neurodevelopment and gametogenesis.  Stem cells are key tools for genetic engineering, development of cell-based therapies and basic research. Introduction of AID system into ESCs opens new perspectives in scientific endeavor for researchers from different fields, working with stem cells, cancer cells, as well as with tissue-specific cell types and organoids. These cell lines and organoids will also be of great benefit to tissue engineers and clinicians.  Creation of AID mouse models will allow analysis of essentially any developmental stage, any tissue and cell type of interest. This model will result in the development of new approaches to analyze embryogenesis and organogenesis, stem-cell niche interactions and fate decisions.  As the AID system is titratable, it can be optimized to better emulate human diseases. Furthermore, this technology will be adaptable to high-throughput genetic and therapeutic screens to study stem cell homeostasis and differentiation capacity, together with any cellular event or feature of interest."
"9260796","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions);  The Vaccine and Cell Therapy Core Laboratory is a highly specialized shared resource at the NYU Cancer Institute (NYUCI) that is an essential part of the Tumor Vaccine Program. The purpose of the laboratory is to support clinical trials of experimental immunotherapies for cancer and chronic viral infections such as HIV/AIDS at NYU Medical Center and at collaborating institutions. The laboratory provides two types of services to meet this purpose. First, the laboratory prepares vaccines and cellular immunotherapies in a dedicated, controlled space in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations as required by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This cGMP laboratory features three class 10,000 (ISO 7) cleanrooms, and has been designed with the flexibility to manufacture virtually any type of therapy that uses manipulated human cells. It is one of only a handful of such laboratories in the Greater New York metropolitan region. Second, the laboratory also features a very well equipped Immunology Laboratory that offers a variety of sophisticated immune monitoring technologies and services to measure patients' responses to vaccination. Access to this facility has enabled investigators at NYU to undertake investigator initiated studies as well as take part in pharmaceutical-sponsored studies, thus providing patients at the Clinical Cancer Center access to novel therapies in a number of disease settings. Since opening in early 2006, the facility has supported 20 completed and ongoing immunotherapy trials for cancer at NYU, 2 HIV vaccine trials at Massachusetts General Hospital, and immune monitoring contracted by Merck. The user base for the laboratory continues to expand as more investigators take advantage of this remarkable resource."
"9329976","Abstract The promise of harnessing cell-mediated (TH1) immunity to treat cancer or establish prophylactic immunity against chronic viral pathogens like HIV continues to be hampered by an incomplete understanding of many different critical factors and processes, including the manner by which the innate and adaptive immune  systems interface and communicate. CTLA-4 is one of the best characterized of the immune checkpoint proteins, molecules that serve to balance, regulate, and fine-tune immune activation with homeostatic inhibition. The critical importance of CTLA-4 to the regulation of T-cell activation and proliferation was demonstrated nearly two decades ago by the dramatic phenotype of the null mutant, animals which die in the early postnatal period of uncontrolled lymphoproliferation and autoimmune inflammation. CTLA-4 is expressed by all major lymphoid lineage effectors including T, B, and NK cells; however, its functionality has been best characterized in T-cells where it exhibits both cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic regulatory functions. There is almost nothing known about CTLA-4 expression or function in non-lymphoid cell types, and sporadic reports of CTLA-4 expression in non- lymphoid lineages have been inconclusive. Recently our group reported expression and secretion of  microvesicle-bound CTLA-4 from myeloid lineage innate dendritic cells (DC). Microvesicular CTLA-4  demonstrat ed the ability to bind B7, leading to vesicle internalization and subsequent downregulation of B7 expression. Knockdown of DC-expressed CTLA-4 resulted in a dramatic upregulation of CD8+ cell proliferation as well as enhanced antitumor and antiviral immunity in vivo. The discovery of non-lymphoid CTLA-4 expression in an innate cell type and concomitant characterization of novel function signifies a significant paradigm shift in the understanding of CTLA-4's role in immune governance as well as the manner by which the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system communicate. Successful completion of the work proposed herein will characterize the basic mechanisms by which DC expressed CTLA-4 is regulated as well as the manner by which this critical immunoregulatory molecule contributes to crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity. These data will enable and accelerate development of novel therapeutic approaches and assist in enhanced exploitation of existing therapeutics (i.e. ipilimumab) that target CTLA-4 checkpoint pathways."
"9272731","Currently, there are no replacement tooth therapies that provide the function and sensory responsiveness of natural teeth. Our long-term goal is to design and develop functional bioengineered, vital, whole tooth constructs for clinical applications as an improved alternative to synthetic dental implants. The objective of the proposed study is to fabricate biomimetic tooth constructs of specified size and shape using post-natal dental cells encapsulated in gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA) hydrogel scaffolds. We hypothesize that ?tunable? GelMA hydrogel constructs will promote improved dental cell interactions leading to the formation of mineralized dental tissues. The rationale for the proposed research includes the significant health need, our strong preliminary data, and the need for alternatives to currently used replacement tooth therapies. Results from the proposed studies could also be used to develop other bioengineered tissue and organ systems that require proper epithelial and mesenchymal cell interactions. We will test the hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1. Identify growth factors that can be incorporated into GelMA constructs to promote dental cell differentiation and mineralized dental tissue formation. 2. Identify scaffold design for improved DE cell differentiation and enamel production. 3. Characterize biomimetic GelMA tooth bud constructs grown in an in vivo rat jaw implant model.  The analyses that we will use to investigate the effectiveness of these different fabrication strategies of GelMA tooth bud constructs include 3D radiographic techniques, and histological and immunohistochemical methods, to measure the extent of polarized dental cell morphology, differentiation, and organized construct mineralization. The expected outcomes of the proposed study include an improved biomimetic 3D tooth bud model that facilitates the formation of organized, functional, bioengineered teeth of specified size and shape. Validation of a functional biomimetic 3D tooth bud will have a significant impact on the tooth tissue engineering field by providing a clinically relevant alternative to artificial dental implants. The contribution of the proposed research is significant as it aims to enhance the quality of dental and oral health for people suffering from tooth loss as well as contribute to other studies aiming to bioengineer similar organs and tissues."
"9108904","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     In patients with neuromuscular diseases, including spinal cord injury (SCI), stroke, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), expiratory muscle weakness and inability to generate an effective cough and clear secretions are a major cause of respiratory complications including bronchitis and pneumonia. In fact, pneumonia is a common cause of death in these patient populations. In a recent human clinical trial, we demonstrated that lower thoracic spinal cord stimulation (SCS) results in activation of the expiratory muscles and the generation of large positive airway pressures and high peak airflow rates characteristic of a normal cough. Restoration of an effective cough resulted in greater ease in raising secretions, reductions in the incidence of respiratory tract infections, and improvement in life quality. Unfortunately, activatin of the respiratory muscles via SCS requires high stimulus amplitudes (40mA), which may also cause unwanted side effects including stimulation of pain fibers and, therefore, this method cannot be applied in patient populations who have intact sensation. We have recently demonstrated in preliminary animal testing that expiratory muscle activation can also be achieved with high frequency (e 300Hz) spinal cord stimulation (HF-SCS) requiring very low stimulus amplitudes (< 2mA). This is a novel and more physiologic method of expiratory muscle activation since stimulation occurs at a pre- motoneuron level, allowing for processing of the stimulus within the motoneuron pools, resulting in a more physiologic recruitment pattern. It is our Hypothesis that HF-SCS will result in sufficient activation of the expiratory muscles to provide large positive airway pressures and high peak expiratory airflow rates necessary to generate an effective cough. Prior to clinical trials, however, there are important aspects of this technique that require further characterization in an animal model. The Specific Objectives of this proposal are to: I) determine the optimal stimulus paradigm and electrode location that result in optimal activation of the expiratory muscles with the consequent development of large positive airway pressures and high peak expiratory airflow rates characteristic of an effective cough, II) evaluate the mechanism by which the expiratory muscles are activated during HF-SCS, and III) evaluate the electric field distribution during HF-SCS with the goal of evaluating alternative electrode designs. The results of these animal studies should resolve important basic science issues concerning this technique and provide the framework for human clinical trials. Restoration of an effective cough may allow patients with various neuromuscular disorders to clear secretions more easily and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory complications in these patient populations."

"9285212","Mammalian telomeres are sequential hexameric TTAGGG DNA repeats that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Structurally, the telomeric DNA forms a lariat, or T-loop, at the end of each chromosome to shield the ends of linear chromosomes from degradation and/or illegitimate recombination. The six-subunit protein complex shelterin binds and protects telomeric DNA with sequence specificity functioning to both inhibit the DNA damage response and regulate T-loop formation. Defects in shelterin function lead to telomere instability and contribute to both premature aging and the progression towards cancer. Recently this protective cap at telomere ends has expanded beyond shelterin to include the telomere repeat- containing RNA, TERRA. TERRA is expressed in several eukaryotes including plants, yeast, fish, and mammals. In human cells, TERRA is transcribed from the C-strand within the subtelomeric region and transcription elongation extends into the telomere repeats generating a transcript between 200bp and 9kb. TERRA is localized within the nucleus and associates with both the telomeric DNA and telomere associated proteins. The discovery of this long non- coding RNA, expressed from a region once considered transcriptionally silent, suggests that there is still much to learn about the mechanisms of telomere maintenance and the role these mechanisms play in the development of cancer. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that TERRA is cell cycle regulated, and that this regulation drives a molecular switch coordinating telomere replication with telomere end protection in vitro. While these studies were among the first to demonstrate a functional requirement for TERRA in telomere maintenance, exactly how TERRA functions to mediate these process in mammalian cells is still unclear. These studies have been limited, in part, by an inability to manipulate endogenous TERRA transcript levels. To overcome this challenge, we have designed a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) system that allows us to manipulate gene expression from the endogenous TERRA promoter. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to further define the function of TERRA in regulation of telomere stability and ultimately, understand how defects in TERRA function contribute to the development of cancer."
"9234420","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Saphenous vein (SV) graft failure is a common clinical problem in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Failure of various therapies, including targeted gene therapy, could be due to the bad choice of the gene and/or the use of animal model dissimilar to human disease. Also, there was no consideration to promote endothelial cell proliferation. We observed inactivation of PTEN with increased proliferation of SMCs in human SV and PTEN overexpression limits cell proliferation. Since PTEN modulates cell signaling and cell growth, PTEN transgene expression in SV graft SMCs would prevent the development of intimal hyperplasia. Also, the repair of endothelial cells (ECs) with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would inhibit thrombosis. The hypothesis is that the inhibition of intimal hyperplasia by PTEN transgene while preserving endothelium with the delivery of MSCs in autologous vein grafts prior to CABG would be the best strategy to maintain vein graft patency. We will do these studies in a well-established and routinely used in our laboratory the swine model of atherosclerosis and perform CABG using superficial epigastric vein (SEV) isolated with no touch technique. Aim 1: Our hypothesis predicts that the overexpression of PTEN transgene in the SMCs of vein graft in coronary arteries in atherosclerotic swine will prevent the development of neointimal hyperplasia in bypass vein graft. Aim 2: Our hypothesis predicts that the repair of endothelial cells with MSCs together with PTEN transgene in the SMCs of vein graft in coronary arteries of atherosclerotic swine will prevent thrombosis and neointimal hyperplasia in bypass vein graft, and this would be superior to the effect of PTEN transgene alone. Aim 3: Our hypothesis predicts that overexpression of PTEN transgene and MSCs-induced endothelial cell regeneration would reduce inflammation and inhibit constrictive remodeling together with inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in the vein graft in coronary arteries. The autologous SEV will be exposed to PTEN vector and MSCs followed by aorto-coronary grafting in atherosclerotic swine. EKG and echocardiography to monitor heart function, and coronary angiography and optimal coherence tomography to quantify in-segment minimal luminal diameter, diameter stenosis, late loss and intimal hyperplasia will examine the therapeutic efficacy of this therapy. Histological parameters will include the intimal thickness, lumen area, intima-media ratio, development and ulceration of plaque, thrombosis, extracellular matrix, and re-occlusion. Expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory and pro-hyperplasia pathways will be examined in excised vein graft and correlated with the degree of neointimal hyperplasia and constrictive remodeling.  Findings from these studies will provide the conceptual support for our hypothesis, and position us to translate our investigation into a clinical phase 1 study for the use of PTEN-engineered autologous MSCs for the treatment and possibly cure of the vein graft disease following CABG."
"9430685","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to exploit oral vaccination with a novel HIV envelope (HIVenv)-loaded pollen grain (PG) formulation to elicit a rapid immune response comprising of HIVenv-specific immunological memory in Natural Killer (NK) cells that directly kill HIV infected cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, to prevent HIV infection. NK cells are an essential anti-viral weapon of the immune system; they respond quickly to infection, kill infected cells without prior activation, engage multiple targets simultaneously, and secrete large amounts of anti-viral cytokines, such as interferon gamma. Further, NK cells also crosstalk with B cell-mediated Ab- responses through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), a rapid NK cell-mediated lytic function that only requires tagging of target cells by binding Abs that may not even be neutralizing. If these unique NK cell-mediated effector functions could be enhanced through vaccination, and induced rapidly at the site of HIV entry, it may be possible to prevent the establishment of a systemic HIV infection. In support of this postulate, Dr. Paust (PI) and colleagues have recently demonstrated that contrary to conventional paradigm, subsets of NK cells mediate Ag-specific immunological memory to HIV-envelope. However, reliable elicitation of strong mucosal immunity through vaccination remains a challenge. Recently Dr. Gill (Co-I) has pioneered a unique approach that uses pollen grains (PGs) for oral vaccination. PGs, due to their natural toughness, survive the harsh environment of the stomach, and safely ferry antigens (Ags) to the intestine, where they are persorbed cross the intestinal epithelium. Using these methods, we generated data, which show that oral vaccination with ovalbumin (OVA)-loaded lycopodium spores (LS-OVA) results in (i) OVA-specific Abs in serum and fecal matter, (ii) OVA-specific memory NK cells, which degranulate, kill, and mediate ADCC upon in vitro restimulation, and (iii) memory NK cell recruitment to the mucosa upon oral challenge. We further found that HIVenv elicits recall responses in human NK cells in vitro, and in vivo. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that human NK cells with antiviral activity against HIV represent a potential effector cell population able to prevent systemic HIV infection, and that oral LS-env vaccination elicits HIV-specific memory NK cell responses. We propose to determine the efficacy of a novel oral LS-env vaccine for the induction of long-lived HIV-specific mucosal NK cell-memory responses in humanized mice, and to assess the efficacy of NK cell memory for the prevention of HIV infection. The demonstration of memory NK cells with activity against HIV in human NK cells, and the ability to induce these responses by vaccination would be highly significant, as it would identify a novel adaptive lymphocyte subset that can be targeted by vaccines and directed against HIV."

The microCT systems that are currently available at UPitt and the other academic institutions in Pittsburgh are of the in vivo type and capable of intermediate resolutions (maximum resolution corresponding to 10.5?m voxel size). Although they provide an essential service to many investigators, these instruments cannot attain the image resolution (corresponding to a 1-8?m voxel size range) needed for the studies described in this application; they have been designed for longitudinal studies of relatively larger anatomical structures in animals. Five major users and three minor users based in several departments at UPitt and Carnegie Mellon University participate in the application with a combined need for 1500 hours of instrument use per year. To ensure an efficient operation of the system with minimal downtime, the system will be operated by a dedicated, full-time expert technical specialist.  Half of the specialist's salary for four years will be covered by funds made available for this grant by the Dean of the School of Dental Medicine, while the remainder will be recovered from fees charged to the users. The funds necessary for ensuring the proper function of the instrument (service contract, a technician's effort for operation of the system) have been guaranteed for the life of the instrument from the School of Dental Medicine in the case of shortfalls in revenue.

"9333472","Seizures are named for their unpredictability. This project seeks to understand the conditions that lead to seizure initiation so that we can develop anticonvulsant strategies to ameliorate those conditions. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures first develop interictal spikes and then spontaneous seizures over 3 - 7 days in vitro (DIV). The question addressed here is: why does a seizure occur instead of another interictal spike? Answering this requires a careful dissection of the conditions just prior to each spike, and each seizure. That is not feasible to do even in vitro, whereas in computer models, pre-ictal conditions can be stored, analyzed, manipulated, and re-run. In the last round, we developed the first neural network model that generates both interictal spikes and seizures. The seizures are self-sustaining reentrant waves of activity that have recently been recorded with high-density electrodes in human epilepsy. The conditions for sustained re-entry are difficult to achieve, which may account for the relative rarity of seizures vs. interictal spikes. In this proposal, we will test three pre-ictal conditions that we have identified in silico. The first condition is the wiring of the network. Neuronal synaptic wiring strategies are largely unknown, but we have developed technologies to determine synaptic wiring in the organotypic slice, including a microcscope within an incubator (?IncuScope?) and deployment of digital micromirror chips to stimulate single neurons using optogenetics (?optical synapses?). We will read out the synaptic targets of the stimulated neurons using sensitive new transgenic calcium fluorophores. We will then test the necessity of that ictal wiring pattern by altering it using excitatory and inhibitory optical synapses. The second pre-ictal condition is the pattern of refractoriness in the network. These patterns shape the wave of activation, and most waves die out without forming stable re- entrant cycles. The third preictal condition is the location of the onset of the wave of activation; reentrant waves of activity can only be initiated from particular regions within a pre-ictal network pattern of refractoriness. We will test the second and third conditions by converting spiking networks to seizing networks, and seizing networks to spiking or quiescent networks, with appropriate stimulation using excitatory optical synapses. These experiments will provide unique new insights into brain connectomics; ictogenesis; and the mechanisms of efficacy and failure of the therapies for medically intractable epilepsy: seizure surgery (changing network wiring; Aim 1) and brain stimulation (changing the refractory patterns in epileptic networks; Aim 2)."
"9352660","ABSTRACT  The Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment Services (CHIPTS) is a collaboration of leading scientists from UCLA, Charles R. Drew University, Friends Research Institute, and RAND Corporation. CHIPTS' research agenda incorporates advances in HIV prevention science using combination antiretroviral therapy for those living with HIV and prophylactic antiretrovirals (ARVs) for high-risk HIV-negative individuals. Yet in key populations (e.g., young MSM of color, transgender, homeless, incarcerated, African American women), especially those with concurrent substance use and mental health disorders, barriers prevent access and adherence required to benefit from ARVs. CHIPTS will bridge these gaps with a plan to promote research, dissemination and training on treatment as prevention (TasP) in HIV-positive individuals and HIV prevention that integrates ARVs for high-risk, HIV-negative individuals (pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP), with emphasis on those with substance use and mental health disorders. CHIPTS has three specific aims. (1) SCIENCE: To promote novel, high impact and transformational research to eliminate barriers and to increase uptake, adherence, and persistence across the HIV prevention, care and policy continua. We study behavioral, biomedical, technological and structural approaches at individual, family, community, and policy impact levels that will stop new HIV infections, particularly in key populations. (2) NETWORKING: To sponsor meetings and provide venues for collaboration among scientists, providers, insurers, policy makers and stakeholders to accelerate uptake of high impact HIV prevention. (3) CAPACITY BUILDING: To mentor and train researchers, policy makers, providers, community leaders and staff members in health, criminal justice, social service, and administrative systems to reach HIV prevention goals for 90-90-90 by 2020. Our efforts are conducted domestically and globally. CHIPTS is comprised of five Cores. (1) Administrative Core leads CHIPTS interdisciplinary team, convenes center meetings and coordinates science, networking and capacity building agendas at local, state, national, and international levels. It ensures financial and scientific integrity, leads strategic planning and promotes a Global HIV Prevention Strategies Program. (2) Development Core invests in innovative, early stage research, supports emerging investigators and promotes dissemination events. (3) Combination Prevention Core promotes research on combination behavioral, biomedical, technological and structural interventions to reduce HIV incidence and to improve viral suppression, especially in key populations and those with substance use and mental health disorders. (4) Methods Core guides innovation and impact in measurement, statistical methods, and implementation science, focusing on factors presented by those with substance use and mental health disorders. (5) Policy Impact Core optimizes public health impact and science implementation by providing evidence on policy options to guide HIV prevention policy."
"9311053","PROJECT ABSTRACT / SUMMARY SKP1?CUL1?F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complexes use a family of F-box proteins (69 in humans) as substrate receptors to mediate the ubiquitylation and consequent degradation of a large number of regulatory proteins involved in many cellular processes. Given their critical role within the three key dimensions of cellular life: growth, survival, and proliferation, deregulation of SCF complexes and their substrates contribute to oncogenic events. SCFs can function as oncoproteins when overexpressed (if their substrates are tumor suppressors) or as tumor suppressors (if their substrates are oncoproteins). Several F-box proteins play an established role in cancer (e.g., FBXW7, FBXO11, FBXL1, and FBXW1), and inhibitors have been developed, with thalidomide and lenalidomide (which modulate CRBN, an F-box protein- related substrate receptor) as clinically valuable examples. During the initial years of CA076584, we focused on the role played by FBXL1 (aka SKP2) in cancer and defined FBXL1 as an oncogene in a wide variety of tumors. Moreover, our studies on FBXW1 (aka ?TrCP) demonstrated a role for this F-box protein in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. During the last funding cycle, we asked whether any other members of the F-box protein family play important roles in cancer. We have uncovered a unique role for FBXW7 in the survival of multiple myeloma cells (by contributing to the activation of NF-?B), and found that FBXO11 is a tumor suppressor in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas (by mediating the proteolysis of BCL6). We now propose a project investigating F-box protein-controlled cell cycle checkpoints and their aberrations in cancer cells. Using protein purifications followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we have identified novel players involved in these processes and we will characterize the mechanism and regulation of their degradation in the context of genotoxic stress in S and G2 cells (Aims 1 and 2). Several features of cancer cells suggest that their defects in DNA repair provide the required therapeutic index that make them sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Specific Aim 3 has two objectives: (i) to identify the SCF defects that sensitize cancer cells to this and related approaches, and (ii) to establish cell systems and mouse models to optimize and validate the concept of exploiting these defects in cancer therapy."
"9233784","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of infants, children and young adults are living with disabilities resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) in childhood. Following the intial insult, a cascade of secondary events produces progressive neurodegeneration. The developing brain may be uniquely vulnerable to some of these secondary insults, due to maturational features. In the very young, the injury may interfere with the execution of the developmental program later in life, leading to learning, attention, and social behavior abnormalities. Currently, treatment is limited to supportive care. Here, we will investigate novel emerging pathways involving cell signaling by 20- HETE, a cytochrome P450 metabolite of arachidonic acid. We find that specific cytochrome P450s known to synthesize 20-HETE are expressed in neurons and microglia and that 20-HETE can induce phosphorylation of NMDA receptors and Na,K-ATPase. Based on our previous work showing that a 20-HETE inhibitor is neuroprotective in models of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia and adult ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, we began to study its effect in the controlled cortical impact model in postnatal day 10 rats. Preliminary data show large reductions in lesion volume, improved long-term sensorimotor function, attenuated morphological changes in microglia, and a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The 20-HETE inhibitor also attenuated the response to lipopolysaccharide in microglia cultures. The goal of this project is to investigate the role of 20-HETE in males and females in a model of pediatric TBI. In Aim 1, we will determine the optimal duration of 20-HETE inhibitor administration and the maximum delay that provides efficacy so as to inform when 20-HETE signaling is exerting adverse effects after TBI. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of 20-HETE inhibition after TBI on NADPH oxidase and the consequent downstream effects on key caspase-dependent and independent cell death pathways. In Aim 3, we will determine the effects of 20-HETE inhibition after TBI on microglia morphology and the cytokine profile. By targeting both cell death and inflammatory pathways with a single drug in the very immature brain, this work has great potential for improving outcome from TBI in infants and toddlers who often have the poorest prognosis in pediatric TBI. Moreover, emerging evidence with cerebral ischemia indicates sex differences in cell death mechanisms and inflammation in both immature and mature brain, yet sex differences have been understudied in pediatric TBI models. Thus, the proposed work also is innovative in that it will begin to reveal whether sex differences in response to neuroprotective therapies are operative after TBI in the immature brain. Finally, elucidation of new pathways of 20-HETE in neurons and microglia could have an important bearing beyond TBI for other neurodegenerative disorders involving excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation and, hence, may stimulate new areas of investigation."
"9247260","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, Optimizing HIV Prevention in Ethiopia through Implementation Science, proposes to create and strengthen research teams capable of conducting implementation research at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia (AAU) College of Health Sciences, through collaboration with a Johns Hopkins University training group. It will focus on prevention of HIV, in particular on optimizing prevention of mother to chil transmission (PMTCT) and on treatment as prevention (TasP). Our proposed research training program addresses multiple areas prioritized by NIH in its FY 2012 strategic plan. PMTCT is a current priority in Ethiopia and TasP is expected to be a focus of the country's attention in the near future. The proposal is responsive to institutional needs, building upon existing capacity, leveraging other ongoing training infrastructure and filling a methodologic gap critical not only t addressing HIV prevention issues but other public health challenges as well. It builds upon a long standing collaboration between AAU and JHU that includes HIV research, PEPFAR-supported HIV program implementation, prior Fogarty supported training and the Medical Education Partnership Initiative. We are now proposing a program composed of advanced specialized training for 3 mid-level AAU faculty interested in implementation research, and a 2 year didactic and research training curriculum for 8 post-doctoral junior faculty. Training tracks will provide 4 possible areas of focus: bioethics, health services research, quantitative and qualitative research methods. Didactic training will be include a combination of online and Baltimore-based JH Bloomberg School of Public Health courses and supplemented by coursework taught in Ethiopia and an ongoing videoconference-based seminar. Trained mid- level AAU faculty will assist JHU faculty in delivering courses in future years. The junior trainee will develop and undertake implementation research addressing an issue of importance to prevention of HIV and graduates of the program will serve as mentors to more junior trainees. Evaluation metrics will include trainee scientific output (publications, grant submissions, presentations at scientific meetings), in particular any that include an interdisciplinary approach and indicators of trainee satisfaction and perceived benefit of the program. This program will create a cadre of well-trained interdisciplinary researchers focusing on HIV prevention, a priority for both the institution and the National HIV program, whose specific research skills will be crucial in identifying means of optimally implementing current and future HIV prevention strategies."
"9430754","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tumor Necrosis Factor-? (TNF) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling play key roles in coordinating immune responses, by driving the transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes. However, it has long been recognized that they can also trigger apoptotic cell death. More recently, it has been shown that these signals can also induce another form of programmed cell death, called necroptosis. While the discovery of necroptosis has generated considerable interest, the physiological role of this alternate cell death program remains elusive. In particular, necroptosis is blocked by the pro-apoptotic protease caspase-8, so most studies rely on genetic ablation or chemical inhibition of caspase-8 to trigger necroptosis. This raises a question: when does TNF or TLR-mediated necroptosis occur under physiological conditions? We have shown that caspase-8 must act in concert with its paralog FLIP to block necroptosis, and FLIP is potently up-regulated by TNF and TLR transcriptional signaling. Many types of infection and stress lead to inhibition of inflammatory signaling or general inhibition of protein synthesis. We therefore propose that the absence of FLIP-rather than inhibition of caspase-8-provides a general mechanism for cellular sensitization to necroptosis. We further hypothesize that necroptosis is itself inflammatory, because cells dying by necroptosis release damage- associated signaling molecules that activate immune cells. To address this possibility, we will focus on three specific questions: 1) How is the pro-necroptotic kinase RIPK3 activated, and how is this activation suppressed by caspase-8/FLIP? We have created a system in which multiple steps of RIPK3 can be controlled. We will use this system to test the hypothesis that RIPK3 activation requires phosphorylation- dependent assembly and propagation of a RIPK3 oligomer, and that caspase-8/FLIP directly blocks this process. 2) How is suppression of caspase-8/FLIP relieved to allow necroptosis under physiological conditions? We hypothesize that inhibitors of NF-kB signaling, or of general protein translation, sensitize cells to necroptosis by preventing FLIP expression. We will test this model in multiple cell types using pathologically relevant models of bacterial and viral infection, as well as ER stress. We will also consider how FLIP levels are controlled at both mRNA and protein levels. 3) How does the immune system respond to necroptotic vs. apoptotic cell death? We hypothesize that the mechanism by which a cell dies is important, because necroptosis releases inflammatory molecules that are contained or eliminated during apoptosis. To test this idea, we have created a system that allows us to trigger apoptosis or necroptosis using a non-toxic drug. We will use this system to analyze innate and adaptive immune responses to cell death. Together, the work proposed here seeks to understand the causes and consequences of necroptosis in vivo, and to thereby allow rational design of therapies that manipulate this process in infection, autoimmune disease, and cancer."
"9309564","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT In demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Periventricular Leukomalacia associated with Cerebral Palsy (CP), myelin sheaths are lost through injury or death of oligodendrocytes (OL). Remyelination by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) is considered crucial to recovery, but myelin repair often fails contributing significantly to ongoing neurological dysfunction, axonal loss and disease progression. There are currently no therapies to promote remyelination, and one of the greatest unmet needs is gaining a greater understanding of the obstacles to successful myelin repair. Remyelination can be divided into two critical stages: Firstly (1) recruitment of migrating OPCs into areas of demyelination from surrounding normal appearing white matter followed by (2) their differentiation into mature OL within the lesion. We have recently identified that OPCs migrate during their developmental dispersal around the CNS using vasculature as a physical scaffold for motility (Science 351, 379 (2016)). This requires movement along vessels, but also subsequent detachment from vasculature after migration to allow OPC differentiation. The mechanism of migration of OPCs into remyelinating lesions, critical for successful myelin repair, remains largely unclear. This grant will (1) identify for the first time how OPCs are recruited into remyelinating lesions utilizing vasculature as a physical scaffold for motility. It will (2) demonstrate that failure of OPCs to detach from vasculature appropriately is a pathological finding in human white matter injury. It will identify this inability to detach not only as a mechanism preventing their proper distribution into lesions but also as an obstacle for subsequent OPC differentiation. (3) It will show that OPCs remaining inappropriately attached to vessels interfere with astrocyte-vascular coupling and integrity of the blood brain barrier that may contribute further to lesion pathology."
"9214324","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early diagnosis of breast cancer is critical for favorable clinical outcomes. Many traditional imaging methods have suboptimal sensitivity for breast cancer detection, particularly in women with dense breasts. Methods with high sensitivity, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suffer from low specificity rates, resulting in unnecessary biopsies. In normal clinical practice, majority of biopsy cases turn out to be false positives, leading to unnecessary biopsies. Undergoing biopsy for benign disease can result in significant cost and great emotional distress. Any reduction in false positives can be significant in terms of patient care, and healthcare cost. It is, therefore, important to develop new low-cost breast imaging techniques with high sensitivity and specificity. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an ultrasound-based breast imaging technique to improve the diagnostic specificity in breast cancer. To improve the specificity, one needs to measure a parameter of tissue that is highly correlated to tissue pathology. One such parameter for breast is the shear elastic modulus. To date, several methods have been developed for mapping the shear elasticity of tissue. In almost all cases, these methods are based on the assumption of plane shear wave propagation in tissue. However, this assumption can be violated in the complex structure of biological soft tissues, leading to errors in elasticity estimation and image artifacts, which may produce false positives or false negatives. For this reason, developing an elasticity mapping technique that does not rely on this assumption is of significant value. The short-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a new method for viscoelasticity imaging of breast that can work with any type of wave, and not restricted to plane shear waves. The proposed method, called radiation force computed elastography (RFCE), produces quantitative map of tissue viscoelasticity. This method uses ultrasound radiation force (URF) to induce a vibration in tissue, and then measures the resulting motion. Such motion does not have to be a plane shear wave or any other particular wave mode. RFCE is anticipated to produce more reliable and accurate results than other viscoelasticity imaging methods that are based on the assumption of plane shear wave. RFCE treats viscoelasticity estimation as a stochastic problem, a robust approach when conditions are not well defined. Goal of this project are achieved in 3 Specific Aims: (1) Extension and implementation of a novel computational inverse problem framework to viscoelasticity mapping using URF, (2) Validation of the inverse problem framework using laboratory phantoms and tissue samples, and (3) Pilot Studies- Estimation of viscoelastic parameters of masses in human breast. The first Aim is focused on developing the computational method for estimating viscoelasticity map of the object from motion data. The second aim optimizes RFCE on phantoms and tissue sample and prepares it for the human study in the third aim. Aim 3 is focused on evaluating the performance of RFCE in identifying masses in breast in clinical settings. Successful completion of this project will have a significan impact in breast cancer imaging."
"9224400","Myelin formation and maintenance is vital for proper neuronal communication and its disruption is associated with numerous diseases of the central nervous system. Oligodendrocytes make myelin and are the only cells in the adult cerebral cortex that are continuously generated from a population of resident progenitors, called NG2 cells. Thus, protracted oligodendrocyte and myelin formation into adulthood constitutes a unique, understudied system for adult neuroplasticity, with broad implications for human cognition and disease. Understanding the process of oligodendrocyte generation is fundamental to dissect roles played by oligodendrocytes and myelination in nervous system function, plasticity, and disease. We have a rudimentary understanding of how new oligodendrocytes are generated in vivo. Reasons for this stem from inadequate tools for their dynamic investigation in the live brain. In light of these challenges, my long-term goals are to develop and apply optical and single cell molecular based approaches to dissect multicellular interactions in the intact developing and diseased nervous system, with a primary focus on the interface between the axon and oligodendrocyte. Realization of this goal has begun as we have now developed a range of novel complementary tools that allow unprecedented detailed investigation into the transformation of single progenitor cells into gap junction-coupled, mature myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo. This proposal will implement and expand on these tools to ask several fundamental questions basic to our understanding of adult nervous system plasticity and response to injury. First, during the K99 phase, the in vivo dynamics of oligodendrocyte differentiation, gap junction coupling and internode assembly during initial myelin formation and after a demyelinating event will be determined. Next, a new method will be used to determine the developmental profile, longitudinal dynamics, and effects of demyelination on internode and Node of Ranvier assembly and distribution along extensive stretches of single axons. Finally, during the R00 phase, using a powerful combination of in vivo imaging and single cell molecular manipulation techniques learned during the K99 training period, the effects of myelin deposition on dynamic axonal structural plasticity will be tested. Overall the research portions of this proposal will uncover how functional internodes initially form, restructure throughout life, respond to oligodendrocyte death, and interact with the axon to influence its structural plasticity, all for the first time in the live brain. The aims set out in this proposal will provide the foundation for implementing these in vivo optical tools during the R00 phase. Furthermore this strategy will provide fundamental training in novel approaches for molecular design with unique intellectual, professional and academic guidance during the K99 phase under the mentorship of Dr. Jaime Grutzendler in collaboration with consultant Dr. Anthony Koleske and the vibrant neuroscience research environment at Yale University. The combination of learning a new set of molecular approaches and implementing our powerful in vivo imaging platform will ensure a unique skillset and perspective, critical components for a successful career as an independent investigator."
"9331794","Project Summary/Abstract  The assembly and trafficking of neurotropic alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV), are extremely complex processes. DNA-packaged capsids must be exported from the infected cell nucleus, recruit molecular motors then move along microtubules to reach their site of envelope formation in the cytoplasm. After docking to the surface of organelles such as the trans Golgi network capsids interact with multiple viral structural proteins and the cellular ESCRT machinery to undergo envelopment. The resulting egress compartments, containing mature enveloped virions in their lumen, then recruit molecular motors and use microtubules to deliver their cargo of virions to the cell surface. Envelopment and trafficking is critical for viral infectivity and spread between cells, tissues and individuals; microtubule- directed transport is particularly dramatic in neurons, where viral particles must move very great distances within axons.  Despite their importance for the spread of disease the molecular details of envelope assembly and motor recruitment are poorly understood. Central to both events is the conserved herpesvirus tegument protein UL36p (VP1/2). UL36p is essential for envelopment, and is also thought to recruit molecular motors to capsids and enveloped particles. In this proposal we explore the role of UL36p in each of these processes for both HSV-1 and PRV. Our approach combines reductionist in vitro biochemistry with fluorescence and ultrastructural microscopy, and imaging of virus assembly and movement ex vivo in living explanted neurons.  To study the function of UL36p in assembly: We will explore the role of UL36p in export of capsids from the nucleus, docking to organelles and recruitment of the cellular ESCRT apparatus to the envelopment site. We also use quantitative fluorescence microscopy, in concert with correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), to probe the ultrastructure of HSV-1 and PRV envelopment organelles,  To test the role of UL36p kinesin-binding sites in trafficking: We have identified motifs within UL36p that mediate attachment to kinesin I. We will test the importance of these binding sites for the motility of capsids and enveloped virions. To facilitate molecular and ultrastructural analysis we use an in vitro cell-free system that reconstitutes HSV-1 and PRV traffic along microtubules in a microscopic imaging chamber. In parallel we will image trafficking of naked and enveloped wild type and mutant viruses in the cell bodies and axons of sensory neuron explants cultured ex vivo."
"9229498","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hippocampal neurogenesis is implicated in regulation of plasticity, learning and memory and experience in novel environments. However, the role of neurogenesis in learning and memory deficits and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of memory and cognitive decline, is not fully elucidated. We have shown that hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired early in life in animal models of Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Deficits in neurogenesis precede onset of hallmarks and onset of learning and memory impairments, suggesting that defective neurogenesis may play a role in the development of cognitive decline. In addition, we have shown that experience of mice in environmental enrichment rescues impaired neurogenesis and attenuate neuropathology. However, it is not clear whether impairments in neurogenesis in AD are causative and whether up regulation of neurogenesis would rescue cognitive deficits. To address that, we generated mouse models, in which neurogenesis is regulatable. Specifically, ablation of neurogenesis in APPswe/PS1?E9 was achieved by ganciclovir-induced depletion of neural progenitor cells expressing a modified version of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (APPswePS1?E9/nestin-?-HSV-TK mice). Enhancement of neurogenesis in APPswe/PS1?E9 mice was achieved by tamoxifen-induced ablation of Bax in neural progenitor cells (APPswePS1?E9/nestin-CreERT2/Baxlox/lox mice). In a preliminary study we show that ganciclovir-treated APPswePS1?E9/nestin-?-HSV-TK mice exhibit significantly reduced extent of neurogenesis accompanied by deficits in contextual encoding, pattern separation and novel object recognition, as early as three months of age. Intriguingly, we observed more amyloid deposition in the hippocampus of these mice compared to vehicle-treated APPswePS1?E9/nestin-?-HSV-TK or APPswePS1?E9 mice. Taken together, these observations suggest the hypothesis that impaired hippocampal neurogenesis plays a key role in the development of cognitive deficits and neuropathology in AD, and that enhancement of neurogenesis would restore these deficits. Experiments will determine the effect of loss or gain of neurogenesis in FAD mice on extent of proliferation, survival and cell fate determination of hippocampal neural progenitor cells and new neurons (Specific Aim 1), progression of neuropathology (Specific Aim 2) and learning and memory (Specific Aim 3). In Specific Aim 4 we will examine the association between extent of neurogenesis, level of cognitive function and neuropathology in human brain tissue of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD patients. These experiments will determine the role of neurogenesis in AD and lead to the development of neurogenesis-based treatment of cognitive deficits in the disease."
"9333598","Project Summary  DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) are oncogenic drivers for many types of human cancer. For some cancers, e.g. certain ovarian, breast and endometrial cancers, it is very likely that CNAs, comprise the bulk of genetic alterations responsible for their highly malignant properties. CNAs may also be responsible for driving squamous carcinoma of the lung and for subsets of gastric and esophageal cancers. Relatively little attention is being paid to understanding this class of genetic alterations. More importantly, from a cancer treatment perspective, there is no roadmap for determining whether they induce selective dependencies that could be utilized for developing new therapeutics.  As our group and others have discovered in the past several years, the vast majority of CNAs contain multiple driver genes, and this makes it considerably more difficult to study how they impact cancer progression compared to single-gene events. The overall goal of this project is to develop new tools and models to investigate multigenic CNAs so that they can be more readily studied and utilized in developing new therapeutics. In Aim 1, we will combine CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre-Lox genome engineering to accurately model multigenic CNAs and determine how they impact oncogenic phenotypes in normal mammary epithelial cells, similar to how mutations in single-gene alterations such as PIK3CA are currently studied. Once we have validated these new cell models, we will screen for induced dependencies. In Aim 2, we will develop and implement computational methods to extract information about specific CNAs from the warehouse of information present in large-scale integrated cancer genome datasets. We have extensive preliminary results that validate this approach, including the prediction of CNA-selective dependencies. Lastly, to truly understand how multigenic CNAs play a role in cancer, we must functionally probe the interactions between multiple drivers. We previously demonstrated that these interactions were key features of the oncogenicity of the 14q13 amplicon in lung cancer and 11q13 amplicon in liver cancer. Thus, our final goal is to develop and implement generalizable methods to study genetic interactions between multiple drivers (Aim 3).  Our proposal is based on the premise that CNAs are important drivers in cancer but that the current research approach needs to be improved. The clinical effectiveness of targeted treatments for patients with HER2-amplified breast cancers underscores the enormous translational potential of CNAs. By developing the tools and models for CNAs described in this proposal, we will make a significant impact on understanding multigenic CNAs and will lay the groundwork for identifying associated dependencies and therapeutic strategies."
"9223983","PROJECT SUMMARY The broad aim of this proposal is to determine if any of several proposed methods to quantify biological aging in humans are promising for use in trials of interventions to increase healthy lifespan. The biological process of aging is thought to drive risk for many disabling health conditions and mortality. There is evidence that trajectories of aging begin to diverge as early in life as young adulthood. If this process can be measured, it will speed development of interventions to prevent disease and disability and prolong healthy life. One measurement approach is to calculate a ?biological age.? In contrast to a person's chronological age, which counts time since birth, a person's biological age reflects the condition of their body and mind relative to their peers. For example a 30-year-old person with the body and mind of an average 50-year-old would have a biological age of 50. Interventions shown to reduce biological age or slow its increase would thus be strong candidates for increasing healthy lifespan. But in order to identify such interventions, measures of biological age are needed. Several algorithms have been proposed to calculate a person's biological age from panels of clinical biomarkers and whole-genome data on blood DNA methylation and RNA expression. These algorithms represent highly-scaleable methods ideal for implementation in intervention trials. But a critical knowledge gap is whether the algorithms actually measure the process of biological aging that, if modified, would extend healthy lifespan. The research proposed in this application aims to fill that knowledge gap by implementing and testing five of the most promising algorithms in an already-created database, the Dunedin Study. The Dunedin Study follows a population-representative birth cohort now in it's fifth decade of life. The database includes genome-wide DNA-methylation, RNA-expression, SNP, and clinical biomarker data on 954 individuals along with extensive physical and cognitive function testing. Research aims will test if the different algorithms measure a common process of biological aging that drives disease and disability. Studying all of the algorithms together in a young, still-healthy cohort followed over time will answer three questions: 1) Are the different algorithms related to one another, i.e. do they measure the same thing? 2) Can they measure changes occurring in young adults as their trajectories of aging begin to diverge ? the time interventions would likely have their greatest benefit? and 3) Do they measure real-life experiences of health decline in aging ? deficits in physical and cognitive functions and subjective perceptions of aging? Results will inform which, if any, of the proposed biological aging algorithms show promise for implementation in intervention trials. This could lead immediately to their implementation in archived biospecimens from completed trials. Results will also inform future approaches to developing measures of biological aging by identifying what works and what doesn't."
"9332905","Glioblastomas (GBMs) are among the most deadly cancers known, with only limited improvements in treatment outcomes despite extensive efforts. GBMs exhibit resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, irradiation and other cell death inducers, colonize brain tissue far removed from the tumor's primary origin, and exhibit intrinsic intra-tumor heterogeneity, the presence of a robust tumor initiating cell (TIC) compartment and multiple other obstacles to treatment. Still a further significant challenge in developing effective GBM treatments is that normal CNS progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes are more vulnerable to most anticancer therapies than are cancer cells themselves. Adverse neurological side effects of cancer treatment are increasingly recognized as important problems, thus emphasizing the importance of developing treatments that are selectively toxic for transformed cells. While some new therapies offer benefit to a subset of individuals, with ongoing efforts to better identify such individuals in advance, most GBM patients remain without effective treatment. Thus, development of therapies that can overcome the multiple mechanisms of therapeutic resistance of GBM cells without causing unacceptable toxicity to normal cells of the CNS is thus a central need in this field.  The central hypotheses of this research are that (i) restoring the ability to activate the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase in GBM cells, and in particular using a non-canonical oxidation pathway to activate c-Cbl, enables targeting of multiple critical regulators of GBM cells with a single therapeutic intervention; (ii) agents that restore c-Cbl function in GBM cells can be identified by mechanism-based drug repurposing; (iii) c-Cbl restoration therapies provide a foundation for rational combinatorial treatments that are more toxic for GBM cells than for normal glial progenitors; (iv) this approach provides clinically relevant therapies that re effective in treating established human GBMs growing intra-cranially in immune-deficient NSG mice; and (v) it is possible to prospectively identify GBMs that are likely to respond to specific therapies developed in this research. Preliminary data to support each of these hypotheses is provided,  To further develop this promising avenue of investigation, we now propose the following aims: Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that candidate CRAs (of which we thus far have ten) increase sensitivity to compounds relevant to GBM treatment, enable simultaneous targeting of multiple proteins and biological activities critical in GBM cell function and tumor generation and achieves these outcomes without increasing the sensitivity of normal glial progenitor cells to relevant therapeutic agents. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that CRA-based therapies enable effective treatment of human GBMs, growing in immunodeficient mice, in a clinically relevant manner. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that the presence of complexes between c-Cbl and Cool-1/-pix predicts sensitivity to our CRA-based therapies, thus potentially enabling prospective identification of tumors most likely to be responsive to these approaches."
"9241997","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood hearing loss disrupts central processing of spectral and temporal cues, and may contribute to perceptual deficits, including impaired speech and language processing. Though difficulties can persist even after normal auditory input is restored, earlier restoration is correlated with superior recovery. These findings suggest that there is a critical period of development during which the neural mechanisms subserving auditory processing are particularly vulnerable to sensory perturbations. The key goal of this proposal is to determine whether a brief period of developmental hearing loss disrupts the neural and perceptual detection of amplitude modulation (AM), a temporal cue necessary for speech comprehension and non-human animal communication. The core hypothesis is that transient hearing loss during a critical period disrupts the neural encoding of AM stimuli, thereby producing a perceptual impairment that persists after normal peripheral function is restored. This hypothesis will be explored in detail, with two experimental aims. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether there is a critical period during which temporary hearing loss impairs subsequent AM detection. Sound attenuation will be induced by the insertion of bilateral earplugs at various postnatal ages. After a period of restored auditory input (via earplug removal), animals will be trained and tested on an aversive conditioning paradigm designed to assess amplitude modulation detection capabilities. Behavioral performance will be quantified by calculating correct responses and false alarms. Detection thresholds will be estimated from psychometric functions and compared between earplug-reared animals and normally-reared littermates. These measures will reveal whether there is a critical period during which the maturation of AM detection is sensitive to hearing loss. Specific Aim 2 will examine the impact of temporary, developmental hearing loss on central sensory encoding in auditory cortex of awake-behaving animals performing the AM detection task described in Aim 1. Multi- and single-unit responses will be recorded wirelessly from chronically implanted electrode arrays in left auditory cortex. AM-evoked firing rates and power will be calculated and used to calculate neurometric curves that can be directly compared to behavioral psychometric functions. Additional analyses will assess the relationship between behavior and neural activity on trial-by-trial basis. Results will be compared between earplug-reared and normally-reared animals. The results of this experiment will elucidate whether behavioral deficits arising from developmental hearing loss can be explained by disrupted sensory coding, as is generally assumed, or whether non-sensory (e.g. cognitive) factors contribute to perceptual dysfunction. Together, these findings will reveal whether there is a discrete developmental critical period for the neural representation and perceptual detection of AM. Ultimately, these results may further our understanding of speech and language delays associated with childhood hearing loss, a goal directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD."

"9270037","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Resource Project Discovering the functions of the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome is a required step for understanding human biology and disease. Genetic model organisms, including zebrafish, play a critical role in this discovery process, because genetic analysis can connect gene sequence and function. Model organism databases, like ZFIN, provide tools required to make this connection.  The zebrafish has emerged as a premier organism to study vertebrate biology. Powerful techniques allow rapid efficient generation and recovery of mutations affecting genes that orchestrate developmental patterning, organogenesis, physiology, and behavior. It is easy to study gene function by generating transgenic zebrafish, by knocking down gene function with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, or by altering gene function by genome editing. The genome has been sequenced and about 50% of the protein coding genes have been mutated by targeted gene knockout technology. Large-scale projects are underway or planned that will produce functional data about almost all the genes and sequence-based functional elements in the genome. Multiple mutations and gene knockdowns can be combined in the same individual to study gene modifiers and other genetic interactions. The functions of most of these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups. Thus, analysis of zebrafish mutations provides insights into gene functions in other vertebrates, including humans.  The long term goals for ZFIN are a) to be the community database resource for the laboratory use of zebrafish, b) to develop and support integrated zebrafish genetic, genomic, developmental, and physiological information, c) to maintain the definitive reference data sets of zebrafish research information, d) to link this information extensively to corresponding data in other model organism and human databases, e) to facilitate the use of zebrafish as a model for human biology, and f) to help serve the broad needs of the biomedical research community.  In this part of the project, we will curate and integrate zebrafish research data into the ZFIN database and link them to human biology and disease, and we will develop maintain the zebrafish reference genome and provide ongoing annotation. We will also continue to improve zebrafish gene models."
"9221330","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the major cause of visual impairment and blindness in persons > 65 years in the United States and the 3rd leading cause of blindness worldwide. Several lines of evidence have implicated immune activation and inflammation in the pathogenesis of AMD, including biomarkers of systemic inflammation as risk factors for AMD, complement deposition in drusen, complement factor and chemokine genetic polymorphisms as risk factors for AMD, and circulating activated monocytes in patients with AMD. Antiretroviral (ART) -treated, immunorestored, HIV-infected patients have accelerated/accentuated aging and a shortened life span due to age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes. Immunorestored, HIV-infected persons have immune system changes similar to those of >70 year-old HIV- uninfected persons, known as immunosenescence. Enrollment data from the Longitudinal Study of the Ocular Complications of AIDS (LSOCA) cohort show a ~4-fold greater prevalence (prevalence ~10%) of intermediate- stage AMD vs. that seen in an age-matched, HIV-uninfected cohort. LSOCA has enrolled 2092 participants with AIDS, has medical and treatment data, cryopreserved plasma and blood leukocyte specimens in a specimen repository from enrollment and every-6-month follow-up visits, and has an archive of 5- and 10-year follow-up retinal photographs, which will be graded at a Reading Center for incident AMD. Cryopreserved blood specimens will be evaluated for evidence of inflammation, immune (particularly monocyte) activation, and immunosenescence markers as risk factors for both prevalent and incident AMD, using a nested case-control design. Pathways and markers will be those known to be operative in both ART-treated, HIV infected persons, and in HIV-uninfected older persons. Biomarkers and pathways identified as relevant to AMD in the LSOCA cohort will be evaluated in cryopreserved specimens from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) cohort. These studies will lead to an improved understanding of the roles of inflammation, immune activation, and immunosenescence in the pathogenesis of AMD."
"9234011","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project assesses associations between ambient air pollution exposures and vascular phenomena, integrating air pollution epidemiology, exposure assessment, and applied statistical techniques. The proposal aims to further understanding of the patterns and biologic mechanisms underlying the relationship between air pollution and cardiovascular disease. This project will investigate acute and chronic effects of ai pollution on cellular adhesion molecules and on the microvasculature, as measured via retinal photographs. This research utilizes a large, existing, multi-center US cohort with well-characterized health measures and state-of-the-art air pollution exposure predictions. Design of the study allows assessment of microvasculature longitudinally as well as characterization the interrelationship between air pollution exposure, microvascular changes, adhesion molecules, and cardiovascular events via mediation analysis (causal modeling).

"9290021","The goal of our proposal is to determine the role of the master regulatory cytokine, Interleukin 10 (IL10), in regulating proteostasis in mouse models of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) in an Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoform dependent manner. Our proposal addresses two key questions that are relevant to understanding of AD pathogenesis: (1) how does immune pathways interact with and modulate the function of AD risk genes, such as APOE and (2) can we harness this knowledge to disrupt the IL-10/APOE axis and achieve therapeutic benefits in AD-relevant mouse models? Our preliminary data has shown that the anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin (IL)-10, has unexpected negative effect on A? and tau proteostasis in transgenic mouse models of AD. This demonstrates a complex interplay between innate immunity and proteostasis in AD type neurodegenerative diseases, an interaction we call immunoproteostasis. The mechanism(s) underlying such immunoproteostasis leading to neurodegenerative pathology in AD remain unknown; studying the mechanisms underlying immunoproteostasis can enable us to design immunobiotherapies targeting such signaling pathways. We have observed that overexpression of IL-10 in APP transgenic mice worsens A? plaque pathology and cognitive functions via an ApoE-dependent mechanism. Mechanistically, we could attribute the negative effects of IL-10 on A? proteostasis to synergistic effects of decreased A? phagocytosis by microglia, increased endogenous ApoE expression and enhanced accumulation of ApoE in insoluble amyloid plaques. In our study, the increased level of insoluble ApoE was plaque-associated, consistent with mouse ApoE functioning as a pathological chaperone for A? aggregates. Blocking IL-10 signaling using the soluble decoy receptor against IL-10 abrogated this effect and reduced brain amyloid plaque burden. We observed similar ApoE dependent effects on tau proteostasis following IL-10 overexpression in two independent mouse models of tauopathy. Essentially, IL-10 accelerated tauopathy and reduced time to survival in JNPL3 mice; it also promoted forebrain neurodegeneration and tauopathy in the rTg4510 mice. While this was an unexpected phenotype, we provide preliminary data that ApoE specifically interacts with fibrillar tau in a cell free system, which could partially explain the proteostasis, though other mechanisms, such as autophagy inhibition also need to be considered. Guided by these robust preliminary data, we will undertake the following specific aims: Aim 1. Assess whether APOE genotype affects IL10-induced proteostasis in APP mice and evaluate whether interaction of human APOE isoforms with A? aggregates alters microglial clearance of insoluble A?. We will test the effects of IL- 10 immunoproteostasis on amyloid plaque deposition in an APP transgenic mouse expressing human APOE protein (2 or 3 or 4) and provide mechanistic insights into APOE-dependent microglial uptake and clearance of aggregated A?. We expect that promoting expression of the protective APOE2 isoform will have beneficial effects while APOE4 induction will have harmful effects. Aim2. Determine the effects of an AAV-delivered soluble IL-10 receptor decoy (sIL10R1) strategy in APP, tau and non- transgenic mice. Given that IL-10 worsens proteostasis and AD-relevant phenotype in mouse models of A? and tau, herein, we will test the efficacy of a decoy receptor strategy against IL-10. By blocking IL-10 signaling, we expect the decoy receptor strategy to be a potentially translatable disease modifying therapy against both A? and tau proteostasis. Aim3. Replicate and extend our studies of IL-10 overexpression as a driver of tau pathology. Herein, using the AAV toolkit, and systems biology approach, we propose to reproduce our observations of IL-10/APOE-dependent proteostasis phenotype in a well-controlled and behaviorally-characterized tau transgenic cohort and further provide insights into possible mechanisms underlying such amyloidogenic properties of the IL-10/APOE axis. The strength of this proposal lies in the teamwork between a new investigator with continuing commitment to studying the neuroimmune axis in mouse models of AD and an established investigator with experience in creating transgenic AD mouse models. We expect that this proposal will enhance our knowledge of the complex immune signaling cascades in AD proteostasis and uncover translatable immune decoy receptor strategies targeting APOE-regulated proteostasis."
"9341882","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the lung plays a key role in allergic asthmatic inflammation. Asthmatic patients also exhibit elevated serum IgE levels, which may re-equilibrate with the lung IgE pool or enhance IgE-mediated allergic asthma. A seminal finding of IgE downregulation by active IgE immunization was first reported in our lab. This led to the product concept of the mAb omalizumab, and a subsequent collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry led to FDA approval of the Xolair. In the proposed project, the native conformation of receptor-binding IgE loops (e.g., the Xolair binding FG loop epitope) are conformationally constrained in a selected thermostable b-strand pair (dubbed super-b strands) and then fused to an immunogenic and thermostable protein scaffold as a bifunctional vaccine. The use of Imiquimod(IMQ, 3M, Inc.) through a safe transcutaneous route of administration, followed by vaccine IN challenge in saline, ensures that mucosal IgA and IgG subclass anti-IgE antibodies target asthmogenic lung IgE as well as the removal of serum IgE by systemic anti-IgE antibodies. This specific targeting improves safety, and is unlikely to cause type 2 hypersensitivity or chronic urticaria. In the absence of a vaccine reboost, emerging anti-IgE producing B-cells are naturally tolerized by the endogenous self-IgE recovered during the rest period as another safety feature. A ?just-in-time? vaccine reboost is required to break self-IgE tolerance to protect against allergen re-exposure. The lack of persistent IgE suppression preserves IgE competence for parasitic defenses. Our three aims are: Aim 1: Study immunogenicity of human FG supersite vaccine in rodents: location, duration, and efficacies. Aim 2: Evaluate therapeutic vaccination in alleviating IgE-mediated asthmatic inflammation and AHR in rodent models. Aim 3: Evaluate therapeutic vaccination in alleviating IgE-mediated asthmatic inflammation and AHR in rhesus macaques."
"9295309","Project Summary/Abstract The United States is in the midst of an obesity epidemic, with over a third of U.S. women of childbearing age being obese (BMI?30 kg/m2). Obesity in this country reflects an ethnic disparity, with non-Hispanic African-American women being nearly twice as likely as white women to be obese. Obese women are at particular risk to end their full-term pregnancies with unplanned cesarean delivery, in large part due to their abnormally slow labors. African-American race confers the highest risk for unplanned cesarean in analyses adjusting for maternal BMI, labor complications, labor interventions, and neonatal size. When obese women have cesarean delivery, they are more likely than normal-weight women to experience significant post-cesarean morbidity and mortality. In vitro research investigating myometrial contractility suggests that the cellular metabolic milieu of obesity may account for the decreased contractile efficiency in labor, longer labor duration, and decreased response to commonly-used interventions like oxytocin infusion that are seen in clinical investigations of obese women. Gaps exist in our understanding of the mechanisms or pathways that link slow labor progress, synthetic oxytocin response, and obesity to risk for unplanned cesarean delivery. The proposed study will investigate the metabolomic profiles that differentiate between obese, African-American women with slow labor progress vs. normal labor progress (Aim 1), and oxytocin sensitivity vs. insensitivity (Aim 2). We plan a nested case-control study of 124 term, obese, African-American women to identify metabolomic profiles activated in serum collected during the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy from subjects participating in a prospective 5-year study of preterm birth and the microbiome. Detailed chart-review will be performed on the hospital records of obese, term, healthy women achieving active phase labor with singleton, vertex fetus to identify cases and controls for metabolomic comparisons. Differential analysis will then be used to compare metabolite features between groups. The proposed research study and mentored research scientist career development plan are congruent with the applicant?s long-term research goals to understand the biobehavioral determinants and effective intrapartum care management strategies for obese women in order to decrease the incidence of cesarean delivery, its short and long-term adverse consequences, and the cost of healthcare for obese childbearing women. Specific career development goals included in this plan are: 1) developing skills and knowledge in metabolomics research to examine obesity in pregnancy, 2) gain methodological skills in bioinformatics and advanced statistics used in metabolomics investigations, and 3) enhance and refine research skills and program of research to position career as an independent investigator. Results obtained from this study will inform future research and promote new understanding of effective care practices for nurses, nurse-midwives, and physicians as they support the vulnerable population of obese, African-American women through labor to a safe birth outcome."
"9270034","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Discovering the functions of the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome is a required step for understanding human biology and disease. Genetic model organisms, including zebrafish, play a critical role in this discovery process, because genetic analysis can connect gene sequence and function. Model organism databases, like ZFIN, provide tools required to make this connection.             The zebrafish has emerged as a premier organism to study vertebrate biology. Powerful techniques allow rapid efficient generation and recovery of mutations affecting genes that orchestrate developmental patterning, organogenesis, physiology, and behavior. It is easy to study gene function by generating transgenic zebrafish, by knocking down gene function with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, or by altering gene function by genome editing. The genome has been sequenced and about 50% of the protein coding genes have been mutated by targeted gene knockout technology. Large-scale projects are underway or planned that will produce functional data about almost all the genes and sequence-based functional elements in the genome. Multiple mutations and gene knockdowns can be combined in the same individual to study gene modifiers and other genetic interactions. The functions of most of these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups. Thus, analysis of zebrafish mutations provides insights into gene functions in other vertebrates, including humans.             The long term goals for ZFIN are a) to be the community database resource for the laboratory use of zebrafish, b) to develop and support integrated zebrafish genetic, genomic, developmental, and physiological information, c) to maintain the definitive reference data sets of zebrafish research information, d) to link this information extensively to corresponding data in other model organism and human databases, e) to facilitate the use of zebrafish as a model for human biology, and f) to help serve the broad needs of the biomedical research community.  This project will continue and expand curation of zebrafish research data, develop expanded support for zebrafish models of human disease, expand and integrate links to other databases, and maintain and update the zebrafish reference genome. This work will provide a powerful means for researchers to associate gene sequence and function, thus facilitating studies of human gene function and disease as well as cross-species analyses of genome organization and evolution."
"9156301","Abstract Cannabis use is particularly prevalent and problematic amount youth. Compared with only one in eleven cannabis-exposed adults, one in six cannabis-exposed youth develops cannabis use disorder. Moreover, youth are more prone than adults to potentially lasting adverse effects of cannabis use, including cognitive impairment, altered brain development, poor educational outcome, and diminished life achievement. Despite this, relatively little work has focused on developing optimally efficacious cannabis use disorder treatments, particularly among youth. Current evidence-based treatments convey generally small to modest effect sizes, and novel approaches are critically needed. Among the most promising approaches are the over-the-counter antioxidant medication N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and the behavioral treatment contingency management (CM). Our team previously demonstrated superior NAC versus placebo (PBO) abstinence outcomes in youth with CUD who concurrently received CM. Further work is now needed to disentangle the effects of NAC and CM. It is possible that they are synergistic, with their combination being critical to maximizing abstinence outcomes. Alternatively, NAC may be efficacious independent of CM, but this has not been formally evaluated. In order to optimally translate NAC and CM findings to real-world clinical practice, their relative contributions to cessation outcomes must be formally evaluated. We propose a 12-week 2 x 2 factorial design trial of NAC and CM for CUD in youth (N=336). Participants will be randomized to double-blind NAC or PBO and to CM or no CM, yielding four equally-allocated treatment groups: NAC + CM, NAC + No CM, PBO + CM, and PBO + No CM. All participants will receive brief weekly cannabis cessation counseling and medication management. The primary efficacy outcome will be the proportion of negative urine cannabinoid tests during the 12-week active treatment, compared between groups. We will also serially assess cognitive task performance, examining changes in performance among participants who achieve abstinence versus those that do not. This proposed trial is the clear ?next step? in the assessment of NAC and CM as extremely promising youth CUD treatment modalities, and is positioned to inform researchers, clinicians, and the general public, addressing a critical need for optimization of youth CUD treatments."
"9243920","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemotherapy with cytotoxic drugs is successful when these drugs either preferentially kill cancer cells, or preferentially accumulate in tumors compared to other tissues. Yet, neither case holds true for the 52,000 Americans diagnosed last year with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC originates in the mucosal tissues of the head and neck, but it rapidly metastases throughout the cervical lymphatics, which presents a daunting clinical challenge. The cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs used to treat HNSCC have very poor penetration into these lymphatics, and left undertreated the HNSCC will relapse in up to 70% of patients. The primary objective of this work is the synthetic development and biological evaluation of a new polymeric biomaterial for chemotherapy of the head and neck tissues. This innovative approach will perform better than any existing therapy because chemotherapy is delivered directly into prone tissues so delicate organs are not damaged, and this is accomplished with the first nanoparticle system specifically engineered for exceptional drug delivery into cancerous lymph nodes and tissues after peri-tumoral injection. The new biomaterial, star nanoconjugates, can be targeted to HNSCC tumors without expensive and less robust homing ligands, such as antibodies or aptamers. The first aim is to synthesize a library of star nanoconjugates of chemotherapeutics, including both standard-of-care drugs, new nitric oxide-based drugs that synergize with existing drugs, and the first photodynamic nitric oxide treatment. The star nanoconjugates are synthetic sugar-based star polymers that collapse into compact nanoscopic carriers when conjugated to common anticancer drugs. The physiochemical properties of the resulting nanoconjugates can be synthetically tailored for excellent lymphatic uptake and retention, tumor penetration, and sustained drug release within the lymphatics surrounding tumors. In the second aim, fluorescent imaging and radiological tracking of the nanoconjugates and drugs in rodents after locoregional injection will demonstrate the superior delivery of chemotherapy into HNSCC tumors. Subsequently, PET/CT imaging of canines with spontaneous oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) will verify performance of this platform in a more man-like model. Third, the efficacy and safety of HNSCC treatment with star nanoconjugates will be compared to conventional chemotherapy in rodent xenografts of HNSCC. Fourth, a Phase I canine trial in patients with spontaneous oral SCC cancer will demonstrate efficacy and safety in a large animal model. At the end of this study, there will be proof in a large animal, whose disease closely models human HNSCC, that this treatment is both superior in safety and more efficacious than current chemotherapies. Based on extensive preliminary results in rodents and canines, this platform is expected to significantly impact human health by reducing the need for extensive surgery and radiotherapy, treatments that cause permanent disfigurement and reduce quality-of-life, and provide a much safer alternative to systemic chemotherapy that can be administered to even severely weaken and advanced patients."

"9229587","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms leading to decrements in lung function, the physiologic hallmark of obstructive lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are necessary to inform interventions to improve lung health. In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function."
"9278964","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The candidate for this Clinical Science Research and Development Career Development Award (CDA2) is Bharati Prasad, MD, MS, a pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine staff physician at Jesse Brown VAMC. Dr. Prasad's academic appointment is as a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Prasad's long-term career goals are to become an independent physician-scientist developing effective strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diverse populations through interventions that optimize sleep and breathing. To achieve her goals, Dr. Prasad has assembled a comprehensive career development plan and a strong team of mentors with longstanding VA and other federal funding and mentorship experience. Her primary mentor, Frances M. Weaver PhD, is a VA Research Career Scientist and an experienced clinical trialist. Her co- mentors are David W. Carley, PhD (an expert in autonomic derangements associated with Obstructive Sleep Apnea; OSA and developing novel treatment interventions for OSA) and Samuel T. Kuna, MD, with expertise in Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment intervention trials in patients with OSA and an extensive research record in the VA. The proposal also includes a multidisciplinary team of collaborators with expertise in the areas of measurement of biomarkers key to the pathogenesis of hypertension in OSA, genetic ancestry in biomedical research, early non-invasive assessment of vascular dysfunction, and longitudinal data analyses. The proposal leverages the extensive research and clinical resources at Jesse Brown VAMC, including a large pool of diverse Veteran populations served. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and hypertension are both common and severe problems in African American individuals (as noted in the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement). CPAP treatment of OSA is effective in controlling hypertension in patients with OSA, but has not been studied in African Americans, a high-risk population with potentially large health gains. This is an area of significance because poorly controlled hypertension leads to progression of CVD and morbidity in this population. By identifying CPAP treatment-response and relevant moderators of this response in African Americans with hypertension and OSA, targeted treatment of OSA can be implemented, reducing the excess burden of CVD. We will determine the relative magnitude of hypertension response to CPAP treatment (ambulatory blood pressure and central aortic blood pressure) in 220 African American and European American Veterans with hypertension and newly diagnosed OSA (specific aim 1). We will measure changes in pathogenic biomarkers (urinary cumulative sympathetic nervous system activity and oxidative stress) that are responsive to CPAP treatment in addition to hypertension assessments. Further, we will examine the role of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), a potentially important moderator of treatment response, in these two patient populations (specific aim 2). Finally, we will adjust our outcomes assessment for the anticipated biological heterogeneity among self-identified African Americans by measuring genetic ancestry (exploratory aim). This award will provide the foundation for the goals of this research program to reduce CVD disparity in diverse populations with targeted treatment of OSA."
"9290597","PROJECT SUMMARY Glioblastomas (GBMs), the most common and deadly primary malignant brain tumors, frequently display mutations that activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the Pi-3 kinase-Akt (PI3K) signaling pathway. Yet, to date, drugs that directly inhibit RTK and/or PI3K signaling have proven ineffective in treatment of GBM. Our research program uses complementary experimental model systems, including patient-derived primary GBM stem cell cultures and novel GBM models in Drosophila melanogaster, to identify and interrogate genetic and cellular processes that underlie glial tumorigenesis. Using our GBM model systems, we identified RIOK2, a highly conserved atypical serine-threonine kinase, and our results revealed that, in GBMs, RIOK2 becomes overexpressed in response to RTK-PI3K signaling to drive tumor cell proliferation and survival, and that RIOK2 knockdown in RTK-PI3K dependent GBM cells inhibits proliferation and elicits apoptosis. Our preliminary data also indicate that, in both Drosophila and human GBM models, inhibition of RIOK2 catalytic activity strongly counteracts RTK-PI3K-driven transformation. In contrast, loss or inhibition of RIOK2 activity in normal human or Drosophila glial progenitor/stem cells does not elicit cell death and does not dramatically affect cell proliferation. Thus, RTK-PI3K mutant tumor cells, but not normal glial cells, are dependent on RIOK2 activity for their growth and survival. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that RIOK2 drives GBM by phosphorylating and activating RNA-binding proteins to promote the translation of oncogenic target mRNAs, and that RIOK2 differentially promotes the growth and survival of GBM cells by stimulating the translation of oncogenic mRNAs that are expressed as a consequence of gliomagenic RTK and PI3K signaling. This proposal focuses two aims designed to Aim 1) Determine the mechanisms of interaction between RIOK2 and its associated RNA-binding proteins, and Aim 2) Determine if RIOK2 activity specifically promotes translation of select target mRNAs in tumor cells. This project may reveal new mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis, and establish a basis for developing RIOK2 inhibitors for potential targeted treatment for GBM."
"9254608","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a group of related neurodevelopmental syndromes defined by social communication deficits and by restricted and repetitive behaviors. The public health burden is enormous, with an estimated cost of $35 billion in the U.S alone. Behavioral approaches are currently the mainstay of treatment; options for somatic therapies remain extremely limited. A new generation of more effective treatments will require a far deeper understanding of the pathobiology of ASD. In addition, while there has been significant recent progress in clarifying the genomic architecture of autism, only a small number of the hundreds of genes and genomic regions thought to be involved in ASD have so far been identified. The current proposal focuses on discovering additional rare recessive mutations leading to autism via the study of consanguineous families from Egypt and Turkey. The project leverages a long-standing collaboration between the Gunel and State labs, which have independently and collectively demonstrated the productivity of homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing for a range of developmental disorders including autism. Our long-term goal is to make use of genetics to identify therapeutic targets in ASD while contributing to translating such findings to clinical practice. Our hypothesis is that th discovery of additional rare recessive, highly penetrant ASD mutations in consanguineous families will advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms; that these will show overlap with the emerging picture of the genetic architecture and biology of idiopathic ASD in outbred populations, and that, combined, these advances will lay the foundation for the development of novel, rational, and more efficacious treatments. Therefore, we focused on 3 specific aims: 1) To expand our current cohort of consanguineous ASD families with an additional 250 carefully diagnosed ASD kindreds from Egypt and Turkey, 2) To identify novel, rare, highly penetrant genetic variants that contribute to ASD by employing homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in 384 ASD subjects and parents; and 3) To search for clustering of these variants among unrelated families as well as to evaluate the overlap in risk loci for inbred versus outbred ASD populations, cross- referencing findings from these Middle Eastern families with data from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), which we have been studying for the past 5 years and to evaluate the identified homozygous variants with reference to ASD-associated developmental co-expression networks using high confidence ASD genes discovered in outbred families. Overall this proposal is aimed at advancing the understanding of the genetics and biology of ASD in the interests of identifying novel approaches to diagnosis, and therapeutic development."
"9322172","PROJECT SUMMARY The holy grail of structural biology, i.e., the simultaneous quantitative determination of a protein?s structure and function, remains very difficult to attain. This application pertains to the development of a new, cutting-edge optical approach that allows the resolution of sub-nanometer-scale distances and distance changes in real time: distance-resolving Voltage Clamp Fluorometry (drVCF). drVCF combines the use of small, spectrally-identical, Cys-attached fluorophores of variable length with Trp-induced collisional quenching. Crucially, fluorophore range and flexibility are accounted for by radial probability density functions (pdfs) generated by fluorophore molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The pdfs are used to simultaneously fit the optical signals of multiple labels and obtain highly constrained distance information immediately relevant to protein structure (from the Trp side-chain to the labeled Cys C? atom). drVCF encompasses the benefits of other optical structural approaches (FRET, LRET, etc.), such as wide applicability and physiologically-relevant experimental conditions; but also distinct advantages, such as (i) the ability to measure intramolecular distances and functionally-relevant distance changes with a very fine grain (<2  measurement error in a preliminary evaluation), practically excluding intersubunit and intermolecular signal contamination (<2.2 nm range); (ii) the acquisition of structural data in real time, allowing the simultaneous tracking of structure and the kinetics of structural change; (iii) the ability to acquire data from conducting channels without large protein adjuncts such as toxin-mounted fluorophores or large fluorescent proteins; (iv) no dependence on fluorophore dipole orientation. As all scientific approaches, drVCF carries assumptions and limitations. In this proposal, the capabilities and limitations of drVCF will be evaluated in established models of structural biology, over three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Validate a New Optical Approach to Measure Functionally-relevant Intramolecular Protein Distances (drVCF) Using Rigid Rod-like Peptides of Known Length. As Stryer and Haugland did to calibrate FRET, drVCF accuracy will be evaluated by measuring the length of rigid polyproline peptides. Aim 2: Validate drVCF in a Well Characterized Soluble Protein of Known Structure. drVCF will be used to measure intramolecular distances in T4 lysozyme, a gold standard in structural biology, to evaluate the applicability of this approach in proteins and its accuracy. Aim 3: Validate drVCF in a Voltage-sensitive Membrane Protein with Known Resting/Active Structures. The voltage-sensing domain of the voltage sensitive phosphatase (Ci-VSP) was recently crystallized in the Resting and Active states. drVCF will be combined with cut-open oocyte voltage clamp to test its ability to measure voltage-dependent distance changes. This approach was developed following highly-encouraging preliminary experiments. The proposed studies may reveal practical pitfalls and limitations, but with them also the opportunity to rectify and refine this highly innovative and potentially ground breaking approach."

"9413645","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This U01 application seeks funds for 3 years to conduct a Phase II clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of the non-selective Beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, compared to placebo, for treatment of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). TMD, one of the most common chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions, is ineffectively treated. Growing evidence suggests that pain states are enhanced by diminished activity of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines), which results in elevated levels of catecholamines and increased activity of Beta 2/3-adrenergic receptors. Three common haplotypes in the COMT gene have been associated with pain modulation and the risk of developing TMD. In a pilot study of TMD patients, we found that analgesic efficacy of propranolol varied according to polymorphisms in the COMT gene. We now propose to conduct a Phase II randomized, masked, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment clinical trial of propranolol (LA 60 mg twice daily). The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of propranolol in reducing pain in TMD patients; a secondary objective will determine if propranolol efficacy varies according to patients' COMT diplotype. We will enroll 200 Caucasian female TMD patients, genotyped for COMT polymorphisms. This trial will consist of a 1-week baseline phase, a 10-week treatment phase, and a 1-week follow-up. The primary endpoint will be a weekly mean pain index, calculated as a product of the pain intensity score multiplied by the pain duration score from a Daily Symptom Diary. Patient pain ratings, responses to heat and pressure stimuli, physical function, emotional function, global improvement, occurrence of symptoms and adverse events, and use of rescue medication will be measured as secondary endpoints. Statistical analysis will evaluate three trial hypotheses: 1) propranolol is efficacious compared with placebo in reducing the pain index, 2) efficacy of propranolol varies according to patients' COMT polymorphism, and 3) propranolol is efficacious in improving secondary endpoints. Continuous measures will be analyzed in the intent-to-treat sample using methods for mixed-model repeated measures, with the baseline scores as covariates. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted with the per-protocol sample. Under an R34 grant, we have created the protocol, informed consent forms, the Manual of Procedures, case report forms, and study plans needed for the proposed clinical trial. The proposed study will generate new evidence about treating pain through previously unexploited pharmacologic targets (e.g., Beta-adrenergic receptors). The study offers potential for a genetically-tailored pharmacogenetic approach for TMD treatment and may explain variability of treatment responses to Beta-blockers when used to treat other diseases."
"9263431","Growing evidence links posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Abnormal sleep is a modifiable behavior that is a known contributor to cardiovascular risk and a hallmark symptom of PTSD. Our preliminary data and data from other labs show that PTSD is associated with profound sleep disturbance and with abnormal autonomic function (dysautonomia) especially at night. We propose a rigorous twin study to test the new paradigm that abnormal sleep is linked in a bidirectional way with nighttime dysautonomia to increase cardiovascular risk in PTSD. We will add comprehensive autonomic and sleep assessments to an ongoing NHLBI-funded twin study of PTSD and ischemic heart disease (IHD), the Emory Twin Study Follow-up (ETSF). The ETSF will re-examine 180 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (360 individuals) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry to reassess PTSD status and cardiac status using positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging. In a previous examination of this sample, we found that twins with PTSD had worse myocardial perfusion and coronary microvascular function compared with twins without PTSD. As part of the proposed ancillary study, we will add both at home and in-lab objective sleep and autonomic monitoring, which will allow for both ?real- world? and controlled psychophysiological assessments. Twins will undergo in-lab polysomnography when on site and will be equipped patches for electrocardiogram monitoring and actigraphy wristbands for sleep monitoring to use at home for 14 days. During their visit, they will be examined in a controlled environment which matches their brothers' and allows for the most controlled analyses of within-pair difference. We will address the following hypotheses: (1) Twins with PTSD will exhibit more disturbed sleep (shorter sleep duration, more sleep fragmentation, and more sleep-disordered breathing) compared with twins without PTSD. (2) Twins with PTSD will exhibit more nocturnal dysautonomia (lower nighttime HRV) compared with twins without PTSD. (3) Disturbed sleep and nighttime dysautonomia will be positively related to quantitative indicators of IHD using PET imaging, including perfusion deficits and lower coronary flow reserve. We will also explore dynamic associations among PTSD, sleep disturbance and dysautonomia in the lab and at home. Our proposed twin study should fill a significant gap in evidence regarding the mechanisms of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. If our hypotheses are met, this study will place abnormal sleep and nighttime altered autonomic function at the forefront as interrelated biobehavioral pathways linking PTSD to IHD. The long-term goal is to provide targets for novel interventions that collectively help reduce IHD risk, sleep disturbance, and PTSD symptom burden."
"9280751","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) constitute a significant and growing percentage of injuries in the veteran population; sequelae of explosions, motor vehicle accidents and falls. TBI is also a major cause of death and disability in the general population of the US, particularly in those under 40. Approximately 2% of the population is living with a chronic TBI-related disability. There are currently no effective protective or restorative therapies available clinically. In severl models of CNS trauma, administration of a neurotrophin (e.g. BDNF, NGF) protects tissues acutely and promotes longer term recovery. However, the neurotrophins are poor drugs as they are labile, exhibit poor CNS penetration and may augment cell death and pain pathways. These properties are due to their polypeptide composition and the stimulation of intersecting signalling pathways through the activation of multiple receptors. These problems may be at least partially circumvented through the use of recently discovered small, stable, non-peptidyl drug-like compounds (designated LM22) that promote neuronal survival through selective interactions with the Trk neurotrophin receptors (LM22A-4 with TrkB and LM22B-10 with TrkB and TrkC). The compounds inhibit neuronal death, promote neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and augment functional and morphologic neuroplasticity. We hypothesize that the LM22 compounds will: increase neural progenitor survival and differentiation through distinct mechanisms involving activation of specific Trk-coupled survival and differentiative signalling pathways; that increasing TrkB signaling following TBI will promote early neuronal and neural progenitor survival and longer term plasticity, with effects on neuronal processes and spines; that activation of TrkB and TrkC together will be more effective than either alone, and; that while the compounds should improve behavioral outcomes, prolonged or excessive increased plasticity may be detrimental. Specific Aims are to: 1. Determine LM22 compound effects on hippocampal progenitors in vitro: A) Examine the effects of LM22A-4 and LM22B-10 on proliferation, survival, neuro- and/or gliogenic differentiation and morphology of hippocampal neural progenitor cells in vitro, in comparison with neurotrophin protein ligands; B) determine the Trk specificity of the compounds for these effects using selectively inhibitable tyrosine kinase mutants of TrkB, TrkC or both receptors and; C) determine the role of PI3K/AKT, ERKs 1, 2 and 5, PLC?, miRNA9 and NRSF/REST in compound effects, using selective chemical inhibitors, miRNA-mediated downregulation and viral construct-mediated enforced expression; 2. Determine LM22 compound effects on cellular responses relative to dose and timing of administration in the rat controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI: assess A) neuronal and neural progenitor cell death; B) Trk activation and downstream signaling; C) neuro/gliogenesis and neuronal morphology and; D) inflammation, and; 3. Determine LM22 compound effects on behavior following rat CCI: Examine A): spatial/hippocampal memory (Morris Water Maze); B) anxiety/depression (open field testing, elevated plus maze) and; C) motor learning (rotorod/gait analysis) These studies will provide information important for the eventual application of these or related compounds to clinical head trauma, and will advance our knowledge of the roles of TrkB and TrkC in pathologic states. The overall goal of this research is to advance the application of these neurotrophic compounds to the treatment of brain trauma and other conditions."
"9381316","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Both hemostatic plug formation and thrombosis require thrombin-dependent fibrin formation, platelet recruitment and aggregation. While hemostasis is an essential process, pathologic thrombosis can cause stroke, heart attack and other vasoocclusive diseases. Coagulation factors XI and XII (FXI, FXII) promote thrombin generation through the coagulation cascade. We found that both FXI and FXII contribute to experimental thrombosis, and epidemiologic data suggest that FXI deficiency is protective against deep vein thrombosis and ischemic stroke. Yet, unlike other coagulation factors, FXI-deficiency causes only a mild hemostasis disorder and FXII deficiency is apparently asymptomatic without a demonstrable role for FXII in normal hemostasis. Our original findings have opened a new window towards the development of new safe antithrombotic strategies. In this renewal application of my first R01 grant, we address the major unresolved questions on the role of FXI in thrombus formation, including activities that bypass the FIX- mediated intrinsic thrombin generation pathway. We will test our hypothesis that FXI also plays a key role in promoting thrombin generation through the inactivation of local endogenous anticoagulants. In Aim 1 we will characterize the mechanisms by which FXI-platelet crosstalk promotes the procoagulant activities of platelets during thrombus formation. We will test our hypothesis that FXIa promotes the clot formation through the inactivation of platelet tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). In Aim 2 we will define the role of FXIa in the prothrombotic activities of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and will determine whether activation of the contact pathway by NETs promotes platelet activation and microaggregate formation distal to sites of thrombus formation under flow. In Aim 3 we will utilize in vitro and in vivo models to define the molecular mechanisms by which FXI promotes tissue factor-dependent coagulation on endothelial cells. The goal of the proposed studies is to better understand the role of contact activation in the initiation and propagation of thrombus formation, which may provide further rationale for therapeutic targeting of the FXI axis as a safer new strategy to combat thrombosis."
"9331056","PROJECT SUMMARY Our goal is to develop Acomys cahirinus as a new alternative mammalian model system, since they represent the only known mammalian species that retains a remarkable capacity for increased regenerative healing potential across multiple systems as adults. As mammals, the molecular pathways for regenerative repair in Acomys are unique, yet are not likely to be distant from those required for human therapy. Although Acomys may be the best key for unlocking our own capacity for regeneration and untangling the relationship between homeostatic repair versus pathological fibrosis in mammals, Acomys animals for research purposes are more stringently regulated than other rodent models, and hence are currently in limited use in biomedical research. Our innovative approach to enable rapid research across multiple systems has been to first sequence, assemble and annotate a high quality Acomys cahirinus Genomic Resource. Our second step is to develop Acomys Cell and Transgenic Resources to more rapidly facilitate their utilization in biomedical research. Our multipisciplinary Acomys Research Team has extensive evidence that cells from different adult Acomys tissues grow surprisingly well in primary cultures. In fact, isolated Acomys fibroblasts actively resist cytokine-mediated myofiboblast induction by both changing gene expression and by differentially regulating signal transduction kinetics in homeostatic and regenerative pathways. We propose to develop Acomys cell lines from multiple adult tissues, genetically encode them with an array of fluorescent biosensor tools that report activity of key signaling pathways, generating essential tools to unravel the important mechanistic details of Acomys regenerative biology. We also aim to develop transgenic Acomys technology and animals to rapidly facilitate use of these remarkable animals by the broader scientific community. We believe that enabling access and facilitating research into this fascinating experiment of nature offers truly novel possibilities for discovery with far-reaching implications for human regenerative medicine."
"9232060","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many Gram-positive bacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are pathogens with significant impact on human suffering, and potentially, bioterrorism worldwide. With increasing levels of drug resistance in virtually all pathogens there is significant interest n the development of new drugs. The World Health Organization (WHO) published a goal of having 21 new or repurposed anti-tuberculosis drugs in Phase 1 clinical trials by 2015. Reaching this goal will require a tremendous investment in effort and money; however, new drugs to combat these pathogens would help reduce human suffering and potentially counter the threat of bioterrorism. The pathogens mentioned above are obligate aerobic Gram-positives, utilizing menaquinone as the sole lipoquinone in their electron transport chain. This suggests that menaquinone synthesis may present a potential drug target in all. Although the work proposed here is applicable to most Gram-positive organisms, emphasis has been placed on M. tuberculosis. Thus, the overriding goal of this project is to identify new compounds that have the potential for entering the drug development pipeline and helping to meet the WHO goals. We have previously demonstrated that menaquinone synthesis is a viable druggable target and identified enzymes involved in menaquinone synthesis in mycobacteria that were previously unknown and, which may also provide potential new drug targets. In this project we will refine our lead compounds via medicinal chemistry guided by enzyme kinetics, evaluate mechanisms of action for these new compounds and study the physiological importance of novel enzymes identified to be involved in mycobacterial menaquinone synthesis. If funded, the project will generate new and improved anti-TB compounds based on our current lead compound, identify new pharmacophores that inhibit various aspects of oxidative phosphorylation, identify previously unknown drug targets and significantly advance our understanding of how mycobacteria are able to regulate oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis in the hypoxic conditions found in the granulomas of infected lungs."
"9312562","Summary/Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious and debilitating condition, characterized by changes in fear expression and modulation. The fear modulation deficits in PTSD patients likely stem, at least in part, from difficulties using ?safe? and ?danger? contexts to disambiguate potentially threatening cues. A number of cognitive deficits may underlie impaired contextual processing in PTSD, including deficits in encoding and retrieval of contextual information. Pattern separation (ability to distinguish between similar but different stimuli) and pattern completion (ability to identify a previously encoded stimulus based on partial information) are believed to underlie memory encoding and retrieval, respectively. The goal of this project is to systematically probe memory function, like pattern separation and pattern completion in PTSD patients, trauma exposed controls (TC), and healthy controls (HC) using neurocognitive tasks and a fear learning task. We will investigate the roles of memory for context and pattern separation/completion in the modulation of fear expression. We aim to examine 1) Pattern Separation and Pattern Completion abilities in PTSD and the underlying neural circuits, and 2) Relationships between Pattern Separation and Pattern Completion abilities and context processing deficits during fear learning in PTSD. Participants will complete a fear learning task to assess contextual processing and fear modulation. Memory for contextual information, pattern separation, and pattern completion will be examined during MRI scanning to identify associated hippocampal and prefrontal cortex activation patterns. Brain activation and behavioral performance will be compared between PTSD, TC, and HC groups across all tasks to better understand contributions of these hippocampal deficits to altered fear learning and reactivity in PTSD. In order to successfully complete the proposed project, training objectives include 1) advanced MRI processing and analysis, 2) hippocampal mechanisms of learning and memory, 3) neurocognitive assessment of PTSD, and 4) clinical translational neuroscience. This proposed NIMH K23 award will provide rich pilot data for an R-level application and protected time for the candidate to obtain advanced training in neuroimaging methods, while broadening her expertise in neurocognitive mechanisms underlying anxiety disorder presentations. The outcome of this project has strong potential to enhance our understanding of mechanisms involved in PTSD development and maintenance, to eventually improve existing treatments. "
"9428606","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatments for systemic amyloid diseases have been held back by lack of information on the structures and causes of aggregation of the disease agents. These agents are the elongated, unbranched amyloid fibers formed by proteins having propensity for aggregation. The fibers accumulate in organs which eventually fail. In contrast, the increasingly successful attack on cancer, infectious, and metabolic diseases is rooted in part in the availability of information on the structures of the disease targets, permitting design of effective chemical interventions.  In previous work we have developed a procedure for inhibiting the formation of amyloid fibers. This first step is application of our computer algorithm which identifies the short Velcro-like sequence segments that drive formation of amyloid fibers. We have applied this algorithm to find over 100 such segments in disease- related proteins, and have verified that such segments themselves form amyloid fibers, and closely related microcrystals. The second step is X-ray structure determination of these microcrystals, which reveal the atomic basis of fiber formation. The third step is to use the resulting atomic structure as a platform for the design of inhibitors to stop fiber formation. This overall procedure is robus and ready to produce inhibitors of fibers found that cause light-chain (AL) and transthyretin (TTR) systemic amyloidosis.  In our research, we will validate particular segments of immunoglobulin light chains and transthyretin as the causes of aggregation, and based on their atomic structures, design inhibitors of aggregation. These inhibitors will be tested for their abilty to halt fiber formation in vitro, and in animal models. In principle, the same methods can be used to develop inhibitors for other systemic amyloid diseases."
"9263591","The major defining pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) are the accumulations of amyloid ? (A?) and hyperphosphorylated Tau, associated with neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytoskeletal aberrations, and synaptic loss. Multiple studies have shown that A?-induced neurotoxic signals require Tau, since the loss of Tau abrogates many deleterious effects of A?. Despite the clear pathogenic link between A? and Tau, a large knowledge gap exists in how A? pathogenically impinges on Tau. Our recently published and preliminary studies indicate that the Slingshot-1 homolog (SSH1)-Cofilin activation pathway and RanBP9 play critical roles in linking A? and Tau pathogenesis as well as their downstream neurotoxic signaling. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that RanBP9 and the Slingshot-Cofilin activation pathway not only mediate A?- induced neurotoxicity but also simultaneously promotes A? and Tau pathogenesis. By utilizing molecular, biochemical, cell biological, electrophysiological, viral, and histochemical tools, we propose to 1) test the effects of SSH1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to simultaneously reduce both A? and Tau pathogenesis; 2) validate the role of SSH1 and novel SSH1 inhibitors in A? secretion and Tau phosphorylation in primary neurons, and 3) determine the role of SSH1 and Cofilin activation status on Tau/MT dynamics and A? production in primary neurons."
"9243922","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Control of actin stability and branching by Arg and cortactin Abl family kinases act downstream of cell surface receptors to coordinate changes in actin cytoskeletal structure. These signaling roles make Abl kinases essential in fundamental processes that depend on actin regulation, such as cell migration and cell and tissue morphogenesis. Aberrant Abl family kinase activation also causes leukemia and contributes to the progression of other cancers. These biological processes have been largely ascribed to kinase activation, but our lab has shown that the Abl2/Arg kinase can also directly bind and stabilize actin filaments. In addition, Arg synergizes with its substrate cortactin to activate Arp/3 complex- mediated actin branching. Our lab has established that Arg regulates actin-rich structures that are essential for fibroblast migration, breast cancer invasion, and neuronal morphogenesis. Elucidating the direct effects of Arg- actin binding is critical for understanding how Abl family kinases regulate motility and morphogenesis in these diverse cell types. In this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that Arg-mediated actin filament stabilization and stimulation  of filament branching is critical for the formation and turnover of actin-based cell edge protrusions. My first aim is to determine which domains of Arg and cortactin mediate actin stabilization and branching. I will use total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to  measure the effects of Arg and cortactin mutants on actin stability and branch formation. Arg phosphorylates cortactin, but our lab has shown that this is not required for Arg and cortactin synergy in actin regulation. I will utilize a panel of Arg and cortactin fragments and deletion mutants to determine the minimal functional domains of Arg and cortactin necessary for their synergy in stabilizing actin and promoting Arp2/3 complex-mediated branching. My second aim is to elucidate how Arg-actin interactions activate cortactin- and Arp2/3 complex- mediated filament branching. Arg binds actin cooperatively and changes the helical twist of filaments, which increases cortactin binding to actin. I will use cosedimentation assays to test the hypothesis that Arg increases actin branching by recruiting the Arp2/3 complex to filaments. I will also use two-color TIRF microscopy to determine whether branching is increased on Arg-actin filaments relative to naked actin filaments. My third aim is to determine how Arg-actin interactions drive dynamic cell edge protrusions in vivo. The two Arg actin-binding domains (ABDs) have distinct effects on actin stability and branching, however, the role of Arg-actin binding in regulating the formation of actin-based structures in cells is not well understood. Arg is required for adhesion-dependent cell edge protrusions in fibroblasts. To determine which Arg residues are necessary for protrusions, I will express mutants with deletions and mutations in each ABD in arg-/- cells. Arg may have cortactin-independent effects on actin branching modulated by one of its ABDs, AB2. I will express Arg mutants in cortactin knockdown fibroblasts to elucidate the cortactin-independent effects of Arg in cells."
"9428010","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic cardiometabolic (CM) diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in urbanized societies. While poor diet, exercise and genetics have been the primary suspects, the link between chronic exposure to environmental pollutants has only gained recent attention. Recent compelling evidence from our group has suggested that environmental exposures to ambient particulate matter <2.5 (PM2.5) may cause insulin resistance and promote the development of several features of the metabolic syndrome such as elevated blood pressure and endothelial dysfunction. If such links were demonstrated to be true in humans, then it may provide insights into the epidemic of T2DM and cardiovascular disease in developing countries which sit at the confluence of high exposures to such pollutants over a life time and inadequate resources to study/respond to them. We posit that a multi-national collaborative effort with focused investigations in environments with the highest levels of exposure (developing countries such as China and India), are likely to provide new and much needed data on the risk posed by these variables on an individuals life-time risk for T2DM and cardiovascular complications. We will test this hypothesis through the establishment of a network that would lead studies on the links between exposure and adverse CM effects and propose doing this in this as part of 3 specific aims. In aim 1, we propose to establish feasibility of such an effort in Beijing, China, an effort that will involve implementation of novel exposure assessment methodologies simultaneously with the ability to execute key surrogate outcome measures of importance in cardiovascular risk with CM diseases. In Aim 2, the association between functional cardiovascular risk variables [insulin sensitivity, BP, endothelial function] and acute and sub-acute variations in personal black carbon and ambient PM2.5 levels among 100 individuals with the CM syndrome will be investigated. In Aim 3, we will examine potential biologic pathways of importance in the proposed functional outcomes. Specifically we will determine the association between ambient PM2.5 levels and alterations in (a) adipocytokines/inflammatory variables and autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance. If such links between PM and T2DM cardiovascular risk can be demonstrated, they will present a unique opportunity for public health policy changes on limiting environmental exposures to inhaled particulates."

"9310836","Project Summary  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease with a strikingly increasing incidence world-wide, implicating the influence of environmental factors. While genetics of MS are beginning to be understood, they can account for at most ~30% of the disease risk. The remainder of the disease risk is accounted for by environmental factors and gene-by-environment (GE) interactions. Mechanisms of GE in MS are not well understood, and are difficult to study in humans. Mounting evidence implicates a novel environmental risk factor for MS: dysregulation of the gut microbiome. In this application, we propose to take a genome-wide approach to identify gene  microbiome interactions in a novel and powerful mouse genetics system. These studies cannot be carried out in humans, and they will provide important mechanistic understanding of GE in autoimmune disease of the CNS, and deliver cause vs. effect distinctions that are lacking in epidemiologic studies."
"9327543","Project Abstract Hypothalamic hormones regulate multiple physiologies, and changes in their signaling to a variety of pathologies including obesity, growth and metabolic abnormalities, and sexual dysfunction. Prominent neuroendocrine pathways that regulate physiologies of metabolism, growth, and stress, all rely on hypothalamic input for their control. Little is known about extra-hypothalamic inputs that control these pathways. Towards this goal, we have discovered a novel projection from the basal forebrain cholinergic system to the hypothalamus and median eminence. Furthermore, we have shown that an increase in the activity of these cholinergic neurons leads to a novel hormone-driven weight loss phenotype. Using innovative techniques in conditional viral genetics, cell-type specific neuronal manipulations, cell-type specific labeling, optogenetics, and ultrastructural imaging we propose to determine the role of basal forebrain cholinergic signaling on hypothalamic hormone release. Specifically, we propose to (1) determine which hypothalamic- pituitary axis hormones are altered by changes in cholinergic tone and (2) determine how cholinergic signaling alters the release of hypothalamic hormones."
"9278680","Voltage-dependent Na+ (Nav) channels typify the most distinctive feature of most neurons and other excitable, their capacity to generate action potentials (AP). In several classic cases, a primary role of Nav channels is to ensure failsafe reliability of the AP, whether in long distance AP propagation in an axon or in contributing to reproducibility of APs in skeletal or cardiac muscle. However, there is a growing realization that Nav channels in many neurons and neuroendocrine cells play central roles in the regulation of cell firing behavior, contributing to accommodation during repetitive firing with associated changes in AP height or duration. These effects on firing arise, in part, from use-dependent changes in Nav current availability defined by the specific inactivation properties of different Nav channels. Multiple kinds of fast inactivation have been described for Nav channels. One is classic fast inactivation that is intrinsic to the Nav pore-forming ? subunit. Another involves pore block by N-terminal segments of specific intracellular fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (iFGFs). When two forms of fast inactivation are present at the same time, they act in a competitive fashon. The differences in recovery from inactivation of the two forms then critically define Nav current availability. The extent to which iFGFs regulate properties of different Nav channels is only beginning to be understood. Some challenges are that there are multiple Nav variants in many cells and multiple FGFs, some inactivating, some noninactivating, that can compete for association with Navs. In this project, we will utilize a relatively simple cell, chromaffin cells (CCs) of the adrenal medulla, which have the excitability properties of neurons, but offer advantages for teasing apart the role of iFGFs. Using methods of electrophysiology coupled with genetic manipulations that delete specific subunits from mice, this project will define properties of inactivation of Nav current in CCs, tease apart the dual-pathway fast inactivation behavior observed in such cells, determine the identity of specific subtypes of Nav currents found in CCs, and assess the role of iFGFs in producing the unusual inactivation behavior. This project is expected to provide new insight into the properties of inactivation mediated by FGF's, the distinctions between normal fast inactivation and iFGF-mediated inactivation when both are present, potential specificity in the roles of different iFGFs and different Nav isoforms in regards to native cells, and the impact of cytosolic iFGF-mediated inactivation on cell excitability. As potential disease causing mutations in iFGF's or their associated Nav channels become revealed, the results of this project will be important to assessing the impact and potential future therapeutic strategies."

"9371902","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to RFA-MH-15-300 (Exploratory Clinical Trials of Novel Interventions for Mental Disorders [R21/R33]) by proposing to translate neuroscience findings into a novel non-pharmacologic treatment for Acute Fear, a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) construct common to many DSM defined anxiety disorders. The neuroscience findings which serve as the basis for this effort are an extensive pre- clinical literature documenting that the region of the brainstem known as the locus coeruleus (LC) plays a key role in mediating symptoms of Acute Fear. We capitalize on evidence that LC activity can be non-invasively measured with pupillometry and our pilot data indicating that we can modulate LC activity with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied via electrodes attached to the skin/scalp. Our approach is to develop tDCS as a means of inhibiting LC activity and then determine if this diminishes symptoms of Acute Fear.  Our translational effort will consist of two stages, a 2 year R21 phase where we establish feasibility, tolerability, safety, and proof-of-concept (POC) in terms of capacity to engage the neural target, followed by a 3 year R33 parallel-group, double-blind, controlled trial. In the R21 phase we will employ an iterative approach where we use electric field modeling with a realistic head model to identify promising treatment electrode placements which we will test across a series of electrical doses in 3 cohorts of healthy controls to attempt to identify a tDCS treatment electrode configuration with which we can identify a dosage in each subject that is: (1) tolerable (5-point Likert ratings of no more than mild discomfort); and (2) engages the target neural circuitry by transiently inhibiting LC activity as reflected in prevention of the pupil dilation response to rare stimuli in the auditoy oddball task (AOT), which reliably activates LC. If successful we will proceed to a 3 year R33 parallel- group trial where 60 healthy volunteers are randomized to electrical dose-personalized active tDCS vs an active control therapy (tDCS that delivers the same skin current density as the active but does not affect LC) where clinical symptoms Acute Fear, the primary outcome, are elicited by inhalation of 7.5% CO2. Future development viability will be assumed if there is preliminary evidence that engaging the target (inhibiting LC) safely diminishes clinical Acute Fear symptoms.  Our broad scientific goal is to evaluate if engagement of the target brain circuitry, inhibition of LC, is a viable target for treating Acute Fear. This is of high public heath importance as Acute Fear is extremely widespread and debilitating problem and current treatment options are quite limited."
"9234318","Nothing short of defining the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the nuclear receptor (NR) and coregulator (CoReg) containing transcriptional complex and its order of assembly will significantly advance our current understanding of gene regulation by steroid hormones. Insights into the fundamental regulatory mechanisms (both proximal and distal) of transcriptional initiation, elongation, and pausing are critical since steroid hormone control of gene expression underpins a wide array of physiological and pathophysiological responses. Using an innovative reconstitution assay of the transcriptional complex, we recently revealed that DNA-bound progesterone receptor (PR) recruits the steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) to the transcriptional complex to drive target gene expression. This in vitro finding has in vivo significance since we have previously demonstrated a pivotal role for SRC-2 in PR-dependent reproductive functions in the female mouse and more recently in PR-driven mammary epithelial expansion and morphogenesis. These in vitro and in vivo findings are the basis of the following hypothesis: The PR functions together with SRC-2 in a multi-subunit transcriptional complex to drive transcriptional programs that underpin normal and abnormal mammary epithelial expansion and morphogenesis. Implicit in this testable hypothesis is that deregulation of SRC-2 levels can derail normal PR mediated transcriptional output, which leads to abnormal hormone responsiveness of the mammary epithelium, resulting in hyperplasia and cancer. The above hypothesis will be tested by the following four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the 3D structure of DNA-bound PR/SRC-2/Co- CoReg protein complexes on a progesterone response element via cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM); Specific Aim 2: To codify the regulatory involvement of PR and SRC-2 in Growth Regulation by Estrogen in Breast Cancer 1 (GREB 1) promoter/enhancer topology and transcriptional activity; Specific Aim 3: To dissect the selective contributions of luminal epithelial and basal/myoepithelial derived SRC-2 to normal progesterone- dependent mammary gland morphogenesis in vivo; and Specific Aim 4: To elucidate the role of SRC-2 in hormone-dependent and -independent aberrant mammary epithelial expansion and morphogenesis. For these innovative specific aims, forefront molecular and genetic mouse technologies?Cryo-EM, a cell-free reconstitution assay to study transcriptional complex assembly, cell-type specific cre-mediated gene ablation or induction in the mouse, and the integrative analysis of genome-wide datasets as a molecular phenotyping tool?will be used to advance the above provocative hypothesis. The outcomes of this research program are predicted not only to significantly expand our current understanding NR/CoReg control of gene expression but will address the underexplored role of CoRegs in normal progesterone-dependent mammary epithelial proliferation and morphogenesis as well as for abnormal hormone responses that can lead to aberrant development such as cancer?a high-priority health issue for the National Institutes of Health."
"9391426","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic Reversal of Endothelial Dysfunction in Atherogenesis Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. In particular, atherosclerosis is a life-threatening disease strongly associated with risk factors such as elevated cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. There are effective commercially available therapeutics that target these systemic risk factors. Yet despite these, there is still a significant rate of adverse events in patients prescribed these therapeutic and a significant population that suffer adverse cardiovascular events even in the absence of these conventional systemic risk factors. Importantly, in the face of these systemic classical cardiovascular risk factors, certain regions of the arterial vasculature remain relatively resistan to the development of atherosclerotic lesions while some are relatively susceptible. Interestingly,  the anatomical locations of these protected and susceptible regions are predictable between individuals and even between species. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the specific hemodynamic environments within these arterial regions exert a protective influence on the local vascular endothelium, and thus inhibit early lesion development. In contrast, hemodynamic conditions present in other regions of the vasculature evoke a pro- inflammatory pro-atherogenic dysfunctional state in the endothelium. Despite recent progress in the understanding of some of the biological mechanisms responsible for hemodynamics-induced atheroprotection and atherosusceptibility, these basic discoveries have not yet been translated into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. During the Phase I of our STTR funded project, we utilized insights regarding the mechanisms underlying endothelial responses to hemodynamic flow to establish a novel cardiovascular drug discovery platform, which resulted in the identification of novel chemical entities able to mimic hemodynamics-induced atheroprotection. In this Phase II project, we will continue development of these promising results. Here, the major goals are to 1) develop an optimized lead compound from our existing vasoprotective chemical series, 2) characterize the mechanism of action of this vasoprotective compound, and 3) evaluate the preclinical efficacy of this optimized lead in an animal model of atherosclerosis. These essential milestones should catalyze this innovative cardiovascular drug discovery effort toward clinical translation, thus establishing a new approach to cardiovascular disease therapy."
"9317886","PROJECT SUMMARY Treatment of advanced melanoma remains a major challenge despite recent FDA approvals of targeted therapies and immunotherapies that significantly improve patient survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, e.g., anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (nivolumab), augment anti-tumor immunity to improve clinical outcomes in certain patients. Concurrent ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy is more efficacious than immune checkpoint monotherapy, albeit at the expense of increased toxicity. Hence, there is a need for novel treatment combinations to boost efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors without additional toxicity, and to identify robust biomarkers to predict which melanoma patients are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Increasing evidence supports a complex interplay between tumor angiogenesis and anti-tumor immunity, largely through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. Thus, combining the inhibition of angiogenesis with immune checkpoint blockade provides a rational strategy to enhance anti-melanoma immunity. Indeed, a recent phase I study of ipilimumab and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) in melanoma patients demonstrated better clinical activity than ipilimumab alone. Moreover, tumor biopsies from patients treated with the combination showed elevated CD8+ T cell infiltration and endothelial cell activation, suggesting that this combined treatment approach might improve melanoma immunotherapy efficacy. However, a critical obstacle to this strategy is the lack of a biomarker to predict which immunotherapy- treated patients would benefit from angiogenesis inhibition. Our preliminary and recently published data identified a KDR (VEGFR2) germline variant (Q472H) in ~35% of melanoma patients in two independent cohorts. We showed that: (i) KDR Q472H is associated with increased tumor microvessel density (MVD) and VEGF secretion; (ii) KDR Q472H melanoma cell growth and invasion are sensitive to VEGFR2 inhibition, supporting angiogenesis blockade as a rational therapeutic strategy in patients carrying this variant; (iii) increased ERK1/2 and Akt signaling in KDR Q472H melanoma cells compared with wild-type (WT) cells, and (iv) a pilot cohort of melanoma patients who did not respond to anti- CTLA-4 therapy had increased KDR Q472H prevalence. Our working hypothesis is that germline KDR Q472H is a functional determinant of melanoma angiogenesis (and thus anti-tumor immunity), and might dictate the clinical response to anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 therapy. We will utilize melanoma patient tissues with extensive clinicopathological annotation, germline DNA from three independent immunotherapy cohorts, and a transgenic melanoma mouse model established by our group to address these questions. The direct translational impact of our work is that germline KDR Q472H might (i) predict patient benefit from combined anti-angiogenesis and immune checkpoint blockade, and (ii) provide an actionable target to sensitize tumors to these therapies."
"9332033","Project Summary/Abstract The human placenta plays a major role in maintaining the proper environment for fetal growth, but remains as the most poorly understood organ. This project aims to substantially improve our knowledge of this important human organ by studying its early development in a systematic, detailed manner, then to combine this knowledge with the latest technologies in regenerative medicine in order to develop in vitro models for the study of both normal and abnormal placental development. Specifically, we aim to understand the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of a multipotent human trophoblast stem (TS) cell, one which can give rise to all other subtypes of trophoblast, the epithelial cells of the placenta. Over the past few years, we have identified a key pathway, directed by the p53-related protein, p63, which is required for maintenance of undifferentiated cytotrophoblast (CTB) stem cells in the early placenta. More recently, we have noted that a subset of these CTB co-express CDX2, a transcription factor required for maintenance of TS cells in mice, and hypothesize that these CDX2+/p63+ CTB are multipotent human TS cells. We will characterize this subpopulation further, using a combination of FACS sorting, followed by differentiation assays and both bulk and single cell transcriptome profiling. In this discovery-based approach, we will focus our analysis on identification of transcription factors and cell surface markers, which characterize this cell population in the early human placenta. At the same time, we will take a more gene-focused approach, probing the specific role(s) of p63 and CDX2 in first trimester CTB proliferation and differentiation, including their downstream targets. Finally, we will apply this knowledge to human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)--both embryonic (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)?in order to develop in vitro models for the study of human trophoblast lineage specification and differentiation. We have established a novel differentiation protocol for step-wise differentiation of hPSCs, first into CTB, and subsequently into hCG- secreting syncytiotrophoblast (STB) and HLA-G+ extravillous trophoblast (EVT). Using this protocol, we have found that Trisomy 21 iPSC spend a prolonged period in the CTB stem cell state, and show blunted differentiation into functional STB, identical to the phenotype of primary CTB isolated from placentas with Trisomy 21. These exciting preliminary data suggest that hPSCs may be useful for modeling trophoblast differentiation defects, which are the basis for placental dysfunction. We will compare hPSC-derived trophoblast to primary trophoblast from both pre- and post-implantation tissues in order to determine which they most resemble. The successful completion of this project has the potential to transform the field of human placental biology, by both identifying human TS cells within the placenta, and establishing hPSC-based models of placental disease, thereby constructing a firm foundation on which diagnostic marker discovery and therapeutic targeting of this important human organ would be possible."
"9217584","While virtually all human tumors are derived from a single cell-of-origin, neoplastic cells within a tumor evolve over time due to genetic and epigenetic alterations, lineage diversification, and influences from stromal cells. These processes generate considerable heterogeneity within populations of neoplastic cells from individual tumors. Despite our knowledge of the existence of tumor cell heterogeneity, it is not understood whether the heterogeneous subpopulations of tumor cells merely co-exist, or alternatively whether they communicate with each other, complementing one another's phenotypes and generating biological outcomes that individual populations are incapable of producing on their own. The lack of understanding of such functional interactions between tum9r populations has been due in large part to the inability to maintain the heterogeneity of human tumors in culture and to propagate distinct clonal subpopulations from individual tumors. We and our collaborators have developed approaches that have overcome these barriers and made it feasible to culture bar-coded, fluorescently-tagged, clonal populations of tumor cells and then track individual clonal populations within tumor xenografts generated from mixtures of transplanted clones. Using these approaches, we have obtained evidence the supports the hypothesis that clonal subpopulations within a tumor cooperate with one another to promote tumor expansion and metastasis. In this proposal, we describe plans to test this hypothesis in human breast tumors by (1) characterizing the extent of genetic and phenotypic variation among clonal populations derived from an individual breast tumor and analyzing the tumor-initiating, invasive, and metastatic activity of each clonal subpopulation, (2) generating a map that plots the localization of clonal populations within tumors and their dynamic evolution over time, (3) investigating the functional consequences of heterogeneity within human breast tumor cell populations, and (4) elucidating the mechanisms responsible for phenotypes generated by intratumoral crosstalk. These studies will provide important insights into the nature of cooperative interactions between tumor cell populations and how these affect tumor expansion, invasion, or metastasis."

"9429256","Abstract The hallmark of allergic diseases is the infiltration and accumulation of Th2 cells at the sites of inflammation; however the molecular mechanisms governing tolerance induction in Th2 cells and their relation to allergic responses are poorly understood. Thus, today it is becoming clear that understanding the Th2 cell biology and ways to control their function may prove to be invaluable for the treatment of allergic inflammation.  Recently, we as well as others have demonstrated the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Grail and Itch in induction of Th2 cell tolerance. Cullin4A (Cul4A) belongs to the evolutionally conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase family and has been suggested to be involved in hematopoietic cell activation and in chromatin regulation; however, the role of Cul4A in T lymphocytes has not been addressed yet. Interestingly, expression of Cul4A was upregulated in tolerant T cells. Moreover, Cul4A knockout CD4+ T cells activated in vitro under tolerogenic conditions exhibited an enhanced level of proliferation and IL-2 production compared to wild-type cells, suggesting an important role of Cul4A in regulation of T cell tolerance. Strikingly, we found that Cul4A deficient Th2 and Treg cells expressed higher levels of Th2 cytokines, which correlates with increased levels of IgG1 and IgE in the sera of Cul4A deficient mice, indicating the selective role of Cul4A in controlling Th2 programming and Th2 mediated inflammation. We also detected reduced Cul4A expression in CD4+ T cells from asthmatic patients compared to CD4+ T cells from healthy donors, further indicating that Cul4A potentially regulates the tolerogenic process in pro-allergic Th2 cells. In addition, shRNA knockdown of Cul4A in human CD4+ T cells resulted in upregulated expression of Th2-specific cytokines. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that regulation of Th2 cell function by Cul4A may be an important checkpoint in airway tolerance induction, which is crucial to prevent development of allergic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to determine the molecular mechanisms whereby Cul4A controls T cell tolerance by utilizing gene knockdown approaches and in vitro and in vivo Th2 tolerance induction models. In Aim2, we will determine the role of Cul4A in Th2 cell programming and its underlying mechanisms as well. We will employ cutting edge technologies, including two-hybrid screening and microarray analysis of gene expression, to identify the exact target(s) of Cul4A to determine its function in Th2 development. In addition, we will assess the cellular mechanisms whereby Cul4A controls Th2 type mediated airway inflammation. In Aim3, we will determine the mechanism by which Cul4A regulates Tregs function, particularly the acquisition of Th2-like properties. The physiological significance of this finding will be analyzed in three different in vivo models. The proposed research will provide new significant insight into characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying Cul4A-mediated tolerogenic process in Th2 cells that may potentially have therapeutic implications for allergic diseases."
"9233890","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging-related denervation of skeletal muscle results in a significant loss of independence in the elderly population. With age, motor neuron (MN) axons are retracted from the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), leaving behind denervated muscle fibers that cannot be recruited during muscle contraction. This age-related denervation occurs in both humans and animal models, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Recent evidence suggests a new mediator for age-related synapse loss: proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI). MHCI mRNA is constitutively expressed in adult spinal MNs, and MN MHCI levels increase significantly with age. In contrast, in muscles that are resistant to age-related denervation (e.g., the extraocular muscles), MNs consistently express much lower levels of MHCI. These results suggest a model in which MHCI expression contributes to age-related synapse loss at the NMJ.  Retraction of MN axons from the NMJ is not limited to aging: it is also a critical aspect of normal development. MN axons retract during the course of postnatal vertebrate development, removing the supernumerary MN inputs that form prenatally. Our preliminary data show that MHCI is expressed during developmental synapse elimination at the NMJ. We also find that developmental synapse elimination is significantly impaired in MHCI-deficient mice. This proposal is guided by the hypothesis that MHCI contributes to removal of MN axons at the NMJ, both during developmental synapse elimination and aging-related synapse loss.  The goals of this project are three-fold: 1) Using a MHCI-deficient transgenic mouse model, we will determine if reducing MHCI expression ameliorates aging-related synapse loss at the NMJ. 2) Using RT-PCR and transgenic mouse lines, we will determine if classical MHCIs are required for MN retraction. 3) By expanding our studies to muscles of different fiber type compositions and labeling these fiber types in MHCI- deficient mice, we will determine if MHCI triggers MN retraction specifically at slow twitch muscle fibers.  Together, the proposed studies will define the role of MHCI in developmental synapse elimination and aging-associated synapse loss, and could suggest unexpected, immune-based strategies to protect aged muscles from denervation."
"9272269","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension (HTN) is a multifactorial disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. While many risk factors for HTN have been identified, they do not adequately predict whether an individual will develop this disease. The overarching goal of this proposal is to expand understanding on possible modifiable factors and their underlying mechanism for HTN in older women. Investigators propose to examine the association between periodontal disease (PD), edentulism (the complete lack of teeth), the oral microbiome, inflammatory profile, and incident HTN in postmenopausal women. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that edentulism and PD may be associated with HTN; however there are no prospective epidemiologic studies that have evaluated this association in postmenopausal women. It is important to study this association in postmenopausal women be- cause HTN, edentulism, and PD are common in this demographic. Aim 1 will assess the prospective association between PD and incident HTN in 46,400 women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS). A potential mechanism of the association between PD and HTN is inflammation caused by harmful oral microbes. Inflammation has been shown to play a critical role in HTN in animal models. Also, certain cytokines have been independently associated with HTN in epidemiologic studies. Better understanding of the influence inflammation has on HTN could be realized through studies of broader cytokine profiles. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the association between inflammatory biomarkers and HTN utilizing data from 893 women enrolled in the Buffalo Osteoporosis and Periodontal Disease (OsteoPerio) observational cohort study, an ancillary study of the WHI-OS. Another important factor in PD is imbalances in the oral microbiome, which may contribute to the inflammatory link between PD and HTN. The association between composition of the oral microbiome and HTN has not been investigated. Aim 3 will assess associations between composition of the oral microbiome and hypertension in the OsteoPerio study. All three aims will be achieved utilizing prospective data and biological samples available in the WHI-OS and OsteoPerio. Aims 2 and 3 will additionally utilize data currently being collected at a 15 year follow-up visit. Overall this grant application proposes to determine whether (1) edentulism and PD, (2) inflammatory biomarkers, and (3) composition of the subgingival microbiome at baseline are associated with increased risk of HTN during follow-up. Achieving these aims will deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of HTN in older adults in whom HTN exacts enormous health and economic burden. Results could also inform future mechanistic evaluations of HTN, as well as identification of novel intervention targets to enhance population control of HTN and its complications."
"9310851","ABSTRACT: Early onset pediatric epileptic encephalopathies such as Dravet Syndrome (DS) are devastating to families because of the high degree of neurodevelopmental compromise, including developmental delay, cognitive decline, and intellectual disability. Most concerning are the severe seizures and high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Mutations in voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) ? and ? subunit genes are linked to DS. While the majority of DS cases are linked to SCN1A haploinsufficiency, SCN1B homozygous mutations are also linked to DS. Scn1b-/- mice have a DS phenotype with SUDEP. SCN1B encodes VGSC ?1 subunits, which are developmentally regulated cell adhesion molecules and ion channel modulators that play critical roles in the regulation of excitability. Scn1b-/- mice have cell type specific changes in Na+ (INa) and K+ (IK) currents. In addition, Scn1b-/- mice have neuronal proliferation, migration, and pathfinding defects at postnatal day (P)5 that precede seizure onset at ~P10. These data suggested that alterations in CAM function may contribute to hyperexcitability, however, new data challenge this idea and offer the alternative explanation that defective cell adhesion in SCN1B-linked DS may not contribute to seizures but instead impact other co-morbidities. Preliminary data show that Scn1b-/- mice also have delayed maturation of neuronal Cl- gradients such that GABAergic signaling remains depolarizing and excitatory until ~P17-18, which may contribute to hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The objective of this work is to understand the mechanism of hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism of hyperexcitability in the Scn1b-/- model of DS is cell type specific changes in INa, IK, and GABAergic signaling. Further, it is proposed that human SCN1B-DS mutations result in loss-of-function, with similar defects in ionic currents and delayed maturation of GABAergic signaling as observed in Scn1b-/- neurons. The experimental plan will test three Aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of hyperexcitability resulting from Scn1b deletion; 2. To determine whether human SCN1B-linked DS mutations result in loss-of-function in mouse models; 3. To determine the phenotype of SCN1B-linked DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons. Model choice is key to understanding epilepsy mechanisms. Importantly, mice are not small humans. Thus, patient-derived iPSC neuronal models provide essential information regarding human disease. On the other hand, mature brain networks cannot yet be replicated using iPSCs and so brain slice preparations from transgenic mouse models remain important to understanding circuitry. Rather than relying on a single model, this project will compare and contrast human and mouse models to understand key mechanistic aspects of the development of hyperexcitability in DS. Even though SCN1B-linked DS is rare compared to SCN1A-linked disease, this work may lead to the discovery of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in DS caused by multiple types of gene mutations."
"9270035","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Management, Dissemination and Training Core Discovering the functions of the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome is a required step for understanding human biology and disease. Genetic model organisms, including zebrafish, play a critical role in this discovery process, because genetic analysis can connect gene sequence and function. Model organism databases, like ZFIN, provide tools required to make this connection.  The zebrafish has emerged as a premier organism to study vertebrate biology. Powerful techniques allow rapid efficient generation and recovery of mutations affecting genes that orchestrate developmental patterning, organogenesis, physiology, and behavior. It is easy to study gene function by generating transgenic zebrafish, by knocking down gene function with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, or by altering gene function by genome editing. The genome has been sequenced and about 50% of the protein coding genes have been mutated by targeted gene knockout technology. Large-scale projects are underway or planned that will produce functional data about almost all the genes and sequence-based functional elements in the genome. Multiple mutations and gene knockdowns can be combined in the same individual to study gene modifiers and other genetic interactions. The functions of most of these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups. Thus, analysis of zebrafish mutations provides insights into gene functions in other vertebrates, including humans.  The long term goals for ZFIN are a) to be the community database resource for the laboratory use of zebrafish, b) to develop and support integrated zebrafish genetic, genomic, developmental, and physiological information, c) to maintain the definitive reference data sets of zebrafish research information, d) to link this information extensively to corresponding data in other model organism and human databases, e) to facilitate the use of zebrafish as a model for human biology, and f) to help serve the broad needs of the biomedical research community.  This core will provide support for public access, dissemination, training, and outreach. We will maintain our administrative structure for management of ZFIN, including our Scientific Advisory Board. We will provide guidelines and tutorials for using ZFIN. We will provide general information about research activities, meetings, etc., and we will maintain a research community wiki. We will continue to develop user surveys, employ user-centered design, and provide training sessions at conferences."

"9314042","Project Summary/Abstract: Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood and imposes a profound clinical and financial burden on American children, costing the US health care system ~$50.1 billion dollars annually. The pathogenesis of pediatric asthma is complex, secondary to both genetic predisposition and environmental/infectious exposures. Multiple well-powered genetic association studies (GWAS) and cis- expression quantitative trait loci studies (cis-eQTL) have linked over-expression of the gene ORMDL3 to pediatric-onset asthma. Unfortunately, the role of this gene in asthma pathogenesis remains unclear. Multiple studies have shown ORMDL proteins regulate critical aspects of sphingolipid metabolism, but the underlying immune mechanisms dysregulated by ORMDL3 risk variants are currently undefined. This gap in our basic knowledge impedes the rational targeting of novel therapies to this important new asthma pathway. I have recently performed preliminary studies that have shown ORMDL3 over-expression in dendritic cells (DCs) reduced basal cellular ceramide levels and enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. I hypothesize that ORMDL3 over-expression in these cells may contribute to the gene's role in asthma pathogenesis. The primary scientific goals of my proposed research project are 1) to establish the cellular and molecular mechanisms linking ORMDL3 over-expression in DCs to pro-inflammatory responses in the lung and 2) to establish the effects of ORMDL3 risk variants on sphingolipid-regulated immune responses in human DCs. To achieve these goals, I will acquire additional training in biostatistics, lipidomic analysis and advanced immunology with the long-term goal of establishing a laboratory focused on the role of sphingolipids in pulmonary inflammation.  In the attached proposal, I have outlined an integrated set of multidisciplinary studies to evaluate the role of ORMDL3 in DCs during asthma pathogenesis in both mouse and human systems. In Aim 1, I will determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of ORDML3 over-expression on DC immune function. We will utilize a transgenic ORMDL3 over-expressing mouse model I have developed to probe the functional effects of ORMDL3 on DC antigen processing, T cell activation and DC migration. In Aim 2, we will identify the regulatory effects of ORMDL3 over-expression in DCs by examining the gene's effects on cellular lipids and gene expression during DC maturation. We will utilize both shotgun and targeted lipidomics in combination with RNA sequencing to identify key gene and lipid metabolite pathways that are altered by ORMDL3, leading to enhanced DC-mediated inflammation. In Aim 3, we will determine whether ORMDL3 risk alleles regulate sphingolipid levels in human monocyte-derived DC in ORMDL3 genotyped subjects. Together these studies will directly address the gap in our knowledge regarding sphingolipids and DC function and are predicted to offer insights into the susceptibility mechanisms of pediatric asthma."
"9246339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury represents a considerable public health problem which exerts both a large financial burden on society, and post-traumatic reductions in quality of life through a constellation of cognitive impairments on individuals. The identification of pharmacological approaches to reduce brain injury-induced neuroinflammation currently exists as an unmet need despite advances in diagnostic techniques. Secondary mechanisms of neurodegeneration such as neuroinflammation are thought to contribute to post-traumatic cognitive impairments. Prostaglandins (PGs) and other eicosanoids have been found to play an important role in neuroinflammation, the production of which occurs via the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) by biosynthetic enzymes. Recent discoveries yield new insight into a novel pathway which supports the production of AA from within the endocannabinoid system. In vitro work shows that inhibiting diacylglycerol lipase-? (DAGL-?) reduces the biosynthesis of 2-arachadonoyl glycerol, an endogenous cannabinoid ligand but also a precursor for the production of AA. This reduction in the production of free AA in turn results in decreases in PG formation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Therefore, we hypothesize that inhibiting DAGL-? will provide cognitive protection following brain injury in a murine learning and memory assay by reducing the pool of available AA that contributes to the production of PGE2 and other pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines in the hippocampus. Accordingly, the objectives of this training plan are to determine the distinct contribution of DAGL-? blockade on the reversal of TBI-induced memory impairments in mice, as well as the dampening of downstream production of prostanoids, and pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by microglial cells in the hippocampus. The proposed aims to examine these objectives are: 1) Evaluate the consequences of DAGL- inhibition on TBI-induced cognitive impairments in mice, 2) Evaluate the impact of DAGL-? inhibition on TBI-induced production of eCBs, AA, and PGs, and 3) Evaluate the impact of DAGL-? inhibition on TBI-induced production of a pro-inflammatory cytokine on CNS cell types. The completion of the research outlined in this training plan will contribute to the understanding of the role that DAGL-? plays in injury-induced production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids separate from its action at cannabinoid receptors, as well as provide Ms. O'Brien with the necessary technical skills and theoretical foundation toward becoming an independent investigator."
"9013359","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Detection of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow (BM) aspirates in patients with different cancers predicts for high risk of recurrences and reduced survival. DTCs enter a long-termed dormancy phase and are the sources of metastasis. Immediate goals: 1- to understand how DTCs enter dormancy; 2- to identify therapeutic alternatives to treat patients in remission. Current work: We have recently published a study showing that dormancy of DTCs is achieved by re-expression of a retinoid-responsive gene named NR2F1. We are exploring the epigenomic landscape regulated by NR2F1 during dormancy and how it regulates pluripotency programs (NANOG and SOX2) in dormant cancer cells. Long-term goal is to apply the knowledge gathered from understanding metastatic dormancy to reduce or prevent tumor relapses by finding strategies that stops residual disease from becoming a life-threatening metastasis. Description of the K22 project (3 years): We published that NR2F1 while lost in primary tumors is re-expressed upon surgical removal of the primary tumor in local and distant DTCs and allows them to undergo dormancy by regulating pluripotency gene transcription and histone-H3 post-translational modifications (H3-PTMs). The objective is to understand the mechanisms by which dormant DTCs hijack stem cell programs and to explore potential therapeutic treatments for minimal residual diseases. In this proposal we plan to use head and neck carcinoma models. The central hypothesis is that NR2F1 via NANOG and SOX2 supports tumor cell dormancy. The rationale is that characterization of the mechanisms responsible for DTC dormancy would provide molecular markers to identify dormant disease in human samples (e.g. BM aspirates) and this could be used to identify patients at risk of metastasis and monitoring response to therapies. Specific aims: 1) Determine the role of NANOG and SOX2 downstream of NR2F1 in regulating tumor cell dormancy. To test this aim we will use gain of function (cDNA overexpression) and loss of function experiments (TET-ON-shmirRNA constructs) to uncover the role of NANOG and SOX2 in combination with immunofluorescence and immunochemistry methods. We will also use our published mouse model for dormancy. 2) Investigate the epigenomic landscape governed by NR2F1 and H3-PTMs in dormant cells by using ChIP-sequencing and computational approaches. 3) Determine the effectiveness of combining two therapeutic drugs (DNA methylation inhibitors + retinoids) currently in clinical trials in reprogramming residual disease into dormancy and thus reducing metastasis formation in mouse models. The approach is innovative because it proposes for the first time that pluripotency programs are responsible for dormancy of DTCs. The research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance the understanding of how dormant DTCs utilize stem cell genes to preserve their dormancy phenotype and the later tumor initiating capacity. Ultimately, this finding will contribute to the development of therapies that aim to preserve DTCs as chronic asymptomatic residual disease and/or eradicate them."
"9262547","Project Summary: The neural circuitry that encodes and mediates the establishment of cue-reward associations, an adaptive process that is essential for survival, likely becomes dysfunctional in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as drug addiction. While the full encoding of cue-reward associations require a distributed network of brain nuclei acting in concert to orchestrate behavioral output, neurons in ventral tegmental area and upstream circuits in cortex and hypothalamus are thought to play an important role in reward prediction and assigning incentive salience to environmental cues such as those that become associated with repeated drug use. In this application, we propose to state of the art deep brain two-photon imaging in awake and behaving mice to study how the encoding properties within these circuits emerge and are altered during primary reward exposure as well in associative learning. These experiments will provide important mechanistic information to explain how reward circuits encode and control the development and expression of cue-reward associations relevant to addiction."

"9443729","After a breast conserving therapy, histology is often performed to check whether the excised tumor specimen is surrounded by a sufficient amount of normal tissue. If a positive margin is identified, then a second operation will be performed. Currently, the re-operation rate is 20-40%, which raises a need for intraoperative detection of residual cancers. The current intraoperative tools for margin assessment are time consuming and lack sufficient tumor specificity. Multiple emerging optical technologies improved the sensitivity and specificity but still suffered from a long procedure time. We propose a multi-modal spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging system to differentiate cancer and normal tissue in a resected breast tissue. Providing both chemical content and mechanical property information, this system, named MarginPAT, is able to measure map tissue components including blood, fat, fibrosis tissue, and breast lesion. Based on a compact Raman laser and a high-speed scanning chamber, the proposed MarginPAT system is able to scan 10 cm2 tissue area per min, which is faster than the frozen section analysis (gold standard for intraoperative assessment) by one order of magnitude. Such capacities allow 3 dimensional assessment of margin status in the entire excised tissue with >90% sensitivity and specificity."
"9286617","Project Summary Recruitment of eosinophils (Eos) from the bloodstream into tissues can occur under a variety of conditions and lead to the release of preformed and newly synthesized products, including cytokines, chemokines, lipid mediators and cytotoxic granule proteins, which can initiate and quickly escalate local inflammatory and remodeling responses. Notably, eosinophil-targeted therapy has been very effective in clinical trials at reducing mature eosinophils in the blood. However, tissue eosinophilia is only partially suppressed and likely results from accessory pathways that continue to promote Eos recruitment and survival. The residual tissue eosinophilia contributes to persistent symptoms and increased risk for tissue damage in patients with Eos-mediated diseases. Thus, new therapies designed with an improved understanding of the mechanism of tissue eosinophilia are needed and likely to have a significant clinical impact. Our preliminary studies implicate Aiolos as a potential regulator of Eos accumulation in eosinophilic asthma as Aiolos-deficiency results in impaired responses to CCR3 ligands and to IL-5, a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic asthma. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Aiolos controls airway eosinophilia in asthma by two processes, 1) positive regulation of Ccr3 expression by direct transcriptional activation, and 2) a positive feedback loop involving Aiolos, Il5ra, and IL-5. In Aim 1, we will identify the Aiolos-dependent transcriptome in Eos and delineate the mechanism for Aiolos-dependent expression of CCR3. We will also determine the consequence of Aiolos deficiency on Eos-mediated tissue pathology in experimental asthma. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism for Aiolos-mediated regulation of IL-5-responsiveness by evaluating the consequence of Aiolos deficiency, haploinsufficiency and overexpression on stage-specific responses by EoPs, eosinophil precursors (preEos) and mature Eos to IL-5. We will also dissect the relationship between Aiolos expression, Il5ra expression and IL-5 stimulation during Eos development in the setting of experimental asthma. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the relationship between expression levels of Aiolos in human Eos and 1) a specific Eos gene signature, 2) functional response of Eos to IL-5 and CCL11, and 3) asthma disease severity and Eos phenotype. The high prevalence of eosinophilic inflammation in pediatric asthma and the recent FDA approval of IL-5-targeted therapy for eosinophilic asthma highlight the significance of this application which focuses on delineating the mechanistic relationship between Aiolos expression in Eos, Eos recruitment into the inflamed lung, and IL-5 responsiveness of Eos. Our proposed mechanistic studies using both mouse and human cell systems (Aims 1 and 2) supported by translational studies with Eos from patients with eosinophilic asthma (Aim 3) will provide compelling evidence to support our central hypothesis. The immediate significance of our study is its potential to uncover a dose-dependent relationship between Aiolos expression in Eos and response to IL-5 which would provide rationale for therapy selection for patients based on the Eos phenotype (e.g. Aiolos expression level)."
"9314801","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Physically active individuals have a 20% - 30% reduced risk of developing colon cancer compared with sedentary individuals. Mechanisms to explain the relationship are not established, and little is known about the effects of exercise at the cellular level in humans. Observational data suggests that low levels of physical activity are associated with DNA hypermethylation of specific genes in blood, but there is a lack of research on either the direct effects of exercise on DNA methylation in target tissue (colon), or on the amount of exercise necessary to effect these changes. Aberrant DNA methylation of certain genes has been identified in the normal colon of people at risk for colon cancer and appears to reflect a ?field cancerization? process, whereby the normal colon is primed for carcinogenesis. Previous research assessed DNA methylation levels using established techniques that were unable to detect low levels. This application is in response to NCI PA-15-163 Exploratory/Developmental Clinical Research Grants in Obesity (R21) which invites grant applications that focus on biomarker effects of weight control methods such as physical activity. Using a novel method that we have developed (MethyLight droplet digital PCR, ddPCR), which accurately detects low levels of DNA methylation in normal colon tissue, we propose to investigate the effects of a 12-month exercise intervention on DNA methylation in 4 candidate genes linked to field cancerization in the colon (EVL, MGMT, p14, and ESR1). Sigmoid colon samples were collected at baseline in 202 initially sedentary men and women aged 40-75 years. Participants were randomized to moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (facility and home, goal 360 minutes/week) intervention (N=51 men, 49 women) or control (no change in exercise; N=51 men, 51 women). In the exercise group, mean exercise over 12 months was 370 min/wk in men (102% of goal) and 295 min/wk in women (82% of goal). 12 month sigmoid colon biopsies were obtained in 187 (93%) [N=48 men, N=43 women in the exercise group, and N=48 men and 48 women in the control group]. Primary analyses will test the intervention effect (intent-to-treat) on levels of DNA methylation of the 4 target genes. Secondary analyses will address effect modification by dose of exercise, weight change and fat mass change (measured by DXA). Exploratory analyses will address: 1) effect modification by sex, colorectal adenoma history, family history of colon cancer, intake of folate and B vitamins; and 2) correlations between baseline DNA methylation of the 4 candidate genes with colon crypt proliferation and apoptosis. The proposed research is highly novel, takes advantage of an existing resource, and will inform future trials testing effects of different types and doses of exercise on genome-wide DNA methylation."
"9317762","Project Summary Drug abuse induces and facilitates dopamine neurotransmission through the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, which modifies reward-related behaviors and is associated with the development of drug addiction. Mounting evidence suggests that addicted individuals exhibited significant deficits on the level and signaling of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), which contribute to decreased sensitivity of addicted subjects to natural reinforcers and predispose them to more potent drug stimulation of euphoria. Therefore, D2R presents a highly promising therapeutic target for drug abuse, as supported by both pre-clinical and clinical studies. Although D2R agonists are being intensively studied as therapeutic intervention for drug addiction, their success have been greatly hampered due to poor adherence and efficacy, or associated side effects related to dopaminergic medications. Structural information on D2R will not only reveal its signaling mechanisms, but also provide required information for rational drug design. As a member in the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, D2R is notorious to form diffraction-quality crystals that are essential for the determination of high-resolution structures by X-ray crystallography. This grant proposal aims to develop a comprehensive and robust platform for structural and functional studies of D2R. To achieve this goal, we will address three major aims: 1) develop optimized protocols for obtaining purified receptors in quantities sufficient for crystallization attempts and functional studies, 2) use stable receptors from Aim 1 to screen for optimal ligands and assess the quality of receptor-ligand complexes with an array of quality- control analyses, and 3) co-crystallize receptor-ligand complexes for structure determination and set up receptor- containing nanodiscs for functional studies as well as searching for high-affinity nanobodies or compounds for D2R. This platform will involve multiple steps that are closely interconnected and looped through a forward and backward feedbacks system. Although highly challenging in nature, we have acquired a few human D2R constructs that could be expressed and purified to more than 1 mg protein per liter of biomass in our laboratory, which is essential for the accomplishment of subsequent aims. The significance of this study is multi-fold on dopamine receptor family and related drug abuse studies: 1) gain insights into biased agonism, 2) reveal information on allosteric modulations, 3) screen extensively to produce new high-affinity ligands for D2R, 4) characterize the mechanisms of D2R signaling and ligand selection between different dopamine receptor subfamilies, 5) stimulate structure-based drug design, 6) establish the platform for exploring the polypharmacology of the ligands that target D2R, and 7) pave the road for GPCR/G protein complex signaling studies and understanding the activation mechanism in the future."

The development of a stationary X-ray source DBT system will enable a 3- to over 10-fold decrease in scan time relative to that of existing commercial systems. Shorter scan times improve image quality by reducing instances of patient motion without introducing image blurring due to tube movement or vibration ? keys to exploiting the improved imaging sensitivity of DBT. In addition, it is anticipated that the proposed system could expand the availability of DBT by decreasing up-front capital, operating, and maintenance costs. We expect that lower-cost, higher-performance imaging will accelerate the on-going displacement of full-field digital mammography by DBT, thereby providing more women with higher quality imaging sooner."

"9246147","Realtime Discovery of Inhibitors among Billion Compounds for Preview and Download Current drug discovery collaborations are mainly centered on the high-throughput screening of large libraries of commercially available or proprietary compounds. This rigid modality is inaccessible to most individual researchers, providing little opportunity for leveraging the large number of small-scale assays available in biology research labs. On the other hand, in silico screening methods of an expanding chemical space that is inaccessible to high-throughput approaches are credible and efficient alternatives for developing novel chemical probes of protein function, yet they are not readily accessible to biologists. Our ultimate goal is to empower researchers around the world to use their own in-house small-scale screening assays to validate compounds that they, as experts on their own targets, rationally designed using structure-based pharmacophore methods and large virtual libraries of both commercially accessible and novel, chemically accessible, small molecular weight drug-like compounds that are biased to target protein interactions. In the previous funding period, we have developed open access structure-based platforms that successfully potentiate real time iterative exact pharmacophore matching, model modification and fast database query for a given target. These technologies, AnchorQuery and ZincPharmer, presently screen over 55 million compounds readily synthesizable by multi-component reaction (MCR) or commercially available at the press of a ?click?, supporting drug discovery efforts worldwide. Building on these robust platforms, we plan to improve and significantly expand the design capabilities of our tools for rational drug design. Specifically, our aims are to: (a) expand the chemical space and targets covered by our libraries with novel MCR-accessible virtual compounds biased to target protein-protein and protein-RNA/DNA interactions, as well as natural products; (b) develop new virtual screening technologies for disrupting protein-RNA/DNA interactions and for leveraging natural product chemistry; (c) develop a new in silico hit-to-lead optimization tool to perform on the fly virtual structure activity relationship analysis of a billion size MCR chemical space; (d) improve the ranking, optimization and other analytical capabilities of our virtual screening technology; and (e) actively engage worldwide research groups with in vitro and/or in vivo assays with the goal of developing small molecular weight (ant)agonists.

"9431762","R&R7. Project Summary/Abstract There is a pressing need to better understand specific factors that lead to relapse among individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) in order to improve existing treatments and develop new interventions for this pervasive and costly disorder. While psychological and affective factors have been investigated as predictors of relapse, little is currently known about physiological markers of relapse risk, and most existing research has not taken advantage of newer real-time psychological assessment methods. This investigation is novel in that it will study simultaneously, cognitive factors associated with alcohol relapse such as anxiety and craving, and associated autonomic nervous system processes as they occur in the environment, in order to identify psychological and biological vulnerabilities that may heighten relapse risk for AUD. The study's goal to identify patterns of real-time affect and patterns of affective lability that predict relapse, as well as attendant biomarkers of affect regulation that operate outside of conscious awareness, and thus may add important, objective information about affective regulation that can complement self-report measures in the study of AUD. Further, the training plan outlined in this fellowship will provide the principal investigator with an important set of skills that will grow his capacity to conduct cutting edge research in the areas of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other mental disorders characterized by affect dysregulation. This will be achieved through specialized training in ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a powerful research modality for studying affective and behavioral processes in real time, as individuals interact with their environment. The long-term goal of this program of research and the attendant training plan is to develop integrated biobehavioral treatments for alcohol and other SUDs that address individual vulnerabilities that can undermine individuals' attempts to achieve lasting remission. This study will provide valuable information about the utility and feasibility of applying novel assessment techniques like EMA and ambulatory psychophysiological assessment to the study of addictive disorders, which has the potential to open up new avenues of research.

"9220759","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is defined by dysregulated signaling, enabling cells to sustain proliferation. Phosphotyrosine signaling plays a central role in normal and aberrant signaling networks with a majority of tyrosine kinases implicated in cancer. Differential phosphorylation of the proto-oncogene Src has been observed in numerous cancers including lung, breast, and colon, but technological challenges have limited study of specific phosphorylated residues. Analysis of phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues has been limited by our inability to control these chemical modifications in vivo or in vitro due to a lack of phosphomimetics that fully recapitulate the chemistry of phoshorylated residues. Recent work has demonstrated direct co-translational incorporation of phosphoserine into mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Mek), enabling production of recombinant phosphorylated MEK without co-expression of regulatory proteins. In this scheme, non-standard amino acids like phosphoserine are incorporated via a paired aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and tRNA directed to a TAG stop codon. No analogous system exists for phosphotyrosine. We have furthered this work through the generation of a genomically recoded E. coli, that is optimized for the incorporation of phosphoserine. We hypothesize that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase evolution in the recoded E. coli will enable site-specific incorporation of phosphotyrosine. We will apply this technological advance to deciphering regulation of Src, where previous assays have been limited by inhomogeneously phosphorylated protein. We hypothesize that Src phosphorylated exclusively on its C-terminus domain (Tyr527) will show complete inactivation, while the acquisition of a second phosphorylation event on its SH2 domain (Tyr213) will lead to recovery of function. Specific Aims: This proposal includes two specific aims. The first is to utilize mutagenesis to engineer an optimized tyrosyl aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for amino acids structurally similar to phosphotyrosine. We will then use metabolic engineering to produce a stable phosphotyrosine pool in the recoded E. coli. Finally, we will integrate these components to generate phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, confirming incorporation by mass spectrometry. In the second aim, we will apply this co-translational phosphotyrosine incorporation system to the biochemical characterization of Src. We will produce Src phosphorylated uniquely on its C-terminal inhibitory domain and characterize kinase activity against a series of known substrates in vitro. To study the effects of SH2 domain phosphorylation on inhibited Src, we will express Src dually phosphorylated on the SH2 and inhibitory domains, hypothesizing that SH2 phosphorylation can overcome intramolecular Src inhibition. Relevance: The overall aim of this proposal is to develop and apply foundational technologies to decoding phosphotyrosine-mediated regulation of the proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase Src. We seek to assess the individual contributions of phosphorylation events on Src to reveal physiologically relevant mechanisms of activation."
"9348329","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The mission of TibaRay, Inc. is to develop and clinically translate next-generation radiation therapy technologies for the treatment of cancer, the single leading cause of death worldwide and increasing epidemically. A major advance in radiation therapy (RT) that has increased its curative potential and decreased side effects is the ability to sculpt radiation doses exquisitely in 3D to conform to tumors and spare surrounding normal organs. This dose sculpting is achieved by delivering radiation beams to the tumor from multiple directions, each of which has an optimized spatial intensity distribution. However, the fastest treatment times are still minutes long, limited by both beam intensities in electron linacs and the mechanical systems that are used to direct and shape the treatment beams. To address these major shortcomings of current state-of-the-art radiation delivery systems, TibaRay is proposing a radical new design for RT systems, Pluridirectional High-energy Agile Scanning Electronic Radiotherapy (PHASER), based on patented, novel technologies to produce intensity-modulated therapeutic energy x-ray beams from multiple directions using no mechanical systems to direct or shape the treatment beams. This is achieved by using an array of novel electron linacs each of which uses a magnetic electron beam scanning scheme paired with an extended bremsstrahlung target and multi-channel collimator array system referred to as Scanning Pencil-array-collimated High Speed Intensity-modulated X-ray source (SPHINX). The multiple linacs obviate the need to move a single linac on a gantry to achieve different beam directions and SPHINX eliminates the need for mechanical moving parts, e.g., multi-leaf collimators (MLCs), for therapy beam shaping. Each of the novel linacs used in PHASER are far more efficient and will generate more beam than conventional medical linacs. In the full PHASER design, it is estimated that the treatment time can be reduced to less than one second, effectively freezing physiological motion. The novel accelerator technology uses much simpler manufacturing techniques and production costs for PHASER are projected to be about the same as current state-of-the-art systems and maintenance/downtime costs should be lower. Initial proof of principle for the subsystems needed for PHASER have been demonstrated. TibaRay, in partnership with the Stanford University Department of Radiation Oncology and the SLAC National Acceleratory Laboratory, proposes to design (Phase I), build and test, and optimize a two-beam PHASER prototype (Phase II). In Phase III, TibaRay will develop the full PHASER prototype which will lead directly to commercialization and clinical translation. Our novel technology will help fill a tremendous worldwide need for high-quality, cost-effective radiation therapy for cancer."
"9285298","Abstract  Neurotrophins are essential for differentiation and survival of neurons during development and modulate neuronal plasticity in the adult nervous system. Nerve growth factor (NGF), the best-characterized member of the family, exerts its actions by signaling mainly through two transmembrane receptors, the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Besides promoting survival, NGF can also induce cell death by signaling through p75NTR. p75NTR is re-expressed at high levels by stressed neurons in pathological conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is the most common adult onset motor neuron disease, characterized by the progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death one to five years after symptoms onset. We have shown that in an ALS-mouse model, the re-expression of p75NTR by motor neurons coincides with an increase production of NGF by reactive astrocytes. However, the ability of mature NGF to induce cell death has been challenged because high concentrations of the neurotrophin are required to induce cell death in vitro, at least an order of magnitude higher than the required to promote survival. More than ten years ago, pro-neurotrophins were identified as the pro-apoptotic ligands of p75NTR, able to induce cell death at subnanomolar concentrations. Since then, pro- neurotrophins are considered the physiologically relevant pro-apoptotic ligands of p75NTR, and the field has focused on the regulation of pro-neurotrophin processing as the switch regulating the pro-survival/pro-death signaling of neurotrophins. Our proposal challenges this paradigm and adds a new layer of complexity. It shows that the pro-survival/pro-death activity of NGF could also be regulated by post-translational modification of the mature neurotrophin. Our preliminary data indicate that nitration and glycation confer mature NGF the exceptional ability to induce cell death at physiologically relevant concentrations (10,000-fold less compared to that required by native NGF). In addition, it identified RAGE, the receptor for advance glycation end products, as a new partner of p75NTR in the induction of cell death by post-translational modified-mature NGF. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanism by which post-translational modifications confer upon NGF the ability to signal through p75NTR and RAGE to promote cell death, and to establish its pathophysiological relevance in models of ALS. We will focus on the following specific aims: Aim 1-To identify the signaling pathways activated by post-translational modified-NGF. Aim 2-To elucidate the role of post- translational modified-NGF signaling in ALS cell culture models. Aim 3-To evaluate the effect of inhibiting RAGE-p75NTR signaling on the progression of the disease in ALS mouse models. This proposal will contribute to the current understanding of neurotrophin-mediated death signaling and it will provide in vitro evidence for the involvement of RAGE-p75NTR signaling in ALS pathology. Finally, it will provide in vivo proof for the role of RAGE signaling in astrocytes versus motor neurons and its value as a therapeutic target in ALS. "

"9212114","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic analyses of human cancers have provided a detailed portrait of the mutational events that underlie tumorigenesis. This information has led to the development of targeted therapies that exploit the unique dependencies of cancer cells not shared by their normal counterparts. Although targeted approaches may offer a greater therapeutic window compared to conventional chemotherapies, their utility has been limited due to the prevalence of acquired resistance and the inability to target gene loss.  While targeted therapies can elicit remarkable clinical responses, their duration is often limited as tumors acquire resistance. For the majority of drugs, the cellular mechanisms and pathways underpinning this process remains largely unknown. Furthermore, unlike oncogenic lesions, inactivating mutations that result in a loss of gene function cannot be directly targeted. Though these mutations may confer additional liabilities to cancer cells, uncovering potential genetic vulnerabilities remains a challenging task.  To address both of these limitations, we have developed a novel method for conducting genetic screens in mammalian cells which relies on the bacterial Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system to induce targeted mutation. We have performed several preliminary screens in two human cancer cell lines. Based on these experiments, we propose screening strategies to (1) uncover the genetic basis of acquired resistance and (2) identify synthetic lethal interactions with the loss o tumor suppressor genes. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Elucidate mechanisms of acquired resistance to ponatinib 2) Identify synthetic lethal interactions with loss of components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex  While we will focus our efforts on ponatinib and the SWI/SNF complex, the approaches described in our proposed work will serve as a general template that can be applied to any drug or genetic lesion. These systematic studies may also yield general insights into mechanisms of acquired resistance and synthetic lethality. Finally, results from this work may lead to improvements in existing targeted anti-cancer therapies and the development of novel targeted anti-cancer therapies."
"9291034","PROJECT SUMMARY  The development of highly selective anti-tumor agents continues to be a challenge in drug discovery and this fact has motivated researchers to search for new molecular targets that allow for the discovery of more selective anticancer agents. Recent collaborative work from the Webb laboratory and others has shown that small molecules that interact with certain spliceosome proteins (such as the SF3B1 protein) target a key vulnerability in certain cancers. Progress in this area has been facilitated by the development of potent small molecules (such as sudemycin D6) that we have developed, which show potent in vivo antitumor activity including complete tumor regression in animal models without significant toxicity. Additionally we have contributed to an improved understanding of the mechanism of action of these molecules with our early observation that these small molecules have potent effects on alternate splicing and this activity is the hallmark feature of these antitumor compounds. This validation of the spliceosome as a therapeutic target for cancer presents an opportunity for the discovery of a family of new therapeutic targets and new agents as probes for understanding the basic cell biology of splicing and, potentially, as starting points for new anticancer agents. This grant application proposes the use of a new triple-exon skipping assay that has very recently shown its utility in the discovery new active molecules as the starting points in the development of potent drug-like in vivo probes, which modulate the processing of pre-mRNA. We propose the screening of a larger and more diverse compound library using our novel screen along with the validation of the new active molecules by the implementation of a series of biological assays. We believe that this novel assay will uncover new active molecules that will be used to developing a better understanding of the process of pre-mRNA splicing and its role in diseases such as cancer. Our path forward involves scaling up the screen and implementing a series of biochemical and cell based assays that have already been implemented on a pilot scale. The confirmatory assays would include biochemical assays to determine inhibition against the cdc-like kinase family (CLK 1-4), DYRK1A, and SRPK and cell-based assays to show binding to SF3B1. This project will focus entirely on novel small molecules that target the spliceosome, which is an important emerging target for cancer therapy. The goal for this stage of the project is to identify and validate probe molecules for known targets and importantly to also identify compounds that modulate splicing by targeting previously unidentified splicing targets. A goal for future grant applications would be the development of structure-activity relationships for new compounds and the full characterization of newly identified spliceosome targets."
"9296276","ABSTRACT Quantitative imaging (QI) is positioned to play a central role in providing clinically relevant information about a tumor?s biology and its microenvironment to aid in the design of adaptive therapy trials. While standardization of QI methods have had a great impact in advancing clinical applications of QI to assess and predict response to therapy, preclinical imaging remains a critical component in the translational pipeline of validating advanced QI methods for applications in drug discovery and assessment of response to therapy. Thus, developing QI standards that transcend species and modalities is critical in advancing the application of QI. Standardization of preclinical QI has been limited primarily for two reasons: first, use of unrealistic animal models of cancer, such as established cell lines, to validate QI methods, and second, logistical and technical challenges inherent in preclinical imaging. More realistic preclinical cancer models are thought to be provided by transplantable, patient-derived cancer tissue xenograft (PDX). Leveraging the infrastructure available at Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology (MIR), Human & Mouse Linked Evaluation of Tumors (HAMLET) Core of the Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS), and the Siteman Cancer Center, the WU-C2IR2 will harmonize, optimize, validate, and implement preclinical-clinical QI algorithms, bi-directionally, in a context of an active co-clinical TNBC trial. Interfacing with the HAMLET Core, the Resource will generate credentialed PDX mice matched to the patient?s tumor sub-type in addition to PDX mice generated from tumor biopsies/engraftments. QI algorithms will be optimized and validated in both settings and implemented in the co-clinical trial taking advantage of simultaneous PET/MR Biograph mMR to evaluate the efficacy of advanced multi-parametric PET and MR imaging methods to assess response to therapy in TNBC. To compliment QI efforts, multi-scale analytics of tissue samples will be collected including RNA Seq, pathology, Exome sequencing, among others to integrate with QI to facilitate prediction of response to therapy. All data will be uploaded to a dynamic and modular informatics resource available to the co-clinical community to test new algorithms, and mine for novel leads integrating imaging and multi-scale analytic data to predict therapeutic response in TNBC. Thus, the Resource will rigorously optimize the utility multi-parametric quantitative PET/MR imaging in assessing response to therapy in realistic animal models of cancer and patients and develop QI standards that transcend species and modalities which is critical in advancing the application of QI."
"9414893","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of our NLM Training Program in Biomedical Informatics (NLMTP), which the NLM has supported for twenty years. The program, evolving as biomedical informatics (BMI) itself has evolved, has consistently produced outstanding trainees. In this renewal, we address new challenges to BMI arising from digital information streaming from innumerable sensors, instruments and simulations, which are outrunning our capacity to accumulate, organize and analyze it. Advances in BMI are needed: 1) to make sense of datasets that may be massive, heterogeneous or even contain errors, 2) to cull from them important insights into fundamental problems of biomedicine and 3) to convey information in ways readily understood by researchers and clinicians. These are fundamental BMI problems, which we will address in the NLMTP renewal. We will emphasize health care/clinical informatics (HC), translational bioinformatics (TB) and clinical research informatics (CR), areas in which our trainees will contribute to progress needed to gain the full wealth of knowledge embedded in genomic, proteomic, genetic, epidemiological, and clinical data and a full return on our substantial investments in health information technology. Our trainees will bring to each of these BMI domains what we call data-driven inference and decision making (DIDM) by which we mean the use computer programs to seek associations in databases whose complexity hides such relations from even expert humans and cognitive informatics and decision making to make such discovered patterns intelligible to humans. Our pre-doctoral trainees will be selected from graduate students who have completed one year of study at one of six participating institutions. NMLTP training will combine DIDM and BMI specific courses and research to engage them with the range of opportunities in HC, TB and CR suggested above. We also will involve pre- and postdoctoral trainees in a set of courses and activities to facilitate their integration into the BMI community. Over many years, our NLMTP has brought computation, mathematics, statistics, simulation and advanced imaging to bear on biomedical problems that were before deemed intractable. Now our researchers are deploying powerful new computational methodologies for data exploration on an unprecedented scale that offer exciting opportunities for the training to prepare a new generation of BMI professionals. We are requesting 9 pre-doctoral and 6 postdoctoral positions for this renewal."
"9303704","Abstract Foxp3+ CD4 T cells (Tregs) play a key role in regulating immunity and tolerance. Defects in Treg generation and/or functions are directly associated with uncontrolled immune activation leading to the development of autoimmune diseases. Yet, the precise mechanisms by which Tregs express the functions remain unclear. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a myelin antigen specific autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) mediated by myelin antigen specific Th17 type CD4 T cells. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model that shares clinical and histological features with MS, and is widely used to investigate the pathogenesis as well as to develop an approach to treat the disease. Increasing evidence suggests that Treg function may be dysregulated in MS patients or EAE bearing mice. Thus, identifying pathways that improve Treg function is an issue of clinical importance to develop a potential therapy targeting Tregs. The major goal of this application is to test the role of IL-27 in Treg function. We recently reported that IL-27 signaling in Tregs plays an essential role in suppressing Th17 type inflammation in the intestine. We utilized a newly developed Treg-specific Il27ra-/- animal and found that Treg-specific IL-27R deficiency results in a severe EAE. CNS infiltrating CD4 T cells producing proinflammatory cytokines were uncontrolled in the presence of Il27ra-/- Tregs, while IL-10+ CD4 T cells implicated in regulation of inflammatory responses remained unchanged. Genome wide microarray analysis revealed that IL-27 stimulation in Tregs induces Lag3, a CD4 like molecule implicated in negative regulation of T cell activation. We then used a novel Treg-specific Lag3-/- animal and found that they also develop severe EAE, suggesting that Treg expression of Lag3 may be critical to mediate IL-27-induced Treg function. Finally, IL-27 prestimulation in Tregs significantly enhances suppressive function both in vitro and in vivo. The overall hypothesis is that IL-27 controls Treg suppressive function during EAE and that Lag3 induced by IL-27 signaling plays a key role in mediating IL-27 effect on Tregs. We also propose that the suppressive function of Tregs can be improved by IL-27 prestimulation, reversing ongoing inflammation in the CNS. Three specific aims are proposed. Aim #1 will test the role of IL-27 signaling on Treg function during EAE. Aim #2 will test To test the role of Lag3 during IL-27-mediated control of Treg function. Aim #3 will test the mechanisms by which IL-27 prestimulated Tregs efficiently reverse ongoing neuroinflammation. We anticipate that the results from this study will identify novel mechanisms by which IL-27 modulates Treg function via Lag3 to downregulate inflammation in the CNS. Completing the proposed studies will provide an important basis for the development of new strategies targeting the IL-27/Lag3 axis in Tregs to treat MS, and chronic inflammation in other tissues."

Since 1992, the Hopkins India Fogarty AITRP has trained 103 Indian scientists at Hopkins, in a wide range of epidemiology and basic science research programs, of whom 99 (95%) returned to India to apply their Fogarty research training. The Fogarty AITRP has led directly to the establishment of highly productive, successful and sustainable HIV research programs at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) and Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Medical College (BJMC). BJMC has also participated in 20 years of continuous HIV NIH-supported research and is now a well- established Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). We now propose, in this application, to strategically expand the institutional research capacity and scientific leadership at BJMC in HIV-TB epidemiology, clinical and laboratory research. The HIV-TB Research Training Program will be led by Dr. Bob Bollinger, the India Fogarty AITRP Director for the past two decades. He will work closely with Dr. D. B. Kadam, Head of the Department of Medicine at BJMC, who will be the Coordinator of the Fogarty HIV-TB Research Training Program. A 3 Phase post-doctoral training program for junior and midlevel BJMC faculty will include strategic short- and long-term training activities, mentored research projects, research workshops and establishment of a Data Management and Biostatistics Training Core at BJMC. During Phase I (Years 1 and 2) ten BJMC faculty (6 epidemiology/clinical research and 4 lab trainees) will participate in strategic short-term trainin activities. Successful completion of Phase I will provide these 10 faculty an opportunity to compete for Phase II training (Years 2-4), which will include 4 in-depth training opportunities (2 mentored MPH degree programs and 2 mentored postdoctoral laboratory research fellowships). These 4 Phase II faculty trainees will then be responsible establishing The BJMC HIV-TB Research Leadership Team during Phase III (Year 5), which will demonstrate sustainable institutional capacity through their own participation as mentors for 5 additional BJMC faculty trainees. The design of this HIV-TB training program reflects key lessons learned over the past 20 years about building institutional research capacity in India. The impact of our program will also be optimized by the leadership of a highly experienced Training Advisory Committee (TAC), by participation 14 experienced Hopkins faculty mentors, including 2 full-time Hopkins faculty based in Pune, as well as the distance learning infrastructure and experience of the Hopkins Center for Clinical Global Health Education. As with our prior AITRP program, success of this program will be demonstrated by peer-reviewed publications, particularly manuscripts first-authored manuscripts by Fogarty trainees, grant submissions and demonstration of institutional leadership and local mentorship of other faculty and students, by the BJMC Fogarty Leadership Team."

"9297627","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne member of the Flaviviridae family that have been known to case sporadic outbreaks in Africa and Southeast Asia. Although ZIKV disease is primarily spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito of the Aedes specie, recent evidence indicates that the disease can also be transmitted by sexual contact. Recently, ZIKV has been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome and to microcephaly in infants of infected mothers, a condition where infants are born with abnormally small heads. The explosive recent pandemic of ZIKV infections throughout South and Central America, the South Pacific and the Caribbean, and the potential threatening to the United States represents the most recent unexpected arrival of an arthropod-borne viral disease in the Western Hemisphere over the past 20 years. Moreover, increase in temperature will impact the spread of the Aedes mosquito and also ZIKV disease. Currently, there are no FDA- licensed vaccines or antivirals to combat ZIKV infection in humans. The significance of ZIKV in human health and the lack of prophylactic (vaccines) and therapeutic (antivirals) methods to combat ZIKV infection, highlight the importance of developing safe and effective countermeasures to combat ZIKV- induced disease in humans.  The central goal of this application is to test the novel hypothesis that a single-cycle infectious (SCI) virus based-approach can be used to develop a safe, immunogenic and protective live-attenuated vaccine (LAV) to combat disease caused by ZIKV infection in both, fetuses and pregnant women. The bases for our hypothesis are: 1) existing evidence that this approach can be used to effectively generate different SCI RNA viruses, including flaviviruses; 2) immunization of validated animal models with SCI RNA viruses, including flaviviruses, has been shown to be safe and able to provide, upon a single immunization dose, complete protection against a subsequent lethal challenge with wild-type (WT) forms of the viruses; 3) SCI and WT viruses have the same protein sequence and hence identical immunogenic properties; 4) SCI RNA viruses contain a deletion of the viral envelope glycoprotein, thus making reversion to a WT virulent virus impossible; and 5) generation of SCI RNA viruses can be rapidly achieved combining the use of reverse genetic approaches with constitutively expressing viral glycoprotein-expressing cell lines. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop reverse genetic approaches for ZIKV (Aim 1) that will be used to generate SCIrZIKVs (Aim 2). These SCIrZIKVs will be used to develop a safe, immunogenic and protective LAV (Aim 3) to combat ZIKV disease in fetuses and pregnant mice (Aim 4). The knowledge we have accumulated in both, the use of RNA virus reverse genetic techniques (including flaviviruses) and the implementation of SCI viruses for the generation of LAVs demonstrate that we have the expertise and knowledge needed for the successful implementation of this approach for ZIKV."
"9226059","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting vascular remodeling has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for neurorestorative therapy. Cerebral vascular trauma leads to inadequate cerebral blood flow which potentiates neuronal cell loss resulting in motor and cognitive deficits in models of brain injury. Endothelial cells (ECs) lining the blood vessels actively respond to tissue trauma. Our novel findings demonstrate, cell-to-cell contact proteins called Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (EphR), and their ephrin ligand(s), are present on cerebral arteriole ECs and play a central role in limiting arteriogenesis in the murine brain following injury. The research objectives in this application focus on the novel growth suppressive mechanism(s) of EphR signaling on arteriole remodeling and neural recovery. Endothelial-specific deletion of EphR resulted in significant neuroprotection and restoration of blood flow which reflects a monumental change in arteriogenic growth and production of pro-arteriogenic factors. We hypothesize that activation of EphR signaling mediates neural tissue damage and dysfunction by suppressing the EC response during arteriole vascular remodeling. To test this, we will employ novel cell-specific and inducible knockout mice, double reporter labeling and adoptive transfer. We will also investigate the relevance and mechanisms of injury-induced arteriogenesis in neural recovery using gain- and reverse-of-function infusion approaches. These studies will reveal a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance this important adaptive process which will greatly impact treatment and management of acute and chronic head injuries."
"9247837","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resource provides unique primate reagents and services not available commercially in support of NIH funded investigators using nonhuman primates (NHP) as pre-clinical models for vaccine efficacy and immunotherapies. State of the art investigations of immune responses related to human infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, organ and cell allogeneic and xenogeneic transplantation models or immunization procedures that use nonhuman primate models increasingly include the use of recombinant cytokines, chemokines, growth factors or immunomodulatory ligands in vivo. While the close evolutionary relationship between human and nonhuman primates results in cross reactivity between most human recombinant factors when used with NHP cells, differences in affinity/bioactivity have been noted. More important however, most NHP molecules are not identical to human homologues, often leading to the development of neutralizing antibody responses to the xenogeneic molecule in vivo, markedly restricting the repeated and most optimal in vivo use of select immunomodulators in these models. The ready availability of standardized purified recombinant NHP reagents has largely alleviated this limitation and allowed investigators to address seminal questions using NHP during the past 11 years of funding. In addition, testing of in vivo administration of these reagents has markedly revised the clinical administration schedule, leading to more tolerable and efficacious dosing. Thus, this application requests continued support for allowing this Resource to provide NHP factors, in DNA and protein form. Specifically, the resource will perform the following: 1. Continuation and expansion of preparation, testing and distribution of NHP cytokines/chemokines and soluble receptors in protein and recombinant DNA expression vectors. 2. Characterization and in vivo testing of soluble cytokine receptors as immune modulatory enhancers. 3. Generation of modified fusion cytokines for enhanced bioavailability and synergistic bioactivity. 4. Generation of noncommercially available monoclonal antibodies to NHP cytokines in collaboration with the NIH Nonhuman Primate Immune Resource (Dr. Reimann)."
"9178064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditionally thought be a speech-dedicated area, the planum temporale (PT) has been implicated in a host of functions including speech perception, tonal processing, auditory-motor integration, spatial hearing, and audio- visual integration. The present proposal uses the lesion method to test hypotheses regarding the causal role the PT region plays in these functions while at the same time providing important new clinically relevant information. We will assess these functions in a large sample of stroke patients to measure the severity, prevalence and relations between these abilities and correlate deficits with lesion location using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) augmented by additional methods. Healthy controls and a hearing impaired comparison group will also be tested. We propose three specific aims selected for basic science theoretical import and maximal opportunity for future clinical translation. Aim 1: Understand the role of spatial hearing in stroke-induced communication impairment. In two experiments with stroke patients we will measure speech in noise comprehension with and without spatial cues as well as non-speech auditory streaming acuity using a rhythmic release from masking paradigm. Lesions associated with these deficits will be mapped with VLSM. Aim 2: Understand the neural basis of audiovisual speech integration. AV speech has been shown to improve speech intelligibility over auditory speech alone and could potentially benefit individuals with speech recognition impairments do to aphasia. Our pilot data in stroke patients indeed shows that AV speech can facilitate speech recognition in some patients, but also that it can paradoxically interfere with speech recognition in other patients. The effect it has appears to vary with lesion location. We propose a McGurk task as one probe of AV integration and AV synchrony judgments as a second. Lesions associated with these deficits will be mapped with VLSM. Aim 3: Characterize auditory-motor function and organization of the PT region. Auditory-motor integration is unequivocally central to speech development, speech motor control, and speech impairments such as conduction aphasia and possibly stuttering. Here we use repetition tasks with words, non-words and melodic stimuli-which we used to map the auditory-motor circuit in our fMRI research-as one assay of auditory-motor integration in stroke patients to assess speech specificity of the circuit. In addition, we use computational model-driven measurement of the auditory-motor component of a picture-naming task. Lesions associated with these deficits will be mapped with VLSM. -- The present proposal will illuminate the organization of PT region, the relation between different but functionally related speech systems, and potential pathways for clinical translation."
"9284363","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A variety of mutations in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans extend lifespan, such as in insulin signaling, mitochondrial or other conserved cellular pathways. Our new findings on the regulation of reproduction and longevity by systems that surveil the core components of eukaryotic cells for microbial attack reveals a new paradigm for regulation of longevity. Our previous studies have shown that inhibition of these core cellular pathways can extend lifespan and activate xenobiotic detoxification and innate immune pathways and increase longevity. Consistent with this view, long lived dwarf mice as well as long lived daf-2 insulin like receptor mutant C. elegans strongly induce xenobiotic detoxification genes. The major activity of this grant proposal is to test whether the many mutants we have isolated which either inappropriately activate detoxification pathways or fail to activate such pathways have consequences on the lifespan of the animal. We already have many of these mutant strains from our preliminary studies and we propose to test particular sets of mutants and combinations of mutants for lifespan effects of detoxification and immunity programs. We continue to focus on C. elegans in this proposal because compared to mouse genetics, C. elegans genetics is about 100x more economical. And we translate our findings to mouse and human by using our results as a prism through which the mammalian literature can be interpreted. For example, the coupling of longevity control to xenobiotic detoxification is a rather neat explanation for why human females live longer than human males: if females have a higher set point for detoxification, as suggested by the morning sickness of pregnant women and the huge gender bias of anorexia nervosa as well as autoimmune disease and migraines, all could be explained by induction of xenobiotic detoxification and innate immune programs in females rather than the self-destruction post reproductive programs. This would be most dramatic in centenarians. We also explore how the natural microbiome of C. elegans as well as the natural microbiome of humans interacts with these surveillance of core eukaryotic cellular process programs. Our early results established that particular bacterial species disrupt the response to mitochondrial or ribosome toxins or mutations. We propose to screen through collections of hundreds of bacterial strains for such activities and to initiate bacterial genetic analysis on those gene activities. We expect that this analysis will be a model for how to study the microbiome, not via the descriptive metagenomic analysis but by single bacterial species testing for microbiome bacterial countermeasures for other bacterial toxins."
"9333558"," ABSTRACT Conventional methods for adult and pediatric tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment monitoring rely heavily on time-consuming bacterial culture or unquantifiable DNA assays to detect the presence of small numbers of bacteria. Pediatric TB management is particularly difficult because current organism-based methods for diagnosis and treatment monitoring are resource-intensive, invasive and inadequately sensitive for children, who tend to have paucibacillary disease. Due their immunological immaturity, young children are at high risk of rapid disease TB progression, with significant morbidity and mortality. Assessment of their treatment response relies on subjective measures, limiting children's access to much needed shorter and safer TB regimens. More rapid and rigorous methods of TB diagnosis and treatment monitoring are thus critically needed for children. In order to address current limitations in pediatric TB management, we propose to develop a rapid diagnostic method, independent of mycobacterial isolation, that quantifies the low molecular-weight M. tuberculosis (Mtb) antigens (CFP-10 and ESAT-6) and the TB-associated host marker IP-10 in patient blood samples. ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are ideal biomarkers to detect active TB and its treatment response, and addition of IP-10 to this Mtb-specific proteomic pattern will provide an integrated profile of patients' pathophysiological changes during anti-TB treatment, while also improving diagnostic sensitivity. Our strategy utilizes hollow, energy-focusing TiO2 NanoShells functionalized with custom antibodies specific for Mtb CFP-10 and ESAT-6 and host IP-10 peptides with high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) to increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated an Mtb-antigen-only version of this NanoShell-MS platform (no anti-IP-10 NanoShells) with 292 adult and 102 pediatric patients and controls chosen from five highly relevant cohorts (adult, pediatric and latent TB, HIV/TB co-infection, and non-TB mycobacterial infection), from our global collaborators. NanoShell-MS sensitivity and specificity for active TB (bacteriologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed) were, respectively, 90.7% / 97.7% in adults and 88.2% / 100% in children, with 78.6% sensitivity in culture-negative pediatric TB patients, greatly exceeding the WHO's published 4-15% Xpert sensitivity in this cohort. NanoShell-MS results can be obtained within one hour of sample collection compared to 4-6 weeks for conventional culture, and detected decreases in blood Mtb antigen levels within four days of anti-TB treatment initiation. In this proposal we aim to 1) use NanoShell-MS profiling to develop a quantitative prediction model for active TB diagnosis in large, well-described prospective pediatric TB cohorts and 2) determine the utility of our approach for rapid evaluation of treatment efficacy. Our NanoShell-MS assay platform has the advantage that it uses accurate, high-throughput mass spectrometry, which has become a critical means for clinical diagnosis in many parts of the world, while integration of our NanoShell-MS platform with an easy-to-use ?miniaturized? (shoebox size) MS system which should also allow this approach to serve pediatric patients in resource-limited areas."
"9259191","Project Summary / Abstract Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common developmental anomaly, occurring in 1-3% of live human births. CHD often manifests as a primary structural defect, however, palliation of these malformations is frequently incomplete, and can result in the development of cardiomyopathy and heart failure later in life. Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs) are a common and particularly severe form of structural CHD, characterized by a common atrioventricular junction, and are often caused by malformation of the atrial septum (AS). The AS is derived from a population of cells called the posterior Second Heart Field (pSHF), a heterogeneous subset of progenitors that contributes to the developing inflow tract after the initial formation of the cardiac chambers. Our lab and others have demonstrated a requirement for functional transcription factors (TFs) and active signaling components, including those of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, for normal atrial septum formation from the pSHF in mice. Preliminary gene expression analysis performed in our lab has demonstrated that a lack of Hh signaling in the pSHF of E10.5 embryos leads to a downregulation of several progenitor-specific genes, and an upregulation of genes characteristic of cardiomyocyte differentiation. We have also now demonstrated that the positive Hh TF, Gli1, is absent from differentiating cardiomyocytes and the repressive Hh TF, Gli3T, is present in differentiating cardiomyocytes in vitro. Finally, we show that chromatin profiling can be used to identify a network of progenitor-specific, Hh TF-controlled distal regulatory elements. We hypothesize that Hh signaling may function to regulate Foxf1a and additional progenitor genes in the pSHF via distal regulatory elements through a switch mechanism whereby the presence of active Hh signaling leads to the upregulation of genes required for the maintenance of a progenitor state, and a lack of Hh signaling represses these genes, leading to cardiomyocyte differentiation. This proposal will define the mechanisms by which Hh signaling in the embryonic second heart field directs the formation of the atrial septum, and illuminate the network through which Hh TFs control the timing of cardiac progenitor differentiation. Defining these progenitor transcriptional networks will allow for better prediction of AVSD risk and inform a strategy for primary prevention."
"9428564","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In my previous studies, performed in the Jackson Aging Center at the Jackson Laboratory, we used mouse models with a focus on understanding the genetics, physiology and pathology of aging, as well as identifying genetic loci and genes that regulate aging and healthspan. In these studies, we characterized the aging phenotypes of different inbred strains and identified that development traits, such as circulating IGF1 and age of female sexual maturation, are significantly correlated with longevity across the mouse strains. We further verified this correlation by showing that depressing IGF1 by a natural allele could delay female sexual maturation and extend longevity. Using the genetic and bioinformatic methods, we identified a potential aging gene, nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 (Nrip1). We found that the Nrip1 knockout females have a significantly lower level of circulating IGF1 and delayed age of sexual maturation compared with wild-type controls. Other groups have reported that depressing Nrip1 could significantly reduce fat tissue, increase insulin sensitivity and enhance resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes.  I am applying the K01 award to support my career development, from identifying candidate genes for aging to investigating the underlying mechanisms. In this study, I will: Aim 1.Characterize the effects of NRIP1 deficiency on metabolism traits and IGF1 signaling in aging. We will test if the protective effects of knocking out Nrip1 could persist through aging. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that depressing Nrip1 expression in white fat tissue would improve metabolism during aging. Nrip1 null mice are retarded in growth and impaired in female reproduction. To identify a therapeutic target, we will test whether knocking out Nrip1 in white fat tissue would improve metabolism. The tissue-specific knockout of Nrip1 will also provide a valuable model to further understand the role of Nrip1 in the regulations of metabolism and aging. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that global and white fat tissue-specific reduction of Nrip1 expression would extend longevity. We will compare longevities of Nrip1 null and white fat-specific knockout mice to wild-type controls. To investigat the interaction between Nrip1 and diet restriction, we also will compare longevities for these two mutants to wild-type controls under diet restriction.  Nrip1 has wide and complicated effects on regulating metabolisms that relate to many biological mechanisms, including insulin sensitivity, growth hormone/IGF1 signaling, inflammation, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. These mechanisms have also been suggested as critical to regulating aging. In this project, we propose to use a combination of techniques to study these mechanisms. Thus, if the proposal is awarded, I will not only learn many new research techniques that will significantly enhance my research skills, but I will also study many important aging-related biological mechanisms that are important for building my knowledge of the genetic network of regulating aging. It will also give me a chance to explore the potential therapeutic targets for translational medicine. Importantly, as I continue to build on the solid foundation of genetic aging research from my previous studies, this award will significantly contribute to my long-term goals of revealing the genetic network and molecular mechanisms that regulate aging, as well as identifying novel therapeutic targets for interventions of translational medicine that extend healthspan.  To ensure the success of my career development, we have assembled a team of experts in the areas that are proposed to be studied in this proposal. My mentor (Prof. A. Bartke), co-mentor (Prof. H. Van Remmen) and consultants/collaborators (N. Barzilai, J. Kopchick, M. Adamo, M. Parker) have considerable experience in writing and evaluating grant proposals, as well as in researching diverse areas of mammalian endocrinology, metabolism, intracellular signaling and molecular biology pertinent to the biology of aging. We have also developed a complete plan for enhancing my research skills and pushing my career forward, including communicating with my mentor, co-mentor and consultants, training in critical techniques, attending conferences, writing papers and applying new research grants, as well as mentoring younger researchers."
"9317673","Project Summary:  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in the western world. One main problem in the treatment of CRC tumors is the formation of incurable metastases. Mortality is particularly associated with the occurrence of metastases in the liver. There is an urgent need for developing efficacious prevention or treatment approaches for hepatic metastases of CRC.  The long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand cellular metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions and to devise creative approaches for the treatment of cancer and metabolic diseases. One fundamental change in cancer is the alteration of glucose metabolism. Cancer cells exhibit high rates of aerobic glycolysis, in which a majority of pyruvate derived from glycolysis is converted to lactate instead of entering mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen. The cellular metabolic mode associated with aerobic glycolysis allows cancer cells to avoid complete oxidation of glucose. As a result, a significant amount of glucose is shunted to metabolic pathways for production of NADPH and metabolic intermediates, which provide the reducing agent and building blocks required for biosynthesis for proliferation. Pyruvate flux into mitochondria can be dramatically enhanced through mitochondrial uncoupling, a process that allows protons to cross the mitochondrial inner membrane without producing ATP. As a result, mitochondrial uncouplers lead to a ?futile? oxidation cycle that promotes complete oxidation of glucose. We hypothesize that safe mitochondrial uncouplers are potent anti-cancer agents. Mitochondrial uncoupling could be induced by uncoupler protein 1 (UCP1), or by chemical uncouplers. Niclosamide is an FDA- approved anthelmintic drug that is a mitochondrial uncoupler. In our published study (Nat. Med. 20: 1263-1269), we demonstrated that niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN), a salt form of niclosamide, is primarily distributed in mouse liver, where it uncouples mitochondria. Oxyclozanide, a veterinary anthelmintic drug, is also a mitochondrial uncoupler with similar pharmacokinetic properties as NEN.  The goal of the proposal is to test this novel cancer chemotherapeutic strategy and to find prototype anti- cancer agents for treating hepatic metastasis of colon cancer. Three specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis using pharmacological (NEN and oxyclozanide) and genetic (ectopic UCP1 expression) approaches in three hepatic metastatic CRC mouse models: (1). an immune competent tumor transplantation model; (2). a patient- derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model; and (3). a genetically modified mouse model (GEMM) model.  A positive outcome could have significant impact on cancer chemotherapy in general. The study will also have high translational potential and clinical implication, in particular for treating metastatic colon cancer."

This proposal aims to define key components of the striatal circuitry that process limbic information in mice and to understand how opioid peptides alter these circuits in the context of reward-guided behavior. A systematic anatomical and functional analysis of limbic projections to opioid-rich striatal microcircuits will be conducted using genetic tracing methods and ontogenetic tools in brain slices. New photochemical reagents will be employed in combination with ontogenetic to identify opioid-sensitive circuit components and determine how intercompartmental volume transmission shapes the spatiotemporal dynamics of opioid signaling. Genetically-targeted calcium imaging experiments will reveal how these actions translate into changes in network function. To provide evidence for endogenous opioid release in the context of goal-directed behaviors, activity patterns observed during reward-guided tasks will be driven in brain slices ontogenetically while electrophysiological monitoring opioid signaling in brain slices. To identify a functional role, opioid receptors will be blocked during reward-guided behavioral assays using a new photoactivatable antagonist that enables transient inhibition within discrete striatal sub-regions in vivo. To detect the release and spread of endogenous opioids with high sensitivity good spatiotemporal resolution, optical sensors will be developed by chemically modifying receptors so that they report the presence of endogenous agonists. A chemical- genetic strategy for cell-specific pharmacology will be developed to reveal which cellular targets of opioid signaling underlie behavioral responses to opioid peptides and opiate drugs. By targeting native receptors in genetically-identified cells, ths tool provides a powerful means to study opioidergic pathways in the brain. Collectively, these studies will uncover mechanisms by which opioids modulate a neural circuit involved in goal-oriented behavior. By quantifying signaling dynamics in new ways, the role of volume transmission will emerge. Although these novel techniques focus on opioids, the underlying principles are general, and should be applicable to signaling molecules beyond the nervous system. The anticipated findings should facilitate our understanding of disorders in which goal-directed actions are compromised such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and addiction to substances of abuse."
"9333960","PROJECT SUMMARY Ewing sarcoma is a rare tumor that occurs in children and young adults. The driving oncogenic event in this disease is most commonly the translocation EWS/FLI. Similar translocations involving ETS transcription factors occur in other malignancies, including prostate cancer, broadening the potential relevance of our studies. Prior work has determined that EWS/FLI can lead to chromatin reprogramming by repressing some enhancers while activating others through direct binding. Our own data indicates that EWS/FLI also upregulates expression of lncRNAs. The primary goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular function of lncRNAs in Ewing sarcoma. Our preliminary data indicates that two lncRNAs, EWSAT1 and EWSAT2, may be involved in the oncogenic effects of Ewing sarcoma. Knock-down of either of these RNAs strongly decreases proliferation of Ewing tumors in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, RNAseq analysis indicates that both of these lncRNAs repress a significant number of genes also known to be repressed by EWS/FLI. Our primary goal in this proposal is to elucidate the molecular function through which these lncRNAs act to promote Ewing sarcoma. We will focus our studies on determining how these lncRNAs lead to transcriptional repression. In Aim 1, we will elucidate define how expression of EWSAT1 and 2 alters key protein-protein interactions in Ewing cells. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that EWSAT1 or 2 expression alters PPIs for EWS/FLI, EWS or hnRNPK. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that EWSAT1 or 2 function by modulating the ability of EWS/FLI to bind to specific enhancers. ChIPseq and ChIRPseq will be used to determine how these lncRNAs interact with chromatin and how they alter binding of histones and other chromatin regulators. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the functional consequences of EWSAT1/2 loss or overexpression using Ewing patient derived xenografts and cell lines."
"9307305","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in the United States. In our recent reports, we demonstrated tumor promoting role of Sprouty2, an endogenous suppressor of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/ Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in colorectal cancer (CRC). In order to establish in vivo role of Sprouty2 in cancer we recently generated Sprouty2F/F mouse in our laboratory. The objectives of this RO3 application are to characterize the model and study the effect of embryonic (Sprouty2F/F-Villin Cre) and postnatal (Sprouty2F/F-Villin CreERT2) deletion of Sprouty2 on CRC progression. Our rationale for these studies is that establishing in vivo role of Sprouty2 gene in CRC would allow us to submit a mechanistic RO1 application. In vitro studies from our laboratory utilizing cell culture models, orthotopic and metastasis mouse models demonstrated oncogenic potential of Sprouty2 in CRC. In preliminary studies, we also established that TAT dependent Sprouty2 protein transduction or Sprouty2 stable transfection favors cancer phenotype. On the contrary suppression of Sprouty2 supports epithelial features in cancer cells and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from Sprouty2F/F-Villin CreERT2 mouse. However, requirement of Sprouty2 in CRC progression in vivo is not established. Effect of embryonic and postnatal Sprouty2 deletion in Sprouty2F/F-Villin Cre (embryonic deletion) and Sprouty2F/F-Villin CreERT2 mouse (tamoxifen dependent postnatal deletion), respectively, will be studied during AOM/DSS induced colonic carcinogenesis. We will also examine effect of Sprouty2 deletion in vivo on intestinal cell differentiation and lineage by utilizing both mice groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effect of in vivo deletion of SPRY2 on CRC progression and intestinal cell lineage. We have established our hypothesis based on our past and recent publications. The proposed study is a multi-prong approach to prepare us for a RO1 application."
"9300592","The innate immune response is an ancient, non antigen-specific defense system made up countermeasures that restrict the replication of pathogens early in infection. A successful innate response promotes the secretion of cytokines, particularly interferons (IFNs), that shape the later pathogen-specific acquired immune response. Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the processes that lead to the production of type I interferons (=IFN?/?) via IRFs, and the biological responses elicited by them via STAT proteins. Although IFN?/?, IRFs, and STATs have been extensively studied in the context of pathogen responses in adult organisms, their role in infectious processes during gestation has remained largely unexplored. For instance, even though interferons were discovered decades ago, it is still not clear whether they cross the so-called blood-placenta barrier, or at what point a developing fetus is capable of responding to a pathogen encounter with its own production of interferons. Similarly, it is unclear if interferons contribute to pathogen-associated birth defects. Indeed, many perinatally transmitted pathogens (e.g. hCMV, Rubella, LCMV, more recently Zika virus) are known to give rise to congenital birth defects, however, it is unclear whether the pathogen per se, or the resulting immune response is responsible for developmental deficiencies.  A novel reporter mouse strain we conceived allows for the visualization of IFN?/? encounters and provides a time-integrated picture of interferon responses. Additional reporter knock-in strains in the IFN? or IFN? locus permit the monitoring of interferon production. We intend to utilize these mice in the context of crosses to animals lacking components of the interferon system to study the induction, transmission and the effects of interferons at various stages of gestation. PolyI:C, which mimics dsRNA and thus viral infection, is a potent inducer of IFN?/?. In aim 1 we will investigate whether the IFN?/? eliciting responses in the fetus after injection of the maternal animal with PolyI:C is derived from the fetus itself, or has been transmitted through the placenta from the maternal side. Conversely, we will test whether IFN?/? might be passed from the fetus into the bloodstream of the maternal animal. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is frequently used in labs to study persistent infections by more dangerous related viruses (HIV, HCV, HBV, and now Zika virus), and causes severe birth defects similar to Zika virus. In mice, LCMV rapidly spreads systemically, is transmitted perinatally and strongly induces type I interferon production. IFN?/?-receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice are unable to clear LCMV and develop a persistent viral infection. Thus, in aim 2 we propose to use our reporter mouse strain, and crosses designed such that either only the maternal animal, or only the fetuses are IRF and/or IFN?/?-receptor deficient, to monitor type I interferon production, responses and viral loads during infection. We expect the proposed studies will significantly extend our understanding of the contributions of IRFs and type I interferons to the unique immunological environment that exists during the gestation period."
"9220825","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cell surface expression, intracellular trafficking, and signal transduction by the family of G protein coupled receptors is tightly regulated by numerous proteins that interact with receptor cytoplasmic domains. Mutations in or altered expression of these receptor interacting proteins (RIPs) disrupt the complexes that anchor the receptor and its effectors and thus perturb receptor localization, trafficking and stability and cause defective receptor signaling. Several RIPs have been shown to bind to the sst2A somatostatin (SS) receptor, the therapeutic target for the SS analogs used as primary medical therapy for pituitary and other hormone secreting neuroendocrine tumors. SS analogs slow tumor progression and inhibit the secretion of bioactive tumor products thereby controlling the debilitating and potentially life-threatening symptoms produced by hormone secreting tumors. Unfortunately, SS analogs fail to control hormone hyper-secretion in a large fraction of patients. The factors that cause variability in patient responsiveness to SS analog therapy are not understood but do not result from mutations in the sst2A receptor and cannot be explained by an absence of sst2A mRNA expression. The fundamental hypothesis for this application is that sst2A receptor interacting proteins play a critical role in the responsiveness of hormone secreting tumors to SS analogs and that the interaction of these proteins with the sst2A receptor is dynamically regulated. In this proposal we plan to identify proteins associated with the sst2A receptor in pituitary tumor cells and characterize the functional consequences of the identified interactions on the cell surface expression of the sst2A receptor, on its intracellular trafficking and stability, and on its ability to activate the signal transduction pathways known to mediate SS inhibition of pituitary hormone secretion. In addition, we will determine how the association between the sst2A receptor and its interacting partners is dynamically regulated both at the cell surface and within endocytic compartments. The proposed studies will provide new understanding into the molecular mechanisms that control sst2A receptor signaling, trafficking and expression. Moreover, our results will generate protein candidates whose essential functions may be perturbed in hormone secreting tumors and thus contribute to resistance to SS analog therapy. Finally, they may suggest potential targets for drugs that act downstream of the sst2A receptor to bypass defects in receptor signaling and thus allow improved control of hormonal hypersecretion by pituitary tumors."

"9229208","Project Summary The broad objective of the research is to definitively test a primate model that already shows evidence of beta amyloid (A?) plaque accumulation to determine whether there are cognitive and behavioral deficits that correlate with plaque accumulation, and whether the deficits are specifically ones also found in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in humans. Cognitive tasks that show a unique decline in AD patients include immediate forgetting, category set shifting failures, and visuospatial search failures. A matching-to-sample task, a traditional memory task for animals, is employed to test forgetting over short periods of time of various sets of objects. It is also used to measure accuracy and delays coincident with target objects that are not central to view or target objects that have overlapping features and are thus harder to detect in visual search. A dimensional change card sorting (DCCS) task commonly used to test toddlers who also fail to shift sets is used to measure resistance to switch in the primate model. Individual differences in cognitive tasks and in general vital behaviors (foraging, social, motor) are tracked over time and used in a multiple regression analysis to determine the best predictor of A? plaque accumulation and neural degeneration post mortem. Immunohistochemical assessment in brain tissue will verify the presence of A? plaques through the use of antibody tagging and cell death through the use of Nissl stain. If successful, the methods will elucidate proper tasks for AD-like cognitive measurement in primate models. Finding a good set of tasks to evaluate primates who naturally accumulate A? plaques should lead to new medical and training procedures for AD that can be developed in primate models. "

"9317207","Mucin 1 (MUC1) is aberrantly overexpressed in ~90% of human breast cancers, including the triple-negative (TNBC) subtype, and is associated with poor progression-free and overall survival. MUC1 has thus emerged as a highly attractive target for the treatment of TNBC; however, to date there are no approved agents against this heterodimeric transmembrane protein. What is needed now, at least in part, is therefore the development of novel agents that target MUC1-C for the treatment of patients with refractory TNBC. Importantly, MUC1 consists of two subunits: an extracellular N-terminal mucin subunit (MUC1-N) that is shed from the cell surface, and a transmembrane C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) that is oncogenic. MUC1-C functions as an oncoprotein by acting as a node for integrating signaling pathways linked to transformation. In this way, MUC1-C drives (i) the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), (ii) self-renewal capacity, and (iii) tumorigenicity of TNBC cells. Early attempts at targeting MUC1-N with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were unsuccessful because this shed subunit circulates at high levels in the blood of women with breast cancer. As an alternative approach, we have generated novel MAbs against the non-shed MUC1-C extracellular domain. These MAbs have provided a unique opportunity to develop antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that specifically target MUC1-C on the surface of breast cancer cells. Our MAbs are also being advanced for the development of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and for combinations with other immunotherapies. Recent Phase I trials using single-agent anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 blockade have demonstrated objective and durable responses in heavily pretreated, metastatic TNBC, supporting the premise that evasion of immune destruction contributes to TNBC pathogenesis. Our hypothesis is that our ADCs will be effective against MUC1-expressing breast tumors in our immunocompetent mouse models and that killing these tumor cells could reverse, at least in part, the immune suppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment. In this R21 application, our immunotherapeutic approaches targeting MUC1-C will be developed for clinical evaluation based on their effectiveness against TNBC cells growing in vitro and in animal models. The overall objective of the proposed work is thus to improve the immunotherapy of breast cancer. Our hypothesis is that MUC1-C is an attractive target and that our immunotherapeutic approaches can be developed for patients with TNBC."

"9198254","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) and rapid infant weight gain are important determinants of a child's lifelong risk of obesity. It is particulrly important to improve these outcomes in the Latino population, where rates of obesity and its associated comorbidities are higher than in the general population. The proposed study (GROW Baby) will test how a behavioral intervention supports healthy maternal GWG (Aim 1) and healthy infant growth (Aim 2). By developing a nested sub-cohort from an ongoing randomized healthy lifestyle trial known as Growing Right Onto Wellness (GROW), GROW Baby will collect new data from both Latina women who become pregnant and their infants born during the study. GROW is a culturally tailored intervention that teaches healthy nutrition and physical activity for both mother and pre-school child (aged 3-5 years). The control condition is a school readiness program. Because intervention-group mothers who become pregnant during the study learn these healthy lifestyle skills prior to or early in pregnancy, the intervention has the potential to support healthy maternal GWG and future infant growth. A committed primary mentor and a multidisciplinary team of co-mentors will oversee the candidate's progression to becoming an independently funded physician scientist with a focus on leveraging healthy behavior changes during pregnancy to prevent and treat maternal and child obesity. The career development plan integrates advanced training in behavioral interventions, community engagement methods, the maternal- child interaction, and targeted approaches to underserved populations. The candidate will gain exposure to senior mentors with expertise in behavioral trials and perinatal nutrition, and will participate in 1) advanced coursework; 2) an ongoing intervention to prevent pediatric obesity; 3) community engagement activities; and 4) a multi-pronged approach applying cultural sensitivity skills to community research with Latino populations. In conducting the proposed research, the candidate will advance the field of maternal-child obesity prevention by understanding how a behavioral intervention implemented before and during pregnancy could support healthy weight for both mother and child."

The SURP research education program will continue to be under the oversight of an Internal Advisory Committee, and student selection and progress monitoring accomplished by a Student Selection and Mentoring Committee. As such, we are fully committed to providing training to talented college students, from currently underrepresented backgrounds, to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse population."
"9311684","SUMMARY Osteosarcoma is the most frequent primary malignancy of bone and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in adolescents. In patients without demonstrable metastasis at the time of diagnosis, surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy have resulted in long-term survival rates that approach 70%. However, for patients with metastatic or relapsed osteosarcoma, there is currently no reliable therapeutic option to provide long-term tumor control, emphasizing the urgent need for a better understanding of the disease.  In our efforts to unravel a potential role for the homeodomain protein TGIF in osteosarcoma pathogenesis or progression, we undertook an in vivo mutagenesis approach using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) system. We found that simultaneous deletion of the Tgif gene and activation of SB mutagenesis either in limb bud mesenchymal cells or in committed osteoblasts culminated in the development of highly metastatic osteosarcomas that display recurrent loss of p53 and p16Ink4a (p16), two suppressor genes frequently altered in human osteosarcoma. Congruently, ectopic expression of TGIF suppressed proliferation of osteosarcoma cells in a manner dependent on p53 and p16. To further dissect the functional interplay between TGIF and p53/p16, we explored a physical interaction between TGIF and Twist1 that we identified in a yeast two hybrid screening, because Twist1 has been shown to restrict both p53 and p16 expression, and more crucially, the Twist1 gene is frequently amplified or overexpressed in human osteosarcoma. We found that TGIF associated with and repressed Twist1 transcriptional activity, leading to p53 and p16 accumulation and an attendant suppression of osteosarcoma cell proliferation. In human osteosarcoma, loss of TGIF expression, which is due in part to the disruption of the TGIF gene, is associated with tumor aggressiveness, implicating TGIF as a potential prognostic marker and possible target for attenuating deregulated cell proliferation in this malignancy.  Collectively, these findings prompted us to hypothesize that TGIF might function as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma by antagonizing Twist1 expression and activity and thereby facilitating integration of the p53 and p16 cytostatic programs. We also hypothesize that deregulated TGIF expression might be exploited to define a signature to improve prognostic of osteosarcoma as well as to design innovative therapeutic strategies to curb this lethal malignancy. These overarching hypotheses will be tested in the following specific aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of TGIF in osteosarcoma pathogenesis and progression, focusing on its functional interaction with p53, p16, and Twsit1. Aim 2: Explore the mechanisms by which TGIF restrains osteosarcoma progression, focusing on its ability to antagonize Twist1 expression and activity. Aim 3: Establish the clinical relevance of deregulated TGIF expression in osteosarcoma. Comprehensive characterization of this newly discovered tumor suppressor gene will likely open up new opportunities to the osteosarcoma field, both in terms of delineating the underlying mechanisms, and in terms of prognosis and drug discovery."
"9255836","We propose to develop a topical formulation for preventing or treating oral mucositis. Oral mucositis is a common and harmful side effect of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in cancer patients that affects nearly 500,000 patients in the US annually and can be dose-limiting, impairing the clinical ability to continue the otherwise needed therapy and that also greatly impacts the patient's quality of life due to pain, loss of function, and increased infections. There remains a huge unmet clinical need, with a market value of approximately US$1 billion. Despite the high frequency of oral mucositis in both radiation and chemotherapy patients, its negative impact on the clinical ability to apply sufficient doses of these therapies to patients, its debilitating nature on the affected patients, and the associated high financial costs of oral mucositis per patient, there is no effective intervention currently available for the majority of patients at risk. One promising approach is protecting the oral mucosal cells through the application of topical agents that upregulate cell protection mechanisms in the oral mucosa prior to radiation therapy. We are developing a therapeutic agent (PB201) that activates the Nrf2 (NFE2L2, Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Like 2) cell signaling pathway which in turn upregulates radioprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory genes and is a promising candidate for preventing or treating oral mucositis. We have examined the Nrf2 activating properties of PB201 in a variety of cell types, have identified and tested a backup agent from the same molecular class in case PB201 fails during development, and have created a prototype of the intended aqueous oral formulation of PB201. Briefly, our preliminary data supports the hypothesis the PB201 is a potent Nrf2 activator in a variety of cancer and normal human cell types and is a strong candidate for development as a topical oral mucositis drug. In Phase I of this multiphase project, we will create and test a topical formulation of PB201, examine Nrf2 activation and gene expression caused by the PB201 formulation in cultured human oral mucosal cells, and perform efficacy studies of the topically-applied PB201 formulation in a hamster model of radiation- induced oral mucositis. Our preliminary data suggests that the likelihood for success is high in this Phase I project, and we are planning to continue the work in a Phase II SBIR project including expansion into fractionated radiation and chemotherapy models of oral mucositis and ADME and toxicological measurements as we develop PB201 in an attempt to meet the unmet need for new therapeutic approaches to oral mucositis. Development of safe, effective, topical treatment that upregulates cell protection mechanisms in the oral mucosa prior to or after radiation or chemotherapy would be a significant advancement."

Although some effective treatments are available, most of those diseases remain undertreated. This is mainly because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the delivery of systemically-administered drugs. As a result, only 5% of the more than 7000 small-molecule drugs available can currently treat Central Nervous System (CNS) diseases. Safe and localized opening of the BBB has been proven to present a significant challenge. Focused Ultrasound (FUS), in conjunction with microbubbles, remains the sole technique that can induce localized BBB opening noninvasively and safely. Prior to our studies reported herein, the bioactivity and therapeutic potential of the trans-BBB delivery was unknown. In this renewal study, we aim at determining 1) the role of the FUS technique in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in established mouse models (aim 1), 2) build a new FUS system with neuronavigation capabilities for demonstrating proof of concept of neuroprotection in NHP (aim 2) and 3) build a clinical system and test initial feasibility and safey in a small cohort of patients (aim 3). In this renewal, the primary objective is thus to challenge the FUS technique for demonstrating therapeutic effects in AD models, translating those in large animals and demonstrating clinical feasibility. The underlying hypothesis of the proposed study is thus that the neurotherapeutic potential demonstrated in the previous funding period translates to neurotherapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease including initial clinical feasibilit. The multi-disciplinary team assembled encompasses all critical specialty areas involved, such as ultrasound and microbubble engineering as well as MRI, PET and fluorescence brain imaging, drug delivery, behavioral assessment and mouse model development as they pertain to neuroscience and neurology. The specific aims are thus to: 1) Demonstrate neuroprotection and neurorestoration in the AD mouse model in vivo; 2) Build a new system for accurate targeting and demonstrate therapeutic effects in NHP in vivo; and 3) Build a new system for accurate targeting in humans in vivo."
"9242648","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An interdisciplinary consortium of investigators from the Departments of Ophthalmology and Pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin in collaboration with the Northwestern University Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Biomedical Engineering, Urology, and Pediatrics, and the University of Nebraska Center for Drug  Delivery and Nanomedicine, proposes to increase the pace at which basic science discoveries on disease mechanisms can be translated into therapies for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a stated goal of the R24 National Eye Institute Translational Research Program on Therapy for Visual  Disorders. This scientific partnership will employ its diverse scientific expertise to characterize and test potential therapies for exudative AMD in animal models by using a combination of cutting-edge physiological, chemical, analytical and imaging approaches. By screening novel peptides derived from endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis for their ability to prevent neovascularization in animal models that mimic AMD, we will accelerate drug development before testing in humans. Improving drug delivery to the eye as an integral part of these experiments will also be a high priority. Specific goals of this project are to: (1) determin whether the peptide mechanisms of action in the eye are through their mimicry of these natural inhibitors; (2) Produce and identify optimal new derivatives of benchmark peptides best suited to intravitreal treatment of AMD, where these are ranked by efficacy in CNV models, individually and in combination; (3) Select and tested the most active peptide(s) and their most slowly cleared formulations for efficacy in AMD models. The best candidate(s) will undergo GLP production and then safety testing, including retinal safety to select a suitable new peptide-based entity for clinical development; and (4) Establish preclinical basis for ultimate human treatment protocol for this entity through animal models of retinal disease examined via state-of-the art in vivo retinal imaging and histopathological analysis. Ultimately, the experimental result of these interrelated aims will guide us in developing more successful therapies for those afflicted by currently incurable blinding diseases with a neovascular component."

"9310997","Project Summary  Despite early detection and adjuvant therapy, breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality in women, largely due to distant, incurable recurrences arising years, or even decades, after treatment of the primary tumor. These recurrent, metastatic tumors arise from the pool of residual local and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) that survive primary treatment and persist in the host in a presumed dormant state. Indeed, the presence of bone marrow DTCs following treatment is independently associated with a substantially increased risk of recurrence. At present, however, the mechanisms enabling residual tumor cells to maintain dormancy and ultimately recur are poorly understood, and DTC-directed treatment approaches are non-existent. Consequently, the ability to biologically characterize and therapeutically target dormant DTCs would be a transformational new approach to preventing recurrence and the mortality associated with it.  Increasingly, treatment for cancer patients involves targeted therapies. In particular, targeted inhibition of HER2 in breast cancer patients in the adjuvant setting represents a clear example in which residual tumor cells can be kept at bay for extended periods of time. Using genetically engineered mouse models that faithfully recapitulate tumor dormancy and recurrence, we have discovered that tumor cells that survive targeted HER2 inhibition exist in a state of cellular dormancy at both local and distant sites, and retain the ability to resume growth and give rise to recurrent tumors for the lifetime of the animal. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that dormant residual tumor cells that survive targeted therapy share multiple features with tumor cells that are dormant by virtue of being exposed to microenvironmental cues in the bone marrow and other sites.  We hypothesize that tumor cells surviving targeted therapies exist in a dormant state resembling that induced by microenvironmental cues, that the mechanisms underlying dormancy at local and distant sites are related, and that features of dormancy observed in mouse models are recapitulated in patients. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Determine the functional and phenotypic relationship of tumor dormancy in DTCs surviving targeted therapy or microenvironmental selection pressures; (2) Determine whether similar mechanisms regulate tumor dormancy at local and distant sites; and (3) Determine whether bone marrow DTCs in breast cancer patients in the I-SPY SURMOUNT trial exhibit features of tumor dormancy similar to those in mouse models. These aims will be accomplished using a novel flow cytometry approach to isolate and profile DTCs in mouse models and breast cancer patients, and by functionally evaluating mechanisms regulating dormancy on the survival and recurrence of RTCs at local and distant sites, and in contexts in which dormancy has been induced by targeted therapy or the microenvironment. Results of the proposed studies have the potential to transform treatment options for breast cancer survivors by enabling efforts to target the unique vulnerabilities of dormant DTCs, thereby preventing metastatic breast cancer recurrence."

"9040444","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain management is a significant unmet medical need. Anandamide is an endocannabinoid mediator that plays important roles in the regulation of pain. Previous work has shown that endocannabinoid receptors located outside the central nervous system (CNS) exert a powerful regulatory control over pain initiation. The biological actions of anandamide are stopped by the enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). To explore the role of anandamide in the peripheral regulation of pain, our lab has developed a novel class of FAAH inhibitors that do not enter the CNS. The lead compound in this class, called URB937, exerts profound analgesic effects in animal models, suggesting that peripheral FAAH blockade may offer an innovative approach to pain therapy. Work done during the Phase 1 of the present application has demonstrated that URB937 (a) suppresses postoperative pain in mice more effectively than do currently used analgesics; (b) does not cause side effects typical of those drugs (i.e., sedation, constipation, gastric damage); (c) shows a high degree of target selectivity; (d) has excellent oral bioavailability in rats; and (e) exerts no genotoxic effcts in the Ames' test and does not inhibit the human potassium hERG channel. These results identify URB937 as a suitable candidate for preclinical development in postoperative pain, an extremely common but still underserved pain condition. The objective of present proposal is to complete all key activities needed to enable the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) for URB937 in postoperative pain. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Synthesis and physicochemical characterization of URB937. We will produce a large-scale lot of URB937 for use in nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies. Aim 2. Drug metabolism (DM) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of URB937. We will collect the DM-PK data necessary to support the IND filing of URB937. Aim 3. Nonclinical toxicology properties of URB937. We will collect the toxicology data necessary to support the IND filing of URB937. Aim 4. Nonclinical pharmacodynamics of URB937. We will develop a circulating biomarker for peripheral FAAH inhibition, which will be of great value during the clinical development of URB937. The proposed studies will be coordinated by an experienced team of scientists and pharmaceutical professionals, which include Anteana's cofounders, Professor Daniele Piomelli and Dr. Miguel Garcia-Guzman, Professor Andrew Rice (Imperial College, London), a world-recognized leader in pain therapy; along with and independent consultants Dr. Edward Monaghan (Soar Pharmaceutical Development Services: preclinical development); Dr. Fred Reno (toxicology); Dr. William Schmidt (NorthStar Consulting, health economics); Dr. Jason Brittain (JNG Pharmaceutical Consulting, Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls); and Dr. Richard Lowenthal (Pacific Link Consulting, regulatory affairs). We expect that the successful completion of our studies will provide the data needed to file an IND for URB937 and allow us to raise the private capital necessary to bring this compound to clinical proof of concept."
"9291018","Project Summary  The goal of this grant is to develop enabling technology and systems that address fundamental limitations in microsurgery with a specific focus on vitreoretinal surgery. Due to the inherent micro-scale and the fragility of the neurosensory retina, vitreoretinal surgeons can be challenged by physiological hand tremor where the tremor amplitude is larger than retinal structures, delicate movements that are below tactile sensation, and multiple cognitive decisions that are required when executing high-risk movements, such as during retinal vein cannulation (RVC). Nevertheless currently vitreoretinal surgery is at the limits of human physiological performance and lacks the adequate technology that could further improve the technical performance. This situation is less than optimal and can significantly benefit from the recent advances in medical robotics, sensor feedback and human machine interface design. Robotic assistance may be ideally suited to address common problems encountered in the performance of the demanding micromanipulations in retinal microsurgery.  We propose a robotic system with enhanced real-time multisensory feedback that assesses multiple points of instrument contact located both inside and outside of the eye. Our comprehensive system will enable the surgeon to manipulate tools based on quantitative feedback that will prevent mechanical injury by implementing safeguards against the application of excessive and previously unmeasurable forces at the eyewall and the tool tip. Our aims are: (1) Develop and demonstrate in vivo position/force hybrid control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy for safe robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery: real-time sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy will be uniquely used to control the robot through a machine learning method that adaptively learns a nonlinear mapping from user behavior to sclera-force/position and predicts unsafe motions; (2) Develop and demonstrate in vivo force-input control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the tool-tip for safe robot-assisted vein cannulation: real-time tool- tip-to-tissue interaction force sensing and non-linear robot control algorithms based on observing the user behavior will be used to control the tool-tip position and force and to prevent entry into subretinal areas during RVC; (3) Demonstrate safe robot-assisted RVC in rabbit model in vivo: real-time, position/force hybrid control algorithms based on dual-point (tool-shaft and tip) information fusion will provide sensorimotor guidance of surgical maneuvers during RVC. Statistically significant results in vivo, in clinically realistic conditions will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.  This highly innovative system will enable surgeons to perform maneuvers in a tremor free environment with a higher level of precision than previously possible and with the ability to sense forces on a scale that have been previously imperceptible. We envision this development as a logical next step in the integration of man, machine and computer for the performance of unprecedented microsurgical maneuvers."
"9288741","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  More than 50% of all spinal cord injuries occur at the cervical level. At this level are the phrenic motor neurons which innervate the diaphragm. Therefore, injuries at this level can lead to the inability to breathe. The overall objective of this grant proposal is to examine the changes which take place chronically in the phrenic circuitry of the cord in response to cervical spinal cord injury and investigate and optimize potential therapies that can restore breathing long after injury. Through these studies, an effective intervention can be translated to a significant population of the spinal cord injured community. In this proposal we will utilize chronic cervical spinal cord-hemisected animals which have half of the diaphragm paralyzed. In our earlier studies we observed that enzymatic (chondroitinase ABC) removal of extracellular matrix molecules, called chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which block plasticity, regeneration, and sprouting, led to restoration of function of the once paralyzed hemidiaphragm when administered at or near the time of injury. Recovered diaphragmatic activity was rhythmic and synchronized. In stark contrast, when the spinal cord of chronically injured animals was stimulated with chondroitinase ABC and intermittent hypoxia training, chaotic and unstructured activity resulted, suggesting slowly developing and potentially maladaptive responses to injury. However, the use of chondroitinase alone at chronic stages can promote normal rhythm and dramatically enhance properly patterned functional recovery. This grant proposal seeks to: 1) understand the time course and carefully describe the maladaptive processes that take place; 2) understand the mechanisms underlying the production of this newly discovered atypical activity at chronic time points; and 3) learn how to overcome these negative responses to injury so that interventions and rehabilitative strategies can become more effective, thereby leading to improved functional outcomes. Overall, these studies will provide insight on the basic mechanisms that underlie maladaptive, as well as functionally beneficial plasticity that can lead to robust functional respiratory motor recovery at chronic stages of spinal cord injury."
"9217581","This research is focused on the molecular mechanisms that govern whether a primary breast cancer will or will not become aggressive, metastatic and thus life threatening. At present, the ability to predict such aggressiveness is imperfect, in that there is great inter-individual variability in the behavior of a group of tumors that are all classified together in one of the major subgroups of breast cancer and thus predicted to share a common prognosis. At present, this inability to generate accurate predictions of the future behavior of individual breast cancers leads to aggressive treatment of the great majority of diagnosed tumors, when only a minority are destined to become life threatening. The research describes three major determinants of malignant progression of breast cancer cells and how they conspire to generate aggressive behavior. These are (i) the ability of carcinoma cells to release pro-inflammatory signals; (ii) the reciprocal responses of nearby mesenchymal stem cells within the stroma of tumors to these carcinoma-derived signals, resulting secondarily in the release of signals that have the potential of inducing carcinoma cells to move from an epithelial(benign) to mesenchymal (malignant) state; and (iii) the propensity of the carcinoma cells to respond to these stroma-derived signals by undergoing this shift in differentiation state, thereby acquiring highly aggressive characteristics. The propensity of cancer cells to move from an epithelial/benign to a mesenchymal/malignant state appears to be governed by the state of the chromatin associated with the  gene that encodes ZEB1, which functions as the key molecular governor of the epithelial vs. mesenchymal states. Examining the chromatin configuration of this gene- more specifically the covalent modifications of the histones associated with the promoter of this gene - holds the promise of revealing the proclivity of a breast cancer cell to activate its program of malignant conversion, often termed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition."
"9307224","Project Summary/Abstract Short-term fasting has been shown to provide host protective effects from the toxicity associated with high- dose chemotherapy. We found a novel protective effect conferred by short-term fasting when treating mice with high dose chemotherapy. We demonstrated that fasting mice for 24 h confers protection to small intestinal (SI) stem cells from high-dose etoposide. We also showed increased survival in mice that have been fasted for 24 h prior to treatment with toxic doses of radiation. We will test the hypothesis that the metabolic changes associated with fasting lead to epigenetic changes in SI stem cells, which in turn, leads to expression of genes whose protein products protect SI stem cells from lethal DNA damage. This hypothesis will be tested in fasted mice exposed to high-dose etoposide and mice exposed to high-dose radiation. The clinical applications of our findings will be evaluated in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer."

"9331951","Project Summary: This program will have a major impact in the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in men and women globally. Premenopausal women are less susceptible to heart disease than men, and this protection is lost after menopause. Emerging data suggest that the interplay between nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), the nitroso-redox balance, plays a critical role in this sex-related cardioprotection. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying these gender differences is critical for development of effective therapies. S-nitrosylation (S-NO) of cysteine thiols is a major signaling pathway through which NO exerts its broad regulatory actions. It is increasingly appreciated that the underlying signaling fate of NO ultimately depends upon an intracellular state of nitroso-redox balance; such that excessive production of ROS can disrupt physiological S-NO and that CVD may reflect dysregulated protein S- NO. We have shown that the nitroso/redox balance is an important regulator of CV health and disease. Female mice have 65% more S-nitrosylated proteins in the heart6 and physiologically regulate this elevated level of S- NO with increased activity of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase (GSNOR), an enzyme that promotes protein denitrosylation. We previously showed that male mice lacking S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase, an enzyme that governs S-NO levels by promoting protein denitrosylation (GSNOR??? mice) exhibit improved survival after myocardial infarction (MI). Furthermore, pregnant GSNOR?/? mice exhibit all of the clinical features of a major complication in pregnancy, preeclampsia (PE), including maternal hypertension, proteinuria and abnormal CV adaptation. Poor outcome in the GSNOR?/? females may be due to oxidative stress, as our preliminary data shows that cardiomyocytes (CMs) from GSNOR?/? females generate more ROS as compared to CMs from control females and GSNOR?/? males. Therefore, the state of increased S-NO can lead to an adverse milieu if accompanied by oxidative stress and we have uncovered a sex-associated relationship between cardiac pathology and intra-cellular nitroso-redox imbalance, which is dependent on NO and ROS production and S-NO formation and denitrosylation. Our central hypothesis is that the absence of GSNOR produces a sex-specific, antioxidant milieu in the setting of normal ROS levels (i.e., males) but one of nitrosative/oxidative stress when ROS is elevated (i.e., females). Our proposal aims to identify the fundamental mechanisms underlying this dichotomy. The specific aims are to test the hypotheses that 1) differences in nitroso-redox protein signaling determine sex-specific responses to CV stress; 2) nitroso-redox imbalance in cadiomyocytes during pregnancy underlies pregnancy-related CVD; and 3) GSNOR produces sex-specific changes in the S-nitrosylation of proteins that alter CV function. Together these aims will provide novel insights into nitroso-redox regulation of cardiac function in response to physiologic and pathophysiologic stressors and have significant implications for the treatment of CVD in men and women."
"9432704","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emphysema is a prevalent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) induced predominantly by cigarette smoking is defined as the combination of chronic bronchitis (in the airways) and emphysema, which characterized by excessive cell apoptotic cell death of alveolar lung structural cells and chronic inflammation. Because alveolar structures are essential for gas exchange in the lungs, loss of this tissue component in emphysema affects life quality and health dramatically. Current COPD therapy targets mainly the airways, and no treatment is available for halting loss of parenchymal lung tissue. The founders of EmphyMAb have made the discovery that pro-apoptotic and monocyte stimulating cytokine endothelial monocyte activating protein (EMAPPI) is upregulated in the human bronchoalveolar lavage of current-smokers and of COPD patients who were ex-smokers. Enhanced levels of EMAPII in the murine lung can be experimentally induced by exposing mice to cigarette smoke (CS); furthermore, lung-specific transgenic overexpression of EMAPII causes emphysematous pathology in mouse lung. The strong correlation between disease pathology and EMAPII levels suggested modulating levels of this cytokine might be a useful therapeutic intervention in emphysema. To this end, the EmphMAb team developed an EMAPII specific neutralizing rat monoclonal antibody (mAB), which abrogated functional and morphometric manifestations of CS-induced emphysema in mice when administered either concomitantly or after prolonged CS exposure. The team succeeded in generation of a partially humanized chimeric antibody with only slightly less affinity and activity in comparison to the parental one. In this Phase I application, EmphyMAb and its partners at Indiana University plan to fully humanize and increase affinity of the MAb, and determine that the bioactivity and affinity  of this recombinant antibody are better or at least equivalent to the original MAb. The studies proposed here, will be the basis for future goals of establishing a highly specific fully humanized  EMAP II mAB for use in human COPD patients as a first treatment for halting the progressive loss of gas exchange permitting lung tissue."
"9442252","The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in the US over the last two decades, with rapidly rising  and premature adverse health consequences. Women of reproductive age, especially minorities and those  of low socioeconomic status, are at risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes due to excessive gestational weight  gain (GWG) and this further contributes to alarming rates of childhood obesity and diabetes. Preventing  excessive GWG could reduce pregnancy complications and improve long term health of women and their  offspring. Weight control studies in pregnancy are emerging but most studies have emulated traditional  weight control programs through diet counseling and/or increased activity with limited evidence of sustained  adherence. Novel approaches are needed to limit weight gain to Institute of Medicine (IOM) goals, and to  help new mothers adhere to recommended diet, physical activity and lifestyle behaviors they can model for  their families. The proposed research will develop and test a new approach to primary and secondary  prevention of obesity through a behaviorally adapted, nutrient-dense, energy-balanced lifestyle that can be  implemented clinically, assessed objectively and sustained long term through technologically-advanced selfmonitoring  methods. This randomized controlled clinical trial compares with standard care, the GWG of  overweight / obese pregnant women who participate in lifestyle intervention with individualized, motivational  coaching and group sessions to develop self-monitoring of recommended diet and physical activity behavior  long term. Anthropometric, metabolic, diet, activity and lifestyle outcomes will be assessed prenatally and for  at least 12 months post delivery. The Northwestern Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology provides care  for over 12,000 ethnically diverse obstetric patients a year, many of whom participate in clinical trials,  facilitated by a highly functional obstetric research infrastructure. Our multidisciplinary team, experienced in  obstetrics and prevention research, propose innovative technology and enhanced self-monitoring skills to  document whether new mothers can be better prepared to develop and model diet and energy-balanced  lifestyle behaviors for their families and themselves and reduce and prevent obesity long term."
"9207750","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background. 3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a proposed cancer prevention agent that can be given safely to humans in oral form. We showed that DIM protects normal cells and tissues from damage by ionizing radiation. The protection is due, in part, by ATM activation and is potentially exploitable for protecting normal tissues and organs in the radiotherapy clinic. In preliminary studies, DIM did not protect human breast xenograft tumors in nude mice, but strongly protected mice and rats against supralethal doses of total body irradiation up to 13-Gy. Hypothesis. Here, we hypothesize that DIM activates an ATM-dependent cytoprotective DNA damage response (DDR) and antioxidant response without itself causing DNA damage or oxidative stress. We predict differential protection of normal cells relative to tumor cells in vivo because tumors already exhibit constitutive activation of a similar DDR-like pathway and of cellular survival pathways (e.g., AKT, NF-?B, Bcl-2/Bcl-XL). Research design. We propose three specific aims to investigate DIM's mechanism of action and to advance DIM as a candidate clinical radiation protector during cancer treatment. The experimental plan will include studies to: 1) identify the molecular mechanism(s) of DIM radioprotection up- and down-stream of ATM by the use of biochemical, molecular biologic, and genetic approaches; 2) test the effects of DIM on tumor growth and tumor radiosensitivity in response to fractionated radiation treatments; and 3) test the ability of DIM to protect against late radiation effects in normal tissues, using established mouse models for lung and skin toxicity. Significance. The proposed research addresses the development of a novel means of radioprotection of normal tissues in cancer radiation therapy. The ultimate goal is to develop DIM as a clinical radioprotector in order to improve the therapeutic index by allowing higher doses of radiation to improve locoregional tumor control and/or by reducing late dose-limiting normal tissue toxicity at any given dose of radiation."
"9327733","Project Summary  Mammography screening, the only population-based method for the early detection of breast cancer, has been shown to be effective in reducing breast cancer mortality in women aged 50-74 years. In the United States, continuing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in access to preventive health services, including but not limited to mammography screening, pose a major public health challenge. Over the last decade, two macro-level events had a formidable impact on health care access, with profound implications for persistent disparities in cancer screening. In 2007, the recession led to a sharp increase in unemployment and a decline in employer-sponsored insurance nationwide. After implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the expansion of Medicaid in 2014 had the potential to reduce the mammography screening disparities in low- income and minority women. Few studies have hitherto systematically examined the impact of these two events in relation to mammography screening utilization rates within a nationally representative data set while taking into account a large number of multilevel confounding factors at individual and geographic levels. Among women aged 50 to 64 years and participating in the National Health Interview Survey, our specific aims are to: assess potential variations in mammography screening rates by comparing rates before, during, and after the recession due to increases in unemployment (Aim 1a); examine if any associations vary across race/ethnicity or socioeconomic position (Aim 1b); evaluate potential variations in mammography screening rates, comparing rates before and after the ACA Medicaid expansion (Aim 2a), and examine if any associations vary across race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic position (Aim 2b). The proposed work is significant in that it will uncover the impact of these macro-level events on mammography screening?information that will be useful to policymakers and researchers. Our work will be a unique contribution to the breast cancer screening literature, with important implications for informing public policy. Major strengths are: (1) a large, representative and socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse sample of women aged 50 to 64 years; (2) assessment of mammography screening rates before, during and after the recession and the ACA Medicaid expansion; (3) innovative hypotheses focusing on important gaps in screening research since no information exists on the impact of these two events on mammography screening utilization; and (5) multilevel data have been collected on a wide range of potential confounding factors that might modify any associations of the recession and the ACA Medicaid expansion with mammography screening utilization. The interdisciplinary training environment for this proposal will provide the applicant an opportunity to enhance methodological skills, build research competency, and augment content expertise, in order to become an expert in the intersection of cancer screening and social determinants of health."
"9248278","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to identify and characterize drug-like molecules that inhibit ciliary Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Cells orchestrate their behaviors by communicating through secreted signals such as Hh proteins. Unlike other intercellular signals, mammalian Hh proteins are transduced through primary cilia, microtubule-based projections on the surface of many cells. The Reiter lab discovered that a central component of the Hh pathway, Smoothened (Smo), moves to the primary cilium in response to Hh stimulation where it activates the downstream pathway. The cilium is essential for Hh signaling both in embryonic development and in oncogenesis. Activating mutations in Smo cause basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common cancer in the U.S., and medulloblastoma, the most common solid cancer in children. A Smo antagonist was recently approved for clinical use, although cancers can become resistant quickly. Smo antagonists that act through complementary mechanisms may prevent the emergence of resistance in Hh-associated cancers. To identify novel Hh pathway antagonists and gain insight into ciliary function, the Reiter and Arkin labs completed a pilot screen for inhibitors of Smo movement to cilia. This screen identified novel inhibitors, some of which block BCC cell growth by inhibiting Smo translocation and some of which block ciliogenesis. Investigating the mechanisms by which these inhibitors act revealed previously unknown aspects of ciliary Hh signaling. This project will expand the screen, identify the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibitor action, and understand ciliary signaling. Specifically, we will: 1) screen in-house and Chemical Biology Consortium libraries, substantially expanding the chemical space that has been assessed, 2) execute secondary screens to efficiently identify inhibitors that act through previously undescribed mechanisms, 3) use newly identified antagonists, together with unique genetic tools, to uncover unrecognized steps of ciliogenesis and Smo translocation. Despite their importance to both development and disease, the mechanisms underlying ciliogenesis and Hh signaling remain unclear. The proposed investigation will provide tools to reveal how cells communicate through cilia. These compounds may also provide leads for novel chemotherapeutics, critical for preventing the emergence of resistance and relapse in Hh pathway-associated cancers."
"9250631","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in epigenetics has led to the discovery of large multi-protein complexes that catalyze histone modifications and their removal, affecting nucleosomal remodeling that either promotes or interferes with transcriptional access to genes. One of these, the repressive CoREST complex, includes the enzymes LSD1 histone demethylase, HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) and the scaffolding protein CoREST1. The CoREST complex has not yet been well-characterized biochemically in its intact form. The goal of this project is to provide a deeper biochemical understanding of the CoREST complex. Through kinetic analysis of the CoREST complex with post-translationally modified peptide substrates, we expect to reveal cross-talk among histone modifications and the regulatory effects of protein-protein interactions. We hypothesize that the CoREST complex will process multiply-modified histone tails more efficiently that the LSD1 and HDAC1 enzymes acting on their own. Aim 1 will focus on substrate specificity by evaluating the enzymatic activities of the complex on post-translationally modified peptide substrates. Aim 2 will explore active site coordination by analyzing hybrid substrate-inhibitor peptides that can dock the inhibitor moiety in  the active site of HDAC1 or LSD1 and the substrate moiety in the partner enzyme. Furthermore, by varying the distance between these two groups on the same peptide, we hope to determine complex orientation, geometry and the role of protein-protein interactions in enzymatic specificity. In Aim 3, we plan to extend these studies to the more physiologically relevant nucleosome substrates engineered to have specific PTMs. These experiments can reveal whether there are special features of the CoREST complex interactions with this more natural substrate form. Gene expression regulation rarely involves single enzymes catalyzing modifications and investigating intact complexes as a whole is likely to give more accurate insight into their functions. In addition, silencing of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms is a hallmark of cancer and other diseases, and much work from this laboratory and others has been focused on discovering novel inhibitors for LSD1 and HDACs. Therefore, studies on the biological mechanisms of these complexes can not only enhance our fundamental understanding of gene regulation but it can pave the way toward improved therapeutics."
"9315521","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT National surveys show that among U.S. adolescents, e-cigarettes are the most commonly used nicotine or tobacco product. Research also shows that adolescent e-cigarette users? are susceptible to transitioning to combustible tobacco use or dual use (use of e-cigarettes and combustible tobacco), increasing their risk for nicotine dependence. It critical that we better understand the risk factors and health effects associated with e-cigarette use, including the transition to combustible tobacco products and the differential risk for e-cigarette only users and dual users, in order to inform FDA regulations. Research suggests that socio-ecological factors, such as e-cigarette access, perceptions, marketing, and use by others, may lead to a greater susceptibility to future willingness and use of combustible tobacco products. However, extant research is insufficient due to the use of retrospective measures, largely cross-sectional methods, and the focus on between-persons designs. The proposed study will be one of the first to use a longitudinal ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach and baseline CASI survey to examine both within-person and between-persons associations of e-cigarette and tobacco use, intentions, and willingness, and the role of environment and situational factors on adolescents? use of e- cigarettes and tobacco. Data will be collected from 50 adolescents (ages 13-17), who are e-cigarette only users or dual users of e-cigarettes and tobacco, and living in Kentucky, a state where e-cigarette use rates are three times higher than the national average for middle schoolers and two times higher than the national average for high schoolers. Using a framework based in the Social Ecological and Prototype Willingness Models, the specific aims for the proposed study are: (1) to investigate within-person associations among e-cigarette and tobacco access, motivations, exposure, context, intentions, willingness, and behaviors; (2) to investigate between-person associations among e-cigarette and tobacco beliefs, norms, access, motivations, exposure, context, intentions, willingness, and behaviors; and (3) to explore differences between e-cigarette only users and dual users on e-cigarette and tobacco beliefs, access, motivations, exposure, context, intentions, willingness, and behaviors as well as differences among the two groups on personal risk factors. The results of this study will provide strong preliminary data, including estimates of effect sizes, to guide the design of the larger, more rigorous R01 study to address significant shortcomings in the literature and inform FDA?s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) research priorities: (#4) e-cigarette initiation, use, and perceptions, and transitions to tobacco products and multiple use, (#6) the impact of tobacco product characteristics, (e.g., flavors, labeling and marketing) on initiation and use, and (#9) perceptions of tobacco products including the impact of labeling and marketing. In line with the goals of RFA OD 15 004, this study builds on successful collaboration of a promising New Investigator with experienced scientists in tobacco and e-cigarette research for preparation of an R01 that will launch an independent career in tobacco research."
"9307103","Project Summary The proposed research tests the novel concept that mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are coordinately regulated to promote both turnover of old mitochondria but also to facilitate rapid and wholesale re-programming of mitochondria in response to stress. Furthermore, we suggest that this regulated coupling of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis is disrupted in cancers by oncogenic signaling resulting in increased mitochondrial mass and incomplete metabolic switching in response to stress. Finally, we identify novel chemical regulators of these processes that may ultimately be exploited for cancer therapy. These ideas are tested in the aims set out below. In Aim 1, we set out to measure the kinetics and interdependence of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in normal breast epithelia compared to a panel of breast cancer cells, to allow us to identify pathways and commonalities in how these two processes are controlled. We also use proteomic approaches to define changes in mitochondria in response to stress and as a function of intact mitophagy or mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, we develop approaches to ?track? mitochondria to determine whether there are ?stem? mitochondria that are resistant to mitophagy, to which new mitochondrial protein mass is preferentially added. In Aim 2, we leverage data from normal cells examined in Aim 1, and determine how these pathways and signaling events are altered in different human breast cancer cell lines and in primary human breast cancers. We examine whether increased mitochondrial mass is linked to defective mitophagy, increased biogenesis or potentially uncoupling of these process and whether this in turn is associated with specific oncogenic lesions. We use inducible c-Myc systems to address how oncogenic activity driving biogenesis affects coordination with mitophagy and overall mitochondrial mass and whether this plays into a tumor suppressor role for mitophagy and a tumor promoting role for biogenesis. In Aim 3, we identify of FDA approved drugs that promote tumor cell killing by preventing removal of damaged mitochondria, or the generation of new healthy mitochondria, with limited effects on normal cells. Since these drugs are already FDA approved for other purposes, they could be translated to the breast cancer clinic rapidly (within 2-5 years) tailored to their new role as inhibitors of mitochondria housekeeping, rapid tumor cell killing and promoting recurrence-free survival. Overall, we expect to provide insight to novel mechanisms of tumorigenesis that relate to control of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in such a way that may explain the heterogeneity in mitochondrial mass detected in primary human breast cancers.!"
"9310754","Project Summary 53BP1 is essential for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) of DNA lesions and is tightly regulated by reversible phosphorylation. We recently reported that dephosphorylation of 53BP1 at residues T1609 and S1618 in its foci-forming region (FFR), catalyzed by the PP4C-PP4R3? phosphatase complex, is necessary for its recruitment to double-strand breaks (DSB) during G1. Independent lines of evidence suggest that dephosphorylation-dependent recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB could be leveraged in the context of cancer therapy. Mutations in BRCA1, which are frequently found in breast and ovarian cancers, compromise HR and render these tumors exquisitely sensitive to PARP inhibitors. The response to PARP inhibitors is strongly dependent on the function of 53BP1. In fact, depletion of 53BP1 in BRCA1-mutant cells restores homologous recombination (HR) proficiency and renders these cells resistant to PARP inhibitors. Secondly, a mutation in 53BP1 within the sequence spanningT1609/S1618 was identified in a breast cancer patient and we found that this mutation disrupts 53BP1 recruitment to DNA damage foci, and induces resistance to PARP inhibitors. Importantly, the functional deficiency in 53BP1 (deletion or mutation) enhances radiosensitivity. Therefore BRCA1-mutant tumors that develop resistance to PARP inhibitors due to loss in 53BP1 function are likely to respond to radiotherapy. Based on these results we hypothesize that the PP4C-53BP1 axis has significant therapeutic implications specifically in BRCA1-mutant tumors. We have observed that phosphorylation of the Ser840 residue in a fragment in the C-terminus of PP4R3? is necessary for the formation of PP4R3?/53BP1 complex. In Aim 1 we will utilize phosphoproteomic methods to examine the specificity of PP4C/PP4R3? mediated 53BP1 dephosphorylation. Use in vitro binding assays and cell based assays to determine whether the interaction of PP4R3? and 53BP1 is direct, or mediated by other factors. Finally use time-lapse imaging to examine the kinetics of interaction of PP4R3? and 53BP1 during late mitosis and early G1. Our preliminary results suggest that Cdk5 mediated phosphorylation of the Ser840 residue on PP4R3? is critical for the interaction of PP4R3? and 53BP1. Aim 2 will utilize several innovative chemical genetic tools to systematically investigate the connection of Cdk5 with the PP4/53BP1 axis. Using an extremely specific and potent Cdk5 inhibitor, we will determine the precise impact of Cdk5 on PP4R3? phosphorylation during mitosis. 53BP1 foci formation in G1, and broadly assess its impact on DSB repair. Furthermore proteomics coupled to an unbiased chemical genetic approach will allow us to identify other Cdk5 substrates involved in DNA repair in cells. In Aim 3 we will identify and investigate the impact of sporadic mutations in the FFR of 53BP1, a PP4R3?-S840F mutation and inhibition of Cdk5 on olaparib sensitivity of BRCA1-mutant ovarian and breast tumor lines in vitro and for selected ones in orthotopically implanted mouse models. We will test whether olaparib-resistance can be overcome by radiation therapy using a sophisticated a small animal irradiator."
"9435362","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in hnRNPA1 are recently found in multiple families with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). HnRNPA1 is known to regulate RNA processing and to interact with proteins related to varying cellular functions, but how hnRNPA1 mutation causes disease is not known. A critical step towards understanding hnRNPA1 pathogenesis is determining the effect of pathogenic mutation on hnRNPA1 function at both systematic and molecular levels. HnRNPA1, TDP-43 and FUS belong to ribonucleoprotein family and their mutations are all associated with ALS. The three ribonucleoproteins exhibit similarity in disease features: 1) the disease shows an autosomal dominant trait; 2) proteinopathy and mitochondrial impairment is prominent in the disease; and 3) both wildtype and mutant forms cause diseases when overexpressed in animal models. Even seven years after the discovery of TDP-43 mutation in ALS, how TDP-43 mutation causes the disease remains elusive. Our preliminary studies show that both deficiency and excess in hnRNPA1 expression causes neurotoxicity respectively in hnRNPA1 knockdown and transgenic rats, suggesting that hnRNPA1 must be tightly regulated to maintain its normal function. To unravel the effect of pathogenic mutation on hnRNPA1, we created hnRNPA1 knockin rats in which a single pathogenic mutation is introduced. The knockin rats differ from their wildtype littermates in a single nucleotide examined. Any phenotypes detected in the knockin rats must result from the pathogenic mutation. With unprecedented rat models, we will examine how pathogenic mutation impacts hnRNPA1 function at both the systematic and molecular levels, revealing the mechanism by which hnRNPA1 mutation causes neurodegeneration in ALS."
"9236203","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Calcium signals are vital in controlling cellular events. In smooth muscle cells (SMC), short term Ca2+ signals control contractile responses whereas longer term Ca2+ signals regulate cell growth and proliferation through Ca2+-mediated transcriptional control. The proposed studies focus on the two centrally important Ca2+ signal transducers, STIM1 and STIM2. STIM proteins are finely-tuned endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensors. STIM proteins are triggered to self-associate and translocate into specialized ER-PM junctions within whom the STIM proteins gate the highly Ca2+ selective store-operated Orai channels. STIM proteins also target voltage-operated L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC) and exert reciprocal control over these two channel targets, activating Orai but deactivating LTCC, likely important to SMC growth phenotype change in which LTCC is lost and STIM-Orai signaling predominates. While STIM1 has been intensively examined, a major challenge is to understand the role of the poorly-studied STIM2 protein: how differences in its structure, function and expression lead to powerful signaling and phenotypic changes. While whole animal knockout of either STIM1 or STIM2 are lethal, we generated conditional SMC-targeted deletions of STIM1, STIM2, and STIM+STIM2 in mice. The SMC-specific STIM1-KO results in poorly-developed animals dying early, with major defects in the ability of SMC to undergo growth transition, in vivo and in vitro. The SMC conditional STIM1/STIM2 double knockout is perinatally lethal indicating important yet distinct roles of STIM1 and STIM2 in SMC function and growth transition. Using these systems, we have two independent but inter-dependent specific aims 1. To understand the mechanisms and distinctions between STIM1 and STIM2 activation, and to define their molecular coupling to target Ca2+ channels. Using mutational modifications, high resolution Ca2+ and FRET imaging, and electrophysiology, we aim to define the molecular basis of sensing and target channel coupling for STIM1, defining mechanistically important distinctions in the poorly studied STIM2 protein. Building on new structural insights and major functional distinctions between STIM1 and STIM2, our studies focus on defining the interactions through which the two STIM proteins interact with and gate Orai and LTCC target channels. 2. To understand the distinct roles of STIM1 and STIM2 in mediating mitogen-induced growth transition of SMC from the quiescent to proliferative phenotype. Using our SMC-targeted STIM1 and STIM2 null-back- ground mice together with molecular probes to specifically modify STIM1- and STIM2-mediated target channel coupling, we aim to define the differential effectiveness of STIM1 and STIM2 in mediating SMC growth transition. Studies will determine how changes in STIM1 and STIM2 expression and distinctions in their activation and channel coupling, lead to distinct profiles of Ca2+ signals, NFAT activation, and altered growth transition. Our studies apply: (a) new knowledge on the structure and channel-coupling of STIM proteins, (b) innovative STIM1 and STIM2 gene-deletion animal models, (c) innovative probes to assess STIM1 and STIM2 target channel coupling - to provide new understanding of the crucial role of STIM1 in controlling SMC growth transition. Our goals also address a fundamental paucity of information on understanding the mechanism, action and role of STIM2. Information from these studies is crucial to understanding how vascular SMC injury responses occur and how they may be controlled. Our model predicts that distinct patterns of STIM1 and STIM2 expression can be a determining factor in whether SMC undergo phenotype change. Hence the work has fundamental importance in understanding and preventing the SMC growth changes that underlie major vascular diseases including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and arterial restenosis, and SMC phenotype change that underlies lung responses in asthma and angiogenesis that supports growth of tumors."

The instrument will be used to gain comprehensive knowledge of protein complexes, including interactions with appropriate ligands, by studying their kinetics and key dynamics to characterize function and elucidate possible roles in disease modulation. Specifically, the stopped-flow spectrometer will be used to: understand the binding behavior of aggregation inhibitors related to neurodegenerative diseases, probe binding kinetics and dynamics of protein-ligand complexes in solution, study the binding dynamics and conformational changes of shell proteins from bacterial microcompartments, elucidate the folding pathway of membrane proteins, evaluate hemoglobin binding and hemin transfer and measure reaction kinetics of novel bioorthogonal chemistry for the rapid labeling of biomolecules towards molecular imaging applications. The information obtained from this technology enables accurate monitoring, and analysis of reactions that occur on a sub-second level. On campus, only one stopped-flow spectrometer exists. It was purchased nearly 20 years ago and has outdated capacity. Therefore, access to this valuable technology is currently lacking at UCLA. The specific instrument we are requesting is a SX-20 (standard with an absorbance PMT and 150W Xe lamp), produced by Applied Photo Physics. The SX-20 represents the state-of-the-art in stopped-flow technology and exhibits exceptionally high fluorescence sensitivity, optimum speed and robustness for steady state and kinetic experiments. Thus, it is well suited to support the UCLA research community?s needs. The stopped-flow spectrometer will be located in the UCLA-DOE Biochemistry Instrumentation Facility where it will be accessible to the entire UCLA research community. A highly experienced Ph.D.-level staff member and a research technician, with full salary support from UCLA, will be responsible for operating, maintaining, and training individuals on the instrument. UCLA will provide additional funds to support the service contract for the stopped-flow spectrometer to ensure that it is properly serviced for long-term utilization by the broad user community at UCLA."
"9323655","In preliminary work, we identified a unique pre-weaning interval, we refer to as the post-neonatal phase, during which luminal antigens bypass the small intestine (SI) immune system and are assimilated by the colonic immune system. These events coincide with a bloom of tolerance-inducing colonic bacterial taxa, an influx of nave T cells, the translocation of live bacteria, and are followed by the expansion of a long-lived population of microbiota driven ROR?t+ inducible regulatory T-cells (iTregs), which have an enhanced capacity for tolerance, and control of Th2 responses. Our preliminary findings suggest that the timing and orchestration of events in the post-neonatal phase are under maternal control via chronological changes in breast milk, and altering maternal control, or altering of the gut microbiota during post-neonatal phase produce durable (life- long) deficits in tolerance induction, and persistent Th2 responses to antigens encountered throughout life.  We hypothesize that during the post-neonatal phase luminal antigens and specific live gut bacteria are delivered to the colonic immune system and interact with specific cellular immune populations locally in the colon and in distant lymphoid tissues to establish a durable (life-long) and balanced immune system, and that disruption of these time-limited events during early life predisposes to allergic disorders. To explore this hypothesis and this unique period in early life we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Define the bacterial species that disseminate, their cellular and tissue localization, and the host pathways of translocation and antigen delivery during early life Aim 2: Define cellular populations acquiring antigen and carrying bacteria and the fate and function of effector T cells generated in the post-neonatal phase. Aim 3: Define the effects of disrupting events in the post-neonatal phase on the development of tolerance and in models of Th2 disease.  The overarching premise for these studies is that understanding the biological processes imparting the benefits seen with current childhood feeding practices and antibiotic avoidance and understanding these benefits are restricted to a specific time in early life will provide insight into strategies to ?reset? an unbalanced immune response as a therapy for Th2 mediated diseases."

Dr. Han is clinically trained as a gastroenterologist and has a Ph.D. in immunology. He is doing postdoctoral research under the mentorship of Dr. Mark Davis, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University and Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In his proposal entitled The intraepithelial T cell response in celiac disease, Dr. Han aims to better understand celiac disease (CD), an incurable autoimmune disease that affects millions of Americans, and many more worldwide. The research further investigates the observation that intraepithelial T lymphocytes (T-IEL) in CD are deliberately recruited to the intestine in response to gluten. T-IELs are the cells held responsibl for the detrimental consequences of CD, including intestinal damage and lymphoma development. As a follow up, the proposal aims to better understand mechanisms through with T-IEL are activated and recruited to the intestine in CD. The research explores the hypothesis that gluten-specific CD4+ T cell responses enable T-IEL responses directed against antigens other than gluten. The proposed research investigates the nature and mechanisms of T-IEL responses in CD through the following aims: 1) Examine the mechanisms through which gluten enables ?? T cell activation in celiac disease through the study of ?? T cell function in peripheral blood and tissue. 2) Examine the mechanisms through which gluten enables tissue damage by CD8+ T cells in CD. 3) Analyze mechanisms through which T-IELs are activated and recruited to the intestinal epithelium through the study of antigen-specific T-IEL responses in humanized mouse models. These aims leverage Dr. Han's clinical training in gastroenterology, his post-doctoral research training in the study of human mucosal T cells, and the expertise of the Mark Davis laboratory and collaborators. Successful completion of these aims may ultimately enable the development of novel approaches in the prevention and treatment of CD and other autoimmune diseases.

Genomic research continues to relevant for nursing research, evidenced by the development of A Blueprint for Genomic Nursing Science that was recently published. Bringing research efforts to bear upon clinically relevant issues requires that a continuous cadre of individuals receive state of the science education and training to allow them to incorporate genomics into their research trajectories. Nurses are uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between genomics research and clinical practice. They interact with patients at all stages of life, and in all clinical arenas. Teir work is interdisciplinary by nature. More nurses are now receiving education in genomics because of the inclusion of genomics into nursing curricula across the country. Nevertheless, there continue to be few opportunities for long-term laboratory-based training in the conduct of cutting-edge genomics research. Such training opportunities are essential because nearly every condition studied by nurse scientists, including those on the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh, School of Nursing, has a genetic component. Our objective is to train talented nurse scientists, at the beginning stages of their careers, to develop research trajectories related to the application and evaluation of genomics in improving patient outcomes. The goal of the training program is to prepare predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to incorporate genomics into their research trajectories using didactic courses, clinical rotations, journal clubs, seminar, individualized practica, laboratory experiences, and presentations at scientific meetings. Objectives of the program focus on training in: 1) the integration of genomics into theoretical / conceptual frameworks; 2) genomics research methodology (e.g., family studies, genome-wide association studies, gene expression studies); 3) genomics laboratory techniques; and 4) clinical application of genomics; and 5) applicability of bioinformatics and genomic Big Data.

"9434992","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the most pressing challenges to the biomedical research community lies in the development of novel antimicrobials as a means of combating the evolution of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. As such, research in the van der Donk is focused on the study of lanthipeptides, a class of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products, which have demonstrated significant potential as antibiotics. Indeed, the antibiotic lanthipeptide, nisin, has been used in  the U.S. food industry for almost half a century with very few reports of antibiotic resistance. These natural products derive their name from the presence of lanthionine rings within their structure, which are formed through the conjugation of cysteine thiols to dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues within the maturing lanthipeptide. It has recently been found that LanBs, the enzymes responsible for the generation of dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues in some lanthipeptides, rely upon glutamyl-tRNAGlu in order to glutamylate and subsequently eliminate the hydroxyl-group from serine and threonine. Unfortunately, little is known about the enzymatic mechanisms by which this occurs or how it is regulated. Therefore, through the use of isotopically labeled cofactors, non-reactive substrate mimics, mutagenesis, and enzyme kinetics analysis, the research proposed herein is designed to examine the chemical and structural features that underlie LanB activity. The specific goals to be achieved include the determination of the mechanism and chemoselectivity of glutamate transfer by NisB, the structural elucidation of the glutamylation and elimination active sites, and the molecular mechanisms that determine tRNA cofactor recognition. Through a better understanding of these properties, our overall objective is to better understand lanthipeptide biosynthesis in order to inform the development of novel antibiotic and therapeutic compounds."
"9222060","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is to reveal the major molecular bases for the function of KCNQ K+ channels (KCNQ1-5) that are important in the heart, brain, inner ear and epithelia. The aberrant functions of these channels are associated with cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, deafness, and gastric cancer. The importance of these channels is based on two prominent properties. First, all these channels, when expressed without auxiliary  subunits, are activated by voltages at negative ranges (start activating around -60 mV). Being activated just above the resting membrane potential, the M-current through KCNQ2 and 3 in neurons reduces membrane excitability and acts as a brake to membrane discharge. Second, the association of the KCNE family K+ channel  subunits, which radically alter gating, permeation and pharmacological properties of KCNQ1, determines the physiological role of KCNQ1. KCNQ1 associates with KCNE1 to form the IKs channel in the heart that regulates action potential duration, and with KCNE2 or KCNE3 to form the constitutively open background K+ channels in epithelia important for ion transport. What are the mechanisms underlying these properties? This is a long-standing question whose answer will provide the basis for the understanding and treatment of KCNQ associated diseases. We propose that the answer to this question lies in a novel mechanism for KCNQ1 activation. During voltage dependent activation in KCNQ1, the voltage sensor domain (VSD) moves in two steps, from the resting to intermediate and then to activated state; the channel pore opens at both intermediate and activated states of VSD, but the VSD-pore interaction differs at different states of VSD to alter channel gating, ion permeation and pharmacology. KCNE1 modulates channel function by suppressing the intermediate openings of the channel. In this project we wish to test various aspects of this hypothesis in three specific aims. 1) We wish to identify the structural motifs that are important for the VSD-pore interaction at intermediate and activated states, respectively. Mutations in KCNQ1 and KCNE1 are associated with long QT syndrome (LQT) that predispose patients to fatal cardiac arrhythmia, this study will reveal if some of the LQT mutations alter VSD-pore interaction. 2) We will examine if suppression of the intermediate and potentiation of the activated openings is the main mechanism for major functional changes upon KCNE1 association including the response to - adrenergic stimulation and inactivation gating. LQT patients with KCNQ1 mutations often experience symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia such as syncope and sudden death during exercise when -adrenergic pathway is stimulated. This study is therefore particularly significant for the understanding of molecular bases of LQT. 3) We wish to reveal if KCNE2 and 3 make the channel constitutively open by altering VSD activation, pore opening or VSD-pore interaction. We will identify if these channels are at intermediate or activated open states and their responses to drugs and cellular signaling molecules."
"9237304","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early obesity puts children at increased risk for adult obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), early mortality, and other risks relative to normal weight children. Most parents of obese children are not concerned about their child's weight, and parents grossly underestimate the probabilities that their child will be obese and develop CVD in adulthood. Parents of obese children who have enrolled in obesity treatment programs cite a desire to improve their child's long-term health as a reason for engaging in behavior change. Concern about a child's health may be an important facilitator for behavior change engagement. Therefore, we are interested in understanding ways to promote accurate understanding of children's long-term health risks in order to raise an appropriate level of concern about obese children's weight and increase uptake of healthful behaviors. Health care providers are essential to help parents understand whether their child is on a healthy weight trajectory, but providers do not have effective tools for talking to parents about obesity and its associated adverse health risks; BMI growth charts alone are insufficient. This proposal's overall research goal is to identiy clinic-based risk communication approaches that can motivate parents of obese children to engage in behavior change to prevent future obesity and CVD. In Aim 1, we will develop novel risk communication messages. We will consider several novel approaches around message content and framing, but primarily, we propose using microsimulation models to forecast a child's long-term health risks, based on his age, race, gender, BMI, and family history of CVD. Qualitative interviews with providers and parents, and a stakeholder panel comprised of health researchers and parent research partners, will be used to evaluate potentially effective and acceptable messages. In Aim 2, we will experimentally evaluate the efficacy of four novel risk communication messages on parental behavior change willingness and intent using a national web-based survey. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the acceptability and effectiveness of new risk communication messages in a clinical setting, and we will observe the impact of new messages on behavior change activities. A survey will assess parent-perceived risks, perceived message accuracy, concern about child health, and anxiety. This research plan is part of a K01 proposal designed to provide scholarly training, mentorship, and support for Dr. Wright to gain skills and experience needed to conduct research on how improved obesity-related risk communication messages may affect child behavior change. Dr. Wright is a decision scientist whose career goal is to become an independent investigator with a focus on using decision science methods to motivate uptake of childhood obesity treatment and behavior change. To achieve this objective, she will pursue training in: (1) the psychology of medical decision making and principles of pediatric risk communication, (2) qualitative research methods, and (3) the design, implementation, and evaluation of behavioral health interventions.

"9308614","Project Summary Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is an mRNA-binding translational repressor whose loss causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS), which we fight with a well-established Drosophila model. A revolution in transgenic technology (FlyLight) in this last funding cycle provides unprecedented ability to target individual neurons within brain learning/memory circuitry. We target a single projection neuron (mPN2) with olfactory dendritic input and two synaptic outputs: 1) biased-stereotyped connection in Lateral Horn (innate behavior), 2) activity-dependent probabilistic connection in Mushroom Body (learned behavior). Cross-comparing these synapse classes in one neuron is a phenomenal advantage. We hypothesize simultaneous introduction of sensory activity and FMRP activity-sensor defines the critical period (CP), a restricted developmental time window when early-use activity refines synaptic connectivity and circuit function. In this renewal, we focus on CP activity-dependent translation control in the refinement of synaptic connectivity and circuit function to optimize the mature behavioral output. In Aim I, we test FMRP RNA-binding translational control of critical period structural/functional development at all 3 mPN2 synaptic sites: dendritic input and dual axonal outputs. We use a range of targeted transgenic tools to assay synapse architecture, ultrastructure and molecular assembly, in normal animals compared to the FXS model in staged developmental studies. We introduce targeted optogenetic channels driven throughout the circuit to bidirectionally manipulate activity during CP development, monitoring changes with GCaMP Ca2+ reporters, ArcLight voltage reporters and patch-clamp electrophysiology. In mPN2 developmental studies, we test activity-dependent FMRP roles in CP synaptic connectivity and function. In Aim 2, we test the partnership of FMRP with other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in this activity-dependent translation repression mechanism. RBPs rarely act alone, and our preliminary data suggest RBPs Staufen and Pumilio partner with FMRP, with their coupled expression jointly delineating the critical period. We will test formation of FMRP/Staufen/Pumilio complexes and combinatorial roles in mPN2 translation repression. Using double mutant combinations, we will test combinatorial functions in remodeling of CP synaptic connectivity, circuit function and learning/memory behavioral outputs. In Aim 3, we test 3 novel translational targets; 1) phosphatase Corkscrew, 2) ESCRTiii core protein Shrub and 3) Neurobeachin homolog Rugose. Preliminary data show all 3 mRNAs bind FMRP, proteins transiently elevated in the CP in the FXS model and over-expression phenocopies FXS. We hypothesize FXS elevation of 1) Corkscrew increases synaptic signal transduction, 2) Shrub impairs synapse elimination via a local pruning module, and 3) Rugose accelerates synaptic trafficking to impair CP synaptic remodeling. We will test these roles individually with characterized mutants, and test whether CP restoration of protein levels corrects FMRP/Staufen/Pumilio loss phenotypes. FXS is a primary heritable cause of intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and targeted interactors are likewise causally linked to ID/ASD states."
"9327614","ABSTRACT This study brings together information on the phylogenetics and epidemiology of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 to examine variation in the virulence and distribution of disease. Previous studies have suggested that genetic characteristics reflected in the phylogeny of STEC O157 strains could explain differences in virulence, specifically incidence of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, these studies are based on only a partial phylogenetic tree and employ analysis methods that do not accurately summarize the risk associated with individual STEC O157 strains. In this project, I will test the association between phylogenetic lineage and HUS using an expanded phylogenetic tree and rigorous analytic methods (Aim 1). A potential mechanism will then be tested using mediation analysis to determine the role of Shiga toxin genes (stx) in the association between lineage and HUS (Aim 2). Finally, this study will further deepen understanding of STEC O157 epidemiology by testing whether phylogenetic lineages are geographically segregated and detecting clusters of STEC O157 by lineage (Aim 3). In pursuit of these Aims, I will use a study population of 1,160 culture- confirmed STEC O157 cases reported to the Washington State Department of Health from 2005 to 2014. Phylogenetic lineage and stx subtype for these cases were determined using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing and Shiga toxin-encoding bacteriophage insertion site (SBI) typing, respectively. The phylogenetic tree for the study population will be drawn, incorporating HUS status to depict how HUS clusters by lineage. Generalized estimating equations will be used to test the association between lineage and HUS while accounting for the correlation among isolates of the same strain. Potential outcomes mediation analysis will be used to test the contribution of different stx subtypes. Clusters of disease due to each lineage will be identified using spatial scan statistics, phylogeography will be employed to explore how STEC O157 in Washington has evolved according to case locations, and spatial segregation will be estimated to determine whether the lineages are randomly mixed throughout the state. The results of this study will expand our understanding of genetic determinants of virulence of STEC O157. It will provide evidence to focus research on the most virulent forms of STEC O157 and test whether stx subtypes are responsible for observed associations. If results are negative, this will suggest that virulence determinants are not correlated with the genetic markers used to establish phylogenetic lineage. This study will also provide knowledge about the geographic distribution of STEC O157 by phylogenetic lineage. Segregation may suggest that locally-maintained bacteria populations are important sources of infection, whereas random mixing of lineages may indicate that dominant sources of infection are diffuse. With positive or negative findings, this study will make an important contribution to the biologic and epidemiologic knowledge of STEC O157."
"9390285","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular (CV) aging, featuring large artery stiffening, endothelial dysfunction, and impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, is a maor risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Male aging is associated with a gradual and variable decline in serum testosterone (T) and low T is associated with accelerated CV aging. The purpose of this R01 proposal is to determine the key functional mechanisms underlying accelerated CV aging in older men with low T. The overall hypothesis is that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are mechanisms underlying the apparent accelerated CV aging in older men with low T. To test this hypothesis Aim 1 will use cross-sectional comparisons of young and older men with normal T (?400 ng/dl), and older men with chronically low T (<300 ng/dl). Carotid artery stiffness, conduit and microvascular endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, hyperemic peak velocity time integral, and peripheral arterial tonometry) and indices of LV diastolic function will be measured during saline (control) and during systemic ascorbic acid infusion, an experimental model to acutely reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, oxidative stress burden and mitochondrial function (biogenesis, networks, respiration, dynamics, ROS) will be measured in harvested brachial artery and peripheral venous endothelial cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. To better isolate the effects of low T from factors that change with aging and chronic low T, Aim 2 will expand on the cross-sectional comparisons by assessing measures of CV function, oxidative stress burden and mitochondrial function in older men with normal T before and after randomization to short-term (28 d) gonadal suppression (gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist, GnRHant) + placebo (PL), GnRHant+T alone, or GnRHant+T+aromatase inhibitor (AI). AI will control for the effects of aromatization of T to estradiol (E2), and thereby isolate  effects while suppressing E2, a potent modulator of CV function. In an exploratory aim, gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue arterioles will be isolated and assessed for endothelial vasodilation in response to acetylcholine and agents that target ROS and mitochondrial function (e.g., the antioxidants Mito-TEMPOL and MitoQ). The results from this research should provide new mechanistic insight into the processes that mediate the impairment in CV function at the cellular and systemic level in older men with low T. These studies will lead to a better understanding of the independent role of T in age-related changes in CV function and the mechanisms of action, which will help guide future sex-specific therapies for the prevention of CVD."
"9215621","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is about intrinsic mechanisms of aging, which are inherent and always occur during the normal aging process. Intrinsic mechanisms involve an internal clock that specifies lifespan during normal aging. Besides damage accumulation, another mechanism for intrinsic aging has recently been found in C. elegans termed developmental drift. Developmental pathways are established in the young adult to guide the formation of different tissues. Key regulators of these developmental pathways become aberrantly expressed in old age, leading to a cascade of changes in expression of downstream genes that has detrimental effects on tissue function and that limits lifespan. Developmental drift is conceptually novel because it proposes that that old worms are not the same as young worms with damage accumulation. Rather, old worms have inherent, programmed differences that make them more susceptible to degeneration and death. This proposal uses C. elegans as a model system because of its short two week lifespan and powerful genetic tools. DNA microarray experiments have been used to define a molecular signature for aging that includes 1254 genes that differ in expression between young and old worms. Seven transcription factors have previously been identified as candidates that may be responsible for these age-related changes. All seven transcription factors are key regulators of development in diverse tissues, such as the intestine and the skin. This proposal will use ChIP SEQ experiments to determine whether these transcription factors are directly responsible for causing expression of their downstream genes to change with age. Expression experiments using an automatic cell lineage analyzer to digitize images of GFP-expressing worms will be used to extract precise expression data from individual cells. These data will show how expression of the seven transcription factors changes with age. Transgenic worms will be engineered to convert old worms into young worms; specifically, expression of the seven aging regulators in old worms will be altered to resemble expression found in young worms, and then lifespan experiments will be used to test whether converting worms to their younger state is beneficial. A key prediction of the developmental drift hypothesis is that changes in old age should resemble changes that occur during development. This will be tested by finding out if the network of genes directly downstream of a transcription factor during aging are the same as its downstream network during development."
"9311801","Project Summary/Abstract Treating the immune response within tumors is a major focus of new therapeutic development. Much of the focus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is currently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells. We have recently isolated rare populations of myeloid cells that appear critical for robust responses but we don't yet fully understand how they work. We hypothesize that rare stimulatory dendritic cells traffic antigens and stimulate T cell according to specialized rules and that harnessing and modulation of this pathway is part of the reason that checkpoint blockades may work. We further hypothesize that specific tissue-based cells are responsible for upregulating the critical cytokine to make stimulatory dendritic cells but that tissue production is dysregulated in cancer and possibly improved with checkpoint therapies. In this proposal we will be vastly extending an approach that my lab has been pursuing over the last few years. Specifically we will be extending our cell-biology based studies of these critical cells (Aim1) to understand how they play a fundamental role in antigen trafficking. Additionally, we will seek to understand how they hand off antigen to other antigen-presenting cells in the lymph node to engage T cells (Aim2) and how both of these processes are affected by checkpoint blockades. Finally, in aim 3, we will seek to understand the normal and intratumoral production of the cytokine Flt3L, a key player in regulating the number of these rare cells. At the end of this work, we will understand how these intratumoral myeloid cells function on their own and in concert with T cell therapies."
"9274479","ABSTRACT Confocal microscopy has allowed a large number of biomedical researchers in the Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) to elucidate morphological and protein neuroadaptations in rodent models of neuropsychiatric diseases. A number of these investigators are recognized leaders in the field of addiction neurosciences, and a major focus of the faculty in these departments is to understand human disease using innovative approaches. The faculty identified in this application are currently using a 15-year-old and technologically obsolete confocal microscope. There are recent advances in confocal imaging technology that provide substantial improvements in speed, sensitivity, and resolution over the current capabilities of the existing confocal microscope. Thus, the overall goal of this application is to upgrade the obsolete confocal and create a Shared Confocal Facility equipped with a new versatile and high-resolution confocal microscope system that will serve the faculty in the Departments of Neuroscience, Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, and other departments at MUSC. We propose to replace the older system with a Zeiss LSM 880 that has an Airyscan detector capable of superresolution imaging. Unlike our current system, the versatile Zeiss LSM 880 has an open interface and modular architecture that will allow reconfiguration of the system as our future needs change to meet the rigorous demands of biomedical research. Moreover, our preliminary data show that images acquired with a superresolution detector are far superior in quality and resolution, and quantitation of superresolution images revealed an increase in the density of fine dendritic protrusions (i.e., dendritic spines) compared with the same images acquired with a GaAsP detector. These qualitative and quantitative findings strongly demonstrate the necessity of this state-of-the-art technology to allow the investigators to examine cellular structures and relationships of proteins with enhanced detail. There is substantial institutional support provided by the Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences and Office of the Provost at MUSC to cover the instrument for its lifetime and to expand image analysis capabilities in an effort to facilitate superresolution technology on MUSC's campus. In addition to supporting individual R01 awards, two NIH-funded P50 Center grants, and two NIH-funded T32 Training grants at MUSC, the superresolution confocal will provide data to two national consortia (Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism and Neurobiology of Adolescent Drinking in Adulthood). Thus, this upgrade will immediately influence the current research programs at MUSC and across the US, and will provide users with equipment that can grow and change in parallel with cutting-edge neuroscience research. A technological upgrade of this magnitude will be critical in furthering the long-range biomedical research goals at the Medical University of South Carolina."
"9347182","Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) results from a breakdown of self-tolerance that is characterized by immune cell mediated destruction of the insulin-producing ?-cells in the pancreas. Ultimately, glucose metabolism is interrupted resulting in the development of life-threatening complications such as heart disease and renal failure. T1D affects an estimated 3 million Americans, with more than 30,000 new patients diagnosed annually, resulting in roughly $15B in health care costs in the US each year. It is thought that arrest of the autoimmune processes underlying this disease could avert the long-term complications associated with the disease and perhaps even reverse the disease process, given sufficient insulin-producing cells remain. Clinical intervention trials using immunomodulatory agents (e.g., anti-CD3) have failed to meet clinical endpoints, despite positive results in phase I/II trials, and traditional vaccine strategies providing auto-antigen or peptides alone failed to adequately block ongoing beta cell immunity. Thus, a new treatment strategy that is both potent and durable is required to effectively halt the ongoing attack in T1D. Regulatory T-cell (Treg)-based approaches are quickly gaining traction as a therapeutic strategy for treatment of auto-immune conditions. In this personalized therapeutic approach, endogenous populations of Tregs (widely considered the master regulators of the immune system) are expanded ex vivo, conditioned in factors to improve their tolerance-inducing capacity, and then re-introduced to the patient?s body. However, despite the promise exhibited by this approach to curb autoimmune diseases (including T1D) in animal models, the effects in humans are only transient due to rapid Treg death and loss of potency following adoptive transfer. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine known to be critical for Treg survival and function, but systemic introduction of IL-2 results in undesirable off-target effects. OneVax, LLC has pioneered a novel, biomaterial-based nanoparticle-Treg complex system for improved survivability and functionality of adoptively transferred Tregs. In this system, polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating IL-2 and glucagon-like peptide 1 (a hormone shown to promote ?-cell survival and proliferation) are conjugated to Tregs, allowing for delivery of the encapsulated agents in a continuous and controlled manner. This approach has the potential to restore immune tolerance and ultimately restore glucose homeostasis. The objective of this phase I proposal is to conduct pre-clinical physiochemical and biological in vitro characterization of the nanoparticle-Treg conjugate therapy, and to determine its capacity to prevent diabetic onset in the therapeutically relevant non-obese diabetic mouse model. The preliminary data strongly suggests that this nanoparticle-Treg coupled therapy system holds promise for correcting autoimmune responses in T1D. Additionally, OneVax has established strategic collaborations with the Biomedical Engineering Department, College of Medicine and the Diabetes Institute at the University of Florida to boost OneVax?s capability to complete the desired goals."
"9324440","Millions of people suffer from the devastating consequences of age-related dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This number will only increase as our lifespan extends. The histological signatures of AD in patient's brains are neurofibrillary tangles and plaques, consisting of amyloidogenic proteins, including Tau and amyloid-beta (A?). Recent evidence now suggests that the observed cytotoxic effects of AD are less caused by the mature A? fibrils than by toxic oligomers, which are transiently produced on the pathway of amyloid formation, or generated by the shedding of mature fibrils. These results suggest that amyloidogenic modifiers that accelerate fibril formation and/or stabilize mature fibrils will reduce the cytotoxic effects of A?. We have recently discovered that polyphosphate (polyP), one of the structurally simplest, conserved and ubiquitous biopolymers found in biology, serves as a protein-binding scaffold that stabilizes amyloidogenic proteins in a ?- sheet conformation. This accelerates fibril formation and stabilizes mature fibrils. Importantly, we found that polyP decreases amyloid toxicity in differentiated neurons, and delays paralysis in C. elegans models of A? toxicity. These results are consistent with a model in which polyP-mediated acceleration of the fibril-forming process reduces A? toxicity by reducing accumulation of potentially toxic intermediates, and raise the exciting possibility that we have discovered a physiologically relevant modifier of A? fibril formation. Given that polyP levels in vertebrate brains have been found to dramatically decrease with age, we propose that this age- mediated polyP decline contributes to the observed predisposition of older patients towards AD and other amyloidogenic diseases. We will now characterize how polyP affects in vivo A? amyloid formation and toxicity using a C. elegans AD model (Aim 1). Moreover, we will test how brain polyP levels correlate with human AD progression and attempt to manipulate brain polyP levels in a mouse model of AD, assess any related behavioral changes and determine how changes in endogenous polyP levels affect soluble and fibrillar A? levels in AD mouse brains (Aim 2). Together, these experiments will provide us with crucial information about how polyP levels correlate with histopathological AD markers and/or with AD severity during disease progression. They will also reveal whether changing polyP levels affects the abundance of specific A? species in AD model brain. This work will form the necessary groundwork for future in vivo experiments, aimed at directly determining whether levels of endogenous polyP influence onset and/or disease outcome in AD model mice."
"9242696","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a five-year training program for the development of a career in clinical research, focused on improving the quality of cardiac catheterization in children. This proposal is will serve as a vehicle to developing into an independent investigator. To that end, we have established a training plan that includes mentoring, course-work, didactic educational activities, and hands-on research. Steven Kawut, MD, MS, (the primary mentor) is a tenured Associate Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology. He has a track record of successfully mentoring fellows and junior faculty and holds a K24 to support his mentoring activities. An advisory committee has been assembled to guide the candidate's career development.  The application focuses on three specific aims. First, metrics to compare the outcomes of catheterization laboratories in different centers have not been defined. We have demonstrated that death and other catastrophic outcomes are significantly associated with procedural volume. However, the association between procedural volume and less severe adverse events was much less strong. We propose to study the association between procedural volume and risk of failure to rescue (i.e., the ability to avoid catastrophic outcome given an adverse event), and in so doing introduce it to as a novel outcome measure in the field. We propose to leverage a multi-center clinical registry, the IMproving Pediatric and Adult Treatment (IMPACT) registry to accomplish this aim.  Second, economic cost is not only a surrogate marker of clinical outcome, but also an independent measure of the efficiency of healthcare delivery. We propose to establish benchmarks for the economic cost of catheterization procedures, and to study the factors influencing cost. To accomplish this aim, we will use a multi-center administrative database, the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database.  Third, patient-reported outcomes, such as health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) represent an important aspect of health that is not captured in traditional physician reported outcomes (and moreover are not included in multicenter registries and databases). They also represent an important aspect (along with cost) of comparative effectiveness research. We propose to perform a single center cohort study of children undergoing catheterization to define the effect of cardiac catheterization on HR-QOL, and to determine the factors (modifiable and non-modifiable) that influence it.  Together, these three aims illuminate different outcomes associated with cardiac catheterization in children. By combining these novel techniques, the applicant hopes to begin to define the factors that influence health and well-being of children undergoing catheterization and set the groundwork for studies that will test interventions to improve the quality of care for children requiring cardiac catheterization."

"9328625","PROJECT SUMMARY Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) is a heterogeneous collection of inherited polyneuropathies generallyCharacterize dby progressive muscle weakness and loss of sensation in the extremities. This disorder, for which there is currently no curative treatment, is the most common inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system, affecting 1:2,500 individuals. Over 80 loci in the human genome have been linked to CMT, indicating that diverse cellular pathways are involved in its etiology. Fortunately, some common pathological mechanisms arebeginning to emerge, as thirteen different autosomal dominant mutations in GARS (glycyl-tRNA synthetase) have been identified in patients with CMT Type 2D (CMT2D). Although the mechanisms through which mutant forms of GARS cause axon degeneration are unclear, data from humans, mice, and Drosophila are consistent with the expression of mutant GARS protein causing toxic gain-of-function effects in peripheral nerves. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the selective silencing of mutant GARS expression should be of therapeutic benefit for patients with CMT2D. In response, we have developed a gene therapy strategy that specifically reduces mutant Gars expression through allele-specific RNAi. Recent exciting preliminary data confirms that when administered at birth, RNAi targeting mutant-Gars significantly improves all neuropathy outcome measures in an established mouse model of CMT2D (GarsP278KY/+). The overall objective for this proposal is to complete three specific aims designed to use mutant-Gars targeting RNAi as a powerful tool to gain novel mechanistic insights underlying CMT2D and to optimize the therapeutic potential of our gene therapy strategy. In Aim 1 we will assess the efficacy of Gars-targeting RNAi in the prevention of neuropathy when delivered directly into the nervous system compared to its systemic delivery in GarsP278KY/+ mice. This study will determine if the disease is primarily driven by a cell autonomous or non- autonomous mechanism and establish the optimal route of delivery for our gene therapy approach. In Aim 2 we will assess the potential for mutant Gars-targeting RNAi to arrest neuropathy in adult GarsP278KY/+ mice. This study will help us understand how neuropathy begins and progresses, and will help determine if our gene therapy strategy can treat current patients with CMT2D. The objective of Aim 3 is to generate ?humanized? preclinical mouse models that have a CMT2D patient-associated mutation substituted into the mouse Gars gene. This work will provide an in vivo platform to test personalized therapeutic strategies on disease-relevant mutations in in vivo models with established phenotypic validity. This study is significant and innovative, as we will demonstrate critical preclinical proof-of-concept data to help accomplish our long-term goal of developing a gene therapy for patients with CMT2D. This will be the first effective treatment for CMT2D or any dominant form of CMT and will have broad translational impact as it has implications for other common neuromuscular disorders including Huntington?s disease and motor neuron disorders."
"9285686","Abstract Cytosine methylation and histone modification are epigenomic marks with effects on transposable elements (TE), transcription of genes and heterochromatin formation. While occurring mainly in a CG-dinucleotide context, DNA methylation in brain cells contains nearly an equal amount of non-CG methylation (mCH). mCH accumulates in neurons and correlates with transcriptional repression at a period coinciding with synaptogenesis and neuronal maturation. Embryonic CG-methylation patterns also change dramatically during the period between birth and the second postnatal week. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a is highly expressed in brain during this period. Preliminary data in this application suggests that this enzyme is responsible for the accumulation of mC in neurons during the perinatal period. A conditional knockout mouse was created, in which deletion of Dnmt3a in pyramidal neurons occurs during the late embryonic period (~E15, driven by Neurod6-Cre). Contrary to results showing a shortened lifespan in animals with earlier embryonic deletion (driven by Nestin-Cre), or lack of phenotype when the deletion occurs past the second postnatal week (driven by CamK2a-Cre), NeuroD6-driven Dnmt3a-KO (pyrDnmt3a-KO) animals show no postnatal mC accumulation, have significantly altered gene expression, and develop pronounced changes in behavior without changes in lifespan. These results support the hypothesis that mC accumulation and patterning in neurons requires precise regulation of Dnmt3a activity during neuronal development. Based on these findings, it is proposed that mC accumulation during the perinatal period may be essential for the spatial and temporal gene regulation required for proper synapse development and circuit formation. This hypothesis will be tested by delineating the dynamics of Dnmt3a-dependent mC accumulation during brain development, by characterizing the disruptions in methylation patterns, transcriptional dysregulation and histone modifications in animals carrying a deletion of Dnmt3a in pyramidal and inhibitory neurons from cortex and hippocampus (Aim 1). To understand the mechanisms of activation of Dnmt3a during postnatal cortical development, this proposal will identify its binding-partners during the developmental transition between the first and second postnatal week in neurons using mass spectrometry of Dnmt3a immunocomplexes. It will also assess the requirement of these binding partners for Dnmt3a function by transcriptional knockdown experiments in cultured cells and animals using a viral deliver system (Aim2). Finally, this proposal will characterize the effects of Dnmt3a deletion on neuron development and synaptogenesis (Aim3)."
"9209351","SUMMARY  Chronic social stress is an integral part of our busy contemporary lives. Abundant data show that severe chronic psychosocial stress is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a predictor of myocardial infarction and stroke. The mechanisms by which stress contributes to the higher cardiovascular event rates are primarily attributed to secondary effects on behavior, including smoking or food intake. How stress' effect on the brain can directly impact cardiovascular disease is uncharted territory.  Preclinical preliminary data from this Program's investigators describe a direct causal link between social stress, neural signals, and atherosclerosis, the lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disease that is the underlying cause of myocardial infarction and stroke. The key connecting component is the macrophage, a large phagocytic leukocyte that originates in the bone marrow and accumulates in atherosclerotic lesions. Informed by abundant published and unpublished data, we hypothesize that chronic variable stress aggravates cardiovascular disease by interfering with macrophage dynamics.  Specifically, we wish to (i) understand how stress biologically affects macrophage dynamics in atherosclerosis; (ii) develop technology that monitors macrophage dynamics non-invasively; and (iii) elucidate the mechanism by which post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) leads to atherosclerosis. Our highly innovative Program Project comprises a diverse team of investigators with complementary expertise in cardiovascular immunology (Swirski, Fisher, Moore); preclinical cardiovascular imaging (Mulder, Nahrendorf, Calcagno); translational imaging (Fayad, Tawakol, Mani, Fuster); and neuroscience (Murrough, Shin, Pitman, Charney). Structurally, we have 3 main Projects complemented by an Administrative/Statistical Core and Imaging Core.  We will tackle the Program Project's central hypothesis in three Specific Aims from the vantage points of biology, technology, and medicine. In Aim 1 (Biology) we will investigate how stress controls macrophage dynamics in mouse models of atherosclerosis. In Aim 2 (Technology), we will develop and translate non- invasive imaging approaches and nanotechnologies that monitor macrophage dynamics in atherosclerosis during stress. In Aim 3 (Medicine), we will elucidate the mechanism by which PTSD leads to atherosclerosis.  Our Program Project's overarching and long-term goal is to collectively institute a sound scientific foundation for the biomedical and clinical community as how the link between stress and cardiovascular disease can be best approached and integrated in patient care."
"9248804","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell death and clearance are vital processes throughout development and in maintaining homeostasis. Apoptosis, autophagic cell death, and necroptosis are the most well characterized forms of programmed cell death; however, alternative cell death pathways are being discovered and characterized. During oogenesis in Drosophila, fifteen nurse cells support the oocyte through development. During late stages of oogenesis these fifteen nurse cell die and are cleared in a developmentally regulated form of cell death. This application aims to identify the mechanism of developmentally regulated cell death and clearance of nurse cells in late oogenesis. Preliminary data suggest a non-autonomous cell death induced by the surrounding stretch follicle cells. The first aim consists of characterizing the role of lysosomes in nurse cell death and clearance. Ex vivo live imaging and an RNAi screen of lysosomal processing genes will be utilized. The second aim is to determine how the stretch follicle cells surround the nurse cells. More specifically, I will use a genetic construct, Flybow, that expresses different fluorophores in a homogenous cell population; this will allow for tracking of individual stretch follicle cells through confocal microscopy. I will alo inhibit stretch follicle cell extension by pharmacological agents and dominant negative GTPases to test the requirements of stretch follicle cells surrounding nurse cells for their death and clearance. The third aim is to identify signaling molecules necessary for death and clearance of the nurse cells. This will be accomplished by identifying the secretome, the sum of all secreted molecules, of the stretch follicle cells by mass spectrometry. An RNAi screen of the secretome will be conducted in parallel. Altogether the goal of this application is to understand the mechanistic process of nurse cell death and clearance. The information gained from this work will be beneficial to better understanding non-apoptotic cell death in humans."

"9273209","Project Summary In this application, we are requesting funds for the purchase of an Asylum Research MFP-3D- BIO atomic force microscope (AFM) integrated with a Zeiss Observer.Z1 inverted fluorescent microscope. This state-of-the-art AFM requested in this application is the best available AFM to suit our current and foreseeable needs at Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH), and it will be housed and operated from our Morphology Core Laboratory. Importantly, while we are not integrating this AFM with a confocal microscope, we foresee that future studies may necessitate this specialized functionality; as such, the proposed AFM will be situated next to the current Zeiss LSM 700 confocal in our Morphology Core, which will allow us to temporarily convert the dedicated AFM Zeiss inverted microscope to accommodate the confocal scan head, allowing us to have confocal capabilities in a budge-neutral manner. As there is currently not an AFM on the NCH campus, this instrument will add significant functionality to our NIH-funded research projects. These projects have a critical need to understand biological systems at a more fundamental level, and to apply this understanding of the biomechanical properties of these systems to problems as diverse as cardiovascular disease, microbial pathogenesis, biomedical engineering, perinatal diseases, and cancer. The requested MFP- 3D-BIO AFM is versatile and has several key features that set it apart from other instruments on the market that allow it to achieve better performance: (1) it has the highest thermally- limited resolution of any AFM on the market, making it very suitable to measure biomechanical forces of cells, biofilms, and binding as described in our application, (2) when housed in an acoustic enclosure, the noise in the data is extremely low, (3) and the user-friendly control, analysis, and image processing software integrates with Igor Pro 6, allowing for near limitless instrument control and analysis, and (4) the cantilever spring constant can be calibrated without making physical contact with the samples, which is a real benefit when working with soft and/or sensitive materials. These features, along with little to no maintenance, result in high-resolution data acquisition without significant long-term expense. This requested MFP- 3D-BIO will be critical to support the needs of our NIH-funded Major and Minor Users performing sensitive biomechanical measurements on biological samples (cells, biofilms, DNA), often where samples are limited and sensitivity is a key requirement."
"9075577","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to collect preliminary data on Attention Bias Modification Training (ABMT) among clinic referred children and adolescents who display subthreshold impairing anxiety (SubImpAnx; anxiety & related impairment that fails to meet DSM criteria for an anxiety disorder). Traditional approaches to mental health service delivery cannot meet current demand. The inadequacies of traditional service delivery are magnified when viewed through the lens of impaired but undiagnosed youth. It is an unaddressed empirical question whether a least restrictive treatment can effectively reduce SubImpAnx in youth. Empirical efforts to address this issue are important because youths with SubImpAnx experience substantial impairment, are at high risk of escalation to full syndrome anxiety disorder, and pose a burden on the health care system.  ABMT is a novel translational treatment for anxiety based on experimental and neuroscience research findings on attention processes. Research demonstrates that ABMT leads to reductions in anxiety and its disorders. ABMT holds promise as a potential least restrictive treatment for SubImpAnx because (a) youth with SubImpAnx display an attention bias toward threatening stimuli, (b) ABMT is brief, inexpensive, and highly portable, and (c) ABMT does not require skilled clinicians.  This study will enroll 66 clinic referred children and adolescents (ages 8-16 years) who meet criteria for SubImpAnx. Participants will be randomly assigned to complete 8 sessions of either ABMT or a placebo control (PC) task over 4 weeks. Clinician ratings on youth anxiety severity and impairment will be evaluated as the primary outcome. Youth self ratings and parent ratings on youth anxiety symptoms and impairment will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. All measures will be collected before condition assignment (pretreatment), at immediate posttreatment, and at an 8 week follow up. In addition, initial data will be collected to shed ligh on whether it would be useful to pursue (a) attention bias to threat as a mediator of ABMT's anxiety reduction effects and (b) dose-response issues related to ABMT's anxiety reduction effects in a subsequent, larger study.  The specific aims are: Collect pilot data on the effects of ABMT and a PC task on levels of anxiety and impairment at a post evaluation (Aim 1) and at a follow up (FU) evaluation 8 weeks after the post evaluation (Aim 2); Preliminarily examine whether ABMT leads to lower levels of attention bias toward threatening stimuli as compared to a PC Task at post and 8 week FU (Aim 3); Describe the course of anxiety symptoms and impairment during treatment among youth in the ABMT condition (Aim 4).  This project will provide critically needed pilot data on ABMT for youth with SubImpAnx. With these data in hand, the field will be in a better position to determine whether ABMT may be used as a least restrictive intervention among anxious youth who are 'impaired but undiagnosed.'"
"9258599","Project Summary The threat of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections has in recent years led to increased efforts in identifying novel antibacterials. These efforts have resulted in the approval of several new drug classes for Gram-positive infections; however due to the additional challenges imposed by the outer membrane found in Gram-negative bacteria, a novel broad-spectrum agent has not been introduced since 1968. Furthermore, the majority of compounds in the Gram-negative drug development pipeline are derivatives of existing antibiotics, which increases the likelihood of cross-resistance with approved treatments. Thus, there exists a critical need to identify novel classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly those with activity against MDR pathogens. One class of antibacterials is the nybomycins, which are particularly promising due to their impressive activity against wild-type and MDR S. aureus and Enterococci species in both cell culture and animal models of infection. However their use as broad-spectrum agents is limited by their inability to penetrate into Gram- negative bacteria. It is, therefore, the objective of this application to expand the nybomycin spectrum of activity by designing derivatives that possess suitable activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. This work will build upon preliminary studies that recently identified the first nybomycin analogue with activity against Gram-negative bacteria. In Specific Aim 1, a collection of nybomycin derivatives will be prepared and evaluated for the ability to inhibit their biological target and accumulate in Gram-negative bacteria. The results from these studies will be used to determine how each of these factors contribute to antibacterial activity and guide the synthesis of more active derivatives. The therapeutic potential of these compounds will be determined in Specific Aim 2 by evaluating their tolerability, pharmacokinetic parameters, and in vivo efficacy in mice. The completion of these studies will have a significant impact on human health by providing a series of nybomycin analogues with significant activity against serious MDR Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens as well as the preliminary in vivo data to support their development as a novel drug class."

"9173948","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glucose homeostasis and regulation of food intake are both promoted by the secretion of gut hormones following nutrient stimulation of enteroendocrine cells (L-cells) in the lower gut. This process is impaired in diabetes but is restored when delivery of dietary compounds such as amino acids and fatty acids to the lower gut is facilitated. This effect of delivery of nutrients to the lower gut is observed after gastric bypass surgery and during fermentation of carbohydrates in the colon, both of which can result in resolution of diabetes. These approaches to deliver nutrients to the lower gut are not without complications, although their resulting efficacy is often superior to existing drugs. Currently marketed anti-diabetes drugs have deficiencies in efficacy, durability of effect, and safety, and the pharmaceutical industry has, therefore, been looking for novel approaches to restore impaired gut-hormone secretion. BioKier has identified a simple, direct, safe method to deliver one of the key nutrients to the colon in a way that can be developed for the treatment of diabetes and other conditions characterized by impaired L-cell stimulation. BioKier's concept involves the approach of delivering nutrients as gut hormone secretagogues to the colon via a colon-targeting formulation for the treatment of diabetes and other disorders. Acute studies conducted by BioKier showed that direct delivery via catheter of specific nutrients to the colon of diabetic animals and humans restored the oral glucose-induced gut hormone response. Chronic treatment with an oral formulation of a representative nutrient completely prevented the development of diabetes in a diabetes-prone rat model and supported the concept that the approach could lead to development of a marketable therapeutic. Based on lead-selection data from the acute clinical studies, L-glutamine was formulated in an oral, sustained-release, colon-targeted capsule for testing in type 2 diabetes patients. In order to conduct human testing, the glutamine formulation needs to be tested in animals for safety; as is proposed in Phase I of the SBIR application in a local toxicity and toxicokinetic study of BKR 013 capsules in dogs. Phase II involves conduct of a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, plasma GLP-1 and insulin biomarker responses, and safety of BKR-013 in diabetes drug-nave type 2 diabetes patients. Endpoints are to assess the bioavailability of L-glutamine and measure biomarkers to confirm colon- specific delivery. Progress thus far has attracted the interest of several potential pharmaceutical partners who have indicated the results of the clinical study to be funded by this application are crucial to discussions of a licensing agreement."
"9291115","The successful development of targeted therapy for BRAF-mutant melanoma represented a landmark in cancer therapy. However, despite impressive initial responses, most melanoma patients eventually progressed on therapy, necessitating the development of additional therapeutic strategies. Recent studies from our laboratory have identified novel roles for the bromodomain plant homeodomain (PHD) finger transcription factor [BPTF] gene as a mediator of melanoma progression, and as a potential target for therapy. Our studies showed that BPTF activates the MAP kinase pathway, resulting in decreased sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors. Separately, the development of a small molecule inhibitor targeting the BET family has indicated the druggability of bromodomain motifs. In this proposal, we plan to further develop BPTF targeting as a therapeutic strategy for advanced melanoma, especially in combination with available therapies targeting mutant BRAF. Our three specific aims are: Aim 1: To determine the role of BPTF targeting in melanoma therapy. To develop BPTF targeting as a therapeutic strategy for melanoma, we will assess the anti-tumor efficacy of BPTF targeting using (i) bromosporine, a pan-bromodomain inhibitor with demonstrated affinity for BPTF, and (ii) AU1, a novel, small molecule that selectively targets the BPTF bromodomain. We will assess the anti-tumor efficacy of these compounds in a panel of human melanoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) both in culture and in vivo. Aim 2: To determine the role of combined targeting of BPTF and BRAF in melanoma therapy. To develop combined targeting of BPTF and BRAF as a rational strategy for melanoma therapy, we will examine BPTF targeting with bromosporine or AU1 in combination with BRAF pathway inhibition in a panel of human melanoma cell lines and PDXs both in cell culture and in vivo. In addition, we will assess the ability of both BPTF inhibitors to sensitize melanoma PDXs from patients progressing on BRAF inhibitor therapy both in culture and in vivo. Aim 3: To characterize the functional role of BPTF targeting in melanoma cells. We will determine whether BPTF binds to the ERK promoter. We will determine the effects of BPTF targeting (alone or in combination with BRAF inhibitors) on expression of downstream markers in melanoma cells. Finally, we will determine whether targeting BPTF interferes with its interaction with histone modifications. These studies will establish BPTF targeting as a viable strategy for the therapy of melanoma, especially in combination with BRAF inhibitors."
"9332619","Immune function declines with age. In order to extend quality of life, it is critical that we understand mechanisms underlying the age-associated decline in immune function. Humans are riddled throughout life with a variety of acute and chronic infections which trigger the immune system. The accumulating effect of acute and chronic infections throughout the lifespan profoundly impacts the T cell repertoire and immune response of aged individuals. Although the aging mouse model provides a robust experimental model amenable to addressing mechanisms, it is increasingly realized that an important limitation of the mouse model is that mice are typically housed in specific pathogen free conditions. Immune senescence cannot be appropriately modeled in mice in which antigen experience has been deliberately constrained. In addition, optimal immune responses to new infections are thought to be dependent on a diverse repertoire of nave T cells. With age, the numbers and diversity of nave T cells decline and the ratio of memory to nave T cells greatly increases. It has been determined that T cell recognition of antigen/MHC is highly degenerate and T cell responses exhibit extensive and unexpected cross reactivity. We hypothesize that, with the declining numbers of nave T cells with age, the response to new infections become increasingly dependent on memory cells that accumulated with antigen experience and are fortuitously cross reactive. The first goal of this proposal is to develop a better mouse model for aging by defined exposure early in life to sequential infection with chronic and acute viruses. The second goal of this developmental R21 is to test the hypothesis that sequentially-infected aged mice, by virtue of enhanced antigen experience, will manifest increased diversity in the memory T cell repertoire capable of cross- reacting with new infections. Accomplishing the goals of this developmental R21 will be an important advance for aging research. Studies in antigen-experienced aged mice will benefit understanding the impact of antigen experience on immunity and senescence in elderly humans and has important implications for vaccination strategies for the elderly, supporting the concept that vaccines in young and middle age are important for maintaining immunity in later life."
"9341899","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, female sex workers (FSW) are at disproportionate risk for violence, HIV, and substance use. Though many studies have shown that violence imparts HIV risk, little is known about how different forms of violence interact in te lives of sex workers to produce sexual and drug-related HIV risk. The proposed mentored research will examine the association of four dominant forms of abuse (intimate partner violence, client violence, pimp violence, and police violence) with the predominant modes of HIV transmission in this population (unprotected sex and injection drug use), identifying forms of violence that synergistically increase the risk of HIV when they occur together (syndemic effect). The study will use data from sex workers (n=754) in Russia, one of few countries where HIV prevalence and AIDS deaths are still increasing. The study will first assess the prevalence of experiencing multiple forms of violence (polyvictimization) and the relationship between different types of violence. This will show how multiple forms of violence cluster and what demographic groups are most at risk for specific violence clusters. Then, after exploring the individual association of each type of violence with the outcomes, two analytic approaches will be used to explore how sexual and drug-related HIV risk increases as the number of types of violence FSW are exposed to accumulates. First, dose-response techniques will quantify the relationship between the number of types of violence experienced and sexual and drug-related HIV risk. Additionally, multivariate regression analysis will be used to quantify the impact of each form of violence on unprotected sex and injection drug use, using interaction terms to identify synergistic effects between different forms of violence. This study provides a basis for understanding the nature and extent of polyvictimization in propagating HIV and substance use risk in the context of sex work. This research incorporates elements of syndemic and polyvictimization frameworks, both of which have been underutilized in sex work contexts, and extends quantitative methods typically used with these frameworks via the use of interaction terms. Despite WHO calls for violence interventions as a critical component of HIV prevention, violence has not been consistently or comprehensively integrated into HIV and substance abuse research. This study will inform assessment of and intervention on distinct forms of violence in future research and in service provision for HIV and substance abuse among FSW. The proposed dissertation research and training plan leverage the rigorous classroom training and faculty mentorship at Johns Hopkins and will advance the trainee's career goals of becoming an independent investigator and developing evidence-based approaches to reduce substance abuse, violence, and HIV in marginalized populations."
"9230454","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can result in the disturbance of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and physical functioning. Residual cognitive disturbance remains the most significant concern of persons with all severities of TBI. Normal brain cognitive function depends on synaptic connectivity via neurotransmitter release. We have previously shown that experimental TBI can produce persistent deficits in evoked neurotransmitter release, but the mechanisms are unknown. Neurotransmitter release at the synapse requires fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. We have data that a crucial step in this process involving the assembly of a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex is impaired after TBI. This concept is supported by novel ultra-structural preliminary data that demonstrate a reduction of vesicles near the synaptic active zone after TBI. We have also found that proteins important to the assembly of SNARE complexes are decreased after TBI. Cysteine string protein alpha (CSP?), which promotes SNARE-complex assembly by chaperoning SNAP-25 during synaptic activity, is reduced after TBI. Alpha (?)-synuclein is a protein localized mainly in synapses wher it is thought to function in the regulation of synaptic transmission via interaction with specific pools of synaptic vesicles, thereby modulating synaptic functions in the normal brain. There is evidence that a normal role of ?-synuclein is to assist in SNARE complex formation through its interaction with VAMP2. We have preliminary data that native ?-synuclein is decreased from 6hrs to 4 weeks after experimental TBI, suggesting impaired normal function of ?-synuclein. Relevant to this project are recent reports demonstrating that 1) a genetic knock-out of ?-synuclein can reduce the number of vesicles at the presynaptic terminal () and 2) that ?-synuclein can rescue neurons that genetically lack CSPa (). Since both distal synaptic vesicles and CSP? are diminished after TBI, we hypothesize that therapies that restore normal wild-type ?-synuclein levels after TBI will prevent SNARE complex assembly deficits and improve neurotransmitter release and cognitive function after TBI. The first Aim will examine the effects of TBI on wild-type and cytotoxic forms of ?-synuclein. The second Aim will determine the effects of over-expression of ?-synuclein on markers of SNARE protein complex assembly, neurotransmitter release, and cognition. The last Aim will determine if restoring (post-TBI) wild-type ?-synuclein levels can attenuate SNARE protein complexes, increase distal pools of synaptic vesicles, prevent neurotransmitter release deficits, and improve behavioral function. This Aim is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which has been shown to increase ?-synuclein, can attenuate the post-injury loss of wild-type ?-synuclein. While the neurodegenerative properties of ?-synuclein have been a major research area, the concept of restoring ?-synuclein homeostasis represents a novel target of therapeutic intervention after TBI."
"9232705","Project Summary: Circulating tumour cells (CTC) are shed into the vasculature from primary tumours, and have been shown to contribute to the formation of metastatic lesions in model systems. Monitoring these circulating cells therefore presents, in principle, a means to monitor a tumour's metastatic potential in real time. Similar to the heterogeneity of cellular subpopulations within an individual tumour, CTCs within an individual also exhibit heterogeneity, containing subpopulations having varying relevance to the development of metastatic disease. Recent studies show that specific subpopulations of CTCs possess metastatic potential, while other subpopulations of circulating epithelial cells may be relatively benign. Similarly, the levels of surface proteins on CTCs are heterogeneous and dynamic: they are observed to change as a function of disease stage and response to therapy. In particular, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) appears to be a dynamic process in CTCs, and the markers that correspond to these two states vary and contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity of CTCs. Using a microfluidic device, the velocity valley (VV) chip, that was developed in our group, we now have the ability to profile a CTC population from blood samples and by sorting these cells based on expression of surface markers. This novel technology has enabled us to capture and study CTCs within various ranges of EMT. In this proposal, our goal is to fully develop the VV chip technology into a fully integrated device for CTC population profiling, CTC detection, and molecular analysis. This will be accomplished through integration of companion technologies allowing for sensitive on-chip electrochemical detection and genetic analysis of CTCs. Manufacturing methods for the device will be investigated for production at high-scale. In addition, automation for sample analysis and detection will be developed enabling the full realization of the device in a clinical or research setting. Finally the device will be validated with clinical samples from prostate and breast cancer patients. This project will include the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team of six researchers and clinicians for device development, manufacturing, and clinical testing. As a team, the researchers will work to develop and validate this diagnostic platform. At the completion of this project a clinical research tool will be produced capable of profiling a patient's CTC population and providing molecular and genetic information on the EMT for that population in a single automated device with capture, profiling, and detection capabilities.

"9328539","Abstract  Uveal melanoma is the most common ocular tumor in adults. It harbors genetic mutations very different from those seen in cutaneous melanoma. Liver metastasis is common in uveal melanoma and contributes to the very poor prognosis with average survival of several months. Currently there is no treatment for metastatic uveal melanoma. Activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 are the most important cancer drivers, as approximately 80% of uveal melanomas have mutations in either GNAQ or GNA11. Our recent studies have shown that the mutant GNAQ/11 potently activates the YAP oncoprotein, which is a key component of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. Moreover, the elevated YAP activity is essential for tumor growth of uveal melanoma cells containing an activating mutation in GNAQ/11. Besides GNAQ/11, mutations in BAP1, SF3B1, and EIF1AX are also frequently observed in uveal melanoma in a mutually exclusive manner. However, a mechanistic understanding of these genes in uveal melanoma and their functional interactions are largely unknown. The major goals of this project are to determine the contributions of the genes commonly mutated in uveal melanoma and their functional interaction in promoting tumorigenesis of uveal melanoma. We also aim to characterize and validate potential therapeutic targets and tools for treatment of uveal melanoma."
"9326633","SUMMARY Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating neurological disease affecting almost 2.5 million individuals worldwide. It is known that environmental factors heavily contribute to the etiology of MS, however their roles in disease course are not well understood. One interest in the field is whether or not dietary choices have an impact on disease severity in MS patients. Epidemiological studies have indicated high Body Mass Index (BMI) (?25) as a risk factor for earlier onset of MS, suggesting that high fat diet, which is associated with high BMI, may also be involved, however, their effects on progression of disease severity have not been explored. My proposal investigates the mechanisms linking high BMI and high fat diet to disease course using animal models of MS to test hypotheses generated from preliminary studies in human patients. In collaboration with the MS center at Mt. Sinai, I have analyzed data on brain volume, immune profile and diet in therapy-nave RRMS patients which has revealed several differences between patients with a low BMI (<25) and those with a high BMI (?25), including greater monocytic counts in patients with a high BMI. We have further identified a potential mechanism underlying these differences, specifically, lipid-dependent modulation of DNA methylation in monocytes. Based on these results, my proposal tests the hypothesis that high fat diet leads to an accumulation of plasma ceramides that modify the methylome of genes affecting proliferation and function of monocytes, thereby leading to greater monocytic infiltration, greater CNS damage and more severe disease course using in vitro and in vivo models. The results of this proposal will have a high translational impact by providing essential information on the impact of diet on disease course that can be directly applied to patients."
"9264170","ABSTRACT Amyloid-beta (A?)?the principal component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer?s disease (AD)?is generated by sequential secretase cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type 1 transmembrane protein. Despite three decades of study, the precise subcellular locations of A? generation have remained elusive. This is important because not only is A? central to AD pathogenesis but reducing A? levels has been a major focus in the development of potential AD therapeutics. Determing the precise cellular locations of A? generation has been a major bottleneck because current model systems are incapable of tracking A? peptide in living cells. We have recently developed a novel APP construct which incorporates an unnatural amino acid in the extracellular A? segment of APP, enabling click-chemistry to attach a small molecule fluorophore to A? at the plasma membrane. Coincident attachment of distinct fluorescent proteins to intra- and extracellular regions of APP allows the real-time visualization of APP trafficking and A? generation in living cells. In this application we will exploit this model system to determine the impact of retromer sorting on APP trafficking and A? generation in engineered neural cell lines (Aim 1) and to determine the temporal-spatial dynamics of APP trafficking and A? generation within primary neurons (Aim 2). At the completion this grant, we will have a basic understanding of the itineraries of APP that lead to A? generation. We will also be able to examine these same pathways in primary neurons (or even iPSCs), and study how these A?-generating pathways may be altered by genetic variants or neuronal activity."
"9350893","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed study, we will integrate a modular array of miniaturized air monitors for use as personal and residential monitors for future epidemiological studies that will test hypotheses on asthma development and asthma exacerbation. Our overall approach is to develop and test (a) a real-time monitor that can serve as a platform to record its own data and data from other monitors to establish spatial and temporal variations of potential acute asthma stressors and (b) a monitor that can collect either spatially- or time- resolved, integrated samples that can be archived for subsequent analysis in the laboratory. Time scales for battery-powered deployments of both the real-time monitors and the integrated sampler could range from 24 hours to a month in duration depending on the study design. Three aims form our proposal.  Aim 1) Integrate a modular array of miniaturized air monitors for use as residential and personal monitors. The three monitors that make up our modular array currently exist in various stages of development: a completed monitor that is not fully validated (the Multi-day microAeth(r)), a prototype that will be further miniaturized while expanding functionality (the Archive Monitor) and an off the shelf inexpensive smart phone enabled monitor for airborne particulates (The Airbeam from Aircasting.org). Tri-axial accelerometer and GPS chips are integrated into our personal monitors allowing determinations of location, wearing compliance and activity related parameters. The multi-day microAeth monitor, measures optically absorbant components of particulate matter including black carbon and environmental wood smoke. Bluetooth, WiFi and/or serial connections will allow all sensor data to be logged on the multi-day microAeth(r) to simplify integration and allow all sensor data (personal and residential) to be sent to the study team on a daily basis. We include the Airbeam to show capacity of our platform for integrating data streams from third-party monitors and to show capacity for integrating our sensor data into a pre-existing smart phone app.  Aim 2) Refine or develop sensitive analytical methods for a wide suite of asthma-related exposure measurements for archive, integrated samples of PM10, PM2.5 and semi-volatile compounds. The initial suite of measurements to be validated for the archive samples includes airborne allergens (mouse, dust mite and cockroach), PCR based microbial assays, semi-volatile and particle-associated non-volatile PAHs, black carbon, particulate-bound elements, and gravimetric determinations of PM10 and PM2.5 filters.

"9412075","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal requests support for Years 11-15 of the T32 Training Program in Microbial Pathogenesis, a highly successful program that incorporates researchers from seven departments in the School of Medicine and the Department of Biology at University of Utah. This program was initially an outgrowth of the twice- monthly Microbial Pathogenesis Seminar Series (MPSS), which brought together basic scientists and clinician scientists in Microbiology and Immunology for regular, highly engaged research presentations. Since its inception 10 years ago, the Training Program has sponsored 3 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral trainees. Predoctoral trainees enter graduate school primarily through the Molecular Biology umbrella program, where they are supported for one year while taking rigorous core courses and selecting a thesis laboratory. Both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees are selected after entering a laboratory associated with a T32 mentor. The Training Program provides many opportunities for exposure of the trainees and the broader community to cutting edge research and interactions including: the MPSS, the Microbial Pathogenesis Retreat, the Summer Journal Club, the Clinical-Microbiology Combined Conference, and advanced courses in Bacterial Pathogenesis, Viral Pathogenesis, and Immunology. Critical to the training environment are trainee opportunities for interaction with MPSS speakers with a variety of research and health perspectives, and the opportunity to host distinguished speakers. Each of the trainees also present their research at the Training Grant Retreat, providing them with an opportunity for exposure to the greater microbial pathogenesis community on campus and to receive feedback from the external scientists. Trainees also present important new discoveries in the Summer Journal Club. Newly initiated in 2013, is a Clinical-Microbiology Combined Conference with the Infectious Disease Fellows in Medicine, with the goal of highlighting the clinical manifestation of infectious diseases with mechanistic understanding of microbial virulence factors. Trainees have established a record of high impact publications and are pursuing careers in areas of biomedical research and teaching. The various components of the Training Program clearly serve as the nexus of Microbial Pathogenesis on this campus, enhancing the environment of the supported trainees as well as the entire biomedical community."
"9258311","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over 90% of breast cancer (BC)-related deaths are attributed not to the direct growth of the primary tumor, but rather to the spread of these malignant cells to distant organs, a process known as metastasis. Despite decades of investigation, a complete understanding of the molecular forces vital to metastasis remains incomplete, a gap in knowledge that has hindered the development of therapeutics that specifically target metastatic lesions. Contributing to this failure is the ability of disseminated  tumor cells to enter a state of dormancy upon arrival to their metastatic microenvironment, wherein they remain viable and resistant to many standard-of-care chemotherapies, especially those that target rapidly dividing cells. Indeed, these cells do not persist indefinitely in a stat of dormancy, as they possess the capability to reinstate proliferative programs to provide the source for deadly metastatic recurrences years after clinical remission is initially achieved. The pathways underlying the initial instatement of dormancy and, more importantly, those crucial to subsequent escape from dormancy, are poorly understood and must be further interrogated in an effort to develop maintenance therapies that specifically target these undetectable cells. Since genetic changes are, by nature, less prone to arise and be selected for in a non-proliferative niche, it is natural to assume that dormant phenotypes are most susceptible to epigenetic alterations. We therefore seek to delineate epigenetic alterations critical to manipulating metastatic BC dormancy. In doing so, we will focus on a specific member of an emerging class of RNA, long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA), that has been shown to induce global changes in chromatin modification patterns and confer metastatic features to a dormant BC cell line. Using powerful epigenomic techniques in an established model of BC dormancy, we will map the epigenetic landscape modified by this lncRNA in concert with its molecular binding partners. These experiments will provide crucial insight into the mechanisms underlying BC dormancy both dependent and independent of this pro-metastatic lncRNA, thereby establishing the molecular foundation necessary to develop therapies that improve long-term outcomes for BC patients."
"9265138","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are submitting Integrated Multiscale Networks in Schizophrenia in response to RFA-MH-16-300. Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a generally devastating neuropsychiatric illness with considerable morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal cost. Genetic factors have been strongly implicated via family and twin data, and more recently directly through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and sequencing studies. The primary objective of our project is to develop and apply advanced integrative methods for computational and functional analysis of networks, including but not limited to Bayesian network reconstruction and prediction algorithms of variant causality to identify key drivers of SCZ pathology for potential therapeutic intervention. To achieve this in Aim 1 we will construct single tissue and multi- tissue probabilistic causal network by applying a novel top-down and bottom-up or hypothesis-driven probabilistic causal network approaches in RNA sequencing key drivers of networks, novel pathways, and new mechanisms in SCZ pathology data from the CommonMind consortium, incorporating prior information. In Aim 2 we will use network models derived in Aim 1 in order to improve the predictive SCZ networks that could be used to identify SCZ-relevant transcription-based features that can be useful in therapeutic screening. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use modified RNA and cellular models to validate the network models, key drivers and investigate their phenotype effects."
"9231513","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebrovascular sequelae comprise a critical part of traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the acute phase, damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leads to cerebral edema. In the delayed phase, persisting dysfunction in microvessels impair angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Hence, any attempt to treat TBI must take into account these evolving cerebrovascular mechanisms over time. Our overall hypothesis states that (i) in the acute phase, recombinant annexin A2 binds endothelial cell membrane F-actin that preserves endothelial integrity thus protecting against TBI-induced BBB disruption; and (ii) in the delayed phase, annexin A2 promotes remodeling with enhanced angiogenesis, and concurrently increases vascular-derived trophic factor secretion for promoting endogenous neurogenesis and neurorepair. Aim 1: Investigate mechanisms of annexin A2 in early cerebrovascular protection after TBI. We will test temporal profile of BBB permeability and correlate with junction protein expression, and brain edema in vivo TBI model and in vitro endothelial/astrocytes co-cultures. Denatured rA2 or pharmacological inhibitors will be applied to test specific roles of rA2 in binding to F-actin, F-actin stress fiber formation, and permeability modulated signaling pathways. Aim 2: Investigate mechanisms of annexin A2 in cerebrovascular remodeling after TBI. We will test temporal profile of angiogenesis by immunohistochemistry. In situ plasmin activity assay will examine vascular fibrinolytic activity; mRNA microarrays will examine expression profiles of vascular endothelium derived angiogenic/anti-angiogenic, and trophic factors in isolated cerebral microvascular fragments. Long-term neurological function will be examined for up to three months post-TBI. In endothelial cultures, we will test rA2 effects and mechanisms in angiogenesis with in vitro angiogenic assays. Aim 3: Investigate mechanisms of annexin A2 in promoting vascular-derived trophic factor expression for enhancing endogenous neurogenesis and neurorepair. mRNA microarray will examine expression of neuronal trophic factors in isolated microvascular fragments, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and western blots will investigate hippocampus neuron degeneration, neurogenesis in different brain areas, and white matter injury and repair over time after TBI."

"9235661","Sleep and circadian disruption, including sleep apnea, sleep fragmentation, and circadian rhythm irregularity, affect millions of Americans, and are associated with impaired cognition and Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Challenges in applying standard techniques (e.g. polysomnography) in ambulatory settings to quantify sleep and circadian disruption in large numbers of community-dwelling older adults, and in obtaining detailed cognitive assessments and brain tissue from the same individuals, have left knowledge gaps. Thus, although sleep and circadian rhythm disruption affect millions of older Americans, there are few data concerning the contribution of their different forms to the growing number of older adults with cognitive impairment and dementia, and associated brain mechanisms. This study aims to fill these gaps. The overall goal of this study is to quantify the contributions of, and identify brain mechanisms linking, sleep and circadian rhythm disruption to cognitive decline and incident AD in older adults. In compelling preliminary work, we developed and applied a new method of measuring sleep fragmentation in the community setting using actigraphy, the non-invasive continuous measurement of movement using a watch-like device. In older adults, we found that higher sleep fragmentation is associated with 1) a greater risk of incident AD, 2) more brain arteriolosclerosis and subcortical strokes at autopsy, and 3) a higher burden of AD pathology in APOE e4 carriers. However, sleep fragmentation is only one type of sleep disruption, and its impact cannot be understood without simultaneously examining the impact of common sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, which may affect up to half of older adults. To extend these findings, we propose to use a portable battery of 2 wearable devices measuring continuous peripheral arterial tonometry, oximetry, and actigraphy to simultaneously quantify 5 key forms of sleep and circadian disruption in 780 older adults in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (R01AG17911). These will include 1) sleep apnea, 2) sleep duration, 3) sleep architecture, 4) sleep fragmentation, and 5) circadian irregularity. These measurements will be combined with donated cognitive and other clinical data, as well as post-mortem histopathology and brain MRI indices from decedents, to elucidate the brain correlates of sleep and circadian disruption in community-dwelling adults, and their impact on cognitive impairment and incident AD dementia. By overcoming key translational barriers, this study will fill important gaps in our knowledge concerning the burden and brain correlates of 5 key forms of sleep and circadian disruption in old age. This offers the potential to leverage sleep and circadian interventions to decrease the growing burden of cognitive impairment and AD, and for targeted therapies to improve brain health for the millions of Americans who experience sleep or circadian rhythm dysfunction."

"9274052","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-malarial acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses (AUFIs) are caused by infectious diseases, without an identifiable source or focus of infection, in patients who present with undifferentiated fever and have negative results in diagnostic tests for malaria. AUFIs are believed to cause significant morbidity and mortality based on small focal studies. However, their true incidence remains unknown in Latin America for at least three reasons: 1) the etiologic agents tend to be underrecognized under the umbrella of malaria and dengue; 2) epidemiological surveillance without appropriate diagnostic tools; and 3) lack of proper training among scientists and health care personnel. The goal of this Global Infectious Disease Research Training Program is to form a strong team of Colombian scientists from Universidad de Antioquia, Universidad Nacional, and Instituto Colombiano de Medicina Tropical investigating endemic causes of non-malarial AUFIs with researcher partners at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and University of California at San Diego. Program faculty have diverse and complementary areas of expertise conducive to developing synergistic research efforts to target the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these neglected and frequently lethal diseases. To achieve the goal of this training program, we will offer a carefully planned portfolio of medium- and long-term training to address the needs identified in this proposal. Specifically, during the first year of the Program, we will train six medium-term (six-month duration) faculty members from three participating institutions in Colombia on fundamental methodology to rapidly establish a basic research infrastructure. Immediately thereafter, researchers from UTMB will travel to each participating institution for three weeks to assist in the process of implementation. We will support training across institutions in the region through visits for in-country training and through the use of advanced communication technologies and web-based common repositories of projects, research results, protocols, and publications. During Years 02 to 05 of the Program, we will provide long-term training to four PhD students and four postdoctoral fellows enrolled in local programs in Colombia, with a maximum out-of-country training component of 12 months. The research produced during training will be locally relevant and will address multiple areas in epidemiology, ecology, vector competence, and pathogenesis. An important planned outcome is the increased awareness of these diseases at the level of human and veterinary health professionals, as well as public health authorities. We will also contribute to the long-term impact and continuity of this training program by funding reintegration mini-grants for our long-term trainees and by appointing Colombian faculty as UTMB adjunct faculty members. At the completion of Year 05, we expect the three participating institutions in Colombia to have become centers of excellence in the research of arthropod-borne viral and bacterial diseases and leptospirosis in South America."
"9411409","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia currently afflicts over 5 million people in the United States and is projected to rise to 11-16 million elderly by the year 2050. Recently my colleagues and I demonstrated that spatial memory deficits in mouse models of aging and AD correspond to a decrease in excitability of neurons of the hippocampus. However, the molecular mediators of these intrinsic changes and the consequence of excitability changes at the individual neuron level once they are embedded into an active neural network remains unknown. The present proposal is based on our new preliminary data showing that memory deficits in an AD mouse model correspond to changes in the expression of a specific subset of excitatory and inhibitory receptors. These changes in expression are indicative of a shift in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory influences on hippocampal neural networks. An appropriate balance has been shown to be crucial for the generation normal gamma band oscillatory network activity and for the long range synchronization of beta and gamma oscillations. We have new electrophysiological pilot data, showing that spatial memory deficits in our AD mouse model is correlated with a significantly reduced coherence of hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortical (PFC) oscillatory network activity in the beta and gamma frequency ranges. Additional preliminary data on receptor expression provide a probable mechanistic explanation for the observed reduction in Hip-PFC coherence. It is posited that either misregulation of plasma membrane proteins normally required for memory (via de novo synthesis) and plasticity, or the dysfunction of Hip-PFC network coherence, or both, underlie spatial memory deficits in AD that will be tested in ensuing aims. Outcomes of the proposed research have the potential to make a major impact on the identification of new treatments for AD-related memory disorders. Our molecular and network level analysis may also discover biomarkers that could be used to detect potential onset of Alzheimer's disease well in advance, so that treatment could begin earlier with better success rates."
"9268167","Abstract of the Research Plan Despite significant research effort to understand the aging process, we are still not able to confidently answer fundamental questions: Why do we age and can we delay it in humans? Recent studies suggest that various age-related pathophysiological conditions may have common underpinnings, the so-called hallmarks of aging that include mitochondrial defects, cellular senescence and inflammation. Our research group has worked for more than a decade on NAD+-dependent lysine deacetylases known as the Sirtuins (SIRT1-7). Thanks to this grant, we discovered a new cause of aging that explains why mitochondrial function declines with age, a process we call ?Genome Asynchrony?. Genome asynchrony manifests in heart and muscle tissue (and possibly other tissues) as a breakdown in nuclear-mitochondrial communication due to a decline the NAD+ levels and loss of SIRT1 activity. The result is the stabilization of the hypoxia factor HIF-1? in the absence of hypoxia (a phenomenon we call ?pseudohypoxia?) and a potent inhibitory effect on nuclear- mitochondrial communication. Importantly, by feeding old mice the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), for one week, thus restoring NAD+ to youthful levels, the mitochondrial defects of old muscle can be rapidly reversed, demonstrating that NAD+ is a key regulator of aspects of aging in mice and that aspects of aging are reversible. During the study we discovered that the NMN treatment was able to rapidly reverse key markers of aging in the muscle, suggesting declining NAD+ levels may underlie inflammation during aging. We find that NAD+ levels and HIF-1? specifically control the secretion of IL-18 and IL-1? by regulating the activity of the inflammasome, a key regulator of healthspan in mammals. In the next phase of the grant, we will determine the NAD+-dependent mechanisms that regulate inflammation along with its role in the secretory phenotype of senescent cells (SASP) and test interventions to counteract these pathways. Aim 1 is to use primary macrophages from genetically modified mice (GEMMs), along with novel epigenetic manipulation technologies and clinic-ready small molecules to test our hypotheses. In Aim 2, we will perform a comprehensive study of this pathway in vivo using young and old mice from colonies of both wildtype and GEMMs with altered levels of NAD+ and HIF-1? throughout the body or in specific tissues such as muscle and brain. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of the best NAD+ modulating compounds (from Aim 1) to prolong healthspan and lifespan in mice. We will also test the best compounds for their efficacy in a gold- standard model of acute gout (a common age-associated inflammatory disease for which there are no effective treatments) thereby paving the way for rapid human clinical trials. The work will have far-reaching implications by changing our understanding of why aging occurs and creating novel therapeutics to prolong human healthspan and longevity."
"9408864","?    DESCRIPTION:  Substance use disorders (SUD) are significant contributors to the global burden of disease. Annual direct and indirect economic costs of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs have been estimated at $500 billion in the United States alone. An estimated 20.2 million Americans are in need of treatment for a SUD, yet fewer than 5% receive specialty treatment. The most frequent point of health care contact in the United States is outpatient primary care. Minnesota ranks 1st in the US for health status and has one of the highest rates of access to primary care in the US. The proposed NorthStar node of the NIDA Clinical Trials Network brings together diverse healthcare delivery models that excel in delivery and research of primary care. Led by internal medicine physicians with practice and research expertise in addiction, the NorthStar node includes: 1) two major non-profit integrated health systems serving more than 1 million Minnesotans through over 100 primary care clinics (HealthPartners and Allina Health); 2) a Federally Qualified Health Center (NorthPoint Health & Wellness Center); 3) an accountable care organization managing the poorest and highest healthcare utilizing populations of Minnesota's most populous county (Hennepin Health); 4) a student health center, which provides primary and behavioral care for the more than 20,000 university students (University of Minnesota's Boynton Health Services); 5) the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI), a non-profit health improvement organization dedicated to developing and implementing quality improvement and best-practices protocols across more than 45 health systems and 8,000 physicians; and 6) the University of Minnesota Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. In fulfillment of the CTN mission, the NorthStar node will develop (1) models of coordinated chronic care disease management of patients with SUD, (2) risk stratification tools for opiate prescription for chronic pain management in primary care, (3) clinical decision support tools focusing on the treatment of opiate use disorders, (4) integrated models of tobacco cessation treatment and HIV primary care, and (5) effective models to reduce 30-day readmission rates for SUD patients or at-risk users discharged from inpatient general medical settings."

We discovered that transcription errors give rise to misfolded proteins that induce proteotoxic stress. Ultimately, this stress can overload the protein quality control machinery and allow proteins associated with Alzheimer?s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington?s disease or prion disease to escape degradation, which promotes their aggregation and enhances their toxicity. Thus, transcription errors represent a new molecular mechanism by which cells can acquire disease. As a result, it will be important to learn more about the mechanisms that induce or suppress transcription errors, because these mechanisms could either delay or accelerate the progression of proteotoxic diseases.

"9225329","Project Summary / Abstract Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop two main pathological changes in the brain: amyloid plaques composed of deposits of abnormally aggregated amyloid ?-protein (A?) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of abnormal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Amyloid plaques and NFTs are accompanied with chronic inflammation characterized by activated microglia and increased cytokines. Except a small subset of early-onset familial AD cases, the causes for the vast majority of AD cases are unknown and satisfactory therapeutic and preventive measures for AD are unavailable. Therefore, an urgent need exists to identify the molecular mechanisms that increase the risk for the vast majority of AD cases and for development of preventive and therapeutic measures. Over 30% of adults are currently classified as obese in the US and obesity is considered to be responsible for up to 70-90% of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) cases. Consumption of high fat diets (HFD) is strongly associated with obesity, insulin resistance and T2DM. Obesity and T2DM are main risk factors of AD, cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. Additionally, sustained alterations in blood glucose levels promote vascular inflammation and blood- brain barrier (BBB) impairment. Furthermore, the risk of AD increases with the number of vascular risk factors. According to the vascular hypothesis of AD, dysfunctional BBB play a causal role in the pathogenesis of AD, leading to accumulation of A?, neuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, neurodegeneration and, ultimately, dementia of AD. We recently found increased levels of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) in blood exosomes derived from animal models of AD, T2DM and peripheral inflammation. Blood miR-34a levels are elevated in patients with T2DM. We hypothesize that HFD and peripheral inflammation increase miR-34a in blood and increased levels of miR-34a in blood induce brain endothelial cell dysfunction (dysfunctional BBB), leading to an increased risk, early onset and accelerated progression of AD and that miR-34a can be a therapeutic target. This hypothesis will be tested by carrying out the following aims. In Aim 1, we will produce a miR-34a-deficient AD mouse model and determine the effects of miR-34a deficiency on AD-like pathology and cognitive functions. In Aim 2, we will prepare extracellular vesicles (EVs) loaded with miR-34a and its inhibitor, intravenously infuse the EVs and determine the effects of EVs loaded with miR-34a and its inhibitor on AD-like pathology and behavioral functions in an AD mouse model. The long-term goals of this project are to determine the role of miR-34a in the pathogenesis of AD and to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies for AD."
"9343418","ABSTRACT  This proposal requests partial support for the 10th International Conference on Cryptococcus and Cryptococcosis (ICCC) to be held in Foz do Iguazu, Brazil, March 26-30, 2017. Cryptococcus neoformans is an environmental organism that has become a major threat to a growing number of immunocompromised patients in today's world. Recently, the CDC estimated more than 1 million new cases/year of cryptococcosis will occur worldwide in patients with AIDS, with more than half of those affected by cryptococcosis dying of the infection (1, 2). Frighteningly, during the last few years, cryptococcosis has emerged in the Vancouver Island, Canada (3, 4) and Pacific Northwest of the US (5-7) as an important disease in immunocompetent subjects. These epidemiological data underscore the potential for this fungus to continue to emerge in unexpected geographic and clinical settings.  The broad and long-term goal of this conference is to bring together the world's leading researchers in this rapidly expanding field to foster cross-disciplinary discussions, research, and clinical collaborations to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenicity of Cryptococcus and cryptococcosis.  The specific aims of this meeting will be to convene leading experts whose expertise covers critical areas within this field, as well as early career and junior investigators, students, and postdocs. We anticipate hosting 200 participants for this conference. The program will be structured into 14 sessions covering the diverse properties and characteristics of the pathogen as well as host susceptibility and immunity, emphasizing what makes a normal host suddenly susceptible to this disease. Importantly, the Conference will provide ample coverage of current and novel therapeutic strategies and a special forum to address clinical issues related to diverse clinical backgrounds within which clinicians from around the world operate. In general, each oral session will consist of 4 talks: 3 talks (20 min) followed by a 5-min discussion by leaders in the field and 1 talk selected from the abstracts (10 min) with a 5-min discussion. Abstracts from junior investigators, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows will be included among those selected for oral presentation. The Conference will host 2 poster sessions which will permit all participants to actively contribute to these topics. There will be no concurrent sessions. Every effort will be made to encourage participation by graduate students and postdocs and we will see parity with respect to women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. Childcare will be provided as needed.  The 10th ICCC is significant because focuses on an important infectious disease afflicting both immunocompromised and immunocompetent people, bringing together members of the international research community who investigate cryptococcosis. The health relatedness of this application is immediate and translational: the discussions generated and potential new collaborations will define the important basic science questions as well as forge new avenues for the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies."
"9309380","Project Summary/Abstract: In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 6% reduction in all-cause mortality for participants screened with Low Dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray (CXR). Based largely on these findings, lung screening using LDCT is now available to 8.7 million people in the United States who meet the NLST eligibility criteria. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and older screening is covered by Medicare. The area of the body imaged during LDCT lung screening encompasses more than the lung, and abnormalities are often visualized in other organs. Findings that are unrelated to lung cancer, but which are of potential clinical importance, are commonly referred to as significant incidental findings (SIFs). In the NLST, SIFs were detected in 10% of participants at the first screen and an average of 6% at each of the two incidence screens. Although SIFs are known to be associated with increased health care utilization, it remains unclear whether detection of these abnormalities is beneficial or detrimental to patient health. SIFs may prove beneficial if they represent potentially malignant conditions, such as cancers, for which early intervention improves outcomes. However, SIFs may prove harmful if they represent benign conditions, such as liver cysts, whose work-up causes additional morbidity, costs, or mental duress for patients. The outcomes associated with SIFs are likely to differ depending on the organ in which the SIF is discovered. The discovery of SIFs in the NLST may, in part, explain the difference in all-cause mortality reported between the LDCT and CXR arms. The goal of this project is to understand the morbidity and mortality associated with detection of a SIF on LDCT lung screening. Information on SIFs and short- and long-term outcomes is available in the NLST data, and offers a unique opportunity to determine the morbidity and mortality associated with LDCT- detected SIFs. We propose to use the NLST data to determine whether SIF detection was associated with reduced all-cause mortality in the LDCT arm of the NLST, compared with the CXR arm. We also plan to identify those SIFs most likely to lead to cancer detection, and those SIFs most often associated with iatrogenic complications. Findings from this study will provide evidence that may be used to develop practice guidelines that can be applied to the management of LDCT-detected SIFs to maximize the cost-effectiveness and health benefits of lung cancer screening programs and to minimize the potential harms."
"9308432","Abstract  Hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor in the development of calcium oxalate kidney stone disease which presently occurs in about 12% of the American population, costing an estimated $2 billion annually. Despite the significant and serious clinical consequences of hyperoxaluria, which can be associated with numerous diseases and conditions, including an emerging population of patients who undergo gastric bypass surgery, there is still no effective pharmacological treatment to resolve this problem. Consequently, patients have to resort to invasive procedures to eliminate kidney stones and/or suffer the ramifications, including the possibility of renal failure and even death.  Several key pieces of information obtained from our studies over the years have supported the notion that a significant amount of the body burden of oxalate can be eliminated through the intestinal tract resulting in reduced amounts of oxalate passing through the kidneys. This basic proof of principle was demonstrated earlier in rats with chronic renal failure where urinary oxalate was reduced 50 % due to the induction of enteric oxalate elimination. In addition, we demonstrated that a mouse model with elevated concentrations of oxalate in the blood and urine, due to the genetic disease of Primary Hyperoxaluria, type 1, were normalized by enteric oxalate excretion being initiated in the presence of the probiotic bacterium, Oxalobacter sp.  Hence, there exists considerable interest in exploiting the intestine as a means of alleviating the systemic oxalate load to mitigate the risk of stone formation and the eventual consequences of this kidney disease. The investment in furthering this beneficial approach involves a more in-depth look at the pathways oxalate utilizes to cross the intestinal barrier, and specifically, how they are regulated. While we have been steadily developing an understanding about the proteins involved, which belong to the Slc26 gene family, we cannot currently explain how these transporters are regulated in the different segments of the intestine. Based upon some very provocative preliminary data, we have established a research plan with two comprehensive, integrated Specific Aims The strength of this research strategy comprises a number of innovative approaches coupled with a solid, feasible experimental design in a concerted effort to determine two major ?unknowns?; (i) how the components of the bicarbonate-buffering system (pH, CO2 and HCO3- in conjunction with carbonic anhydrase), and (ii) how the cAMP-dependent regulatory pathways modulate net oxalate secretion and the enteric elimination of oxalate. This knowledge will represent a crucial step toward realizing the therapeutic potential of the intestine for resolving hyperoxaluria. 1"
"9209355","SUMMARY  Thrombotic complications in atherosclerosis are decisively determined by macrophage inflammation. In preclinical disease models, atherosclerosis is substantially diminished if macrophage numbers are decreased. Recent work from our Program Project's investigators has shown that real life stressors aggravate atherosclerosis in mice. In patients, psychosocial stress is a well-recognized risk factor for inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis (odds ratio 2.1 for myocardial infarction). Therefore, in both animal models and human subjects, an unmet need hinders our understanding of how risk factors for ischemic events, such as psychosocial stress or organ ischemia, accelerate atherosclerosis.  We and others recently described that macrophage dynamics in atherosclerotic plaque depend on recruitment (R) of monocytes from the spleen and bone marrow, but can also arise from local proliferation (P), especially in established atherosclerosis. Thus, to understand the processes leading to increased inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque, i.e. progression of atherosclerosis, it is essential to measure systemic supply parameters, including monocyte production in hematopoietic tissues (spleen, bone marrow), recruitment of cells into the plaque, and local cell proliferation. Conversely, cell death and exit (E) may decrease the overall macrophage number in tissue.  Currently, we lack non-invasive means of measuring macrophage recruitment, proliferation or exit (R/P/E) in mice and patients. This is a considerable hurdle for gaining a better understanding of basic atherosclerosis biology and for developing new therapeutic strategies targeted to immune cells. Once identified, these pathways could be tested as new therapeutic targets. In the clinical realm, the lack of non- invasive tools that measure R/P/E prevents us from understanding whether or not processes discovered in basic research translate to human patients.  In Project 2 we propose to develop, validate, and translate innovative positron emission tomography combined with magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) methods for both preclinical and clinical measurement of plaque macrophage dynamics. In Aim 1, we will develop integrated PET/MRI to study macrophage recruitment to lesions, macrophage proliferation, and macrophage exit by creatively combining existing imaging agents in atherosclerotic mice subjected to real-life stressors. In Aim 2, we will generate an immune cell-directed nanoparticle library screen and use 89Zr radiolabeling to develop new recruitment and proliferation (R/P) imaging agents. In Aim 3, we will test clinically-viable PET/MRI protocols in atherosclerotic rabbits and translate protocols for clinical imaging in human patients, interfacing with Project 3."
"9245278","Abstract/Project Summary Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans. Of the 9.4 million Americans who take opioids for chronic pain, 2.1 million are estimated by the NIH to be dependent on them and are in danger of turning to the black market. 4 of 5 heroin addicts say they come to the drug from prescription pain killers. Management of chronic pain has increasingly relied upon high-dose chronic opioid therapy, with this change paralleled by increasing numbers of individuals affected by opioid abuse, and dramatic rises in opioid-related overdose and death. Thus, it is imperative that we test and validate cost-effective, non-pharmacological interventions, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), for the treatment of pain to reduce reliance upon high-dose chronic opioids. CBT can effectively reduce pain without increasing costs or producing debilitating side effects associated with opioid medications. Unfortunately, its use in clinical practice is limited, as most of CBT benefits are believed to be related to the improvement of coping but not to pain modulation itself. We have repeatedly shown that 11 weeks of CBT for pain management can significantly reduce pain, suggesting that CBT could be employed as an adjunct therapy in clinical pain settings. Furthermore, we have recently determined that CBT-related pain relief engages multiple neural mechanisms and increases in cognitive control, emotion regulation, and executive processing. However, it remains unknown if CBT related pain relief activates endogenous opioid systems. Interestingly, we and others found that placebo, meditation and CBT attenuates pain responses by activating brain regions (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex) containing high concentrations of opioid receptors. In addition, CBT is postulated to attenuate pain by cognitive control processes and reducing expectations of impending noxious stimuli, mechanisms that are partially mediated by endogenous opioid systems. Therefore, we postulate that CBT engages endogenous opioid systems to reduce pain. This project will incorporate a unique combination of expertise and methodologies to achieve this aim, including a randomized, controlled 11 week CBT intervention, assessment of pre- to post-intervention changes in daily chronic back pain intensity based on telephone-based diaries, and controlled laboratory assessment of pre- to post- intervention changes in endogenous opioid function, tested by effects of opioid blockade on evoked pain responses relative to placebo condition. The proposed experiment will provide novel insight into the mechanisms supporting CBT-related pain relief, thereby providing a foundation for greater use of CBT in clinical settings. Project results would potentially lead to changes in clinical practice with significant population benefits, given the frequency with which chronic opioids are currently used and their recognized negative consequences."
"9230449","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop a quantitative model of the biomechanical basis of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) for a pediatric population. This expands upon our initial five year Bioengineering Research Partnership (BRP) in which we developed a biomechanical model of MTBI for a collegiate population, which has resulted in a database of more than 500,000 recorded head impacts in collegiate sports. This work has produced substantial advancements in the knowledge of injury mechanisms and head impact exposure, and resulted in translational outcomes, including: 1) adult brain injury criteria that provide improved diagnosis strategies and prevention systems, 2) optimized helmet design criteria and publically available helmet evaluations that have improved helmet technologies, and 3) football practice guidelines that have reduced head impact exposure in collegiate football. The proposed pediatric MTBI model will enable translational research and the development of new clinical and therapeutic approaches to reduce the incidence and negative effects of MTBI in youth athletes. Experimental and clinical projects among our team members will allow us to test hypotheses specific to the underlying pathomechanics and clinical sequelae of pediatric MTBI. A cohort of 1050 youth football players between the ages of 6 and 14 years will wear instrumented helmets to collect head acceleration data and clinical data over a 5 year period. Athletic environments offer a rich opportunity for collecting data on large numbers of head impacts, which enables research that combines biomechanical head impact data with the subsequent neurobiologic and functional changes in the brain. To date, biomechanical MTBI research has focused primarily on the approximately 100,000 athletes participating in college and professional football in the United States; however, little is known about the 3,500,000 youth (6 years to 14 years) athletes playing football each year. We hypothesize that head acceleration due to impact is predictive of the type and severity of brain injury, and correlates t specific clinical measures of pediatric MTBI. We aim to: 1) Quantify head impact exposure in youth football, 2) Determine head acceleration injury tolerance for sustaining pediatric MTBI, and 3) Correlate head acceleration with clinical variables related to pediatric MTBI. We have performed a pilot study on 119 youth football players aged 7 to 18 years to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed work. Successful completion of the proposed hypothesis-driven research will result in the development of novel protective equipment strategies, diagnostic tools for field use and other healthcare settings, novel strategies for return to play decisions, and educational tools for disseminating information about the evaluation and prevention of MTBI in the pediatric population. Additionally, our research results will have translational relevance to the general population, including motor vehicle crashes and pediatric consumer products."
"9242924","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Opioids are commonly prescribed to patients on dialysis for pain or the treatment of opioid use disorder; however, practitioners lack basic outcome data on the safety of these medications in end-stage renal disease patients where the risk of sudden cardiac arrest is 30 times higher than the population average. For example, both methadone and oxycodone have been implicated in the prolongation of the QTc interval, which can precipitate fatal arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes. Similarly, propoxyphene has type 1A antidysrhythmic properties with QRS prolongation and potential fatal arrhythmias. Taken all together, the interaction between a proarrhythmic drug and patients with high cardiovascular burden may unknowingly place dialysis patients at excess risk for sudden cardiac arrest. We have preliminary data suggesting that patients seeking methadone therapy from a licensed opioid treatment program are more than twice as likely to die from sudden cardiac arrest when compared patients receiving buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. The intent of this proposal is to investigate the cardiovascular safety between opioid drug classes in a larger dataset through the linkage of external claims with substance abuse data to 15 years of electronic health record data. We will compare the rate of sudden cardiac arrest by drug class in dialysis patients receiving opioids for pain control or opioid use disorder. We believe this exploratory R21 mechanism will permit a collaborative team of addiction, renal, and biostatical investigators to address an important gap in clinical knowledge for physicians who care for patients with ESRD. This proposal has the potential to lead to changes in the practice of pain management and opioid use disorder in patients on dialysis."
"9415334","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with alcohol use disorders are three times more likely to have a co-occurring psychiatric disorder than those without alcohol use diagnoses. Co-occurring alcohol and psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent in clinical settings and, relative to those with a single disorder alone, these patients have more challenging treatment and recovery experiences. Integrated treatments result in more favorable outcomes, yet these services are not widely available. This is a revised R21 application, Integrating combined therapies for persons with co-occurring disorders. We propose to evaluate an integrated adaptation of the Combined Behavioral Intervention (CBI) from NIAAA Project COMBINE. CBI features three evidence-based behavioral therapies: Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Twelve Step Facilitation Therapy (TSF). We adapted CBI into a novel manual-guided intervention for co-occurring psychiatric and substance-related problems. Integrating Combined Therapies (ICT) is an individual-format treatment designed to be transferable to routine care settings and for delivery by the existing workforce. A small pilot study supported the clinical promise of ICT as well as its safety and practicality. In the research now proposed, we will randomly assign 76 eligible patients in community outpatient addiction treatment to ICT adapted standard care versus standard care only. Primary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6- month follow-up periods. We hypothesize that ICT adapted standard care will demonstrate improved alcohol, drug and psychiatric outcomes, and that ICT participants will have better retention in treatment services. As found in our preliminary research, we also expect typical program counselors to be able to deliver ICT with satisfactory adherence and competence. The gap between the discovery and routine delivery of evidence-based treatments for alcohol use disorders is substantial. This problem is compounded when one considers the disparity in public access to efficacious integrated services for persons with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders. The present research stands to address this issue, by rigorously evaluating a promising and community- friendly option for a broad spectrum psychosocial therapy. If found to be effective in this trial, the next logical research steps would be further efficacy study of ICT in a larger randomized controlled trial, as well as in dismantling and fractional factorial designs. The overarching goal of this research is to contribute to better treatment and recovery outcomes for individuals with co-occurring disorders."
"9217585","Existing biomarkers and cancer prevention strategies are limited as the biology of breast tumor initiation remains poorly understood. We aim to elucidate mammary epithelial cells that participate in tumorigenesis as a means of developing markers for risk stratification and targets for prevention. Important clues to the identity of these cells come from epidemiologic and our preliminary data. Early full-term pregnancy is one of the most effective protections against breast cancer in most women but not in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. We investigated parity-associated variation in gene expression profiles of distinct cell types in normal breast tissues of nulliparous and parous women. The most significant differences were seen in CD44+ cells where many genes important in self-renewal and differentiation (e.g., p27, TGFB) were lower in parous women than in nulliparous and in parous BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. The numbers of p27+ and Ki67+ cells were also significantly lower in parous than in nulliparous women except in parous BRCA1/2 cases. The majority of p27+ cells were also estrogen receptor positive. In explant cultures of breast tissues, inhibition of TGFB increased proliferation with a concomitant decrease of p27+ cells implying that p27 due to TGFB is key for keeping breast epithelial progenitors in a quiescent state. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that (1) a subset of p27+ and Ki67+ cells represent quiescent and proliferating hormone-responsive breast epithelial progenitors, respectively, (2) p27 and TGFJ3 play an important role in keeping these progenitors quiescent, (3) the number of these progenitors correlates with breast cancer risk, and (4) mechanisms regulating p27+ progenitors are perturbed in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and this contributes to their high risk. To test these hypotheses we propose: 1. To characterize the molecular profiles of p27+ and Ki67+ human breast epithelial cells from normal breast tissue of women with different risk of breast cancer. 2. To investigate the role of p27 and signaling pathways that regulates its expression in human breast epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. 3. To characterize the role of p27 in regulating the abundance of mammary epithelial progenitors and its effect of this on mammary tumorigenesis in animal models."
"9332038","Abstract The overarching goal of this proposal is to help junior investigators in psychiatry develop and maintain a research career path. The specific aims are to: 1) identify current and future senior psychiatry residents, research fellows, and junior faculty psychiatrists who are promising candidates for successful research careers; 2) provide a 1-day, intensive, mentored training session that will allow junior investigators to present their current or proposed research protocols in small group sessions; 3) provide junior investigators with faculty mentoring and peer feedback; 4) provide information and resources that will enable participants to obtain outside funding and launch successful research careers, as measured by successful grant support, peer-reviewed publications, and academic appointments at research institutions, both private and public, and in academia and industry; and 5) provide opportunities for ongoing post-colloquium mentoring and career guidance.  This application seeks 3 years of support for the Research Colloquium for Junior Investigators, 2017-2019, to be held in May of each year in conjunction with the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Annual Meeting. The research colloquium is a team mentoring opportunity that gives beginning investigators a 1-day, immersive research experience through the presentation of their research in small groups of mentors and peers. Each colloquium invites 30-50 psychiatric residents, fellows, and early career psychiatrists who meet in small groups of 4-5 trainees and 3-4 mentors per group to discuss the trainees' research projects and career plans. They also present their research in a poster session and receive guidance from additional mentors outside their working group. Beyond the 1-day meeting, colloquium participants will engage in online networking, follow-up, and collaborations between junior investigators and mentors before and after the meeting (e.g., via webinar and an online community of discussion boards and email threads). Participants also will have the opportunity to attend and receive further mentoring at the early career events of the Society of Biological Psychiatry, whose annual meeting is held immediately prior to the APA Annual Meeting. Each year, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology will provide a ?booster session? at its annual meeting to a subset of qualified colloquium participants. The research colloquium has taken place annually since the mid-1990s, sponsored by a coalition of NIH Institutes that has included the National Institute of Drug Abuse, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Drug Abuse, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. Administrative direction is provided by the APA Division of Research and research staff in the American Psychiatric Association Foundation. Three core research tracks reflect the range of psychiatric research, from basic neuroscience and translational research through clinical trials and health services research. A fourth, rotating track will highlight research in substance use and substance use disorders for the 2017-2019 meetings.  The colloquium is intended to reach out to young psychiatrists, including senior residents in psychiatry, research fellows, and junior faculty, at a pivotal point in their careers and provide them with an immersive research experience and ongoing opportunities for interaction with peers and mentors who are outstanding researchers in their fields."
"9260787","The overall objectives of the Experimental Pathology Shared Resource are to provide NYUCI investigators  with quality-controlled, stable and cost-effective services and expertise for the microscopic analysis of  human and animal tissues. It is divided into two laboratories: 1) Histopathology and 2)  Immunohistochemistry. The Histopathology laboratory provides routine histopathologic services, including  tissue preparation, processing, embedding, sectioning and histochemical staining for paraffin and cryoembedded  tissues. The Histopathology laboratory also provides whole slide digital imaging and basic  microscopy services, and it makes available state-of-the art instrumentation, such as a laser microdissection  system. The main role of the Immunohistochemistry laboratory is to develop immunohistochemical  protocols for n ew antibodies (commercial or proprietary) that have not been tested in fresh, frozen or fixed  human or animal tissues and cells. It also serves as an immunohistochemical antibody repository with a  catalog of over 900 commercial and proprietary antibodies, which is published on the laboratory website.  Both laboratories offer one-on-one training as well as formal teaching modules for the Pathobiology and  Translational Medicine Graduate Training program and mini-rotations for medical students. The  Experimental Pathology laboratories are uniquely positioned as a bridge between basic and translational  research by promoting resource stability, institutional memory, investigator education, personalized  consulting, and interdisciplinary discussions. They also function as a central hub, facilitating inter-shared  resource collaborative projects that connect the Biorepository Resource Center and the Translational  Research Core Shared Resources with the Proteomics, Genome Technology Center and Flow and Cell  Sorting Shared Resources."
"9333559","Project Summary / Abstract DNA repair pathways maintain the integrity of the genome and help prevent the onset of cancer. Conversely, DNA repair deficiencies engender tumor heterogeneity and promote the selection of highly aggressive subtypes (i.e., `mutator' phenotype). Importantly, DNA repair proteins have emerged as potential synthetic lethal targets for improving the selective response to currently available anti-cancer regimens. Key to advancing such a strategy is a detailed mechanistic understanding of the select DNA repair pathway in question, an appreciation of repair pathway redundancy & crosstalk and a molecular characterization of processes that regulate the function and stability of the proteins essential for repair. This completely revised R01 proposal builds on our recent discovery that Pol is ubiquitylated on lysines 206/244 in a manner that is dependent on the cell cycle and the type of DNA damage. Further, we reported that (i) Pol ubiquitylation may govern pathway crosstalk, (ii) select oxidized DNA lesions require/promote Pol degradation and (iii) Pol-mediated BER facilitates DNA repair pathway crosstalk that may be regulated by steady-state levels of Pol protein. Therefore, our first task was to identify the E3 ligases and de-ubiquitylation enzymes (DUBs) that may regulate Pol. High-resolution mass spectrometry proteomic analysis of Pol-interacting proteins and in response to PARP-activation allowed us to identify several E3 ligases and DUBs likely to target Pol to regulate stability and function. Our new data supports a role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIP12 contributing to the regulation of Pol stability and governing Pol chromatin retention. Further, Pol ubiquitylation appears to govern BER repair complex dynamics. Most importantly, our preliminary data suggests that ubiquitylation facilitates trafficking of Pol to participate in late-phase replication associated repair (RAR) foci in response to complex DNA lesions. These RAR foci are XRCC1 dependent but devoid of DSB markers such as ?H2AX or 53BP1. The Aims detailed in the proposal will use purified proteins, cancer cell lines, tumor stem cells, high-resolution proteomics, live-cell fluorescent imaging and mouse xenografts to address our hypothesis that ubiquitylation/de-ubiquitylation regulates Pol stability, Pol-dependent BER repair complex dynamics and facilitates a coordinated trafficking mechanism to promote Pol involvement yet suppress 53BP1 involvement at complex lesions following alkylation, cisplatin and radiation damage."
"9254582","Synthetic oxytocin (sOT), known medically as Pitocin, is commonly used to induce or augment labor, while oxytocin-receptor antagonists (OTAs) are being developed to slow birth and prevent prematurity. Both sOT and OTAs are believed to cross the placental barrier. However, the effects of these maternal manipulations on infants remain largely unexplored, either in animal models or in humans. Project I will focus on the following objectives: (a) to develop and refine a new translational, animal paradigm, using the socially monogamous prairie vole, designed to model and allow the study of the consequences of birth interventions and taking into account possible effects on the mother-infant interaction; (b) to test the hypothesis that the presence or absence of OT at the time of birth will affect the behavior and nervous system (central and autonomic) of the offspring; and (c) to gain a deeper knowledge of mechanisms through which birth-related interventions may have lasting consequences. Specifically, we will examine the effects on offspring of (a) exposure during birth to sOT or (b) the effects of blocking endogenous OT (eOT), through the use of a selective OT antagonist (L-368,899). Project I will focus on behaviors (including alloparenting, partner preference formation, aggression, anxiety and depression) and neural processes (including the expression in brain tissue of genes for eOT and the related peptide, vasopressin), and selected receptors for each of these. In addition, autonomic processes in a subset of animals from these paradigms will be studied in adulthood. Animals created in Project I also will be studied in Project 11 (neural imaging). In addition, DNA from animals in Project I will be used in Project 111 to examine the hypothesis that alternations in OT in early life may have epigenetic consequences for DNA methylation."
"9234428","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with blood vessels and hemorrhage. The primary TBI injury initiates release of thrombin, oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb), cytokines, ROS), and others. These molecules mediate secondary injury through multiple pathways. Since a number of molecules and signaling pathways are implicated in the injury and behavioral deficits post- ruptured many molecules, including reactive oxygen species, blocking a single mediator or single pathway may not be as clinically effective in human TBI. This led the investigators of this proposal to consider an approach that would block multiple pathways. Src family kinases (SFKs) are non-receptor tyrosine kinases, including nine family members: c-Src, Fyn, Lyn, Yrk, Fgr, Yes, Hck, Blk and Lck. SFKs can be activated by many trans-membrane receptors, such as adhesion receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, and others. This unique feature of SFKs makes them a point of convergence for many toxic molecules (e.g. thrombin, oxyHb, ROS, cytokines, and others) that are released and mediate secondary injury after TBI. Moreover, the activated SFKs initiate many neurotoxic down-stream signaling pathways including RhoA- Rho- kinase1 (ROCK1), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), P38 and Erk mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).  Therefore, the investigators propose that blocking SFKs may provide a novel and powerful approach for treating TBI via blocking multiple detrimental pathways in which many SFK upstream toxic molecules (e.g., thrombin, oxyHb, ROS, cytokines and others) and as well as many SFK downstream effectors (e.g. ROCK1, JNK, P38, Erk, and others) are implicated. However, studying all of these pathways is beyond the scope of a single proposal. Thus, the investigators will focus this study on a linear pathway to show proof of principle that SFKs play an important role in TBI: TBI ? bleeding ? thrombin ? SFKs ? ROCK1 ? secondary injury. The investigators hypothesize that acutely blocking SFKs and acutely blocking SFK down-stream target ROCK1 post TBI will prevent hippocampal cell loss and improve cognitive outcomes many weeks after TBI.  Using a rodent moderate lateral fluid percussion (LFP) model in this proposal, the investigators have shown (1) thrombin increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and SFK activity increases after TBI , and thrombin alone causes cognitive deficits through activation of SFKs; (2) Acute inhibition of SFKs using a non-specific SFK inhibitor, PP2, or nanoparticle-based in vivo small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to SFK subtypes (Fyn and c-Src), protects hippocampal neurons and improves cognitive function after TBI; (3) PP2 blocks ROCK1 expression after TBI, and a ROCK 1 inhibitor, Y27632, improves hippocampal neuron survival and memory function after TBI. The project has the potential to be translated to humans, since SFK antagonists have been safely given to humans, and the in vivo nanoparticle delivery methods are FDA approved for human use."
"9223751","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies indicate that T cells can modulate arterial pressure. We found that adoptive transfer of male but not female CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can mediate Ang II-dependent hypertension in male Rag1 deficient mice. These observations indicate sex specific ations of T cells determine resistance and vulnerability in the regulation of hypertension by the immune system. In aim 1, we will determine if T cell-mediated susceptibility and resistance to hypertension induced by Ang II infusion in the male Rag1-/- host is due to gonad-dependent or gonad-independent effects of the sex chromosomes (XX vs XY) on the T cell donor and how these effects link to end organ damage and T cell responses. In aim 2, we will determine if sex-specific T cell subset responses to Ang II infusion in the male Rag1-/- host are due to sex differences in T cell angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R) and how these receptor- mediated T cell effects link to blood pressure, end organ damage and T cell function. Aim 3 will determine the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in CD4+ and CD8+- mediated susceptibility and resistance to Ang II-induced hypertension and link these findings to end organ damage. Defining the mechanisms by which T cell sub- specification and T cell function are regulated by sex in a model of Ang II-dependent hypertension may provide an explanation for the delayed onset of hypertension in premenopausal women compared with age-matched men. Furthermore, discovering immune regulatory phenotypes associated with resistance and susceptibility to hypertension induced by Ang II could uncover T cell subset specific targets and strategies for treating hypertension in both sexes."
"9318022","Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by progressive fibrosis of skin and multiple internal organs and severe alterations in the microvasculature. SSc has the highest case-specific mortality among the systemic autoimmune diseases and currently, there is no effective disease-modifying therapy for SSc. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to develop effective therapeutic approaches for the disease.  Although the detailed mechanisms responsible for the progressive fibroproliferative process in SSc have not been fully elucidated recent studies, including some from our laboratories, have identified novel molecular pathways that may participate in this complex process.  Recent studies have shown that SOX9, a chondrocyte-specific transcription factor, is unexpectedly involved in various fibrotic diseases including keloids and liver fibrosis. In our Preliminary Results we found that normal human dermal fibroblasts constitutively express phoshorylated Ser181 SOX9 (pSOX9), that pSOX9 levels are increased in SSc fibroblasts, and that TGF-? causes a potent stimulation of pSOX9 levels.  Therefore, the overall goal of this application is to explore the role of pSOX9 in the generation of activated myofibroblasts, the cells ultimately responsible for the severe fibroproliferative process in SSc, and to examine the molecular mechanisms involved. The overarching objective of this proposal will be to: Demonstrate the profibrotic role of pSOX9 and to identify the molecular targets of pSOX9 involved in the fibrotic process. The following Specific Aims will be pursued: Specific Aim 1: Study the effects of specific inhibition of phosphorylation of SOX9 on the activated profibrotic phenotype of SSc dermal fibroblasts in vitro. Specific Aim 2: Identification of profibrotic genes displaying changes in their expression caused by the induced phosphorylation of SOX9 in normal human dermal fibroblasts employing adenoviral and lentiviral transduction of SOX9-specific kinases. Specific Aim 3: Confirm and validate the profibrotic effects of pSOX9 in vivo employing a novel strain of CRISPR-Cas9 genetically modified mice that lack the S181 phosphorylation site in SOX9 following their intercrossing with mice displaying a severe fibrotic phenotype induced by constitutively activated TGF-? signaling pathway."
"9314673","Project Summary I am an MD-PhD psychiatrist with the intertwined interests of understanding the neural basis of behavior and treating psychiatric patients. My goal is to become an expert on the circuit level mechanisms of neural transmission underlying stress, resilience and affective disorders. I plan to direct a research laboratory at an academic medical center, studying the neurophysiology of stress and affect, and have a small clinical practice. For my training, I moved to the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI). The NYSPI is the primary component of the Psychiatry Department of Columbia University, and is one of the largest mental health research facilities in the world. It has state-of-the-art facilities and a broad range of world-class scientists. At Columbia, I joined the laboratory of Dr. Joshua Gordon, an expert at studying circuits underlying psychiatric disorders. I also enlisted the mentorship of Dr. Eric Nestler, a pioneer in the field of chronic stress. With their guidance and this grant, I hope to accomplish 3 objectives: 1) Integrate in vivo circuit and behavioral analyses, 2) Learn to modulate circuits with optogenetics, 3) Develop as an independent physician-scientist. Depression is the leading cause of disease burden in the United States. Many patients never recover despite extensive treatment. Stress can precipitate depression yet some people are remarkably resilient in the face of adversity. Moreover, although women develop depression at nearly twice the rate of men, the vast majority of research on the physiology of stress susceptibility has been conducted in male subjects. Understanding how neural circuits function in susceptibility and resilience to stress is an exciting new approach to developing antidepressant treatment. The goal of my proposal is to identify how communication between the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), areas that process both reward and stress, contribute to susceptibility and resilience in males and females. The VTA-NAc circuit undergoes substantial molecular and electrical changes in mice that develop depression-like symptoms in response to stress. However, it remains unknown how these changes impact circuit communication. In Aim 1, I propose to record VTA-NAc circuit communication of susceptible and resilient male and female mice before, during and after undergoing chronic stress. Three different cell-types in the VTA project to the NAc and these projections may uniquely contribute to the development of susceptibility and resilience. In Aims 2 and 3, I propose to test if these projections are necessary or sufficient for susceptibility. Collectively, these experiments provide novel insight into how VTA-NAc circuit activity contributes to the development of susceptibility in males and females."
"9441965","Project Summary Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing disorder that is a significant burden to afflicted individuals and society as a whole. Many adult alcoholics began to drink excessively during adolescence, and this early exposure may result in increased vulnerability to developing a lifelong addiction. The brain continues to mature throughout adolescence, and exposure to alcohol during this critical period may disrupt brain development, thereby predisposing the development of alcohol use disorder. For example, it has been suggested that the development of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region critical to the regulation of motivated behaviors, can be adversely affected by cycles of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal during adolescence, and disrupted mPFC output is thought to contribute to the behavioral sequelae characteristic of alcohol use disorder. An understanding of how alcohol disrupts the maturation of the mPFC may therefore prove useful in preventing the transition to alcohol dependence. Toward this goal, the studies proposed in this application will make use of a mouse model of binge-like adolescent ethanol self-administration to identify the time course and behavioral consequences of chronic ethanol intake during this critical developmental period. Our lab has previously shown that adolescent binge-like alcohol intake disrupts the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic area that form projections from the mPFC, and that perturbation of currents through hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (HCN channels) may underlie altered mPFC afferent output. Specific Aim 1 will use electrophysiological and immunohistochemical methods to determine the time course of ethanol-related disruption of mPFC HCN channels. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether the hyperpolarization of mPFC projections that arises from this ethanol-related disruption of HCN channels is responsible for the increased ethanol self-administration seen in adult animals with a history of binge-like adolescent intake. The results of these experiments could assist in the identification of novel therapeutic targets for alcohol addiction."

"9309756","ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY Despite clinical advances, the fact remains that humans cannot regenerate injured tissue. Instead, tissue trauma stimulates inflammation, which in turn induces fibrosis and ultimately the formation of scar tissue. Trauma-induced inflammation is primarily regulated by macrophages; key regulators of fibrosis. Although current therapies to control human fibrotic diseases include agents that target macrophages, new data indicate these treatments negatively impact regenerative ability. This outcome results from our lack of knowledge about how macrophages regulate endogenous tissue regeneration. A mammalian model of tissue regeneration is necessary to directly study how macrophages regulate the injury response to fill this knowledge gap. The discovery that African spiny mice (Acomys) can regenerate complex tissues of the external ear including skin, hair follicles, nerves, muscle and cartilage provides such a model. Furthermore, because laboratory mice produce scar tissue in response to an identical injury, this comparative system provides a unique opportunity to directly study how macrophage phenotypes regulate regeneration and scarring. The long-term goal is to develop clinical interventions that stimulate regeneration and inhibit fibrosis. The objective of this proposal is to identify macrophage subtypes that regulate regeneration and manipulate inflammation to stimulate regeneration in response to injury. This proposal tests the central hypothesis that specific macrophage subtypes stimulate a regenerative extracellular environment and that phenotype switching from one state to another is critical to the outcome of injury. This hypothesis is based upon published and preliminary studies indicating general macrophage phenotypes are associated with regeneration, that Acomys and Mus exhibit different cytokine and inflammatory gene profiles and that production of a regenerative or scarring extracellular environment corresponds to specific macrophage phenotypes observed in Acomys or Mus. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) identify specific macrophage phenotypes that regulate tissue regeneration and scarring in Acomys and Mus. Parallel in vivo and in vitro studies will integrate the timing and extracellular influence of macrophage subtypes and macrophage origin using newly developed regeneration assays; and (2) test the role of macrophage-produced arginase on tissue regeneration through the use of a newly identified immunomodulatory agent and genetically engineered mice with macrophages that lack arginase. The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it departs from the status quo of investigating wound healing, and instead, focuses on understanding endogenous tissue regeneration in a unique model of mammalian tissue regeneration. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide new and fundamental insight into how macrophages coordinate the inflammatory and immune reaction to stimulate a regenerative response to injury."
"9230866","Our working hypothesis is that the local control of tissue blood flow reflects the coordination of activity among  endothelial cells and smooth nnuscle cells of microvascular resistance networks. The Specific Aims of this  project focus on understanding how rapid (electrical) and slow (calcium waves) components of conducted  vasodilation are initiated, how they travel from cell to cell, and how they interact with each other. In accord  with the long term nature and innovative scope of this MERIT Award, we have invested substantively in  developing novel methods to study these relationships. In freshly isolated endothelial tubes of feed arteries  from mouse skeletal muscle, dual simultaneous intracellular recording demonstrates that electrical  conduction along the endothelium through gap junctions can be tuned by governing charge loss through  potassium channels in the plasma membrane. Complementary experiments show that glycyrrhetinic acid  derivatives used widely by others to inhibit gap junctions concomitantly block potassium channels,  disqualifying these agents in resolving respective determinants of electrical signaling. We quantified calcium  signaling in endothelial tubes using Fura-2 photometry, establishing a foundation for implementing confocal  imaging and multi-photon technology which we are using to investigate mechansims of calcium signaling  within and between individual cells along the endothelium. In developing intravital macrozoom imaging of  transgenic mice that express the calcium-sensitive protein GCaMP2 in arteriolar endothelium, we determined  that the initiation of calcium waves with acetylcholine microiontophoresis was independent of myogenic tone  and distinguished between the local initation of conducted responses from more global effects when the  agonist gained access to the flow stream. In light of studies of myoendothelial coupling that have been based  entirely upon isolated preparations studied in vitro, we are investigating endothelial calcium signaling in  response to neural activation of smooth muscle cells in vivo. We plan to continue pursuing the Specific Aims  of this project in light of our new methodology and findings. Our long-term goals center on defining the  signaling events which coordinate the activity of endothelium and smooth muscle in resistance vessels that  control the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissue cells. Resolving these relationships will provide critical  new insight for determining how respective signaling pathways may be affected (and thereby treated) during  conditions known to alter endothelial and vascular smooth muscle function including widespread diseased  states of obesity, diabetes and hypertension."
"9308117","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging of the skeleton is associated with increased prevalence of osteocyte apoptosis in mice and humans. Work leading to this application shows that the skeletal syndrome that ensues with aging is mimicked by osteocyte specific deletion of the gap junction protein connexin (Cx) 43. Mice lacking Cx43 in osteocytes exhibit increased osteocyte apoptosis and accumulation of empty lacunae, and reduced OPG levels, and Cx43- deficient osteocytes express lower levels of the survival-associated microRNA (miR) miR21. In addition, bones from old mice exhibit reduced Cx43, OPG, and miR21 expression. We showed in vitro that apoptotic osteocytes release high mobility group box protein1 (HMGB1), which reduces OPG expression and increases osteoclast recruitment and differentiation through activation of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). HMGB1 also activated toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). However, whether activation of HMGB1 receptors RAGE or TLR4 has a role in the skeletal phenotype of Cx43-deficient or old mice is not known. The mechanism by which HMGB1 is released by apoptotic cells is not known. A potential mechanism could involve opening of Pannexin1 (Pax1) channels in cells undergoing apoptosis. Whether this mechanism operates in osteocytes undergoing apoptosis is not known. The long-term goal of our studies is to improve the management of the adverse skeletal effects of aging by targeting osteocyte apoptosis and resorption. The specific objective of this application is to define the signaling pathways involved in the elevated osteocyte apoptosis and bone resorption in aging. We propose that the bone fragility syndrome that ensues with aging is due to increased osteocyte apoptosis as a consequence of reduced expression of osteocytic Cx43, OPG, and miR21. We hypothesize that low OPG and the consequent increase in the RANKL/OPG ratio acts as a permissive event for osteoclast development; whereas low miR21 reduces anti-apoptotic kinase signaling and activates caspases, with the consequent Panx1 channel opening and HMGB1 release, directing osteoclasts to areas with accumulated apoptotic osteocytes. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies that include the use of novel genetically modified mice, and established and primary osteocytic cells. Aim 1 will examine the role of Cx43/miR21 on osteocyte apoptosis with aging. Aim 2 will investigate the role of HMGB1 in osteoclast recruitment and differentiation in Cx43 deficiency and aging. Aim 3 will explore the consequence of osteocytic Panx1 removal on HMGB1 release and osteoclast recruitment. Successful completion of these studies will provide the molecular basis for the in- creased osteocyte apoptosis in the absence of Cx43 and in old animals. In addition, these studies will establish the molecular link between dying osteocytes and targeted bone resorption. Moreover, they will offer the basis for treatments in which the effect of increased osteocyte apoptosis on osteoclast recruitment are counteracted by targeting the HMGB1-RAGE/TLR4 system."
"9229579","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart valve disease results in over 23,000 annual deaths in the United States, with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) being the most prevalent. There is no pharmacological treatment to prevent or reverse CAVD, due to the poor understanding of underlying causes and therefore surgical intervention remains the only effective option. Valve calcification is mediated by valve interstitial cells (VICs) which in response to pathological stimuli abnormally express bone development genes and differentiate into osteoblast-like cells termed osteoVICs. These cells then deposit a calcified matrix that limit cusp movement and leads to stenosis. Despite this, the mechanisms that promote differentiation of osteoVICs are unknown, but our data suggests that Sox9 plays a role. Our data shows that in non-diseased valves Sox9 is highly expressed in the nuclei of VICs where it prevents calcification by functioning as a transcription factor to repress osteogenic gene expression while activating chondrogenic mRNAs that make up healthy valve leaflets. In contrast, we observe reduced Sox9 nuclear localization in several models of calcification including excised valves from human patients and mouse models of CAVD, and in vitro calcification assays, suggesting that Sox9 nuclear export is a common feature of CAVD. Furthermore, our published in vivo work shows that reduced Sox9 function in mice promotes differentiation of osteoVICs and CAVD while attenuating the contribution of chondrogenic matrix proteins indicating a causative role for reduced Sox9 function in CAVD. While our published and preliminary data have identified Sox9 as a key regulator of CAVD, the mechanism underlying its nuclear localization in health and disease are not known, yet identifying this will provide insights for the development of mechanistic-based therapies beyond surgical intervention. In this proposal we demonstrate that in healthy valves, Tgf1 secreted from valve endothelial cells (VECs) molecularly communicates with Sox9 in VICs to retain nuclear localization and prevent calcification via RhoA kinase (ROCK) signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that: In calcific aortic valve disease, abrogated expression of Tgf1 signaling molecules in VECs prevents ROCK-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Sox9 in VICs, leading to differentiation of osteoVICs and CAVD. To do this, we will use innovative in vitro, in vitro, genomic and clinical approaches to address the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanism by which Tgf1 mediates Sox9 nuclear localization in healthy and osteogenic valve interstitial cells; 2) VECs isolated from mouse models of CAVD commonly demonstrate altered expression of Tgf signaling molecules associated with dysfunction; and 3) Determine if pharmacological and genetic targeting to prevent Sox9 nuclear export prevents CAVD in vivo. Findings from this proposal will for the first time define a molecular pathway that underlies CAVD and identify mechanistic- based therapies that can be developed to treat affected human patients."
"9233117","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our perceptions, behaviors, decisions, feelings and thoughts depend on putting together different sources of information. The long-term goal of our project is to elucidate the computations and interactions among brain areas subserving integration of cognitive information across space and time. As a paradigmatic example of cognitive integration, we focus on the problem of visual pattern completion. We can make cognitive inferences and recognize heavily occluded objects from partial information. Cognitive integration must act over time (e.g. comparing current states with past ones), across space (e.g. evaluating signals across different parts of the visual field) and across brain areas (e.g. simultaneously considering bottom-up inputs in the context of prior knowledge). To further our understanding of the neural circuits orchestrating pattern completion, here we record intracranial field potentials from temporal and frontal cortex through electrodes implanted in epilepsy patients for clinical reasons while they perform visual recognition tasks. By virtue of the high resolution of our recordings, we aim to elucidate the circuits, brain areas and dynamic interactions across areas involved in spatiotemporal integration during pattern completion. The results from these investigations will provide initial steps to characterize and constrain the fundamental problem of how information is integrated by cortical circuits."
"9254594","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a progressive disease that leads to deterioration in cardiopulmonary function and premature death. Metabolic dysregulation has emerged as a major area of research in the pathobiology of IPAH, including the altered bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and dysregulated glucose metabolism. Several processes may be governed by the metabolic dysfunction present in IPAH, including enhanced pulmonary vascular cell proliferation and vasoconstriction. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of the metabolic abnormalities in IPAH pathogenesis in order to design therapeutic interventions for the disease. Our effectiveness to design therapies in IPAH will be enhanced by understanding the link between glucose dysregulation, aberrant cell proliferation, and NO deficiency in the human disease and experimental animal models. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that abnormal glucose utilization and flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) drives cell proliferation and NO deficiency in IPAH. The hypothesis has been formulated based on our already published studies and recently generated preliminary data in humans and animal models. Our rationale for the proposed research is designed to establish the effects of glucose key metabolic dysregulation in IPAH by focusing on the rate-limiting OGT/O- GlcNAc axis of the HBP. Mechanistic insights will be gained by studying the HBP in animal models of the disease. The potential of this axis as a therapeutic target in IPAH will be tested by evaluating whether the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis and disease outcomes are modifiable by diet and exercise. Thus, we will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: AIM 1) Determine the mechanistic role of the OGT/O- GlcNAc axis in cell proliferation in IPAH and experimental animal models of the disease; AIM 2) Investigate the specific molecular regulation of eNOS activity by O-GlcNAc in IPAH pathogenesis; and AIM 3) Establish glucose metabolic dysregulation as a modifiable marker of clinical outcomes in IPAH. The proposed research is significant because it will: (i) establish glucose dysregulation, through the HBP and the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis as the driver for the abnormal pulmonary vascular cell proliferation; (ii) determine the extent to which these metabolic abnormalities correlate with IPAH severity and outcomes, and (iii) establish an exercise and diet intervention as a means of improving disease outcomes."
"9207120","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major barrier to development of novel treatments against traumatic brain injury (TBI) is incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of injury and recovery. The overall aim of our research is to determine the molecular mechanisms and contribution of defects in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway to secondary injury after TBI, in order to allow future development of rational therapeutic approaches based on its manipulation. The autophagy-lysosomal pathway is an essential component of intracellular degradation and quality control, and plays a protective function against a variety of conditions including neurodegeneration. However, when lysosomal function is compromised autophagy can also contribute to cell death. Accumulation of autophagosomes has been noted after TBI, but its function and mechanisms remain unknown. Additionally, lysosomal function and the efficiency of lysosome-dependent autophagic degradation (flux), has not been assessed after TBI. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that early after TBI dysfunction of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway contributes to neuronal cell death and its restoration can promote long-term recovery.  Our project will use autophagy-reporter (GFP-LC3) and autophagy-deficient (Beclin1+/-) transgenic mouse models to determine the function of autophagy-lysosomal pathway after TBI and employ both in vivo and in vitro model systems to determine the mechanisms by which disruption of this pathway affects outcomes after TBI. AIM 1 will determine the mechanisms of lysosomal and autophagy dysfunction after TBI. Complimentary in vivo and in vitro approaches, including pharmacological and genetic modulations, will be combined with novel techniques such as ex vivo autophagy flux analysis to test the hypothesis that autophagy flux is impaired early after TBI, reflecting cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) mediated lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). AIM 2 will determine the functional consequences of enhancing lysosomal function and autophagy flux after TBI. Chemical modulators of autophagy flux and lysosomal biogenesis, Rapamycin and Torin1, will be used in wild type and autophagy deficient mice to test the hypothesis that restoring function of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway after TBI will result in improved functional outcomes. AIM 3 will determine the influence of autophagy-lysosomal pathway on neuronal cell stress and survival after TBI. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of autophagy, lysosomal function and ER stress in vivo and in vitro will be used to test the hypothesis that impaired lysosomal activity and autophagic clearance exacerbate ER stress resulting in neuronal apoptosis after TBI.  Our study will for the first time determine the functio and the mechanisms of autophagy-lysosomal pathway after TBI. Additionally, we will demonstrate that increasing lysosomal function and autophagy flux can improve histological and behavioral outcomes after TBI, thus opening potential novel treatment avenues."
"9248797","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although increasing animal evidence supports the hypothesis that in utero exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds can have a long-term impact on the health of the 2nd and subsequent generations, the evidence in humans is nearly non-existent. In addition, individuals may have differences in susceptibility to chemical exposure based on their genetic make-up. We propose to study genetic susceptibility in a unique population of children whose mothers, participants of the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS), were exposed to one of the most potent endocrine disruptors, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin).  On July 10, 1976, an explosion at a chemical plant near Seveso, Italy resulted in a toxic plume that exposed nearby residents to high levels of TCDD. The SWHS, a retrospective cohort study, was initiated in 1996, to investigate the health of 981 women who were newborn to age 40 years in 1976, had resided in the immediate vicinity of the plant, and had archived samples of blood collected soon after the explosion. The SWHS is the only comprehensive study of health effects of TCDD exposure in a female population, and has the unique benefit of measurements of individual-level TCDD in blood collected near the time of the explosion. We are currently re-contacting SWHS women to enroll ~955 children aged 0-38 years in a study of their health, to determine whether in utero TCDD exposure is associated with health outcomes at birth or later in life.  The proposed study will use DNA from blood collected during the current (2014-2016) follow up to genotype mother-child pairs in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (gene: AhR, protein: AhR) pathway, an enzymatic network that directs the metabolism of TCDD and other xenobiotics in humans. We will conduct a gene-by- environment (GxE) analysis to evaluate the modifying effect of genetic polymorphisms in the AhR pathway on susceptibility to dioxin toxicity in women and their children born after the explosion. In particular, we will use longitudinal measurements of serum TCDD (1976 and 1996) to examine differences in TCDD metabolism across genetic subgroups of the SWHS (Aim 1). We will then use genotype data on mother-child pairs in AhR pathway genes to examine interaction between the maternal and child genotypes with in utero dioxin exposure on birthweight in children born after the explosion. With its targeted focus on the AhR pathway, this study is uniquely equipped to examine the influence of genotype on dioxin half-life longitudinally and the first study of how both maternal and child genetics may shape fetal susceptibilities to dioxin."
"9331301","ABSTRACT A primary challenge in ovarian cancer is preventing tumor recurrence in patients following a resection / debulking procedure (5-year survival rate <45%). Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of chemotherapy (most notably paclitaxel) can improve patient outcomes and prevent local tumor recurrence (the principal deterrent to long-term survival). However, despite these modest improvements, there are significant limitations to this therapy. For example, the current clinical formulation of paclitaxel (i.e., Taxol) is: A) limited due to toxic side effects resulting from absorption across the entire surface of the peritoneal cavity with no mechanism for tumor specificity; and, B) rapidly cleared from the peritoneal cavity (<10% remaining after 6 hours) resulting in sub- therapeutic levels within the tumor tissue. The proposed research uses a novel, patented technology, the expansile nanoparticle (eNP), to target the primary observable cause of patient relapse (locally recurrent IP tumor) and address these challenges. eNPs decrease toxicity and increased efficacy via: a) unique Materials- Based Targeting, which leads to preferential uptake in tumors; and, b) triggered drug release following particle swelling, which occurs in response to exposure to lowered pH (5-6.5) found in the tumor microenvironment or in the endosomes of tumor cells. Preliminary data demonstrate that, following IP administration, paclitaxel- loaded-eNPs (PTX-eNPs): 1) accumulate in both microscopic (<1 mm) and large (0.5 cm ? 1 cm) IP tumors via Materials-based Targeting without the need for targeting ligands?this characteristic is hypothesized to result from: 1a) the rapid metabolism of cancer cells vs. healthy cells; and, 1b) swelling of the eNPs within tumor cells which disrupts endosomal / autophagosomal turnover and leads to intracellular accumulation of eNPs; 2) exhibit greater in vitro cytotoxicity than Taxol against multi-drug resistant patient samples?this is hypothesized to result from the formation of an intracellular ?drug depot? upon eNP internalization that overcomes cellular evacuation of drug; 3) deliver 10- to 1000-fold higher intratumoral concentrations of paclitaxel than Taxol over a seven day period following injection; and, 4) reduce the amount of recurrent ovarian tumor by 3-fold (v. Taxol) and more than double survival (v. Taxol) in a multiple-dose treatment of IP mesothelioma model (similarly diffuse/widespread disease presentation in the peritoneum). A key Go/No-Go decision regarding the commercialization of this technology is addressed herein, via: 1) determination of the PTX-eNP maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and identification of target organs and toxicity (which may differ from Taxol due to the pharmacokinetics and distribution of the carrier; i.e., eNPs); and, 2) definitive and robust evaluation of PTX-eNPs v. Taxol to determine the value of further preclinical development of this technology. Thus, the aims are: Aim 1) Determine the MTD of PTX-eNPs, the target organs and characteristic toxicity when administered IP; and, Aim 2) Determine the maximum efficacy of PTX-eNPs in treating ovarian cancer."

"9222048","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Learning, Prefrontal Cortex, and Multiple Memory Systems    Learning, to be useful, must be sensitive to the relevant features of situations, guided by environmental  opportunities, and informed by past actions in similar circumstances. In other words, learning is guided by  memory. The neuronal mechanisms that integrate learning and memory are largely unknown. The  hippocampus is crucial for learning facts and remembering events, the neostriatum is important for habit  learning, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is needed to modify previously learned responses flexibly.  Dysfunction of each of these brain regions or their disconnection contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders  including dementia, PTSD, and schizophrenia. This proposal will investigate how these structures interact  during memory-guided learning. The experiments, part of a larger research program on how prefrontal cortex  contributes to memory and cognition, will test the hypothesis that interactions between PFC, hippocampal and  dorsolateral striatal (DLS) circuits provide key mechanisms for memory guided learning by integrating abstract  rules, event sequences, and stimulus-directed actions. The specific aims will investigate these mechanisms by  combining behavior analysis, temporary inactivation, simultaneous recording of neuronal activity, and deep  brain stimulation.  Aim 1 will assess the functional interactions between the PFC, hippocampus, and DLS the  during learning by temporary disruption of local circuits. Rats will be trained to two behaviorally identical +  maze tasks, one that requires the hippocampus, the other the DLS for initial learning~ the PFC is needed to  switch between them. Interactions between the PFC and the other structures will be tested by temporarily the  mPFC and one of the other structures both the on opposite side of the brain. If PFC interactions are required  for flexible learning, then the crossed inactivation should produce asymmetric impairments in switching from  one strategy to the other. Aim 2 will record neuronal activity in the three structures simultaneously to determine  how activity within and between the PFC and the other structures predict learning. We recently identified EEG  patterns in the hippocampus that predicted memory retrieval, and discovered that DBS could  both mimic these  patterns and restore memory in otherwise amnestic animals. Aim 3 will therefore test the causal relationships  between the PFC and the other structures by combining unilateral inactivation, bilateral recordings, and DBS.  Recording in PFC while disrupting activity unilaterally in the hippocampus or DLS, or vice versa, will determine  the extent to which normal coding in each structure depends on the other, and how these interactions influence  learning. Targetted patterns of DBS will be used to mimic identified signals within and between circuits to  determine if the effects of inactivation can be overcome, or learning strategy modified. The outcome will  advance neuroscience by revealing how the PFC, hippocampus, and DLS interact to allow memory-guided  learning, and will inform emerging treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders that involve disintegration of  prefrontal cortex, hippocampal, and striatal functions, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease."

"9230446","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies performed in rats, mice, non-human primates, and human patients have demonstrated that the hippocampus, a structure within the temporal lobe, plays a critical role in learning and memory, and damage to this structure can result in profound impairments. As this basic cognitive function is critical for day-to-day activities, learning and memory dysfunction makes it difficult to hold a job, manage one's finances, and plan daily activities. These problems severely compromise the quality of life for persons with traumatic brain injury, can hamper the effectiveness of rehabilitation, and hinder a return to an independent lifestyle. Using experimental models of brain injury, a number of investigators including us have shown that traumatic brain injury causes hippocampal cell death and dysfunction that underlies learning and memory deficits. Through a series of experimentats, we have identified two compounds that are capable of increasing the expression of cytoprotective genes, which are endogenous to a number of cell types including neurons and are activated by the transcription factor Nrf2. Our working hypothesis is that post-TBI administration of these newly identified compounds will reduce secondary pathologies and improve learning and memory by increasing the expression of Nrf2-driven genes. We will use a combination of biochemical, molecular, genetic and behavioral tests to examine if post-injury administration of these compounds can decrease blood-brain barrier permeability, offer neuroprotection, and improve learning and memory. If successful, the results from this mechanism-based study may pave the way for clinical testing in patients who have sustained a traumatic brain injury."
"9332731","Project Summary Neurotransmitter release critically depends on the precise assembly of the secretory machine. Within a presynaptic nerve terminal, synaptic vesicles exclusively fuse at the active zone, a protein scaffold that forms release sites opposed to postsynaptic receptors. This scaffold consists of RIM, ELKS, Liprin-? and other active zone specific proteins. It also contains many proteins that are important for secretion and synaptic structure, but that are not restricted to the active zone. In the past two decades, research from many laboratories has started to provide deep insight into the functions of individual proteins at the active zone. However, much less is known about the assembly mechanisms of this key protein scaffold. This is particularly true for vertebrate synapses, perhaps because no genetic mutation to date has strongly disrupted the active zone scaffold. We here overcome this limitation by generating conditional knockout mice to simultaneously delete RIM and ELKS in hippocampal neurons. This mutation leads to massive disruption of the presynaptic active zone scaffold with loss of most of its vital components and of vesicle docking. Based on extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that RIM and ELKS are redundantly required for release site assembly and function, and that these scaffolding proteins are recruited to the active zone by Liprin-?. We designed three specific aims to address our overarching hypothesis. In the first aim, we rigorously test synaptic structure and synaptic vesicle docking in these active zone disrupted neurons. We propose rescue experiments with individual proteins or protein domains to evaluate the molecular hierarchy of the recruitment of active zone proteins and to dissect mechanisms for vesicle docking. In aim 2, we use the mutants with disrupted active zones to test two models that are prominent in the field: we will determine whether the active zone and docking are required for synaptic vesicle release and we will test whether the active zone targets release to the membrane domain opposed to postsynaptic receptors. Our preliminary data reveal that fusion competent vesicles persist upon disruption of the active zone and loss of vesicle docking, which is surprising given the dogma that fusion competent vesicles are docked. In aim 3, we address molecular mechanisms of active zone assembly upstream of RIM and ELKS. The most parsimonious interpretation of the literature and our preliminary data is that Liprin-? recruits RIM and ELKS for active zone scaffolding. We systematically test this hypothesis in newly generated Liprin-? knockout mice. This is the first study that addresses vertebrate Liprin-? function using a rigorous genetic approach. This grant application will generate new knowledge on the mechanisms of vertebrate active zone assembly and function. Human genetic studies have identified mutations in many active zone proteins, including in RIM and in ELKS, which contribute to neurological disease. Thus, precise knowledge of active zone assembly is important for understanding synaptic function in health and disease."
"9243187","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging is a major risk factor for both the development of primary tuberculosis (TB) disease and for the conversion of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection to active TB disease. As a consequence, persons over the age of 65 have the highest TB case rate and are the most susceptible to TB associated death. The immunological factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility of the elderly to TB remain largely unknown. The overarching hypothesis of this program project is that specific changes in inflammatory pathways (termed inflammaging) mediate unique and sub-optimal re-programming in pulmonary and systemic immunity during aging, and worsen the outcome of M.tb infection in the elderly. Project 1 will analyze how pulmonary surfactant and complement contribute to the loss of alveolar complexity within the aging lung and modify the initial cellular interaction with M.tb. Project 2 will address age-associated changes in the function of alveolar macrophages and how they affect M.tb infection. Project 3 will determine the impact of aging and inflammaging on control of primary and latent M.tb infection in old mice. Project 4 will investigat M.tb specific monocyte and T cell function in elderly subjects with latent or active TB. Altogether, these studies will provide mechanistic information to understand how inflammaging and immune senescence impact M.tb infection in the elderly. The program brings together an established group of collaborative scientists with expertise in clinical TB, TB pathogenesis and the immune response to infection, the latter both in human and animal models."

Here, we provide data to support a model whereby immune checkpoints are regulated by gut microbiome, which is defined by the ubiquitin ligase RNF5. Our discovery of impaired growth of Braf/Pten mutant melanoma in syngeneic Rnf5?/? mice, compared with Rnfwt littermates, was linked with enhanced infiltration of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (CD4 and CD8 positive), macrophages and dendritic cells in the tumors that developed significantly slower in the Rnf5?/? mice. Strikingly, co-housing the Rnf5?/? and Rnfwt animals or antibiotic ablation of the gut microbiota resulted in loss of the above phenotypes?tumor growth was no longer attenuated and immune checkpoint-based phenotypes were largely lost. Assessment of the gut microbiome revealed a distinct subset of bacterial species, which distinguish Rnf5?/? mice from their WT littermates (all ?pure? in-house maintained C57BL/6 strain). Notably, common to the distinct RNF5-microbiome are bacterial species that generate select subset of short chain fatty acids. These observations provide the foundation for our hypothesis that RNF5 controls the intestinal microbiota that affects immune checkpoint mechanisms, which in turn impacts melanoma development. Our proposed studies will (i) define RNF5 effect on the gut microbiome?tumor interactions, (ii) identify microbiome-dependent changes in the regulation of tumor immune checkpoint control by RNF5, and (iii) establish the physiological significance and impact of RNF5 control of microbiome and immune checkpoint on melanomagenesis in different mouse strains, age, and under select combination therapies. Our highly integrated studies will define the fundamental mechanisms that underlie the regulation of both gut microbiome and immune checkpoints, thereby providing new insights into therapeutic modalities for melanoma and other cancers."
"9276322","PROJECT SUMMARY Although esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a relatively uncommon cancer, the incidence of this disease has increased rapidly in recent decades; moreover, at the time of detection of EA, most patients have very poor prognosis. The alarming increase in EA over the past several decades, along with the poor prognosis for those affected, demand investigation into the risk factors for this disease, improved management of patients at risk, and development of preventive measures. Advances in these areas will have significant public health benefit in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality for those affected, as well as reducing the public health costs associated with managing EA at advanced stages. To better manage patients at risk for EA will require an improved understanding of the mechanisms of neoplastic progression in the esophagus. Such progression involves the development of Barrett's esophagus, a premalignant lesion in which the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium, visible as an abnormality on endoscopy, and confirmed on biopsy as specialized columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia. For these reasons, the NCI has developed the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet), a consortium research initiative with the goal of reducing the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of EAC, through answering key questions related to the progression of this disease, especially in the premalignant stage of BE, the only precursor lesion definitively associated with EA. In this application we describe the accomplishments to date, as well as the vision forward, for the BETRNet Coordinating Center (BETRNet-CC), with the following critical functions: ? Administrative and logistical support for the BETRNet program, including efficient communications and  coordination of efforts to connect available resources, serve as a data management center, and integrate  activities of the research centers; ? Coordination of cross-network research through leadership and management of diverse teams, as well as  providing logistical and administrative support to the governing body of the BETRNet (the Steering  Committee); and ? Ongoing development, maintenance, and administration of the BETRNet patient registry with virtual  biorepository (BETRNet PR-VB)."
"9259379","Project Summary/Abstract Dental workers, particularly less experienced examiners, are unable to accurately distinguish dysplastic or cancerous lesions of the oral mucosa needing treatment from benign oral lesions. Furthermore, variable stages of dysplasia to carcinoma occur within a single oral lesion, and dental workers often do not biopsy the site which contains the worst pathologic diagnosis to inform treatment as is ideal. The goal of this project is to develop an automated, optical imaging-based platform to promote early detection of cancer in community dental clinics. Its central hypothesis is that optical properties of dysplastic or cancerous oral epithelium can be measured and exploited to augment the ability of dental workers to diagnose these lesions. In particular, two imaging modalities used: 1) widefield autofluorescence imaging (AFI), which has high sensitivity but low specificity for dysplasia and cancer, and 2) high-resolution microendoscopy (HRME), which has a higher specificity but can only interrogate a <1 mm diameter of tissue at once. To achieve the objective, two specific aims will be completed. First, an automated, multimodal imaging early- detection platform that identifies high-risk sites within oral mucosal lesions using widefield images, then distinguishes dysplastic or cancerous lesions from benign lesions by combining HRME and widefield AFI features will be developed. To achieve this aim, an automated image analysis algorithm capable of identifying high-risk sites within oral lesions will be developed; this algorithm will then be combined with existing HRME software to create a single, integrated user interface for the platform. Second, the performance and clinical utility of the early-detection platform will be evaluated by performing a clinical study in 75 patients with oral mucosal lesions with low-prevalence of oral neoplasia (and high-prevalence of benign lesions) similar to community dental clinics. The ability of the early-detection platform to identify high-risk sites within a lesion and distinguish dysplastic or cancerous sites from benign sites will be compared to an expert clinician and dental workers. The clinical utility of the platform will be evaluated based on its ability to provide diagnostic information that improves the ability of dental workers to distinguish dysplastic or cancerous sites from benign sites. This research is significant because it will provide dental workers with an easy to use platform that promotes the early diagnosis of oral neoplasia, a critical step to reducing the global oral cancer burden, and may also reduce unnecessary diagnostic workup of low-risk lesions."
"9271378","One of the key developments in AIDS research has been the association of MHC type with susceptibility to infection and disease progression. A key component of the FOA for this grant is to demonstrate the capability to meet the needs of the AIDS research community as it relates to MHC characterization. We will continue to perform typing for 10 alleles through our MHC typing core at TNPRC, a number that has been sufficient in most cases to meet the needs of our investigators. When additional alleles are required for a specific request we will collaborate with the Genetics Services Unit at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center to perform deep sequencing for the requested alleles (see letter of support). Genome banking of fibroblasts will continue in a subset of the animals born into the colony that represent unique phenotypic qualities or breeding lines, and archived genetic material on over 9,000 individual animals through DNA isolation, blood and Arrayit cards. In addition to continuing our own genetic testing program we will utilize the resources of the NHPRC GWG to share data and enhance the accuracy and application of the genetic information obtained at each Center. Aim of this core is to continue genetic analysis and MHC typing of the colony and provide expanded genetic characterization through enhanced techniques. "
"9311686","The design, synthesis, and evaluation of a unique class of reductively activated N-acyl O-aminophenol prodrug analogues of the duocarmycins are investigated to ultimately improve cancer therapy. Studies to date demonstrate that: (1) the N-acyl O-aminophenol prodrugs release the free drug in vitro providing derivatives that approach the potency of the parent free drug, (2) this reactivity may be finely tuned by changing both the electron-withdrawing character (reactivity: R = NHCOR > NHCO2R > NMeCO2R > NHCONH2) and steric environment surrounding the amino group, (3) these reactivity differences translate into a remarkable range of prodrug stabilities and propensities for N?O bond cleavage even with subtle variations in the electronic and steric parameters, (4) there are clear predictable correlations between ease of cleavage, in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo potency and efficacy, and (5) that those prodrugs which exhibit a well-balanced reactivity [stability vs cleavage] also exhibit in vivo antitumor efficacies that greatly surpass those of the parent drugs. Plans are detailed to: (1) examine additional N?O prodrug designs to further define the structure-function properties, (2) analyze mechanism of in vitro and in vivo N?O bond cleavage with free drug release, and (3) comprehensively examine the most promising and advanced prodrug candidate prepared to date for its ability to inhibit progression of otherwise hard-to-treat cancers in advanced preclinical models. These studies will refine an understanding of the prodrug's in vivo behavior, provide a compelling rationale for its use in targeted therapy, and help define the tumor indication and patient populations most likely to respond to drug administration. Displaying remarkable stability in plasma, a therapeutic window of anti-tumor efficacy much larger than the free drug in a simple tumor model, slow sustained free drug release and preferential free drug release in tumor tissue versus plasma, combined with a stunning lack of bone marrow toxicity, the lead prodrug candidate will be examined in models of aggressive breast cancer and advanced metastatic disease. Addressing the most challenging unmet clinical needs, the lead prodrug will be further investigated in brain metastasis and glioma, conditions that are generally fatal and very likely to benefit from the blood brain barrier penetrance of our prodrug and its proposed ability to inhibit growth of otherwise drug-resistant cancer cells. Information and therapeutic tools from this study will enrich the field, foster development of targeted highly effective cancer drugs, and might directly enable clinical investigation of a unique new class of reductively activated duocarmycin prodrugs with unparalleled efficacy and safety to provide treatment for cancer patients with otherwise fatal conditions."
"9234528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmental sclerosis is a characteristic lesion defining both primary and secondary glomerulosclerosis. In most diseases causing glomerulosclerosis, Tgfb expression in podocytes is a stress response signal associated with sclerosis lesions. To define precisely how activation of Tgfb type I receptor (TbrI) signaling in podocytes affects glomerular cells in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse model (PodTbrI(AAD) that enables conditional (Doxycycline-inducible) expression of a constitutively-active TbrI mutant (TbrI(AAD). When TbrI(AAD) signaling is activated in podocytes, mice eventually develop albuminuria and subsequently progressive glomerulosclerosis associated with podocyte depletion. However, podocyte morphology remains normal while podocytes initially release endothelin 1 (Edn1) to cause endothelial cell mitochondrial oxidative stress (ENDO mtStress) and endothelial dysfunction (ED). Furthermore, treatment with an inhibitor of endothelin 1 type A receptor (Ednra) or mitochondrial-targeted superoxide scavenger, eliminated ENDO mtStress and prevented albuminuria and segmental sclerosis. These results suggest a novel podocyte-to-endothelial-to- podocyte crosstalk, where Edn1/Ednra meditated ENDO mtStress and ED is essential for manifestation of podocyte damage/loss in progressive sclerosis. Using in vitro co-culture system of PodTbrI(AAD) podocytes and mouse glomerular endothelial cells (mGECs), we confirmed that Dox-activated PodTbrI(AAD) conditioned medium or Edn1 treatment of mGEC was sufficient to initiate ED, and subsequent mGEC supernatant was sufficient to induce podocyte apoptosis. Finally, we timed Dox withdrawal and found that 100-fold increase of urine albumin/creatinine ratio and at least 40% loss of podocytes were phenotypic markers for irreversible progression of sclerosis even in the absence of Dox. HYPOTHESIS: Perturbation of podocyte homeostasis can be associated with Edn1 release to initiate Edn1/Ednra-mediated mtStress and dysfunction of adjacent endothelial cells, which in response release soluble signal(s) that mediate progressive damage and depletion of adjacent podocytes characteristic of progressive segmental sclerosis. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Identify soluble molecular signal(s) produced by endothelial cells, subject to Edn1-activated dysfunction, that is required for manifestation of podocyte apoptosis in vitro. 2) Refine and pinpoint the phenotypic markers (thresholds) and the underlying molecular mechanisms that demarcate precisely the onset of irreversible progression of glomerulosclerosis in PodTbrI(AAD) mice. 3) Delineate whether segmental sclerosis and podocyte lesions in human primary and secondary podocytopathies are correlated with underlying podocyte-endothelial crosstalk in human kidney biopsy cases. LONGTERM: the proposed studies should elucidate the requirements and mechanisms for interdependent signaling crosstalk between dysregulated podocytes and endocapillary cells that determine irreversible segmental sclerosis characteristic of glomerular disease progression. This research aims to identify novel glomerular lesion-specific therapeutic targets."
"9238481","ABSTRACT Chondrocytes play an important role in limb development, postnatal skeletal growth and in maintaining cartilage tissues during adult life. Dysregulation of gene expression in chondrocytes is a key event in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). MicroRNAs are a family of noncoding RNAs that are evolutionarily conserved and regulate gene expression by posttranscriptional mechanisms. Many miRs show tissue specific expression patterns, suggesting that these miRs play a crucial role in tissue specific physiological or developmental processes. However, chondrocyte specific miRs, their upstream molecular signals, and target genes are only beginning to be identified. We and others reported that miR-140, a cartilage specific miRNA, plays a critical role both in cartilage development and homeostasis while the reduced expression in OA contributes to pathogenesis.  In our preliminary experiments, both strands of miR-455 (miR-455-5p and miR-455-3p) as well as miR-140 were identified as targets of Sox9, a main transcription factor for cartilage specific genes. Expression of miR- 455-5p/3p was down-regulated in human OA cartilage compared with normal cartilage. Using CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated miR-455-5p/3p knockout mice. These mice showed a severe OA phenotype at 6 months. Microarray analyses revealed a set of possible miR-455 target genes in chondrocytes, including HIF2A, which is a key transcription factor in OA pathogenesis, and a target of both strands of miR455. Importantly, HIF2A was strongly increased in almost all chondrocytes in articular cartilage of miR-455 null mice at 6 months.  These observations support the hypothesis that miR-455-5p/3p are critical regulators of cartilage homeostasis and that changes in their expression and function play an important role in diseases affecting articular cartilage. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Analyze the function of miR-455-5p/3p in OA pathogenesis using miR-455 KO mice and human articular chondrocytes. Aim 2: Identify in articular chondrocytes the direct miR-455-5p/3p downstream targets that regulate cartilage homeostasis and OA pathogenesis. Aim 3: Examine the therapeutic effects of intraarticular miR-455s administration in animal models of OA.  The proposed studies have the potential to reveal important new regulatory pathways that control cartilage development and homeostasis and open new insight on disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions."
"9449765","This application requests support to conduct structural and stigma-focused interventions to increase HIV and STI testing uptake among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM). Our research proposal is focused on this population due to the alarmingly high rates of HIV/STI among BMSM? this group has experienced elevated rates of HIV incidence and prevalence since the beginning of the US epidemic, and current estimates demonstrate that although BMSM make up only 0.2% of the population they make up 22% of new HIV infections. In our own work we have documented a 5.1% annual HIV incidence and a 35% HIV prevalence among BMSM. We are failing to engage BMSM at all points of the HIV care continuum including the seek and test components. The CDC recommends that individuals at substantial risk for HIV be tested for HIV/STI every three to six months; however, this goal is not being achieved and, therefore, a new approach to engaging BMSM is needed. To address these shortcomings and based on preliminary studies, we are proposing a 2 x 2 factorial design to evaluate a model that is aimed at increasing HIV/STI testing uptake among BMSM. We will test a stigma-focused intervention as stigma is a known deterrent to HIV/STI testing, yet little has been done to address this factor; and, we will evaluate HIV/STI test counseling delivered online (in conjunction with at-home HIV/STI test kits) as this delivery of testing may remove key barriers to reaching BMSM in need of HIV/STI related care services. Specific Aim 1: Assess HIV/STI testing uptake at scheduled HIV/STI test counseling appointments during the 12 month follow-up period. 500 BMSM who are HIV negative/unknown status, and report condomless anal intercourse with a male partner in past year and infrequent HIV/STI testing (?1 HIV/STI test in past year) will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (a) receive CDC-based risk reduction counseling and scheduled for in-office HIV/STI test counseling appointments, (b) receive HIV stigma-enhanced intervention and scheduled for in-office HIV/STI test counseling appointments, (c) receive CDC-based risk reduction counseling and scheduled for online, via video calling, HIV/STI test counseling appointments, or (d) receive HIV stigma-enhanced intervention and scheduled for online, via video calling, HIV/STI test counseling appointments. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate mediating (key theoretical stigma variables) factors collected via assessments at 3, 6, and 12 month follow-ups. Specific Aim 3: Conduct an economic evaluation to determine the costs of the office-based and online-based HIV/STI test delivery formats from both a community-based payer perspective and a comprehensive societal perspective that includes all costs. Our project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful impact not only on approaches to engaging BMSM, but to improving HIV/STI testing uptake which will likely improve multiple health outcomes among BMSM. If effective, our approach to improving HIV/STI testing uptake would be available for dissemination immediately and would fit within resource limited settings such as community based organizations and health departments."

"9233175","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurological disorders affect many millions of people in the United States and throughout the world. Recent advances enable the development of adaptive neurotechnologies, powerful new technologies that interact with the nervous system to promote functional recovery. These technologies are inherently multidisciplinary: they involve neuroscience, biomedical engineering, electrical and computer science, signal processing, and clinical, ethical, and commercial domains. Very few people can function effectively across all these ?elds. As a result, only a few of these technologies have been fully developed and translated into clinical practice, and still fewer are widely used.  The goal of this Short Course s to address this problem by providing a new group of leaders with the broad multidisciplinary knowledge needed to plan, develop, and implement the next generation of adaptive neurotechnologies. The Wadsworth scientists and engineers of the newly established National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies propose to create and conduct, together with additional external faculty, a comprehensive four- week Short Course in the theory and practice of adaptive neurotechnologies. This Course has three aims.  Aim 1 will provide lectures in the ?ve areas critical to understanding and implementing adaptive neurotechnologies: basic neuroscience (with emphasis on the most relevant regions and functions); engineering (how technologies monitor the nervous system and interact with it); current adaptive neurotechnologies (capabilities, limitations, future prospects); clinical translation (target populations, trial design); and commercial, regulatory, ethical, and other factors important to dissemination and use of these technologies. Aim 2 will complement the lectures of Aim 1 with hands-on Training Exercises in which participants use the principles conveyed in the lectures and the software platform BCI2000 to design and implement three representative adaptive neurotechnologies. Aim 3 will disseminate the curriculum to the larger research and development community by providing lecture syllabi and videos online and publishing video journal articles for the Training Exercises. It will also gather formal and informal feedback from participants and others to guide improvements in the Course.  This uniquely focused multidisciplinary curriculum will enable the participants to become independent and active agents in developing, evaluating, and using adaptive neurotechnologies, and in bringing others into this rapidly growing ?eld. To enhance the long-term impact of the Course, wide publicity and a careful selection process will recruit 24 participants who are or are likely to become leaders of laboratory, clinical, or commercial research and development programs in this ?eld. In summary, this intensive Short Course will empower the next generation of scientists, engineers, and clinicians to transform promising laboratory developments and concepts into real-world systems, methods, and applications that address important scienti?c and clinical problems."
"9246326","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising incidence of obesity is a huge health concern in the United States, is associated with a number of related health problems including diabetes and heart disease and is an enormous economic burden through associated healthcare costs. Obesity is a multifactorial disease, and environmental factors play a large role in motivating of feeding behavior. Although it is known that environmental cues can potentiate feeding through Pavlovian mechanisms, the neural circuitry underlying this phenomenon has not yet been systematically analyzed. This proposal seeks to identify this neural circuitry using a  conditioned cue- induced feeding (CIF) task. The first specific aim is to characterize the brain regions involved during cue- induced feeding using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and immediate early gene (IEG) mapping. The second specific aim is to identify the genetic identity of activated neurons and to optogenetically and chemogenetically silence and/or activate those neurons. The research described here will shed light on the neural circuitry underlying feeding behaviors that lead to obesity and may provide entry points for potential therapeutics."
"9265713","Abstract/Summary Our group of researchers has been following subjects with ZIKV infection since 2015 including pregnant and non-pregnant adults, sexual partners of infected women, children and other household contacts as well as infants born to mothers with PCR proven ZIKV infection. We have a database and specimen bank with over 5000 biological specimens available including serial serum and urine specimens from over 356 pregnant women with suspected ZIKV infection, 200 non-pregnant women, 200 sexual partners, 150 household contacts and ZIKV-exposed infants. Other specimens include saliva, placental tissue, amniotic fluid, breast milk and urine, saliva and serum from exposed infants. We hypothesize that viral kinetics of ZIKV including virus load and duration of viral shedding may differ widely between different body compartments including blood, urine, breast milk, amniotic fluid, placenta and saliva, and also may differ between patient populations, including pregnant and non-pregnant patients, sexual partners, children, and infants of ZIKV-infected mothers. We also hypothesize that virus load and pathogenesis may be enhanced by sexual exposure to the virus in addition to vector exposure and that may contribute to enhanced disease morbidity and transmission. We also hypothesize that the development of neutralizing antibodies provides lifelong immunity, but that some individuals, including congenitally infected infants, may have delayed antibody responses with prolonged viral shedding. In adults this might translate not only into prolonged viral shedding and increased transmission risk but also rebound infection. Potentially pre-existing antibodies to other arboviral infections including dengue 1-4 viruses and yellow fever may modify the course of ZIKV infection through interference with viral kinetics or delayed development of neutralizing antibodies. We propose to investigate viral load and viral kinetics in different compartments in distinct populations and correlate findings with severity of symptoms and potential transmission to partners and infants. We will perform plaque reduction neutralization assays in a subset of subjects to investigate protective immunity and potential correlates with viral kinetics, transmission and clearance of infection, and the role of pre-existing antibodies to other flaviviruses."
"9232888","Project Summary Given that many of the most common fracture sites, such as those of the distal radius and vertebrae, are predominantly trabecular, the prevailing view is that osteoporotic fractures primarily result from decreased density and impaired structural integrity of trabecular bone. However, 80% of the skeleton consists of cortical bone and some of the most devastating fractures, such as those of the femoral neck, occur at a location where the stresses are shared by the two types of bone. Hormonal loss following menopause causes enhanced cortical remodeling leading to increased pore volume fraction caused by expansion of Haversian and Volkman canals and formation of composite osteons. Paralleling these processes is a decrease in mineralization, referred to as degree of mineralization of bone (DMB), due to the bone's failure of undergoing secondary mineralization. Both effects have previously been shown to be modifiable and partially reversible by treatment with antiresorptive drugs as assessed with measurements in iliac bone biopsy specimens. In preliminary studies leading up to this project, we conceived new quantitative solid-state 1H and 31P MRI methods based on zero-echo-time (ZTE) PETRA encoding and new non-iterative reconstruction techniques for evaluating measures of cortical porosity and mineral density, thereby delineating a path toward noninvasive assessment of cortical bone ultrastructure and chemistry. The approach chosen makes use of T2-selective suppression pulses providing pore and collagen-bound water. The latter is shown to represent a surrogate for bone tissue matrix density yielding, along with 31P density, DMB. In this competing renewal application we propose to reduce to practice, validate, and translate these methods to patient studies. Our primary hypothesis is that postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (OP) have greater cortical porosity as assessed by 1H MRI surrogate markers than their healthy peers; and further that porosity in these patients decreases upon antiresorptive treatment. Our secondary hypothesis is that OP subjects have lower DMB as measured by 31P MRI surrogate markers, and that antiresorptive treatment increases DMB. We propose to evaluate these hypotheses with an integrated MRI protocol in a cohort of OP women in comparison to matched healthy controls, both at baseline and after 12 and 24 months of alendronate treatment. We expect the outcome to show that the proposed technology can quantify and distinguish inter-group differences of the parameters measured, both at baseline and in response to intervention.  The proposed comprehensive quantitative MR imaging protocol, which can readily be implemented on standard clinical MRI equipment, should yield new insight into microstructure and mineral properties of cortical bone, and provide new ways to evaluate the response to antiresorptive treatment in patients."
"9278164","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate's career goals are to become an independent researcher in the field of biomedical imaging, to make significant contributions to the basic knowledge of brain structure and function, and to develop novel tools that will be useful to address important issues in translational neuroscience. The candidate has received training in Physics; her research has focused on fMRI at low and high magnetic fields, on the development of research tools for the fMRI community, and on the investigation of brain function in health.  The K01 award proposal was designed to allow the candidate to become an expert bio-imager of the ascending arousal system (AAS). The candidate's objective for this K01 award period is to receive training in the neuroanatomy, neuroscience and patho-physiology of the AAS, an area different from her previous training and research focus. To conduct the proposed research, she will also gain new research skills in imaging and computational methods for neuro-anatomy. Further, the candidate seeks to strengthen her ability of formulating clinically relevant hypotheses, of using a diversified set of skills and tools to test these hypotheses properly and promptly, and of grant writing. This will be achieved by regular meetings with her mentors, her research and clinical collaborators, by attending to specific didactic courses / workshops / conferences, and by hands-on training during the development of the proposed research project.  Gray matter brainstem nuclei (Bn) of the AAS play a crucial role in regulating arousal, a key component of human consciousness. Because an in vivo identification of brainstem Bn of the AAS has been elusive so far by current imaging techniques, the neuro-anatomic and functional basis of arousal in health (sleep/wake conditions, anesthesia) and in disease (disorders of consciousness, sleep disorders) is poorly understood. The candidate's main research objective for this K01 award period is to develop and validate a novel procedure to delineate an in vivo probabilistic structural atlas of 13 human Bn of the AAS in MNI space. The procedure will use a newly developed set of methods to acquire multi-contrast echo-planar-images with exactly matched geometric distortion and resolution at 7 T, and semi-automatic segmentation procedures. Finally, this research project proposes to apply the developed tool to identify in vivo which Bn of the AAS are affected by hemorrhages in traumatic coma, and to evaluate the AAS connectivity in health and traumatic coma. Our preliminary results show the feasibility of generating a probabilistic template of four Bn of the AAS by 7 T multi- contrast imaging, of evaluating at 3 T the percent of injured tissue of these Bn in traumatic coma, and of mapping their functional connectivity in health. We share our enthusiasm with our collaborators that study the AAS in coma, sleep and anesthesia because the development of an in vivo atlas of Bn of the AAS might greatly advance the knowledge of the mechanism of arousal, improve the accuracy of prognostication in the early stage of coma, and facilitate the development of pharmaceuticals for altered states of arousal."
"9257529","Project Summary/Abstract This postdoctoral fellowship project aims to determine whether specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) promote the resolution of inflammation and increase perfusion and tissue regeneration in the setting of skeletal muscle ischemia. Currently, there are no specific non-surgical therapeutic agents available to promote revascularization in diseases associated with impaired tissue perfusion and wound healing, such as diabetes and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Further, several therapeutic strategies designed to promote revascularization have limited efficacy, in part because they can exacerbate inflammation. Therefore, new approaches are needed that increase revascularization and tissue regeneration, while decreasing inflammation. Resolvins are a novel family of SPM that blunt the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and promote macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Recently, we found that resolvins increase revascularization during hind limb ischemia (HLI), suggesting they may be an entirely new class of mediators that resolve inflammation while promoting revascularization. Our working hypothesis is that monocytes infiltrate ischemic tissue and generate SPM, which in turn facilitate revascularization during HLI by promoting a wound healing macrophage phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we will determine the contribution of monocytes to resolvin biosynthesis and assess the endogenous receptor-mediated roles of resolvins in revascularization. We will determine whether monocytes and macrophages are prominent cellular targets of resolvins during revascularization. Lastly, we will establish whether resolvins promote revascularization in mice with chronic inflammation. In order to perform these studies, extensive hands-on training in state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based methods is proposed in combination with advanced instruction in immunology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. A mentoring team of highly accomplished basic scientists and clinicians will assist in the scientific direction of the project and the career development of the applicant. Completion of these studies will provide fundamental new insights into the biological actions of resolvins and could lead to the development of a new class of therapeutics to resolve inflammation and increase tissue perfusion and repair in patients with PAD or diabetes."

The outcome of this project will be a 3D imaging system that can be used for a variety of imaging needs. Based on the clinical expertise and experience of the medical partner we will develop and primarily test the usefulness of the device to image the optic nerve sheath, which has been selected to serve as a rigorous testing standard. Successful development of the 3D US will result in a device that will have numerous clinical applications including but not limited to imaging of arterial walls, skin and breast mass . In Phase II, we will benchmark the device against CT derived measurements and MRI reconstruction to validate the imaging platform. ."
"9322190","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Marijuana is one of the most widely used drugs of abuse and is increasingly being ascribed therapeutic properties. Unfortunately, the structure of the ?marijuana receptor?, CB1, is still not known. Thus, the mechanisms through which drugs bind and activate CB1, the highest expressed GPCR in the brain, are still unclear at an atomic level. Given the key role this receptor plays in cognition, and its potential as a high-value therapeutic target for treating addiction, chronic pain and glaucoma, why has the structure of CB1 never been determined? On reason is that CB1 has proven to be extremely difficult to purify and manipulate in a functional form. However, after many years of concerted effort, our lab has overcome this obstacle and we can now routinely prepare milligram quantities of purified, functional CB1. Thus, in this R21 we now propose to solve the structure of CB1 using two complementary approaches. The first will involve crystallography in collaboration with Dr. Brian Kobilka, our long-term collaborator and world expert in solving GPCR structures. The second will use single particle EM analysis, a rapidly advancing method that is dramatically changing the face of structural biology. The work will be done with Dr. James Chen, an expert in solving protein structures using EM, and my next-door colleague. Two Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 (SA1) will employ several approaches to crystalize CB1, leveraging our expertise in working with this receptor and the expertise of Dr. Kobilka. These include using CB1 chimeras and CB1 mutants that we have identified to increase receptor expression and stability. In Specific Aim 2 (SA2), we will use single particle EM analysis to help screen and optimize the crystallization conditions described in SA1, and to determine the structure of CB1 complexed with itself and in complex with the G?i subunit. Since single particle EM has does not require crystals, and can be carried out on the protein under more native like, soluble conditions, these EM data will provide unique structural data about how GPCRs dimerize and elucidate how they interact with G?i subunits, information still not known for any GPCR. We anticipate our results will be of significant interest to the pharmacological research community, and the wide array of people interested in this intriguing, lipid binding receptor. Understanding of how drugs bind and activate CB1 will ultimately require high-resolution structures, thus we feel the work we are proposing is both inevitable and long overdue. Such information will be critical to enable rational design and fine tuning of ligands that bind and modulate CB1 activity, for example to preferentially induce biased signaling. Our proposed work is also synergistic ? structures obtained from the CB1 crystals will prove invaluable for further refining the single particle EM data. Finally, we note that the methods we develop should be broadly applicable for studying the structure of other challenging GPCRs and their interactions with affiliate proteins."
"9271377","The Pathogen Detection and Quantification Core (PDQC) is housed in the Division of Microbiology and was established at the TNPRC in 2004. The primary mission of the PDQC is to provide diagnostic services to the Division of Veterinary Medicine for establishing and maintaining SPF nonhuman primate colonies. A secondary mission is to provide research support to investigators. The development of onsite viral testing capabilities has resulted in reduced costs, eliminated shipping of samples, reduced turn- around time, and provided a platform for easy expansion for detection of additional agents. This section of the application focuses on the function of the viral testing lab, techniques used for identification and detection of the target viruses, unusual results over the past 4 years, and current and future expansion of testing capabilities. The Aim of this core is to assure the SPF status of the colony through continued viral testing of existing breeding colony animals and all offspring. All animals in the colony will be tested twice each year for all four target viruses: Type D simian retrovirus (SRV), simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and herpes B virus (BV). We will also continue to expand characterization of the colony through the additional of assays for other potential pathogens."
"9277218","The main objective of this project is to provide a rationale for future therapeutic targeting of the c-myc IRES which mediates cap-independent translation in multiple myeloma cells. IRES-dependent myc translation is critical for tumor cell survival during ER stress in this tumor model. The aims include studying the mechanism by which the MNK kinase, the hnRNP A1 ITAF and the ribosomal protein RPS25 mediate IRES function; the mechanism and importance of myc inducing A1 and RPS25 expression and the potential for an inhibitor of IRES function in myeloma. The viability versus death of myeloma cells as well as their ability to achieve c-myc translation and IRES activity in vitro will be studied. In addition, a murine model of c-myc-driven myeloma will be exploited to determine the in vivo roles of hnRNPA1 and IRES activity in tumor progression as well as the potential efficacy of our IRES inhibitors."
"9345091","Abstract: The goal of the presently proposed Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program project is to prepare for commercialization of an implantable system (developed in Phase II) that is capable of delivering a novel peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapy shown to be highly effective in treating intractable pain in a majority of amputees in previous studies (including Phase I). Approximately 1.8 million individuals in the U.S. are living with an amputation, and about 185,000 individuals undergo an amputation each year. Post- amputation pain has a high incidence (95%) and frequently causes further disability, depression, and reductions in quality of life. Existing long-term pain therapies are inadequate long-term and are expensive (totaling up to $2.7-13 Billion/year in the U.S.).  The previous Phase I project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of relieving post-amputation pain in 88% of subjects during in-clinic testing with a method of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) that selectively activates target fibers using a single electrode inserted remote from the nerve. In an additional 2-wk home trial of temporary percutaneous stimulation, all subjects that completed the trial experienced clinically significant pain relief (average=76%) while receiving 24hr/day stimulation, confirming that pain relief can be sustained as long as stimulation is delivered. The Phase II project is in the final year of the early-stage development of an implantable pulse generator (IPG) designed to be capable of delivering the novel PNS therapy long-term for post-amputation pain relief. The therapy is designed to use a flexible, self-anchoring electrode that avoids the need for open surgery and precise lead placement, and minimizes the risk of complications (fracture & migration) that previously limited use of existing PNS systems. These risks are further reduced by an IPG that is sufficiently thin to be placed in the residual limb, eliminating the need for the lead to cross the hip joint and avoiding the repeated flexing and bending that frequently causes failures with existing commercial systems.  The proposed CRP project is needed to advance the system from an early stage (Phase II) to its final late- stage (commercial) design to enable rapid clinical adoption among pain physicians by enhancing the system implantation tools (Aim 1) to reduce complexity and the need for support staff, while leveraging a familiar procedural approach in which the vast majority of these physicians are already proficient. The project is also needed to advance system production from early-stage (intended in the Phase II project for low-volumes in which each IPG is manufactured by skilled technicians in a time-intensive process) to late-stage development of sustainable, quality controlled, high volume production in line with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to enable successful commercialization. Each aim will be considered successful if all verification/validation tests are passed. If successful, the final product will have the potential to meet the needs of amputees and their physicians through a commercially viable and sustainable therapy following FDA approval."
"9294833","Project Summary/Abstract CANDIDATE/ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Jones Parker is a research associate in the Department of Biology at Stanford University. Having recently completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Michael Ehlers at Pfizer, Dr. Parker seeks to expand upon his expertise using calcium imaging in freely behaving mice to study neuropsychiatric disorders in Dr. Mark Schnitzer's laboratory, where the technique was pioneered. CAREER DEVELOPMENT: This award will ensure that Dr. Parker finalizes his training in the acquisition and analysis of large-scale calcium imaging datasets and will facilitate his transition into a new field of research. More specifically, it affords Dr. Parker the time to refine his programming and analysis skills and provides him exposure to basic research in psychiatric diseases. Ultimately, this award will position Dr. Parker to draw upon cutting-edge techniques to execute more developed programs in his future independent research group. RESEARCH STRATEGY: The fact that individual mental illnesses can result from a host of diverse genetic and environmental risk factors has made it exceedingly difficult to therapeutically target their underlying causes. One explanation for this `many pathways to one disease' relationship is that the brain region responsible for a given set of symptoms can become disrupted by distinct connections from multiple other brain regions. Thus a better understanding disease-related neural circuitry might explain the many ways the circuitry can be disrupted to yield the same set of symptoms. To address this idea, we will use a viral-genetic approach to optogenetically manipulate or image calcium activity in distinct neuronal populations that project to the brain nucleus that controls sensorimotor gating. Deficits in sensorimotor gating occur in a wide range of diverse neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that there are multiple ways for the circuitry controlling the behavior to become disrupted. Sensorimotor gating is readily assessed in rodents by measuring pre-pulse inhibiton (PPI), which tests the ability of a weak, auditory pre-stimulus to attenuate an animal's acoustic startle response (ASR). The basic neural circuit controlling the ASR is well characterized: the caudal pontine nucleus (PnC) modulates the amplitude of the startle response based on auditory information from the cochlear nucleus. To determine how and which brain regions modulate the ASR and PPI, we will use a retrogradely transported Cre- recombinase expressing virus (CAV2-Cre) to selectively express the genetically encoded calcium sensor (GCaMP6) or excitatory/inhibitory opsins (ChR2/NpHR) in neurons that directly project to the PnC. We will then use miniature fluorescence microscopes to image calcium activity in PnC-projecting neurons during acoustic startle and PPI. To establish a causal role for the dynamics we observe in PnC-projecting neurons during PPI, we will also optogenetically manipulate these neurons during acoustic startle and PPI. Our preliminary data reveal two newly discovered direct projections to the PnC, one that is likely excitatory and one that is likely inhibitory. Based on this difference, we hypothesize that these upstream nuclei make opposing contributions to PnC activity and PPI. As these nuclei may contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms other than PPI, our findings potentially provide novel therapeutic targets for treating diverse neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9217583","This proposal is based on results from our laboratory showing that primary skin fibroblasts and primary normal- appearing mammary epithelial cells {MECs) from healthy BRCA1 {B1)+/- women are defective in the repair of stalled replication forks (stalled replication fork repair=SFR). Thus, they are haploinsufficient for this function. The same cells do not appear to be defective in homologous recombination-based double strand break repair, a canonical BRCA1 biochemical function. These cells will be tested for multiple, other B1 functions with the goal of determining whether they perform the other, established B1 functions normally. Preliminary indications are that they are intact for at least 1 other B1 function- centrosome proliferation control. Defective repair of stalled replication forks is a common human cancer- promoting force. The experiments to be performed here are aimed at learning whether a B1-SFR defect and any other haploinsufficient B1 functions present in ostensibly normal B1+/-mammary epithelium represent early drivers of B1 breast cancer development. Positive results would open new avenues to the development of disease mechanism-based B1 breast cancer prevention and therapeutic strategies."
"9317039","ABSTRACT Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary malignancy of the eye. The overall mortality rate is high (40%) because this aggressive cancer often metastasizes before ophthalmic diagnosis. Several gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities have been associated with primary UM (pUM) development and metastasis, however the pathobiology of UM and mechanisms of metastasis remain poorly understood. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses to detect pUM metastatic risk all require samples of tumor tissue. Survival rates have not improved for decades because pUM may metastasize prior to diagnosis and micrometastases may lie dormant for years. If available, blood-borne biomarkers with discriminatory accuracy for UM micrometastases would greatly improve prognostic methods, allow earlier detection of metastatic UM and enhance clinical patient care and survival. The long-term goals of this research are to better understand UM pathobiology, molecular mechanisms of UM metastasis, and to facilitate the development of blood-borne biomarkers. Using a cohort of 15 ocular pUM specimens, we have obtained quantitative proof-of-principal that proteomic differences exist between pUM that give rise to metastasis and those that do not. Our preliminary results have provided bioinformatic clues to mechanisms of UM metastasis and suggest candidate biomarkers from correctly classifying the metastasis risk in an independent test. We hypothesize that by expanding proteomic analyses to a cohort of 100 metastatic and non-metastatic pUM, we will establish with statistical rigor the identity of 20-30 differentially expressed proteins, and with bioinformatics, contribute new insights to UM mechanisms and pathobiology. We further hypothesize that differentially expressed proteins exhibiting discriminatory accuracy for metastatic status among an expended set of independent pUM tumor specimens will significantly enhance worldwide efforts to develop effective blood-borne biomarkers for UM metastasis. We now propose to combine extensive basic and clinical research experience; outstanding research environments; and strong preliminary data to address the molecular mechanisms of UM metastasis with the following two specific aims. (1) Expand iTRAQ LC MS/MS quantitative proteomic characterization to 50 metastatic and 50 non-metastatic primary UM to identify differentially expressed proteins. (2) Identify primary UM tumor proteins exhibiting high discriminatory accuracy for metastatic risk in an independent set of ? 45 ocular tumors. This research will validate for the first time quantitative proteomic differences between metastatic and non-metastatic pUM and bioinformatically advance understanding of UM pathobiology. A better molecular understanding of UM metastatic mechanisms will lead in the future to improved UM therapeutics, effective blood-borne biomarkers and UM patient management."
"9273748","We propose to upgrade a vertical 11.7T MR scanner (Bruker, Advance III) in the NMR Service Center of Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine. The upgrade is necessary because, after 13 years of heavy use from the last upgrade, the scanner starts to experience failures of multiple components. In the past 12 months alone, the system failed 11 times, each time requiring service visits of Bruker engineers, losing a total of more than 3 months of scanning time. As a consequence, we experienced significant drop of productivity of the scanner in the past two years. This vertical MR scanner is truly versatile and unique, attracting many NIH- funded research projects from and outside Johns Hopkins University. To sustain this highly successful program, we would like to seek for the SIG funding.  The upgrade will also provide new hardware components and operating software, which is highly important to enhance the efficiency and quality of ongoing and new research projects. Probably the most significant upgrade is the increase of the bandwidth by a factor of 8 (125KHz to 1GHz), which allows us to acquire eight times more gradient echoes within the same amount of acquisition time. This directly translates to faster imaging acquisition for those studies in which phase-encoding is the rate-limiting step. Upgrade of the current operating software, Paravision 5, to version 6 will also provide significant enhancement of the user interface.  This upgrade will allow us to continue to serve the research communities in JHU and nearby institutes. The past and current unique studies performed with this scanner include microimaging of tissues from mice, rats, primates, and human, perfusion systems of cells, tissues, and organs, in vivo imaging of mouse brains, spectroscopy of cell and tissue extracts, and phantoms studies for pulse designs. The center has more than 25 years of history as a service center, which has been supported almost entirely by users with NIH funding. With the SIG funding, we will extend our service for a coming decade."
"9290051","In order for cancers to progress, metastasize, and become treatment refractory, gene expression programs must be modulated. Transcriptional programs generate transcripts within the cells, while post-transcriptional programs regulate the half-lives, localization, and translational efficiency of cellular transcripts. Such post-transcriptional deregulation has been implicated as a major means by which ?aggressive? gene expression progression are established. We recently showed that RNA-fragments (tRF?s) generated from the processing of specific tRNA molecules suppress breast cancer metastasis through their binding and repression of an oncogenic RNA-binding protein (Goodarzi et al., Cell, 2015). A search for a tRF that could promote cancer progression has led to our identification of a specific tRNA-fragment (tRF) that is increased in highly metastatic breast cancer cells, promotes metastasis, and suppresses expression of transcripts containing its recognition motif. This mode of regulation contrasts RNAi-based mechanisms, since the modulated transcripts contain sense (rather than complementary) sequences relative to the tRF. We hypothesize that this tRF drives metastatic progression by binding and inhibiting an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that otherwise promotes the stability of pro-metastatic transcripts. We aim to investigate the role of this tRF in metastasis formation and progression; to identify the trans-factor (RBP) that this tRF regulates and the downstream regulon impacted; to uncover the upstream mechanism of tRF generation; to investigate its diagnostic potential as a predictive biomarker; and to provide proof-of-concept support for tRF therapeutic inhibition through oligonucleotide anti-sense administration. We will utilize cutting-edge, complementary, and mutli-disciplinary methods to achieve these goals. Successful completion of this study will generate new basic insights into post-transcriptional regulation by a tRNA-derived fragment, reveal how specificity is achieved in tRNA-fragment generation, achieve proof-of-concept for oligonucleotide-based therapeutic inhibition of a tRF in cancer, identify a potentially druggable tRF-producing ribonuclease, and establish diagnostic and prognostic potential for a tRF. As such, this work has significant potential for impacting human health. Our lab has made major mechanistic inroads into the non-canonical roles of tRNAs in gene-expression control in cancer (Goodarzi, Hoang et al., Cell, 2016; Goodarzi et al., Cell, 2015). Moreover, our interdisciplinary approach that integrates molecular, biochemical, genetic, computational, animal modeling, and clinical association methods to investigate basic mechanistic questions of relevance to human cancer position us well for success in these efforts."
"9453886","PROJECT SUMMARY Effective tick control is an important public health measure for combating Lyme disease. It is generally believed that the majority of Lyme disease cases are acquired from ticks living in the peridomestic landscape, thereby placing responsibility for disease prevention mostly at the local level, and especially on individual householders. Despite several studies documenting effective peridomestic tick control measures, human exposures to ticks are increasingly common and cases of Lyme disease have not been reduced. This project aims to bridge the gap between tick control research and human behavior by 1) assessing the effectiveness of an integrated tick management (ITM) strategy applied to either individual or contiguous residential properties, and 2) identifying patterns of human activity within and outside of the peridomestic landscape that lead to encounters with infected ticks. Our ITM approach will integrate the application of well-timed sprays of tick-killing chemicals (to reduce host-seeking ticks) with installation of rodent-targeted bait boxes (to reduce the prevalence of ticks carrying Lyme- causing germs). This approach will be evaluated simultaneously at properties in Lyme-endemic towns located in western Connecticut and southern Rhode Island. Tick abundance will be compared between treated and untreated properties using standard tick collecting methods. Human tick encounters will be recorded and compared using a novel crowd-sourced reporting system (TickSpotters). Study participants will be asked to document the location of their outdoor activity throughout the day in easy-to-use digital journals. Expected outcomes of this project are a reduction in the number of infected blacklegged ticks and human tick encounters at residences receiving an integrated tick management intervention, and an improved understanding of where people encounter ticks both around human habitations and in public outdoor settings."
"9437884","Abstract Recurrent circuits linking the cortex and basal ganglia mediate various types of procedural learning, such as acquisition of behavioral skills resulting in a stereotyped sequence of movements. A fundamental question regarding mechanisms of procedural learning is: how do neural circuits evaluate behavioral outcomes in order to achieve the correct behavioral goal? Vocal learning in songbirds serves as a model of procedural learning in which self-produced vocalizations are evaluated via feedback and progressively refined to achieve an imitation of sounds memorized from a tutor. This process requires the brain to compare feedback of current vocal behavior to the goal memory of tutor sounds. We discovered that the cortical region LMAN is composed of CORE and SHELL subregions that give rise to trans-basal ganglia and trans-cortical recurrent loops that converge in the thalamus. Recent evidence indicates that LMAN-CORE drives vocal output in juvenile birds whereas LMAN-SHELL evaluates the degree to which vocal feedback matches the memory of tutor sounds. The SHELL subregion contains two distinct populations of neurons during a restricted period of development: one responds to the bird's own immature song (OWN) whereas the other is selectively tuned to memorized tutor sounds (TUT+). We hypothesize that the former population encodes feedback of self-produced sounds and is processed via the trans-cortical pathway while the latter encodes the goal memory of tutor sounds and is processed via the trans-basal ganglia pathway; these two signals converge in thalamic neurons and elicit strong bursting activity when feedback of self-produced sounds is similar to the goal memory of tutor sounds. We will test this model by recording activity in OWN versus TUT+ neurons during early sensorimotor learning in juvenile singing birds; a strong prediction is that tutor-tuned neurons will occur in the trans-basal ganglia circuit and will increase their firing rate when birds produce vocal sounds that are similar to learned tutor sounds. In contrast, OWN-responsive neurons will occur in the trans-cortical circuit and their activity will be gated by efference copy of vocal motor commands such that evaluative processing is carried out only against self-produced vocalizations. We will also record thalamic neurons to test directly if self-produced sounds that are similar to tutor sounds produce a strong bursting signal in the thalamus, and whether such a ?matching signal? is eliminated by lesions of either the trans-cortical or the trans-basal ganglia pathway. These studies will increase our understanding of basic mechanisms by which cortico-basal ganglia recurrent circuits mediate action-outcome evaluations. Basic scientific studies of neural substrates of goal-oriented evaluation during initial stages of procedural learning are essential for understanding a variety of disorders involving stereotypic behaviors, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourette syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, and Rett syndrome."
"9328323","Project Summary/Abstract The incidence of new cancer diagnoses is declining each year, however the frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to rise, with a 5-year survival rate of 15%. HCC typically results from chronic liver disease and fibrosis, and liver transplant is the only curative treatment although recurrence can occur. Hence there is a need for improved therapies, and understanding how HCC develops and thrives in a fibrotic background will provide additional therapeutic targets. Wnt expression is upregulated in several cancers including HCC. Wnt ligands can function canonically to activate ?-catenin signaling, or noncanonically to regulate calcium signaling and antagonize ?-catenin. There are 19 total Wnts in the mammalian genome, and all hepatic cell types express Wnts which are secreted to cause autocrine or paracrine signaling. We and others have shown cell types including hepatocytes (HP) and macrophages (MP) produce different Wnts in several liver regeneration and injury models, however studies assessing cell-specific Wnt contributions in HCC are lacking. We hypothesize HP and MP produce Wnts important for carcinogenesis, and we developed cell-specific Wntless knockout animals (HP-KO and MP-KO). Wntless is required for Wnt secretion from a cell, therefore we functionally remove all Wnt activity. HP-KO and MP-KO and littermate controls will undergo a series of diethylnitrosamine and carbon tetrachloride injections (DEN/CCl4) to develop hepatic injury and eventual progression to fibrosis and HCC. This robust model leads to HCC by 5 months in 100% of mice. Furthermore, the DEN/CCl4 model allows us to assess HP and MP Wnts in the microenvironment and the tumor itself. Preliminary data suggests several Wnts are upregulated in control mice after DEN/CCl4. To test the role of HP- and MP-specific Wnts, we have developed two specific aims. Pilot studies identify MP-KO have greater tumor burden, inflammation, and injury than MP-CON at 5 months. Further, MP-KO exhibit frequent cholangiocarcinomas (CC) in addition to HCC. In Aim 1 we will test three hypotheses to explain increased tumorigenesis in MP-KO. Namely, (1) MP Wnts regulate macrophage polarization and reduce inflammation, (2) MP Wnts act to prevent combined HCC-CC (cHCC-CC), a more aggressive and lesser characterized form of liver cancer, or (3) MP Wnts are required for hepatic regeneration after injury, and blocking regeneration leads to a growth advantage for tumor cells. Furthermore, HP-KO and HP-CON have comparable injury and tumor burden at 5 months, however small CK19 positive nodules are present in HP-KO. CK19 is a marker of dedifferentiated tumors suggesting increased progenitor-like phenotype. We previously have shown HP secrete Wnt5a to terminate liver regeneration through ?-catenin inhibition after partial hepatectomy. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that HP Wnts prevent tumor dedifferentiation through secretion of Wnt5a to inhibit ?-catenin activity, and we predict HP-KO will have fully dedifferentiated tumors by 7 months. Taken together, our data will elucidate Wnt signaling in HCC and may provide more targeted therapeutic options."
"9430485","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Title: Metabolic drivers and sensors of cell proliferation in pulmonary hypertension Key Words: Pulmonary hypertension, glucose metabolism, O-GlcNAc, cell proliferation K99 pathway to R00 independence: The applicant took a unique opportunity to join the Cleveland Clinic Pathobiology Department for his postdoctoral training to gain experience in human translational research. The K99 application will combine his pre-doc expertise in basic research and his post-doc translational/clinical research to create an independent, translational career. By the end of the 2 year K99 portion of the award, he will have established an animal model for pulmonary hypertension, acquired the necessary skills to interrogate this model for the 3-year R00 transition, and link this it to his continued study of human clinical research.  Research Plan: Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a progressive disease that leads to deterioration in cardiopulmonary function and premature death. Presently, IPAH is considered a vasculopathy, and metabolic dysregulation, including dysregulated glucose metabolism, has emerged as a major area of research in the pathobiology of the disease. Several processes may be governed by the metabolic dysfunction present in IPAH, including enhanced pulmonary vascular cell proliferation, vascular remodeling, and vasoconstriction. Thus, there is a clear need for more effective therapies that target the underlying disease processes in IPAH. We recently published that increased O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) activity was shown to enhance pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation and worsen IPAH disease outcomes. OGT is a molecular stress `sensor' and is responsible for the O-GlcNAc modification of proteins that are involved in cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, and nutrient metabolism. Proper homeostasis of the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis is required for cell viability and regulation. When elevated and sustained, the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis is a `driver' of disease pathology through the marked regulation of fundamental processes, including cell proliferation and nutrient metabolism. On the other hand, instant and temporary homeostatic changes within the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis can protect cells from the onset of oxidative stress, hypoxia, trauma hemorrhage, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that HBP flux and the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis is fundamental to protect the lung vasculature in the early progression of IPAH, while excessive and sustained levels lead to the `end-stage' of the disease. Using a combination of models ranging from human cell culture to animal models, we will test our hypothesis by investigating the following specific aims: AIM 1 (K99; human clinical training and transition): Determine the mechanism(s) whereby the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis regulates glucose utilization and metabolism in IPAH. AIM 2 (K99, R00): Investigate the specific molecular regulator(s) of the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis in the pathogenesis of IPAH and a hypoxia/sugen mouse model. AIM 3 (R00, independence): Determine the role of the increased OGT/O-GlcNAc axis in the early progression of PAH using a hypoxia/sugen mouse model. The proposed K99/R00 application is innovative because it: (i) utilizes didactic training leveraged through the interaction between the Programs of Excellence in Glycoscience (PEG) sites (Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins University) as well as other significant sites (New York University and University of Illinois-Chicago); (ii) evokes translational research from both human IPAH samples and hypoxia/sugen mouse models to determine the molecular regulators that contribute to the imbalance of the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis and its impact on aberrant glucose metabolism and cell proliferation in IPAH; and (iii) launches long-term, core collaborations between the PI, established scientists in the field of glycobiology, and clinicians/scientists in pulmonary vascular disease. The project will identify the sensors and drivers of the glucose metabolism and cell proliferation, improve our understating of IPAH pathogenesis and progression, and offer new insights into the pathobiology of IPAH to ultimately improve patient functional capacity, quality of life, and long-term survival."
"9298146","Project Summary The project seeks to adapt and test the feasibility of two brief online writing interventions capable of reducing the stress pathways underlying lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) emerging adults? (ages 18-29) disproportionate experience of substance use, HIV risk behavior, suicidality, and depression. Given their low- cost and high portability, these interventions can circumvent barriers to health in geographies without LGB- affirmative resources. We will develop and pilot test these two interventions in the high stigma, low resource context of Appalachian Tennessee, one of the most stigmatizing and impoverished climates surrounding LGB emerging adults in the U.S. The Expressive Writing (EW) intervention asks LGB emerging adults to write about stressful stigma-related events, enabling cognitive-affective processing of stigma-related stress, with pilot support for reducing depression and health-risk behaviors. The Self-Affirmation (SA) intervention asks LGB emerging adults to write a letter to a hypothetical distressed LGB peer in which they advise the peer how best to cope with stigma. This type of ?saying is believing? intervention has previously improved emotional and behavioral self-regulation among other vulnerable emerging adults. The current proposal will adapt these interventions to be culturally relevant and engaging for Appalachian LGB emerging adults and pilot test their efficacy against a control. In Aim 1, we will conduct elicitation research with 10 Appalachian LGB emerging adults and 10 Appalachian LGB community leaders in order to understand (a) the type and frequency of sexual minority stressors they face to create the EW prompts and SA vignettes, and (b) current strategies Appalachian LGB emerging adults utilize to cope with these stressors to guide assessment selection. In Aim 2, we will present Aim 1 results to 10 additional community members and leaders to refine the EW prompts and SA vignettes and the LGB-affirmative, culturally relevant look-and-feel of the online platform. We will identify, with these leaders, promising venues and materials for participant recruitment and retention, and identify effective modalities for future intervention dissemination. In Aim 3, we will pilot test feasibility and efficacy of the interventions by randomizing 108 Appalachian LGB emerging adults to Expressive Writing, Self- Affirmation, or Control conditions. They will be asked to complete outcome measures (depressive symptoms, suicidality, substance use, HIV risk) and proposed mechanisms (circulating cortisol, behavioral and emotional self-regulation) at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Follow-up interviews with 15 participants will help refine study procedures as we scale up this intervention to be tested in a future RCT. Study findings will also be used to estimate the effect sizes of the mediators of intervention efficacy for use in this future test. These culturally relevant, evidence-based interventions are poised to be the first to reduce mental and physical health disparities among LGB emerging adults in rural areas, who are severely impacted by minority stress, thereby addressing a most pressing public health goal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."
"9256204","ABSTRACT Since 1995, several nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (NBP) drugs have been approved for the treatment of Paget's disease, metastatic disease of the bone, and osteoporosis. The later indication has led to the prescription of these drugs to millions of patients in the last 20 years. Patients who have bone metastasis receive very large doses of these drugs, in some cases receiving the amount in one month that osteoporosis patients receive in a year. The NBPs are effective and safe drugs which have reduced morbidity and mortality for a large number of patients with osteoporosis and bone metastatic disease. A side effect now notoriously associated with NBP use is BRONJ (bisphosphonate associated osteonecrosis of the jaw). While the overall risk of developing this side effect is small, it is associated with significant morbidity. Some have advocated for drug holidays prior to dental work (a risk factor for the development of BRONJ), however, this is not an option for the patients with cancer and bone metastases who are at high risk for fracture. In our Phase I study, we developed a novel strategy for preventing or treating BRONJ based on the removal of anti-resorptive NBPs by local application of a secondary fluorescent bisphosphonate (FL-BP) that does not have effects on bone metabolism. In our Phase II study we will build on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I using three specific aims with the goal of generating data to demonstrate clinical utility and safety of this concept: Aim 1. Synthesize the novel indocyanine green (ICG)-based near infrared (NIR) FL-BP conjugates (ICG-BPs) based on the antiresorptive inactive para-pyridyl ethanebisphosphonate (p-PyrEBP); Aim 2. Test the effectiveness of the ICG-BP from Aim 1 in a murine model to prevent ONJ via local delivery; and Aim 3. Develop a method for compound analysis in plasma and other tissues and carryout initial PK and toxicology studies. The product ultimately developed in this project will be delivered locally to the oral cavity without significant systemic effects and will have a near infrared fluorescent moiety that allows visualization of the loading of this new drug and therefore the displacement of the active NBP, thus serving as an indicator for safely initiating a dental procedure. If successful, this product would find great use to help remove the fear of this debilitating side effect of NBP use for these patient populations."
"9251909","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative (HGI) is to further understand the genetic and environmental etiologies of mental disorders. One of the major mechanisms for accomplishing this goal is the NIMH Center for Collaborative Genomics Research on Mental Disorders (the Center), which receives raw biosamples such as blood from NIMH PIs. The Center processes samples to DNA, RNA, cDNA or cell lines, which can then be submitted for genomic analyses. Along with biosamples the Center receives clinical/phenotypic data for each subject and, eventually, the results of genomic analyses. After a proprietary period, the clinical data, genomic data, DNA, RNA, cDNA and cell lines are made available to all NIMH-approved researchers through a. secure web site. This sharing of uniformly processed biological samples and clinical and genomic data from many cohorts leverages the NIMH investment in a large number of HGI grants. It provides critical research power by providing a large body of data applicable to investigations on the genetic bases for individual mental disorders. Since October 1998, >147,000 subject samples have been submitted and the Center has distributed >310,000 DNA samples and >9,000 cell lines. There have been >450 distributions of clinical and genotype data to ~340 investigators and >260 publications using these samples and data. Starting in 2011 the Center provided cell line banking and characterization services for induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and their progenitor somatic cells. The Center also develops novel bioinformatics and computational genomics tools and methodologies designed to integrate and analyze large, independent sets of genotypic and phenotypic data while resolving phenotype and/or genotype discrepancies in datasets. As its guiding aim, the Center will continue to innovate in order to serve the scientific needs of NIMH PIs in a flexible and highly accessible manner, while respecting subject confidentiality, informed consent issues and PI prerogatives."
"9443736","Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used. This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods for semantic data modeling, integration, and querying, and for resource discovery based on learned relationships between users and data resources."
"9233985","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent methodological innovations for integrating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies strategically utilize the strengths of each design and provide opportunities to investigate scientific questions that RCTs or non-randomized studies alone cannot answer. Though not previously deployed, applying these new methods to HIV and substance abuse treatment research can reveal the strengths and limitations of evidence from different study designs and provide better insight into the real-world effectiveness of interventions designed to improve individual and public health. This application uses data from a clinical trial of methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) for HIV-infected Malaysian prisoners where some participants were randomized and some were given the choice of MMT or no MMT (NIDA R01DA025943). The intervention focused on within-prison initiation of MMT to improve HIV and substance abuse treatment outcomes after release. We apply recently-developed statistical approaches for integrating randomized and non-randomized studies to evaluate the weaknesses of each design and utilize their strengths to answer new methodological and substantive questions relevant to substance abuse and HIV treatment research.      The Specific Aims for this F30 application are to: (1) Evaluate whether a non-randomized study of MMT can produce similar treatment effect estimates as a RCT. We will examine whether commonly-used and cutting-edge statistical methods can produce estimates similar to RCT findings from nonrandomized participant data. (2) Generalize the RCT findings by integrating RCT and non-randomized study data. Non-randomized study participants who selected MMT are more representative than RCT participants of those who would receive MMT if it were offered outside the research setting. Using recently developed methods for combining RCTs and nonrandomized studies, we will adjust RCT participants to reflect characteristics of non-randomized study participants who selected MMT, thus providing more generalizable effectiveness estimates of the impact of MMT among HIV-infected prisoners. (3) Estimate the effects of treatment preference on MMT retention and HIV and substance abuse treatment outcomes. When individuals receive their preferred treatment, they may be more adherent and thus have better outcomes. By extending methodology from the preference trial literature, we will integrate the RCT and non-randomized study data to estimate the effects of treatment preferences on MMT adherence and HIV and substance abuse treatment outcomes.      Through this 3-year fellowship, the applicant will gain training in advanced statistical and epidemiologic methods and extensive preparation from a multidisciplinary mentoring team at Yale University for a career as an academic physician-scientist working at the interface of substance abuse and HIV."
"9217545","The herein proposed Center of Excellence for Translational Research (CETR), which will be named the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Center (AD3C) has, at its center, the theme to develop new small molecule therapeutics for emerging and re-emerging viral infections. Translational research will focus on the inhibition of viral replication, especially viral polymerases. Progression pathways will include target validation, high throughput screening to identify novel chemical scaffolds, and basic virologic research to prove and further probe the exact mechanism of action of identified lead molecules in viral replication. Medicinal chemistry and lead development activities will advance identified compounds down the drug discovery and development pathway, ultimately leading to preclinical evaluation of promising drug candidates for clinical evaluation. The ADSC has four interrelated research projects with a focus on flaviruses, coronaviruses, alphaviruses and influenza. They will be supported in their efforts by three cores: an Administrative Core (Core A), a Screening Core (SC; Core B) and a Medicinal Chemistry and Lead Development Core (MCLDC; Core C). Organization and interaction between all projects and cores will be mediated out of the Administrative Core, with day to day ADSC operations led by the Core's personnel. An Executive Committee (EC) consisting of all project and core leaders will regularly review the projects' and cores' activities and productivity.

"9241550","Project Summary/Abstract This project seeks to determine the mechanisms, structures, and structure change of integral transmembrane proteins that govern critical transmembrane processes, at the level that can lead to improved therapeutics for human disease. The premise is that alterations in molecular structures are necessary for the function of transmembrane transporters and gated channels, and are coordinated by regulatory functions. The hypothesis is that understanding the linkage between structure change and function provides a roadmap for therapeutic intervention by organic compounds or Fab fragments generated to stabilize conformational states. A major innovation is the technology and ability to determine atomic structures of membrane proteins and eukaryotic, or human membrane proteins at a resolution sufficient to instruct in the development of therapeutic development of compounds. Principal technologies include X-ray diffraction, electron cryomicroscopy, transport assays, electrophysiology. Three aims focus on different classes of transmembrane proteins. Aim 1 focuses on elaborating the mechanisms of a recently discovered class of intracellular channels that govern the release of ions and nutrients from the vacuole in plants or fungi, or the endolysosome in animals. One aim is to build on our atomic structure determination of a two-pore channel TPC1 from plants, and to determine how regulation of ion transport by voltage, by calcium ions, and by phosphorylation is brought about. The aim moves toward human TPC1 where an inhibitor seen in our structure can cure mice of Ebola virus that enters the cell through the endolysosome, and to another intracellular channel human TRPML where mutations cause a lysosomal storage disease. Aim 2 seeks to determine the mechanisms that govern secondary transmembrane transporters and their sister uniporters. The aim focuses first on a high affinity phosphate transporter where we obtained high resolution structure, made 22 mutations and recorded transport properties Vmax and Km, and effects on growth of yeast deleted of its own phosphate transporters, expressing the mutants in the plasma membrane. We also focus on mutants in the lactose transporter that for the first time converted the structure between states in the biological transport cycle. The goal is to understand how the binding and release of substrates is coupled to the transport of a driving ion, protons, and to see if this surprising mechanism is common throughout secondary transporters. This aim also addresses a human glucose transporter where we showed how drug leads block the uniporter. This transporter is relevant to many cancers. Aim 3 aims to leverage our atomic structure of human brain aquaporin 4, to understand the binding by patient antibodies with the autoimmune, sometimes lethal disease neuromyelitis optica. This will open the way to ask how we may alter this interaction to therapeutic benefit."
"9272595","Project Summary/Abstract  We request funds to upgrade the console of the wide-bore 600MHz MR spectrometer and micro-imager, located in the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital. The current system acquired in 2003 with funds from an NIH SIG award and institutional support has been an essential component of a regional shared resource for pre-clinical medical imaging, and has contributed tremendously to the scientific discoveries and technological innovations of the Martinos Center and local investigators. However, after more than a decade in service, the current system is outdated. It is not only incompatible with the manufacturer's newly developed features and methods for cutting-edge MR spectroscopy and micro-imaging, but most dreadfully, the manufacturer has ceased to provide services on this vintage instrument due to the evolution of technologies and the lack of outdated replacement parts.  To continue and enhance its integrated contributions to the Martinos Center's dual mission of imaging technology development and bench-to-bedside translation, this 600MHz system is in critical and urgent need of an upgrade. We request funds to upgrade the console, including its hardware and software, and necessary accompanying components, and will use its still functioning parts (magnet and NMR probes, etc.). Through this proposed upgrade, the system, with its high-field, high-resolution, multi-nucleus MR spectroscopy and micro- imaging capacities, and state-of-the-art techniques, will greatly benefit the NIH-funded projects proposed by the diverse user group, including 17 projects from 12 Major Users and 5 Minor Users.  The proposed upgrade through this SIG has been supported by all levels of institutional administration, from the MGH leadership, to the Radiology Department, and the Martinos Center. This support covers every aspect related to the upgrade and its future operations, including allocation of instrument space and assistance for installation, operational support in terms of system scheduling, accounting, and maintenance, guarantees from the leaderships to supply additional funds, if necessary, for unexpected shortfalls, and lastly but most significantly, a commitment of up to $225,000 to cover the gap between the NIH SIG award and the purchasing price for the upgrade, in addition to the committed fund of $100,000 from the MGH Executive Committee for Research towards the maintenance of the system. Following the upgrade, the 600MHz MR spectrometer and micro-imager with the capability of temperature control (-80C to 200C), managed by the Martinos Center as a shared core, will be available to the broader research community, both within MGH and the Greater Boston region. The PI and Advisory Committee will ensure equitable and cost-effective operation of the system to achieve its essential role in driving new discoveries pertaining to a host of medically related issues covering the fields of radiology, pathology, cardiology, and surgery, and subjects including brain mapping, neurochemistry, photomedicine, cardiovascular disease, and cancer."
"9389168","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Division on Substance Abuse of the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry and the New York State Psychiatric Institute established a 2-year postdoctoral program that focuses on training physicians and psychologists for research careers in substance abuse. The main goal of this program, which is now in its 19th year of existence, is to provide both the research skills and clinical expertise necessary to design and carry out research on the etiology and treatment of substance use disorders. In this competing application we are requesting 5 additional years of funding for 5 fellows to be enrolled in the program each year. The program continues to include the following aspects of training: 1) Didactic introduction to clinical research in the addictions that incorporates a comprehensive overview of the substance abuse field, an introduction and advanced course in statistics, a weekly journal club and methodology seminar, and a formal course and ongoing instruction on the ethical and appropriate scientific conduct of clinical research; 2) Research apprenticeship where each trainee works as a junior collaborator under the close supervision of a senior investigator who serves as a preceptor and mentor; 3) Clinical experience in the major modalities used to treat substance abuse; and 4) Development of teaching capabilities where each fellow is provided opportunities to provide lectures/seminars to medical students, psychiatric and other medical house staff and/or present at journal clubs and scientific meetings. A new direction in the past 5 years has been to recruit and train MD/PhD candidates who concentrate on translational paradigms to better understand the physiologic and behavioral mechanisms associated with substance abuse. In the 19 years that the program has been running there has been a steady flow of high quality applicants. 47 trainees (31% females) have entered the program, including 34 physicians (30 psychiatrists, 1 neurologist, 2 internists, 1 family medicine), 1 nurse practitioner with a doctorate in public health, and 12 psychologists. In the past 5 years 3 of the physicians have been MD/PhDs. Of those who graduated in the past 10 years, 71% have gone on to academic-research positions, and 24% have entered academic clinical/teaching positions in which several have remained actively involved in research activities. Six fellows (one on a supplemental slot) are currently in training and two additional fellows will begin training in July 2012. The program has been successful in recruiting women and minority trainees. In parallel to this successful training program the faculty within the Division has continued to grow, enriched by the graduating fellows. At the first grant submission there were 9 faculty members within the Division on Substance Abuse. Currently, there are 23 faculty members, of which 11 are capable of serving as mentors. This sustained growth demonstrates how vibrant the Division on Substance Abuse is for young investigators."
"9025171","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The activity and plasticity of dendritic spines and synapses underlie normal cognitive processes, such as learning and memory and are the basis for the complex circuitry found in the brain.  Dendritic spines, which are actin-rich protrusions that emanate from the dendrite shaft, comprise most postsynaptic terminals of excitatory synapses.  Not surprisingly, abnormalities in dendritic spines are associated with a number of neurological disorders, including Fragile-X syndrome, Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy.  Despite the importance of spines and synapses in the central nervous system, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity and plasticity of these structures are not well understood largely because of the current lack of available technologies for probing these structures at single spine/synapse levels.  Furthermore, the capability to study synaptic activity and plasticity in individual spines and synapses would provide significant insight into the function and molecular mechanisms that regulate these structures.  We are developing novel neuron-glia co-culture microfluidic devices with integrated graphene sensors and electrodes and combining them with scanning photocurrent microscopy to detect and stimulate spine plasticity at sub- synaptic resolution (Specific Aim I).  We will use  this technology to record electrical properties at individual dendritic spines and synapses and to examine the effects of different electrical stimuli on these structures.  Since reorganization of te actin cytoskeleton is thought to underlie the activity, plasticity, and function of dendritic spine and synapses, we will explore the role of actin-binding protein VASP in regulating synaptic activity and plasticity (Specific Aim II).  We will alter the expression of VASP and determine the effect on the electrical properties of individual dendritic spines and synapses with the graphene probes.  Moreover, we will determine the contribution of this protein to synaptic plasticity.  The development of the proposed microfluidic platforms will be of great interest and benefit to neurobiologists by providing a powerful technology for investigating the mechanisms that underlie the electrical activity and plasticity of dendritic spines and synapses at a single synaps level."
"9269261","This innovative core implements a unique concept. With support from this P30 grant, we have been able to offer the expertise of a brilliant engineer-neuroscientist (Edward Soucy, PhD; see Personnel below) to our entire community. Working with another engineer-neuroscientist (Joel Greenwood, PhD, supported from University funds), he routinely solves what appear to be insuperable engineering problems-including designing and fabricating instrumentation, electronics, software for data acquisition and analysis, and imaging. Soucy designs and builds novel systems for specialized projects. One benefit is tailor-made solutions that are cost-effective, because the expense of commercial devices often comes from the need to make them applicable to a wide range of experiments. This cost-effectiveness stretches NIH dollars. We estimate that the savings realized from building rather than buying equipment total more than $3,000,000 over that past 4 years. A second benefit is that solutions engineered for one group often are applied rapidly to other groups-many labs here have adopted inexpensive LED light sources and two-photon microscopes, for example. The final benefit is that essential education and training for young neuroscientists. In some cases, Soucy trains students and postdocs to use custom-built instrumentation. In other cases, he guides students and postdocs who are designing and fabricating devices. He assists young scientists programming in LabView and Matlab. The array of the problems he has solved, the equipment he has designed and built, and the publications that have resulted, are now documented in this proposal for renewed funding. The impact on NINDS grant-holders and other H/C neuroscientists is difficult to overstate and impossible to replace.    The Neuroengineering Core enables neuroscientists to surmount their most challenging technological and engineering obstacles. By the cost-effective use of a talented staff engineer and diverse fabrication facilities for trained users, the Neuroengineering Core will contribute to the generation of valuable basic neuroscience research and promote a novel approach to surmounting technological obstacles to scientific discovery, ultimately to address fundamental issues of human health."

"9214291","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While BACE1 has emerged as an effective drug target for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD); side effects of BACE1 inhibitors are not well characterized. To identify the neuronal surface proteins most affected by lack of BACE1 inhibition, we recently performed an unbiased screen of surface proteins in adult BACE1-null mouse brain slices. This screen and subsequent cell-based studies revealed those two GPI- anchored adhesion molecules, contactin-1 and -2, highly increased in the BACE1-null brain. Interestingly, contactin-1 is known to regulate the surface expression and localization of Nav1.2 channels while contactin-2 modulates Kv1.1/2 channels. Nav and Kv channels almost exclusively carry out the rising and falling phases of action potentials. Previously, we have also shown that BACE1 activity regulates mRNA, protein, and cell- surface levels of the pore-forming Nav1.1 ?-subunit, a major CNS-specific voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav). Contactin-2 is also known to promote APP processing. In vitro analyses confirmed that BACE1 cleaves both contactin-1 and -2. In primary hippocampal/cortical neurons, we found that either BACE1 inhibitor treatment or overexpression of BACE1 dramatically alter surface levels of contactin-1 and -2. Interestingly, contactin-2 levels decrease by ~50% in AD brains with elevated BACE1. Nav1.2 surface levels are increased in BACE1- null neurons and the surface expression of Kv1.2 channels is dramatically modulated by BACE1 activity in brain slices and primary neurons. Importantly, overexpression of contactin-1 rescues impaired Nav channel ?- subunit channel trafficking in neuroblastoma cells expressing BACE1. Therefore, our new findings suggest that BACE1 regulates Nav1.2 and Kv1.2 channel trafficking by modulating the surface expression of contactin-1 and -2. The overarching goals of this application are to explore how contactin-1 and -2 processing by BACE1 regulates ion channel metabolism and to elucidate non-amyloidogenic functions of BACE1 for developing a safe therapeutic protocol to inhibit BACE1 activity in AD patients. To this end, we propose to use an integrated approach of cell biology and in vivo animal models. We will first identify the BACE1 cleavage sites in contactin- 1 and -2, and characterize the effect of these cleavages on APP metabolism. We will then determine the functional role of BACE1-mediated contactin processing in Nav and Kv channel metabolism. We will also explore the effect of BACE1 inhibitors on non-amyloidogenic BACE1 functions, including contactin-regulated ion channels in adult mouse brains, and in 3D cultures of human neural cells. Collectively, the proposed studies will define how BACE1-mediated processing of contactin-1 and -2 regulates Nav1.2 and Kv1.2 channel metabolism and may also provide novel mechanistic insights on contactin-regulated A? generation. Since imbalance in ion channel function may lead to seizures, the overall goal of these experiments is to provide necessary mechanistic and in vivo data for further development of BACE1 inhibitors as a safe therapeutic strategy for AD."
"9225216","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our investigation aims to establish how the atomic and membrane-level events operate to trigger visual signal transduction by rhodopsin in a unified multi-scale framework, with broad implications for biological signaling. The high impact of understanding G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation is well appreciated. Yet numerous gaps in our understanding remain, both with rhodopsin, as well as other Family A GPCRs for which rhodopsin is a highly significant prototype. Here we plan to resolve the long sought, critical mechanistic features by an innovative approach that combines magnetic resonance (solid-state 2H and 13C NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and electronic (UV-visible) spectroscopy. Our novel hypothesis for rhodopsin activation is formulated in terms of factors that drive a progression of transient conformational substates through an active ensemble: release of retinal strain, retinal-specific protein dynamics, hydration changes, pH catalysis, dynamical G-protein coupling, and membrane stress due to the polyunsaturated lipid composition. (1) Application of our novel solid-state 2H and 13C NMR technology will reveal how the release of conformational strain through retinal isomerization and relaxation unlocks the active rhodopsin (Meta-II) state. The angular and distance restraints from 2H and 13C solid-state NMR will illuminate the dynamical structure of retinal through its progression of active sub-states toward the active Meta-II form. (2) Changes in local retinal dynamics as studied by 2H and 13C NMR relaxation studies will be correlated with rhodopsin's activating motions by combining the results of spectroscopy with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Local retinal mobility will be related to large-scale protein dynamics involving fluctuations of the transmembrane helices. Notably, this work will address ambiguous X-ray structural data with results obtained at more physiological temperatures. Our investigation will decide the question of why active Meta-II rhodopsin and the ligand-free Opsin* apoprotein have similar X-ray structures, yet completely different activities. (3) Next we plan to investigate the specific role f pH and hydration throughout the active ensemble in relation to rhodopsin's interaction with transducin. We plan to combine our spectroscopic methods (UV-visible, FTIR, site-directed spin-labeling) with osmotic pressure studies to investigate changes in water-mediated H-bonding networks, together with a dramatic water influx due to transmembrane helical movements in rhodopsin activation. (4) Additional research will uncover the influences of polyunsaturated lipids on rhodopsin through modulation of membrane curvature stress, and how lipid composition biases the distribution of states in the active ensemble mechanism. Our plan encapsulates a new multi-scale view of how rhodopsin initiates visual signal transduction, tying together mechanical, environmental, temporal, and structural factors. Understanding how these factors interoperate across various length and time scales is fundamental to understanding of how rhodopsin achieves the extreme high fidelity required for visual signaling. Our robust and novel approach will provide important insights that are transferable to the broader class of GPCRs in biology and pharmacology."
"9410664","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project aims to develop and characterize a novel Magnetic Exosomal Assay to isolate and detect single intact exosome concentrations in human serum. This proposed research will also evaluate the diagnostic potential of the Magnetic Exosomal Assay for diseases with impaired vascular integrity. Vascular integrity or the maintenance of blood vessel continuity is a fundamental process maintained through endothelial cell-cell junctions. Defects in endothelial barrier function are an initiating factor in several disease processes including atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, tumor angiogenesis, cancer metastasis, diabetes, sepsis and acute lung injury. An initial event in impaired vascular integrity is a dramatic increase in a novel type of extracellular vesicle (EV) from endothelial cells (EC) called exosomes. Therefore, the development of a highly sensitive, reproducible and easy-to- implement assay to detect exosome concentrations in complex clinical samples can have potential diagnostic and therapeutic benefit. In this research proposal, we will develop and characterize a novel Magnetic Exosomal Assay kit and reader for fast isolation and detection of single intact exosome concentrations in human serum. In addition, we will assess the optimized Magnetic Exosomal Assay on Community-Acquired Pneumonia patient serum. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a highly sensitive, reproducible and easy to implement exosomal assay as a diagnostic tool for patients with various types of impaired vascular integrity-related diseases."
"9304570","Calorie restriction (CR) was shown to extend longevity in many organisms; however, the mechanisms of CR are still mostly unknown. In our previous study we found that the circadian clock is an important component of CR mechanisms in mammals. We established that CR regulates expression of the circadian clock genes by controlling activity of circadian transcriptional regulators BMAL1 and CRY1. In agreement with that, BMAL1 is necessary for the full metabolic benefits of CR including lifespan extension. Indeed, we found that BMAL1 negatively regulates activity of mTORC1, which is implicated in the regulation of aging and CR-mediated increase in longevity. We will continue the study by exploring our hypothesis that circadian clock recruitment is essential for resource allocation and the full beneficial effects of CR on physiology; in particular, CR recruits the circadian clocks by regulating the level and activity of CRY1 and BMAL1 proteins, which in turn contributes to differential regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We will explore the hypothesis through three specific aims. Aim 1. To decipher the mechanisms of regulation of the circadian clock gene expression by CR. Aim 2. To investigate circadian clock-mediated mechanisms of CR-imposed effects on mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity and signaling. Aim 3. To dissect the effects of periodic feeding with or without reduced calorie intake on CR- induced metabolic changes and longevity."
"9311376","Abstract  Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has gained much attention as a relatively new cancer treatment modality. PDT has a favorable toxicity profile compared to radiotherapy. Meanwhile, it does not incur resistance, and can be applied to previously irradiated tissues. However, the use of PDT in the clinic has been very limited. This is largely due to its surface-weighted treatment efficacy, a result of limited penetration depth of light in tissues.  Our long term objective is to develop a novel PDT derivative called X-ray induced PDT or X-PDT that can break the shallow penetration limitation. Our strategy is to use X-ray, which has great tissue penetration ability, as the energy source to trigger PDT. The key element of our technology is an integrated nanosystem, consisting of a scintillator nanoparticle core and photosensitizing drugs that match the scintillator?s emission wavelength. Upon X-ray irradiation, the nanoparticle scintillator functions as a transducer, converting X-ray photons to visible light photons. The visible photons, in turn, activate the near-by photosensitizing drugs to produce a cytotoxic species called singlet oxygen. Owing to the excellent transmittance of X-ray, X-PDT can be activated from deep tissues. Moreover, it was found that X-PDT is essentially a combination of PDT and radiotherapy. This leads to synergistic treatment outcomes, allowing X-PDT to efficiently kill cancer cells at low radiation doses, even for cancer cells that are refractory to radiotherapy. These characteristics make X-PDT an appealing treatment methodology.  The present project will exploit X-PDT to treat non?small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is challenging or not possible for conventional PDT. NSCLC accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases, and is diagnosed in 187,000 persons each year. Radiation, often concurrent with chemotherapy, is the standard of care for the majority of the patients. The treatment, however, may cause severe side effects such as neutropenic fever and Grade 3 esophagitis. Once recur, treatment options are limited since the radiation has been given to the maximum tolerated dose. Hence, there is an urgent need for an effective and less toxic treatment for NSCLC. It is expected that X-PDT can efficiently kill NSCLC through external radiation of relatively low doses with minimal collateral damage.  Success of this project will be paradigm-shifting, breaking the shallow penetration dogma of conventional PDT and opening many new possibilities. X-PDT holds great potential in clinical translation, complementing or replacing current treatment regimens for NSCLC therapy. Although the current study is focused on NSCLC, the methodology can be easily extended to treatment of other cancer types, for instance head and neck cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer."

"9269163","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of chemotherapy for the treatment of childhood leukemia more than sixty years ago, the, prognosis for children with cancer has improved dramatically. The 5-year survival rate for childhood cancers, many of which were uniformly fatal in the pre-chemotherapy era, is now approaching.80%. Despite these advances, several childhood cancers still have unacceptably low cure rates, and even when treatment is successful, the acute and long-term morbidity of current therapy can be substantial. The Children's Oncology Group (COG), the world's largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, was founded 12 years ago. The COG's multidisciplinary research team, comprised of more than 8,000 members, conducts research at more than 200 leading children's hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for COG, as part of NCI's new National Clinical Trials Network, to continue its collaborative research work that supports the mission of improving the outcome for all children with cancer. The COG will design and conduct clinical-translational studies for children with cancer that builds on an increasing understanding of the molecular basis for pediatric malignancies and has the highest potential to improve the outcome. Using innovative clinical trial designs suitable for the study of rare diseases, we will study novel therapeutic approaches that range from targeted, small molecules to cellular therapies. As more than 90% of children diagnosed with cancer in the US are treated at COG member institutions, the COG has the ability to offer to children with cancer and their families to participation in research that allows for collection and annotation of biospecimens from all children with cancer, providing the foundation for discovery and accelerating the most promising research efforts conducted in laboratories around the world. The COG research portfolio importantly also includes research trials focused on improving the quality of life children with cancer and survivors. The proposal is for support of the COG Group Operations Center, clinician-scientists who develop and conduct research, and for member sites to participate through enrollment of eligible subjects."
"9299603","Imaging mRNA turnover in P-bodies and its application to brain ischemia Injured cells adapt to an insult by removing their mRNAs for storage or destruction. Both these processes occur in the same cytoplasmic foci referred to as P-bodies. The storage and destruction of transcripts cause the translation block and their relative intensity determines the fate of the cell. The ability to separately visualize these processes directly in P-bodies on a cell-by-cell basis is essential for the assessment and future control of cellular response to injury. However, in spite of the enabling nature of such an in situ technology, at present no method can selectively label both the decay and the storage of mRNA transcripts in P-bodies using standard fixed tissue sections. In this project we will resolve this limitation and will introduce the first histotechnology which separately visualizes mRNA decay and storage in P-bodies. We will then apply the new assay to study mRNA turnover in focal brain ischemia in rat. Specific Aims of the proposal are: 1. To develop the first histotechnology for in situ labeling of mRNA turnover in P-bodies. The assay will be applicable to fixed tissue sections. The approach will encompass visualization of the activity of mRNA decay in P-bodies by using the new random DNA nanomer probes. It will permit the co-labeling of P-body core proteins for the assessment of mRNA storage occurring in P-bodies. 2. To test and validate this newly developed in situ labeling technique in sections of experimental stroke. To optimize its specificity, sensitivity and reliability of detection. By making use of fixed tissue sections, the assay will enable the analysis of the archived pathology samples. The assay will be broadly applicable in biomedicine because it will allow visualization of previously undetectable molecular pathways in a convenient histotechnology format. Its application to brain ischemia will provide useful information about the dynamics of ischemic cell injury."
